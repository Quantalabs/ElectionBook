US futures also signaled further weakness. The future for the S&P 500 lost 4.2% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 3.5%. The future for the Nasdaq lost 5.3%.

Also Read | Israel-Hamas War: IDF Strikes on Gaza Kill 15, Mostly Women and Children. Oil prices sank further, with US benchmark crude down 4%, or $2.50, at $59.49 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up $2.25 to $63.33 a barrel. On Friday, Wall Street's worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear. The S&P 500 plummeted 6% and the Dow plunged 5.5%. The Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8%. The losses came after China matched President Donald Trump's big raise in tariffs announced last week, upping the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, usually the economic highlight of each month, wasn't enough to stop the slide. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China's response to US tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China with its own 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10, among other measures. The United States and China are the world's two largest economies. The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4% from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation and lower rates could fuel still more price increases. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. Much will depend on how long Trump's tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 12.7% after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It's one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 12% of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 16%. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell, but they pared their drops following Powell's cautious statements about inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.01% from 4.06% late Thursday and from roughly 4.80% early this year. It had gone below 3.90% in the morning.

In February, soon after taking charge for the second time, Trump outlined a new trade policy focused on fairness and reciprocity and said that the US would implement reciprocal tariffs, charging other countries the same tariffs they impose on American goods.\nTrump emphasised that tariffs would address unfair trade practices, including non-monetary barriers, subsidies, and VAT systems, while encouraging foreign countries to either reduce or eliminate tariffs against the US.\nAs per the announcements, the import tariffs on other major countries are China (34 per cent), the European Union (20 per cent), Vietnam (46 per cent), Taiwan (32 per cent), Japan (24 per cent), India (26 per cent), the United Kingdom (10 per cent), Bangladesh (37 per cent), Pakistan (29 per cent), Sri Lanka (44 per cent), and Israel (17 per cent).\nFrom April 9 onwards, countries with the largest trade deficits with the US will face higher, individualised tariffs. India is one of the countries affected, with a 26 per cent tariff imposed on all its exports.

As it turns out, Barron and Tiffany are as close as can be — and the latter has shared a ton of Instagram snaps over the years to prove it. \n\nTiffany’s first Instagram post of Barron came in 2016, in celebration of the youngest Trump turning 10. The snap — a picture from a People photoshoot — showed all of Donald Trump’s children posed playfully, with Tiffany even pulling on her youngest half-brother’s tie (perhaps a reference to the fact that her stepmother, Melania Trump, once referred to him as “Mini-Donald” for his love of suits). Like we said, it was for a photoshoot, so there’s certainly a possibility that the bond was feigned. However, Tiffany went on to share several more images in the years since that hinted at the two being close. In a 2018 Instagram post in honor of their dad’s birthday, Tiffany included a black-and-white picture of both her and Barron with Donald. The following year, for Barron’s 13th birthday, Tiffany shared a candid paparazzi pic of them during the 2016 Republican National Convention. Then, in 2020, she shared another two pics, this time with a gushy Instagram caption. “Happy 14th birthday to the best ‘little’ brother I could ever ask for! You mean so much to me, Barron, I wish you all the happiness in the world! Love you!” she wrote. \n\nThe pic that best showed off their bond, though, was a throwback Tiffany shared when Barron turned 15. The siblings posed with a massive Minnie Mouse plush, and bar their instant recognizability, they looked like any other tight brother-sister duo.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; &#013; Win Mcnamee/Getty&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Examining Barron and Tiffany Trump&#8217;s Relationship: Insights from Past Photos first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/examining-barron-and-tiffany-trumps-relationship-insights-from-past-photos/","image":"https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/how-close-are-barron-tiffany-trump-old-photos-drop-hints-about-their-relationship/intro-1743428580.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 00:58:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.121},{"id":308378040,"title":"‘We will remain unchanged’: Hong Kong vows to remain a free port as gov’t calls new US tariffs a ‘bullying’ act","text":"Hong Kong will maintain its status as a “free port,” the city’s finance chief has said, after the government slammed the new US tariffs on Chinese goods as “bullying” measures. \n\nHong Kong will continue to implement free trade policies and ensure the “free and convenient” flow of goods, capital and information, Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in a blog post on Sunday.\n\nChan reiterated the Hong Kong government’s stance that it “firmly opposes” the sweeping global “reciprocal tariffs” unveiled by US President Donald Trump on the country’s trading partners last Wednesday. \n\nThe new levies amounted to a “bullying act” that breached the rules of the World Trade Organization, Chan wrote, adding that Washington was “undermining the multilateral trading system.”\n\nEchoing Beijing’s remarks on the new tariffs, Chan said “there are no winners in a trade war,” adding that “protectionism leads nowhere.”\n\n“We firmly believe that the only way to resolve trade differences is through equal, mutually respectful, and reciprocal negotiations with countries around the world, including China,” Chan’s blog, written in Chinese, read. \n\nWashington imposed an additional 34 per cent levy on Chinese imports, covering goods from Hong Kong.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he didn't want global markets to fall, but also that he wasn't concerned about the massive sell-off either, adding, \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” Also Read | US Shocker: Man Forgets 4-Month-Old Infant in Hot Car While Attending Yeshiva in New Jersey, Arrested After Baby Dies. His comments came as global financial markets appeared on track to continue sharp declines once trading resumes Monday, and after Trump's aides sought to soothe market concerns by saying more than 50 nations had reached out about launching negotiations to lift the tariffs. “I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.” Also Read | Israel-Hamas War: IDF Strikes on Gaza Kill 15, Mostly Women and Children. The higher rates are set to be collected beginning Wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said unfair trade practices are not “the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.” The United States, he said, must see “what the countries offer and whether it's believable.” Trump, who spent the weekend in Florida playing golf, posted online that “WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy.” His Cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force Sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. “There doesn't have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week?\" Bessent said. “What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.” U.S. stock futures dropped on Sunday evening as the tariffs continued to roil the markets. Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures fell nearly 4% while Nasdaq futures were down nearly 5%. Even the price of bitcoin, which held relatively stable last week, fell nearly 6% Sunday. Trump's tariff blitz, announced April 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without Congress to redraw the rules of global trade. It was a move decades in the making for Trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the U.S. He is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision. Countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with China and others retaliating quickly. Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett acknowledged that other countries are “angry and retaliating,” and, he said, “by the way, coming to the table.” He cited the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the White House to begin talks. Adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting American allies and adversaries alike, including Israel, which is facing a 17% tariff. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House and speak at a press conference with Trump on Monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with Trump along with the war in Gaza and other issues. Another American ally, Vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. Trump said Vietnam's leader said in a telephone call that his country “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” And a key European partner, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, said she disagreed with Trump's move but was “ready to deploy all the tools — negotiating and economic — necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized.\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. “The tariffs are coming. Of course they are,” he said, adding that Trump needed to reset global trade. But he committed only to having them “definitely” remain “for days and weeks.” In Congress, where Trump's Republican Party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease. Several Republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon said Sunday that he would introduce a House version of the bill, saying that Congress needs to restores its powers over tariffs. “We gave some of that power to the executive branch. I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake,” said Bacon, adding that getting a measure passed would be challenging unless the financial markets continue to react negatively and other indicators such as inflation and unemployment shift. Wyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 member of the Senate's GOP leadership, said Trump is “doing what he has every right to do.” But, he acknowledged, “there is concern, and there's concern across the country. People are watching the markets.” “There'll be a discussion in the Senate,” Barrasso said of the tariffs. “We'll see which way the discussion goes.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

While the pace and scope of reform have exceeded expectations for some, the results reflect the electorate’s conscious choice. The consequences are now manifesting across multiple dimensions of domestic policy.\n\nProminent business and political leaders, including Donald Trump and Elon Musk, have demonstrated a willingness to pursue reform despite sustained scrutiny and personal risk. Their persistence, while polarizing, underscores the intensity of the national moment and the urgency of rethinking long-standing economic dependencies.\n\nMarkets Reward Predictability\n\nMarkets reward predictability. When fiscal and monetary policy is transparent and rule-based, risk premiums decline and valuations stabilize. Policy stability, not volatility, is the real engine of long-term investor confidence. In the past week (early April), markets have been punished based on the lack of transparency and predictability. But this does not have to be a long-term situation. Assuming that clarity is restored, preferably sooner rather than later, markets can and will recover. But time is running out…\n\nTariffs: A Shift in the Economic Narrative\n\nThe introduction of sweeping tariffs represents a critical inflection point — one that is generating pronounced uncertainty in financial markets. Investor sentiment has deteriorated sharply, with concern growing around inflationary pressures and the potential for a stagflationary environment reminiscent of the 1970s.\n\nHowever, current inflation levels remain modest by historical standards, ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%. Unlike past crises, such as the oil embargo of the 1970s, the United States now enjoys a position of energy independence. This foundational difference substantially alters the risk profile of today’s environment. Moreover, the long bond (10 year treasury)-owing to perceptions of increased risk-has dropped in recent days to below 10%. Oil prices are dropping below $60 per barrel. Not everything is inflationary. To the contrary, under normal circumstances these two data points would be extremely bullish for the markets.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWill There Be A ‘1923’ Season 3? What The Ending Means For Spencer And The Show’s Future\n\n‘Existential Threat’—Wall Street Suddenly Braced For A Bitcoin And Crypto Price Game-Changer\n\n‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Sunday, April 6\n\nWhile many economists have raised legitimate concerns about the proposed tariffs — particularly their potential impact on global supply chains — few have offered alternative solutions. Most critiques rely heavily on historical precedent. In contrast, the current proposal, while controversial, may serve a strategic function: to reframe national priorities around production, resilience, and investment.\n\nTariffs: A Tool to Reframe the Narrative\n\nRecent tariff announcements have stirred market unease, partly because of their perceived ad hoc nature. Yet when applied strategically, tariffs can serve as a framework for industrial renewal — particularly if guided by three well-defined objectives:\n\nReshore critical industries, such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing\n\nRaise revenues to narrow the persistent U.S. trade deficit\n\nCreate leverage to compel trading partners to lower their own tariffs\n\nTo achieve these, tariffs should ideally be targeted, proportionate, and negotiated on a country-by-country basis. A one-size-fits-all strategy reduces negotiating flexibility and risks triggering broad-based trade retaliation. This is the case at present. On the other hand, tailored, bilateral agreements allow for greater precision and effectiveness.\n\nThe current administration appears to be moving in this direction — and if done thoughtfully, this measured application can both stabilize trade and support diplomatic repositioning. It also provides an opportunity for political leadership to redefine the goals of globalization around mutual benefit, resilience, and reciprocity.\n\nIndustrial Policy: Investing Tariff Revenue in the Right Places\n\nIf tariff revenues are reinvested with intention, they can form the financial backbone of a modern industrial strategy. Funds should be deployed into areas of national priority: robotics, infrastructure, AI, energy, auto production, and critical supply chains.\n\nImportantly, tariff rates should remain low enough and equally proportionate to preserve trade flows and avoid consumer price shocks — but high enough to signal urgency and shift incentives. The goal is not economic isolation, but recalibration.\n\nDeals with individual nations — structured around fairer terms and shared production objectives — can narrow trade gaps without collapsing global partnerships. A measured, predictable rollout would allow businesses and markets to adjust, and ensure public support is maintained throughout the process.\n\nBeyond the Status Quo: Rebuilding Strategic Autonomy\n\nFor decades, both major political parties have deferred substantive structural reform. Public sector employment — particularly in government, healthcare, and social services — has expanded steadily, yet this model does little to enhance long-term national competitiveness. The United States has become increasingly reliant on foreign supply chains for critical goods, including semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThis dependency poses significant strategic risks. A geopolitical disruption — such as a potential annexation of Taiwan by China — could instantly disrupt access to advanced semiconductors, halting industrial productivity and threatening national security. The imperative to rebuild resilient, domestic supply chains is not ideological; it is pragmatic.\n\nMoreover, it is entirely rational to encourage the consumption of domestically produced goods. U.S. vehicles are competitive on quality, yet face limited uptake in European and Asian markets. Promoting domestic consumption — particularly in sectors where the U.S. maintains technological leadership — is both defensible and economically productive.\n\nNegative Tax Basis: A Catalyst for Investment\n\nTo stimulate large-scale capital investment, policymakers should consider a revival of the negative tax basis policy framework — a historically effective mechanism for mobilizing private capital.\n\nUnder this model, utilized in the 1960s, investors were permitted to deduct losses exceeding their initial investment during the early years of a project. For example, an investor contributing $1 million could claim $3 million in losses upfront, thereby accelerating their time to breakeven and internal rate of return. This powerful incentive structure catalyzed the growth of several major U.S. industries, including California’s agricultural and tech sectors, and Texas’s cattle and energy infrastructure.\n\nBy reinstating this policy with modern safeguards, the U.S. could direct capital toward strategic sectors such as semiconductors, energy, automation, and critical infrastructure. Regional development initiatives could further guide investment to areas poised for long-term expansion or in need of economic revitalization.\n\nReframing U.S. Economic Strategy\n\nThe proposed tariff policy should be seen as a gateway to a more comprehensive national strategy — one focused on restoring and reshoring productive capacity, incentivizing private capital formation, and reducing economic vulnerability. Once trade negotiations stabilize, a targeted set of tariff protections may remain in place. Their deeper function, however, lies in creating the political and narrative space to initiate industrial policy reform.\n\nThis reframing has the potential to catalyze one of the most significant capital redeployments in modern U.S. history. It requires long-range planning, bipartisan commitment, and a willingness to depart from the inertia of past decades. But the opportunity is real — and increasingly urgent.\n\nInvestor Sentiment and the Path Forward\n\nDespite near-term volatility, pessimism often presents opportunity. Historically, markets have rebounded strongly after periods of public and investor doubt. Should the administration succeed in negotiating favorable trade adjustments and introduce credible investment incentives, the United States could reenter a period of strong, productivity-led growth.\n\nThe tools are available. The only remaining question is whether we have the vision — and resolve — to use them.\n\nDisclosure Note: past performance is no guarantee of future results.

That’s what happened recently when the CEO of United States-based luxury furniture retailer Restoration Hardware saw his company’s share price plunge by more than 25% in after-market trading.\n\nThe cause? Donald Trump had just declared “Liberation Day”, announcing sweeping new tariffs on nearly all imports. For companies like Restoration Hardware – which rely on suppliers in China and Vietnam, and now face tariffs of over 50% – the impact was immediate: higher costs, disrupted supply chains and enormous uncertainty.\n\nNew Zealand exporters were spared the worst, with exports facing only the 10% baseline tariff under the new regime. But the lesson is clear. In today’s world, the real threat isn’t always direct exposure, it’s volatility.\n\nTrump’s tariffs sparked a nosedive in share markets and reignited concerns about the reliability of global trade. And while tariffs may rise and fall, uncertainty seems here to stay. This is why an idea first developed by journalist and author Jane Jacobs in the 1980s deserves renewed attention. \n\nIn Cities and the Wealth of Nations, Jacobs argued that sustainable economic growth isn’t driven by national policy or protectionism but by what she called “import replacement”: where cities and regions develop the capacity to produce goods they once imported.\n\nThe concept is often confused with import substitution, where governments impose tariffs or subsidies to protect domestic industries. But Jacobs’ model is different. It’s not about shielding firms from competition. It’s about growing new capabilities from the ground up.\n\nA smarter response to volatility\n\nImport replacement happens when entrepreneurs identify goods currently sourced from elsewhere and start producing them locally, not because tariffs artificially advantage them but because they’ve found a better way to meet local needs. Over time, this drives specialisation, innovation, and eventually new exports.\n\nJacobs believed this bottom-up process was the real engine of economic resilience. And she was right. In an era marked by pandemics, war, climate volatility and policy shocks, the ability to adapt quickly and locally is more valuable than ever.\n\nNew Zealand saw this first-hand during COVID-19. When global supply chains stalled, we found ourselves unable to access essentials from PPE to packaging, diagnostic swabs to digital hardware. Some firms responded with ingenuity. Others waited. In many cases, local capacity simply wasn’t there.\n\nThat experience revealed an uncomfortable truth: trade agreements alone don’t secure economic sovereignty. It depends on the capability to make, adapt and substitute when the system falters.\n\nSome entrepreneurs are already seizing the moment. In the US, for example, founder of activewear brand XX-XY Apparel, Jennifer Sey, argues that trade disruption creates space for ethical, transparent supply chains closer to home. For her, localisation is not just risk management, it’s a business opportunity.\n\nBut rebuilding domestic capacity isn’t easy. It takes capital, skilled workers and time. And tariff-based incentives can vanish as quickly as they appear. That’s why the kind of import replacement Jacobs envisioned wasn’t a reactive policy tool but a long-term development strategy.\n\nWhat import replacement could look like\n\nThe same logic applies to New Zealand. We are heavily dependent on imported goods in critical sectors like machinery, pharmaceuticals, digital infrastructure, fertilisers and food processing. If any of those supply chains is disrupted, we’re not just inconvenienced, we’re exposed.\n\nTo reduce that vulnerability, we need to think strategically. That might mean developing domestic capacity to manufacture essential health products, or supporting entrepreneurs working on substitutes for imported fertilisers or packaging materials. \n\nIt could mean encouraging research institutions to develop substitutes for materials we currently source offshore.\n\nUniversities and other research organisations can play a vital role. By collaborating with startups and small or medium-sized businesses, they can accelerate innovation. From prototype to production, tertiary institutions can help translate research into real-world resilience.\n\nPublic procurement could also be better leveraged. Government contracts could reward suppliers who help reduce import dependency and build options into our domestic supply chains.\n\nCrucially, we need to map our vulnerabilities. Which imports are critical to key sectors? Where are we reliant on a single country or supplier? What could we produce regionally, if not nationally, with the right insight and capability?\n\nResilience is not retreat\n\nThis is not an argument against trade. New Zealand’s economy depends on it. But if we’ve learned anything from COVID and now from “Liberation Day”, it’s that openness without options is a liability.\n\nTariffs may make headlines. But they won’t build the necessary capabilities in the US or globally for the next crisis. That kind of economic resilience comes from the patient work of entrepreneurs in building, substituting, learning and adapting, at speed and close to home.\n\nJacobs reminded us that economies don’t grow stronger by walling themselves off. They grow stronger when they learn to make what they once had to import and, in doing so, discover what the world might want next.","summary":"Trump’s tariffs shine a light on New Zealand’s supply chain vulnerabilities.

The 2019 report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller alleged that the Russian government interfered in the election “in sweeping and systematic fashion,” mostly through hacking and messaging on social media. The investigation, however, “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” according to the final report.\n\nA Fox News reporter asked Stone last week whether he thought that Trump was right to “take on” the FBI and the CIA after “what happened to him with the Russia probe.” \n\n“I know. Look at Russiagate; we paid for it,” the filmmaker replied. “I applaud [what Trump is doing].”\n\n“I hate what they did with Russiagate. I really do. I think it’s, again, the lying, the lying, the lying, and selling that to the American people,” Stone said.\n\n“And the whole thing with hating Russia is so negative. It’s so un-American. They are potentially our best partners. As are the Chinese, actually. We have this mentality that they are the enemy. That’s all been inoculated by propaganda,” the director of Platoon and JFK said.\n\nMueller accused Trump of attempting to obstruct his probe, and a number of former Trump campaign staffers were indicted as a result of the investigation, but not the president himself.\n\nTrump has maintained that the ‘Russiagate’ was part of a politically motivated “witch hunt” aimed at discrediting and undermining his presidency. He dismissed the accusations in the Mueller Report as “fabricated and totally untrue.” \n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied having meddled in the US election. In 2016, President Vladimir Putin described the claims about Russian interference as “a mythical, imaginary problem” and a product of “hysteria.”","summary":"Film director Oliver Stone has said that the ‘Russiagate’ controversy was a bunch of lies \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/615318-oliver-stone-blasts-russiagate/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/67f31d8f2030277e422a4aee.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 00:35:48","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.589},{"id":308376902,"title":"Trump tariffs: Nations seek US trade talks as markets panic","text":"Trump administration: White House inundated with calls seeking fresh trade talks EU ready with \"proportionate countermeasures,\" says von der Leyen Netanyahu will urge Trump to cut tariffs on Israel during talks next week Chip leader Taiwan says it will seek zero-tariff deal with US\n\nHere are the latest developments following the new round of Trump tariffs on Sunday, April 6:\n\nTrump says tariffs are 'a beautiful thing to behold'\n\nUS President Donald Trump said that tariffs are the only way to solve the problem of \"massive financial deficits\" with China, the EU and others.\n\n\"They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social.\n\nHe claimed that the deficits that have grown during the years of President Joe Biden, will be reversed \"QUICKLY.\"\n\n\"Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!\" Trump concluded.\n\nMarket panic grows in the United States\n\nWall Street was bracing itself for big losses at the start of the week over Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on exports to the United States.\n\nFutures contracts on the New York Stock Exchange's main boards were sharply lower on Sunday, pointing to more pain for battered Wall Street stocks when markets open on Monday.\n\nJust over half an hour after contracts resumed trading at 2200 GMT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 3.56%, while the broader S&P 500 index was off 3.85%.\n\nInvestors brace for more stock market volatility\n\nInvestors were nervously awaiting the opening of global stock markets on Monday following a major selloff last week.\n\nIn the two days following US President Donald Trump's shock tariff announcement, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 10.5% — its biggest weekly drop since March 2020.

It doesn't mean that Russia, in the fullest of time, is going to be treated wildly different than every other country,\" Hassett said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a White House official said the reason for Russia's omission was due to negligible trade with Moscow due to sanctions imposed by Washington in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. US trade with Russia stood at $3.5 billion (€3.2 billion) in 2024, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration has imposed a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the US from Ukraine, as it continues to deal with Russian attacks.\n\nTrump official explains why penguin-inhabited islands also face US tariffs\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that some islands inhabited by penguins were included on President Donald Trump's tariff list so that countries could not use them as a loophole.\n\n\"What happens is, if you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America, go through those countries to us,\" he told CBS TV's \"Face the Nation\" program.\n\nAmong the countries named for Trump's minimum 10% tariffs were the Heard and McDonald Islands, a barren sub-Antarctic Australian territory uninhabited by humans, but home to four different species of penguin.\n\nPenguin memes have since gone viral on social media and US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer noted how \"Trump slapped tariffs on penguins and not on Putin,\" referring to the fact that Russia was not on the US tariff list.\n\nBessent dismisses likelihood of US recession\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed last week's stock market drop in reaction to President Donald Trump's new tariffs, saying there was \"no reason\" to anticipate a recession based on the levies.\n\nBessent cited stronger-than-anticipated US jobs growth, published Friday, as proof that the world's largest economy was still performing well.\n\n\"We could see from the jobs number on Friday, that was well above expectations, that we are moving forward, so I see no reason that we have to price in a recession,\" he told NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nThe uncertainty over the impact on trade from the new tariffs helped to fuel a days-long panic in global financial markets.\n\nTrump's announcements wiped $5 trillion (€4.6 trillion) off the value of the S&P 500 index by Friday's close, a record two-day decline.\n\nBessent also said Trump had \"created maximum leverage for himself\" in negotiations with trade partners over the new tariffs, which are set to take effect on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think we're going to have to see what the countries offer, and whether it's believable,\" Bessent said, adding that other nations had been \"bad actors for a long time.\"\n\n\"It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks,\" he claimed.\n\nIndonesia says no retaliation against Trump tariff\n\nIndonesia has issued its first response to Donald Trump's new 32% tariff on Southeast Asia's largest economy.\n\nChief Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto said in a statement that Indonesia would pursue diplomacy and negotiations to find mutually beneficial solutions rather than retaliate.\n\n\"The approach was taken by considering the long-term interest of bilateral trade relations, as well as to maintain the investment climate and national economic stability,\" Airlangga said.\n\nHe added that the government would support potentially impacted sectors, such as the apparel and footwear industry.\n\nAirlangga said Jakarta would also find ways to increase trade with European countries as an alternative to the US and China.\n\nThe government has previously said it would send a high-level delegation to the US for direct trade negotiations with Washington\n\nVietnam seeks delay to 46% US tariff\n\nVietnam has asked for a last-minute delay to a massive 46% tariff imposed by the US on all its imports.\n\nFormer President To Lam said he had appointed Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc to serve as the primary contact with the US side on the issue, \"with the aim of reaching an agreement as soon as possible.\"\n\nExperts believe the new tariffs will hit hardest in the Southeast Asian country's seafood, garments, footwear, wood, electronics and smartphone sectors.\n\nSome economists have warned that the likes of Nike and Adidas could reduce manufacturing in Vietnam, causing factory downsizing and job cuts.\n\nLam, who is General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam has written to US President Donald Trump, requesting a delay of at least 45 days, according to media reports.\n\nHe also said he hoped to meet Trump in Washington next month to finalize the matter.\n\nTrump said on Friday he had had \"a very productive\" call with Lam, who he said wanted to make a deal on tariffs.\n\nThe new levies come amid signs the red-hot Vietnamese economy is slowing.\n\nIn the first quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.93% year-on-year, down slightly from the 7.55% expansion in the final quarter of last year.\n\nNetanyahu: I will urge Trump to cut tariffs during White House talks\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hopes US President Donald Trump will ease tariffs imposed on Israel when the pair meet in Washington next week.\n\n\"I hope that I will be able to help on this issue. That is the intention,\" Netanyahu said of the tariffs. \"I am the first international leader, the first foreign leader, who will meet with President Trump on the issue, which is so important to the Israeli economy.\"\n\nNetanyahu is expected to meet Trump at the White House on Monday.\n\nGoods from Israel face a 17% US levy under Trump's far-reaching tariff plan.\n\nA senior Ministry of Finance source told Israeli outlet Ynet that the country's goal is to cut the tariffs to 10%.\n\nIsrael last week announced plans to cancel its remaining tariffs on US imports, only 2% of which are subject to levies, including high-end machinery and medical equipment.\n\nThe Israeli Manufacturers Association warned Netanyahu that the Israeli economy could lose up to $3 billion (€2.74 billion) as a result of the new tariffs, costing thousands of jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the Israeli Diamonds Exchange Nissim Zuaretz wrote to Netanyahu, urging him to ensure Trump doesn't apply tariffs on Israeli diamond exports.\n\n\"Not acting on the matter could lead to damaging the livelihood of thousands of families,\" Zuaretz wrote.\n\nTaiwanese president eyes zero tariffs with US\n\nTaiwan's President Lai Ching-te has offered zero tariffs as the basis for talks with the US, rather than retaliating against President Donald Trump's new 32% levies on the island territory.\n\nIn a video message, Lai said given Taiwan's dependence on trade, the economy would inevitably have a hard time dealing with the tariffs, but that he thought the impact could be minimized.\n\n\"Tariff negotiations can start with 'zero tariffs' between Taiwan and the United States, with reference to the US-Canada-Mexico free trade agreement,\" Lai said.\n\nThe president vowed to remove trade barriers and said Taiwanese companies would raise their investments in the US.\n\nThe new US tariffs do not apply to semiconductors, a major Taiwanese export. The island produces over 60% of the world's chips and 90% of the most advanced ones.\n\nLast month, the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC announced an additional $100 billion (€91 billion) investment in the US.\n\nEU's von der Leyen warns bloc will 'defend its interests'\n\nEuropean Union chief Ursula Von der Leyen said the bloc is prepared to \"defend its interests with proportionate countermeasures\" against Trump's tariffs and will work with partners towards this end.\n\nVon der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, issued a statement following a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose country has been hit by 10% tariffs.\n\nThe president also reaffirmed the EU's \"commitment to engaging in negotiations with the US.\"\n\nThe Commission, which also coordinates the bloc's trade policy, is due to propose to EU states on Monday a list of US products, worth $28 billion (€25.6 billion), to hit with extra duties.\n\nThe imports targeted include US meat, cereals, wine, wood and clothing, among other goods.\n\nThose retaliatory measures are in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs rather than the broader reciprocal levies announced last week.\n\nThe 27-nation EU faces 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and car exports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs of 20% from Wednesday for almost all other goods.\n\nThe new US tariffs will cover more than two-thirds of EU exports to the US.\n\nOn Monday, Luxembourg will host the first meeting of EU trade ministers since Trump's sweeping tariffs were announced, where ministers are expected to push for a unified response.\n\nTrump adviser: More than 50 countries want to renegotiate trade\n\nDozens of countries have so far reached out to renegotiate tariffs with the United States, a senior economic advisor to US President Donald Trump said.\n\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC's This Week that Trump's tariffs had so far driven \"more than 50\" countries to contact the White House to begin trade talks.\n\nSimilar remarks were made by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nHassett insisted that the duties would not lead to major price rises at home.\n\n\"I don't think that you're going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US,\" he said.\n\nHassett also denied that Trump hoped the new tariffs would crash financial markets to pressure the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\nHe insisted there would be no \"political coercion\" of the US central bank.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump shared a video that suggested his tariffs aimed to hammer the stock market on purpose in a bid to force lower interest rates.\n\nUS stocks tumbled by around 10% on Thursday and Friday, after Trump announced a new global tariff regime that was more aggressive than investors had been anticipating.\n\nWelcome to our coverage\n\nThank you for joining us as we bring you the latest developments on US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan, that has sent shockwaves around the world.\n\nAs nations digest the impact of the punitive new levies, several leaders have spoken about the desire to cut their own tariffs on imports from the US.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, are nervously awaiting the opening of financial markets on Monday, after large falls in stock prices late last week, following the announcement.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-tariffs-50-nations-seek-161900547.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.gFDM1sBZ5wM0v189TU9Vw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/deutsche_welle_articles_124/98adf5d1ac91fee725ee1be878c5de54","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 00:29:00","author":"Dw English","authors":["Dw English"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.051},{"id":308377730,"title":"Trump Steps Off Golf Course to Lecture America: Take Your Medicine","text":"Donald Trump celebrated yet another “win” at his own golf championship Sunday by telling America it had to take its “medicine” as the markets faced historic sell-offs in response to his shock tariff announcements. \n\nThe president says he spent the weekend—in between rounds of golf—talking to tech leaders and politicians from around the world who are begging to renegotiate tariffs, which are due to go into effect on Wednesday. \n\nAsked on board Air Force One about the catastrophic market reaction to his announcement, Trump said: “Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” \n\nEven MAGA politicians and influencers are balking at the turbulent economic response and hoping that Trump will be willing to calm the markets by renegotiating the tariff rates he announced last week.\n\nTrump told reporters on the way back from winning the Senior Club Championship at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, that around 50 world leaders had called to discuss trade. They are “coming to the table” and “want to talk,” he explained. \n\nThe president said he was willing to negotiate, but only if countries would help end U.S. trade deficits. \n\n“I’m willing to deal with China, but they have to solve their surplus.

The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing Tens of Billions of Dollars into the U.S.A. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold. The Surplus with these Countries has grown during the “Presidency” of Sleepy Joe Biden. We are going to reverse it, and reverse it QUICKLY. Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!”\n\nStocks were expected to open lower on Monday.\n\nThe crisis was sparked on Wednesday when Trump unveiled a wide-ranging plan to impose a range of tariffs on most countries across the world on what he called “Liberation Day.” While the announcement was long expected, the details were more severe than anticipated, sending markets into a spiral and prompting retaliatory tariffs from China. Revelations about how the U.S. tariffs had been calculated undermined confidence in the policy.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday evening as he flew back to Washington, D.C. after a weekend golfing in Florida, Trump said multiple world leaders had been calling him and being very “solicitous” in discussions about his new tariffs regime. He also said he had spoken to leading tech moguls who had assured him that “we don’t blame you.”\n\nHowever, he declined to name exactly who he had spoken to, saying he did not know whether the conversations had been private or not.\n\n“I spoke to a lot of Europeans, Asians, all over the world. They’re dying to make a deal. But I said we’re not going to have deficits with your country. We’re not going to do that because to me a deficit is a loss.\n\n“What’s going to happen to the markets I can’t tell you. But our country is much stronger.”\n\nHe added: “They are coming to the table. They want to talk but there’s no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis.”\n\nAsked if he had crashed the markets on purpose, after he shared a video on his Truth Social platform suggesting this was a deliberate part of his economic strategy to weaken the dollar, he replied: “No that‘s not so. But I do want to solve the deficit we have with China, the European Union and other nations.”\n\nAnd questioned on whether he had a threshold in mind for how low he was willing to see the stock market drop, he said: “I think your question is so stupid. I don’t want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”\n\nThe stock market had closed on Friday with the Dow Jones losing 2,231 points and the S&P 500 dropping 6 percent in response to Trump’s tariff plan.\n\nLast week was the worst for the stock market since 2020. Market-wide losses over the last two days now total a record-breaking $6.4 trillion, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSpeaking on Air Force One, Trump also said he did not anticipate inflation being an issue.\n\n“Because if you look at me, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars. This is not new to me. I took it during my four years, hundreds of billions of dollars from China, and we also took in a lot of money from other countries, but in particular China, because it was just getting started and there was – we had no inflation. Who had inflation was Biden. Biden had the worst inflation in the history of our country. I had no inflation.\n\n“We had a perfect country. We had no wars. I ended them all. I defeated ISIS. Everything was good. And then when this numbskull got in, as they really call themselves now, numbskulls, but when he got in, bad things happened to our country.”\n\nOn Saturday, tens of thousands of people across the U.S. – and around the world – marched in protest at Trump and Elon Musk’s policies on everything from DOGE cuts, tariffs, immigration and free speech.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/stock-futures-drop-again-trump-233839415.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/7ebb898c5171252187998951fa6a7c3a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 00:27:33","author":"Phil Thomas","authors":["Phil Thomas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":308375374,"title":"'Black Monday 2' fears rise as stock futures sink sharply again as Trump tariff fallout escalates","text":"Wall Street is bracing for a potential repeat of Black Monday tomorrow — and last week's brutal sell-off could look tame by comparison.\n\nDespite President Donald Trump claiming Sunday night that world leaders are 'dying to make a deal,' US stock futures tanked. \n\nFutures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow all plunged between 4.2 and 6 percent — a clear signal that last week’s $6.6 trillion wipeout was just the beginning.\n\nMeanwhile, markets in Asia opened deep in the red. Japan crashed 6 percent, South Korea fell 4.7 per cent, and Australia dropped 2.75 percent in early Monday trading — Sunday night U.S. time. \n\nCNBC host and market analyst Jim Cramer on Saturday warned of a potential repeat of the 1987 'Black Monday' crash if Trump doesn't pull back on his sweeping tariffs. \n\nThat crash saw the Dow Jones plunge 22.6 percent in just one day — still the worst one-day drop in history. He said the current volatility could lead to a similar event.\n\n'If the president doesn't reach out and reward countries and companies that follow the rules, then the 1987 scenario… where we dropped for three days and then plunged 22 percent on Monday, becomes highly relevant,' Cramer said during his show on Saturday. \n\nFutures for the three main indices —the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and the Dow — were all down between 4.2 and 6 percent at 7.20pm, after an hour and 20 minutes of trading. Traders fear tariffs will cause a global recession.\n\nEach had already dropped at least 10 percent In the two days following Trump's Wednesday announcement of sweeping tariffs on nearly 90 countries.\n\nThis follows the worst two-day wipeout in US stock market history on Thursday and Friday — with $6.6 trillion wiped off the value companies.\n\nA stock market rout does not just affect the big US companies. Most Americans have their retirement savings in the form of 401(K)s or IRAs linked to shares. \n\nTrump's 10 percent 'baseline' tariff came began Saturday, hitting all US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada. Come April 9, higher levies on goods from 57 larger trading partners - including the European Union.\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump denied he was intentionally engineering a market selloff and insisted he could not foresee market reactions, saying he would not make a deal with other countries unless trade deficits were solved.\n\n'Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,' he said of the market pain.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One — as he returned from the LIV golf tournament at his course in Miami — he added that he had engaged with world leaders on the issue to seek resolution over the weekend, claiming 'they're dying to make a deal.'\n\nThursday and Friday's steep slide pulled the S&P500 down more than 17 percent from its February 19 record close — bringing it closer to bear market territory, defined as a 20 percent drop\n\n'The bull market is dead,' said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. 'We might see some gains in the next few days, but for now they´re not going to be sustainable.'\n\nMalek also pointed to poor timing — the tariff announcement came just as first-quarter earnings season was getting underway — adding to investor anxiety. \n\nOn Sunday morning talk shows, Trump's top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning. \n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on NBC News' 'Meet the Press' that there was 'no reason' to anticipate a recession.\n\nSome analysts believe the market may attempt a short-term bounce. \n\n'Sometime this week it´s probably inevitable that we will have an up day,' said Steve Sosnick, chief investment strategist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nThe question remains about the sustainability of any rally.\n\n'We may see a day this week where screens are green, but any lasting rally may not arrive for three or four weeks,' said Alex Morris, chief investment officer at F/m Investments. \n\n'At that point, people will start saying we´ve taken enough air out of the balloon.'\n\nTrump's new tariffs will cause higher prices, job losses and lower growth, Jerome Powell warned Friday\n\nThe chair of the Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates for the US, issued the chilling outlook as he said the central bank faces tough decisions ahead as it navigates the economic fallout. \n\nWall Street analysts had expected the Fed to go beyond its planned two rate cuts for 2025 as recession fears grow over the new tariffs.\n\nBut Powell said the central bank won't make any moves until it has a clearer sense of the fallout.\n\nThe Fed controls interest rates, which impact borrowing costs for families and businesses. It raises them to cool inflation and lowers them to spur growth. \n\nPowell spoke Friday as global markets continued a massive sell-off that has wiped some 10 percent off major US stock indexes since Trump announced a raft of new tariffs on Wednesday. \n\nAnd major global companies also changed plans amid terror at Trump's tariffs crippling the world markets. On Friday, Nintendo delayed pre-orders of its new console at the 11th hour. Dodge-maker Stellantis announced abrupt layoffs Thursday.","summary":"Fears are growing that Wall Street is about to see Black Monday 2 tomorrow - which would make last week's sell-off caused by President Donald Trump's tariffs look tiny. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/article-14577875/black-monday-fears-trump-tariffs-stock-market.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/06/22/96984613-0-image-a-8_1743976573993.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 00:26:50","author":"Daniel Jones,Editor","authors":["Daniel Jones","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":308377012,"title":"New Bills Propose Trump On The $100 Bill, And New $250 Option.

(AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that he won’t back down on his sweeping tariffs on imports from most of the world unless countries even out their trade with the U.S., digging in on his plans to implement the taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he didn’t want global markets to fall, but also that he wasn’t concerned about the massive sell-off either, adding, “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”\n\nHis comments came as global financial markets appeared on track to continue sharp declines once trading resumes Monday, and after Trump’s aides sought to soothe market concerns by saying more than 50 nations had reached out about launching negotiations to lift the tariffs.\n\n“I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,” Trump said. “They’re dying to make a deal. And I said, we’re not going to have deficits with your country. We’re not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We’re going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.”\n\nThe higher rates are set to be collected beginning Wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said unfair trade practices are not “the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.” The United States, he said, must see “what the countries offer and whether it’s believable.”\n\nTrump, who spent the weekend in Florida playing golf, posted online that “WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won’t be easy.” His Cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force Sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy.\n\n“There doesn’t have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week?” Bessent said. “What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.”\n\nU.S. stock futures dropped on Sunday evening as the tariffs continued to roil the markets. Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures fell nearly 4% while Nasdaq futures were down nearly 5%. Even the price of bitcoin, which held relatively stable last week, fell nearly 6% Sunday.\n\nTrump’s tariff blitz, announced April 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without Congress to redraw the rules of global trade. It was a move decades in the making for Trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the U.S. He is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision.\n\nCountries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with China and others retaliating quickly.\n\nTop White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett acknowledged that other countries are “angry and retaliating,” and, he said, “by the way, coming to the table.” He cited the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the White House to begin talks.\n\nAdding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting American allies and adversaries alike, including Israel, which is facing a 17% tariff. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House and speak at a press conference with Trump on Monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with Trump along with the war in Gaza and other issues.\n\nAnother American ally, Vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. Trump said Vietnam’s leader said in a telephone call that his country “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” And a key European partner, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, said she disagreed with Trump’s move but was “ready to deploy all the tools — negotiating and economic — necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized.”\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away.\n\n“The tariffs are coming. Of course they are,” he said, adding that Trump needed to reset global trade. But he committed only to having them “definitely” remain “for days and weeks.”\n\nIn Congress, where Trump’s Republican Party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease.\n\nSeveral Republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon said Sunday that he would introduce a House version of the bill, saying that Congress needs to restores its powers over tariffs.\n\n“We gave some of that power to the executive branch. I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake,” said Bacon, adding that getting a measure passed would be challenging unless the financial markets continue to react negatively and other indicators such as inflation and unemployment shift.\n\nWyoming’s John Barrasso, the No. 2 member of the Senate’s GOP leadership, said Trump is “doing what he has every right to do.” But, he acknowledged, “there is concern, and there’s concern across the country. People are watching the markets.”\n\n“There’ll be a discussion in the Senate,” Barrasso said of the tariffs. “We’ll see which way the discussion goes.”\n\nTrump’s government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, had been relatively silent on Trump’s tariffs, but said at a weekend event in Italy that he would like to see the U.S. and Europe move to “a zero-tariff situation.” The comment from the Tesla owner who leads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency drew a rebuke from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.\n\n“Elon, when he is on his DOGE lane, is great. But we understand what’s going on here. We just have to understand. Elon sells cars,” Navarro said. He added: “He’s simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do.”\n\nTrump indicated he disagreed with Musk, saying Sunday of the European Union, “They want to talk, but there’s no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis.”\n\nLawrence Summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under Democratic President Bill Clinton, said Trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners.\n\nIf other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the U.S, does, too, he said, “it’s just making a deal, then we don’t raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the United States. If it’s a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the United States, then we’re going to have these tariffs permanently. So the president can’t have it both ways.”\n\nBessent was on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Hassett and Summers appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” Lutnick and Barrasso were on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and Navarro was interviewed on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Futures had suggested a 4.3 per cent fall on Monday.\n\nTen of the index’s 11 sectors were in the red, with energy, mining and tech stocks leading the losses. The only winning sector was consumer staples, home to the likes of supermarket groups Coles and Woolworths, which are seen as safer, defensive stocks in times of market volatility.\n\nThe biggest losers included stocks exposed to the US, such as buy now, pay later group Zip Co, which surrendered 14 per cent, or those with big US sales but offshore factories facing the tariff hikes, like appliance maker Breville, which lost more than 10 per cent before a quick rebound.\n\nEnergy stocks have been hit by the sharp retreat in oil prices as markets worry that less of the commodity will be used in a slowing global economy. Having been hammered last week, Woodside Energy was down another eight per cent in Monday trading.\n\nCommonwealth Bank was 8.5 per cent lower, while mining majors BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals were all down between five per cent and 8.5 per cent.

potential turmoil, with fallout from Mr Trump’s sweeping import levies keeping investors on edge after the worst week for US stocks since the onset of the coronavirus crisis five years ago.\n\nMore volatility across global markets could be in store ahead of the April 9 deadline Mr Trump set for his reciprocal tariffs to take effect, after last Wednesday’s announcement of the levies sent markets

near $U63¢.\n\nWith China launching retaliatory levies against the US, heightening investor fears about a disastrous trade war, the S&P 500 collapsed 6 per cent on Friday to lead the biggest two days of losses by major US equity markets since the height of COVID-18 in 2020.\n\nThe S&P-ASX200 began Monday already in correction territory, having lost just over 10 per cent since February’s record

rates remain in place the greater the impact on inflation, and deterioration in business confidence and subsequently the higher the probability that Trump’s tariff policy will be seen as responsible for causing a US and possibly global recession,” Mr Weston said.\n\n“While we’ve seen a number of (exporting) nations making moves to have their tariff rate taken down, the market is far more sensitive to news and moves that involve China, Europe, the UK and Japan,” he said.","summary":"Australian stocks have plunged more than 6 per cent on the opening of trading amid deepening fears US

Interests'","text":"Top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro claimed on Sunday that billionaire Elon Musk is \"simply protecting his own interests\" after the Tesla CEO spoke about the administration's sweeping new tariff policies.Newsweek reached out to Navarro's office and Musk via email on Sunday for comment.Why It MattersMusk saw around $11 billion shaved off his wealth in the stock market bloodbath that followed President Donald Trump's unveiling of tariffs last week, taking his overall losses since the beginning of 2025 to more than $110 billion.That is according to financial data compiled by Bloomberg, which monitors the wealth of the world's 500 richest people.Musk, also the CEO of SpaceX, is a close political ally and major funder of Trump, and has been spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) cuts to federal spending.What To KnowIn remarks on Saturday during a video appearance at a congress in Florence for Italy's right-leaning co-ruling League Party, Musk expressed hope for the Trump administration to ease tariffs against Europe, which faces a 20 percent generic tariff.\"At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\" Musk said.He told League Party leader Matteo Salvini that \"if people wish to work in Europe or wish to work in North America, they should be allowed to do so in my view. This has certainly been my advice to the president.\"During a Sunday appearance on Fox News, Navarro pointed out that while Teslas are manufactured in Texas factories, \"they get a lot of their content from China, Mexico, Japan and Taiwan and elsewhere,\" making the company particularly vulnerable to the administration's new tariff regime.\"Elon when he's in his DOGE lane is great, but we understand what's going on here. Elon sells cars. He's simply protecting his own interests,\" Navarro told Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures guest host Jackie DeAngelis.Navarro's comments come after Trump implemented what his administration calls \"the largest slate of US tariffs in a century\" against virtually all countries. The president announced the tariffs during his \"Liberation Day\" event last Wednesday.In response to the imposition of tariffs on European Union (EU) steel and aluminum imports, the European Commission has launched swift countermeasures on U.S. imports. In total, the EU countermeasures could therefore apply to U.S. goods exports worth up to €26 billion ($28,494,700,000), matching the economic scope of the U.S. tariffs.While Musk has been careful about directly criticizing Trump's tariff push, which forms the core of the president's second-term economic agenda, he has previously expressed concerns about tariffs.\"I think you need to be careful with tariffs...I deal a lot with supply chain issues like the global automotive supply chain for Tesla is incredibly complex. So, when there are sudden changes in tariffs…it messes everything up,\" Musk said in an interview with Joe Rogan late last year.Late last month, the billionaire wrote on X about tariffs: \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.\"In a separate post, he wrote that it's \"important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.\"Musk, who leads DOGE, is working as a special government employee. However, that status is set to expire by the end of next month, amid speculation about his future role.What People Are SayingElon Musk, in a now deleted X, formerly Twitter, post, wrote about Peter Navarro: \"He ain't built s***.\"Peter Navarro cleared up rumors on Sunday that he was involved in a tense relationship with Musk: \"There's no rift here. Look, Elon, he's got X, he's got a big microphone. We don't mind him saying whatever he wants. But, just, the American people need to understand that we understand, what that's all about, and it's fine.\"He later added: \"The reality here is that institutionally, the international trade system is designed to cheat us. They have systematically higher tariffs on us.\"The White House said last month that the U.S. automobile industry: \"Has been undermined by excessive imports threatening America's domestic industrial base and supply chains.\"Mark Williams, a professor of finance at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, previously told Newsweek: \"Should Trump's tariff war trigger a full-fledged recession, demand for any car, whether a Tesla or a Ford, will fall. A tariff war is a high-stakes gamble that our largest trading partners will acquiesce and accept trade terms that help the U.S. but harm them.\"What Happens Next?Trump and his allies have said there may be some temporary economic \"disruption,\" but that tariffs will ultimately benefit the U.S. economy and Americans.Trading partners have responded in various ways to the newly imposed tariffs, with some announcing reciprocal measures. Others are holding off or attempting to negotiate with the Trump administration to lower the rates.The president has insisted that markets will \"boom\" as a result of his trade war.

Nigeria, whose key exports to the U.S. include crude oil, gas, agricultural products, and manufactured goods, faces a direct threat to its trade earnings, which has already been confirmed by the Minister of Trade, Dr Jumoke Oduwole.\n\nThe newly introduced 14 per cent tariff marks a significant shift in U.S.-Nigeria trade relations, with the U.S. government citing an ongoing trade imbalance. According to the Trump administration, Nigeria imposes a 27 per cent tariff on U.S. exports, a disparity the U.S. claims has long been detrimental to American businesses and consumers.\n\nReacting to the tariffs, analysts at Meristem Securities in the weekly market report noted that the move would “shrink export revenues, raise costs for Nigerian exporters, and deter U.S.-bound trade, especially for non-oil goods trying to gain global market share.\n\nIt stated, “This may strain export revenues and FX inflows in the short term”; however, it anticipates that the government would “drive to localise production, scale non-oil exports, and reduce overdependence on traditional markets like the US. This could deepen engagement with the African Continental Free Trade Area and push policymakers to fast-track structural reforms that enhance trade resilience and industrial competitiveness.”\n\nExpressing concern about the newly imposed tariffs, experts at Cowrywise Asset Management Limited said, “As global trade dynamics shift under this new wave of U.S. protectionism, the resilience of Nigeria’s economy will be put to the test. We think that President Trump’s 14 per cent reciprocal tariff has cast a shadow over the stability of this trade partnership. While the move is framed as a strategy to safeguard American industry, it risks triggering broader friction, especially if Nigeria responds by exploring alternative trade alliances with China, the European Union, or BRICS countries.\n\nBeyond trade, U.S. investment in Nigeria spans vital sectors including oil, technology, and finance. American giants such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Microsoft maintain a strong presence in the Nigerian market. But growing trade tensions could dampen investor confidence and strain diplomatic ties unless carefully managed.\n\n “From a macroeconomic perspective, the imposition of the tariff threatens to exacerbate Nigeria’s existing vulnerabilities. Reduced export earnings, particularly from non-oil sectors, could diminish foreign exchange inflows, heightening pressure on the naira. This could deepen Nigeria’s foreign exchange liquidity crisis, potentially forcing the Central Bank to deplete its already stretched reserves or tighten currency controls. Inflation is also likely to accelerate, as Nigeria may be compelled to source critical imports like wheat, pharmaceuticals, and industrial machinery from more expensive markets. This would elevate input costs, worsen food inflation, and erode purchasing power.”\n\nOn the geopolitical front, the analysts said that the tariff may prompt Nigeria to recalibrate its foreign policy, which may include strengthening ties with alternative partners such as China, the European Union, and the BRICS bloc. \n\n“It may also look inward, seeking stronger regional cooperation within ECOWAS and the African Union to establish new trade corridors and collective negotiation frameworks,” the analysts said in their report.\n\nAt the heart of the concerns over the tariffs lies the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which since 2000 has granted duty-free access to the US market for eligible Sub-Saharan African countries, including Nigeria. The newly imposed tariffs place the future of this trade framework in jeopardy. Nigeria, a major AGOA beneficiary, has used preferential access to expand its exports in apparel, agricultural produce, and select manufactured goods. Now, that progress stands threatened.\n\nThe Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment, Dr Jumoke Oduwole, in a statement on Sunday, admitted that the policy would undermine the competitiveness of Nigerian goods, especially in sectors reliant on market access and price competitiveness.\n\nShe also noted that smaller businesses, particularly SMEs, that rely on the African Growth and Opportunity Act exemptions would feel the brunt of the new tariff, with rising costs and uncertain buyer commitments likely to make market access even more difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, Renaissance Capital Africa, in a report titled ‘The African Continent is (relatively) Immune to Trump’s Tariffs’, suggests that African countries, including Nigeria, may be less impacted by the US tariffs due to their diversified trade networks.\n\nAccording to the report, Nigeria, Algeria, and Angola could feel some effects of the tariffs due to their oil exports.\n\nThe report read, “The US does not trade much with Africa. It imported $39bn of goods in 2024, which is roughly what it imports from Mexico or Canada in just over a month. The US imports more in 24 hours from either of them (over $1bn a day) than it imports in a year from about 40 African countries.\n\n“The biggest exceptions are South Africa and, to some extent, Nigeria, which account for over half of everything the US imports from the continent.”\n\nIt further disclosed that Nigeria alone represents 14 per cent of African exports to the US. Despite this, the US remains a minor trading partner for Nigeria, with only nine per cent of the country’s total exports heading to the US market.","summary":"Market watchers have said that the Federal Government may need to drive the pace of local production and participation in the African Continental Free Trade Agreement following the imposition of a 14 per cent tariff on exports from Nigeria to the United States of America.

Countries including China, India and Russia responded swiftly, deploying search-and-rescue teams and medical support.\nChina’s response was the most robust, with more than 600 personnel across 30 teams sent to Myanmar and over 100 million yuan (US$13.7 million) pledged in aid.\n“We hope and believe that the government and people of Myanmar will overcome difficulties and rebuild their homes at an early date,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement. China was closely following the situation in its friendly neighbour after the earthquake and extended its sincere sympathies to Myanmar, the ministry added.\n\nBy contrast, the United States has offered US$2 million to aid the earthquake relief efforts – an amount that observers have described as modest.\nIt is the first major disaster since US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day freeze on foreign aid in January and slashed funding for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), cutting over 90 per cent of its contracts and eliminating an estimated US$60 billion in global assistance.\nWashington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, but its arrival was reportedly delayed due to issues in obtaining visas from the military junta – a stark difference from the rapid and comprehensive response the US had deployed during previous calamities around the world.\nMoe Thuzar, Myanmar studies programme coordinator at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said that the drop in USAID assistance had become “all the more salient in the aftermath of the earthquake where thousands are in need of urgent humanitarian and health assistance”.\nRegional rivals such as China could quickly move in to fill this “aid vacuum”, Kei Koga, an associate professor at the Nanyang Technological University’s public policy and global affairs programme, told This Week in Asia.\n“With the United States no longer maintaining leverage in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in Myanmar because of the aid cut, the narrative and public perception can be quickly shifted in China’s favour.”\nThis could have significant political and strategic implications. “China is now positioned to demonstrate its reliability in supporting Myanmar, while implicitly or explicitly suggesting that the United States is not a dependable partner,” he said.\n\nThe impact of these aid cuts would be felt among Myanmar’s civil society organisations that were already stretched thin to begin with, said Bridget Welsh, an honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute Malaysia.\nWelsh added that the loss of USAID would make it more difficult and slower to facilitate aid, as this would have to be diverted through other organisations such as the United Nations.\n“That has its own sets of problems in those circumstances, because the UN will operate slowly … It limits the funds going to the sources that you really need, which are people on the ground,” she told This Week in Asia, adding that these cuts were “basically creating harm [not only] to the networks of soft power networks that the United States had, but also particularly in helping Myanmar”.\n‘Asean at the centre’\nObservers stress that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations must cement its role as a regional leader and strengthen its mechanisms in delivering aid, as larger countries such as China and India aim to use their humanitarian assistance to their strategic advantage.\nMyanmar’s military government has announced a temporary ceasefire against armed opposition groups to better facilitate aid delivery, but there are fears that it may restrict access for humanitarian workers in opposition-led areas.\nThuzar said that the ceasefire could provide Asean members already in Myanmar a chance to “plan and coordinate future actions and responses as urgent needs post-quake for saving lives, providing shelter, food and medical care will eventually shift to addressing longer-term recovery needs”.\n\n“It is hoped that response teams from various countries can also get the opportunity to work with local organisations and networks to reach as many of the communities in need, regardless of whether they are in areas not under the military regime’s direct administrative control,” Thuzar said, adding that Asean needs to exert “adroit diplomacy” to ensure that aid reaches all communities in need and reaffirm itself as a key regional actor in disaster response.\nKitti Prasitsurk, professor of international relations at Thailand’s Thammasat University, said that while the regional bloc “does not have a tradition in terms of financial contribution”, it can continue to mobilise support and attract aid, working primarily with Japan, the UK and Europe.\nWith the US and other Western governments holding back aid, countries like China and India would compete to stake their interests in Myanmar and the region, Welsh said.\n“The fact that the US is no longer a player has given more power to China and India to

dependence","text":"IN just 20 months, Nigeria has secured N13.21 trillion ($8.6 billion) in loans from the World Bank alone, with an additional $2.2 billion in borrowing expected in 2025. While access to concessional loans can be a critical financial lever for development, the growing reliance on borrowings amid a rising debt profile—now at N144.67 trillion—raises concerns about debt sustainability and repayment capacity.\n\nThe 2025 federal budget tells a grim story. Of the N54.99 trillion budget, N14.32 trillion or 26 per cent is earmarked for debt servicing. This exceeds the outlay for recurrent expenditure (N13.64 trillion) and the combined allocation for health, education, agriculture, and social welfare.\n\nWhile President Bola Tinubu claims that loans are needed for development, the speed, scale, and sustainability of Nigeria’s debt accumulation demand urgent scrutiny.\n\nWhile it took eight years for Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to move Nigeria’s debt profile from N42 trillion to N77 trillion, Tinubu has doubled that figure in less than two years.\n\nNigeria’s debt-to-GDP ratio is approaching 40 per cent, a threshold that many economists consider risky for developing economies. This trend is not only fiscally dangerous but also unsustainable.\n\nDespite assurances of development-driven borrowing, the disbursement and implementation of these loans do not give room for comfort.\n\nAccording to the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, only 16 per cent of previously approved loans have been disbursed, raising serious questions about institutional capacity, transparency, and fund utilisation.\n\nEqually troubling is the opacity surrounding Nigeria’s forward sales of crude oil. While this provides short-term liquidity, it undermines the country’s long-term fiscal sovereignty. With an estimated $21 billion of future barrels already sold, the country’s future has been effectively mortgaged.\n\nThis is a perilous gamble for an oil-dependent economy still grappling with the volatility of global markets. Oil prices tanked to a four-year low of $65.58 per barrel on Friday amid the United States-led global trade war.\n\nYet, there is a silver lining. The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative recently revealed that oil companies owe the government a staggering N9.33 trillion. This is enough to offset nearly 72 per cent of the projected N13 trillion budget deficit for 2025. The EFCC and NEITI must fast-track recovery efforts to trim the deficit. \n\nThe Tinubu administration must ensure that loans are utilised for tangible and measurable development initiatives. All loans must be tied to projects with direct economic returns: power, transportation, and digital access must be prioritised to enable private sector growth.\n\nA project audit mechanism must be institutionalised to track the performance and impact of loan-funded initiatives.\n\nThe tax reforms must be implemented without overburdening citizens. The government should focus on broadening the tax base through digitisation, plugging leakages, and enforcing compliance. Efficient taxation can dramatically improve revenue without worsening the cost of living.\n\nRather than relying on more borrowings, the government should monetise state assets to free up cash. The NNPC is sitting on $370 billion worth of assets as of 2024. A partial privatisation through public listings can inject liquidity without incurring further debt. Transparent divestments would improve corporate governance in the national oil company and other entities.\n\nNigeria must develop a comprehensive debt management strategy that sets borrowing thresholds, imposes performance conditions on loan utilisation, and restricts future borrowing unless past loans are effectively deployed.\n\nDebt is not inherently bad, but loans must be concessional, transparently disbursed, and aligned with a national development strategy anchored on productivity, job creation, and diversification away from oil.\n\nThe government should reduce its costs by merging or scrapping redundant agencies. The US, a $28 trillion economy, is doing the same under Donald Trump.\n\n The Tinubu administration should shift from debt dependency to revenue mobilisation, enforce strict loan utilisation tracking, and halt the reckless forward oil sales.\n\n Nigeria must avoid an unsustainable debt trap that will endanger future prosperity.","summary":"IN just 20 months, Nigeria has secured N13.21 trillion ($8.6 billion) in loans from the World Bank alone, with an additional $2.2 billion in borrowing expected in 2025.

Despite US and European efforts to secure peace in Ukraine, Russia continued “to murder children and civilians”, Macron said. “My thoughts are with the children and all civilian victims of the bloody attacks carried out by Russia, including on 4 April in Kryvyi Rih,” Macron said on X. “A ceasefire is needed as soon as possible. And strong action if Russia continues to try to buy time and refuse peace.” Macron said that even though Ukraine accepted US president Donald Trump’s proposal for a complete ceasefire and European countries were also working to secure peace, “Russia is continuing the war with renewed intensity, with no regard for civilians.”\n\nUkraine’s president said Russian attacks were launched on Sunday from the Black Sea, showing why Moscow is refusing to agree to an unconditional ceasefire: “they want to preserve their ability to strike our cities and ports from the sea.” Zelenskyy said a ceasefire at sea was key for overall security and bringing peace closer and suggested Vladimir Putin does not want to end the war, adding: “He is looking for ways to preserve the option of reigniting it at any moment, with even greater force.”\n\nZelenskyy said on Sunday that Russia was increasing its aerial bombardment after its forces mounted a “massive” missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight, killing two people. “The pressure on Russia is still insufficient,” the Ukrainian president added.\n\nIt would be unsafe for Russia to restart the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and would take Ukraine up to two years in peacetime if it regained control, the chief executive of the company that runs the site has said. Petro Kotin, chief executive of Energoatom, said “major problems” to overcome included insufficient cooling water, personnel and incoming electricity supply. The future of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor, is a significant aspect of any negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-briefing-macron-urges-235543905.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/e19df324b9aa18567f91a12ade419b44","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-06 23:55:43","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":308375376,"title":"Gladiators star Steel shares update and new snap of his baby son after revealing he was born prematurely at just 23 weeks","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Apr 7th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTube passenger openly smokes crack cocaine triggering a shocking police response - just another day in London's transport crime epidemic\n\nPep Guardiola tells Man United fans they should be 'ashamed' over vile chants about Phil Foden's mother and accuses them of 'lacking class'\n\nNine out of 10 GPs call for NHS prostate screening programme: Hundreds of lives would be saved by initial targeting, say experts - as Starmer hails the Mail's campaign\n\nThis is the REAL cause of the explosion of autism and depression: Top psychiatrist DR ALISTAIR SANTHOUSE delivers his damning verdict... and reveals the only answer\n\nDEAR JANE: My girlfriend loves her new cosmetic enhancement... but I hate it.

It doesn’t mean that Russia, in the fullest of time, is going to be treated wildly different than every other country,” Hassett said.\nOn Wednesday a White House official suggested the reason for Russia’s omission was because trade was negligible thanks to sanctions.\nTrump has long insisted that countries around the world that sell products to the US are in fact ripping Americans off, and he sees tariffs as a means to right that wrong.\nBut many economists have warned that tariffs are passed on to consumers and that they could see price rises at home.","summary":"Oil prices dropped below US$60 a barrel for the first time since April 2021, even with countries seeking compromise on tariffs.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/3305435/market-panic-mounts-world-scrambles-temper-trump-tariffs","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/07/e42f8682-4a26-4ed4-b287-13508c811d6d_6dc01c59.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-06 23:40:30","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":308373532,"title":"Goldman Sachs lowers 2025 growth forecast for Chinese stocks thanks to Trump tariffs","text":"Goldman Sachs reduced its 2025 growth forecast for Chinese stocks after the US unveiled higher tariffs on imports from the mainland, as analysts said the Hong Kong stock market would slump to begin this week’s trading.\nAccording to Goldman’s report on Sunday, the impact of the tariffs could be blunted by a 2 trillion yuan (US$275 billion) fiscal package from Beijing to support the economy and consumer consumption.\nGoldman cut its 12-month growth estimate for the MSCI China Index to 10 per cent from 16 per cent, while the CSI300 Index for the largest stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen was reduced to 17 per cent from 19 per cent.\nThe New York-based investment bank said the average earnings per share growth for Chinese stocks for the next 12 months would be 7 per cent, down from 9 per cent, while the price-to-earnings ratio for the MSCI China gauge would be lowered to 11.5 times from 12 times.\nThe revision reflects a “high degree of uncertainty as [a] new trade war and possible negotiations unfold,” adding that a bull run for Chinese stocks would “slow on event risks and profit-taking pressures”, according to the report written by Kinger Kau, Timothy Moe, Si Fu and Kevin Wong.\nThe revisions were tempered from a more bullish position in February, after DeepSeek, an artificial intelligence start-up on the mainland, released powerful but cost-effective large language models. The breakthrough spurred the Hang Seng Index to jump 15 per cent in the first quarter after rising 18 per cent last year.\nGoldman made its revision after US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on most of the country’s trading partners, including China. China quickly retaliated by applying 34 per cent tariffs on all US imports.\nThe MSCI China Index has dropped 2 per cent since Trump unveiled the tariffs, while the S&P 500 slumped 6 per cent. Hong Kong’s stock market was closed on Friday for a public holiday, as were bourses on the mainland.\n\nKenny Tang-hing, the chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Financial Analysts and Pro-fessional Commentators, said he expected the Hang Seng Index to drop 1 per cent to 4 per cent on Monday to a range of 22,600 to 22,000.\n“However, the Hong Kong and mainland stock markets are expected to be more resilient than US stocks because the Chinese government can introduce measures to boost domestic trade and consumption,” Tang said.\n“The US stock market has more reasons to go down as tariffs are set to increase their inflation pressure while its economy may have a recession this year.”\nGoldman’s report also said the chance of a US recession over the next 12 months had risen to 35 per cent from 20 per cent amid a more challenging outlook for growth and inflation.\nIt expected China would increase its fiscal-deficit spending in terms of gross domestic product to 13.8 per cent from 12.6 per cent. It also said Beijing could introduce additional fiscal stimulus of 2 trillion yuan (US$275.2 billion).\n“Our economists believe Chinese policymakers could dial up the policy easing intensity to soften the tariff headwinds, and to help facilitate the rotation from external demand to domestic consumption,” the Goldman said.\nThe yuan was also expected to weaken to help exports, it said, which would affect offshore-listed Chinese companies that are quoted in Hong Kong and US dollars in other markets.","summary":"Goldman cuts its 12-month growth estimate for the MSCI China Index to 10 per cent from 16 per cent.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3305416/goldman-sachs-lowers-2025-growth-forecast-chinese-stocks-thanks-trump-tariffs","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/06/07ad8c0b-379a-4819-822e-5e0370d4ede2_a72aeacb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-06 23:30:15","author":"Enoch Yiu","authors":["Enoch Yiu"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.06},{"id":308370276,"title":"Fury over Mike Ashley's 275-acre greenbelt 'mega-campus': Now locals fight to stop 'catastrophic' plans to build 1,500 homes 'for workers' in surrounding villages","text":"Black Friday\n\nBreaking News\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Apr 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore devastating news for artist behind THAT hated Trump portrait\n\nPep Guardiola tells Man United fans they should be 'ashamed' over vile chants about Phil Foden's mother and accuses them of 'lacking class'\n\nTube passenger openly smokes crack cocaine triggering a shocking police response - just another day in London's transport crime epidemic\n\nThis is the REAL cause of the explosion of autism and depression: Top psychiatrist DR ALISTAIR SANTHOUSE delivers his damning verdict... and reveals the only answer\n\nDEAR JANE: My girlfriend loves her new cosmetic enhancement... but I hate it.

Email arthur.parashar@mailonline.co.uk \nBy ARTHUR PARASHAR\n Published:00:28 BST, 7 April 2025 |Updated:00:28 BST, 7 April 2025 \n\nVillagers living in the shadow of where Mike Ashley's 275-acre 'mega-campus' is set to be built are facing a fresh battle to block 'catastrophic' plans for thousands of homes on green belt land.\nResidents have vowed to 'fight to the end' despite feeling 'battered and bruised' from their campaign to stop Ashley's controversial Frasers headquarters being relocated from Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to green belt land adjacent to Ansty, Warwickshire.\nThe Sports Direct tycoon's retail empire won official backing for a new HQ on farmland in the tiny village of Ansty in December, despite a finding that it will permanently damage the Warwickshire's green belt.\nThe campus, which will include five warehouses, a 100-room hotel, a swimming pool, a helipad, and research and development facilities, has been recommended for approval by planning officers and is being considered by the Government.\nFrasers, who bought the land for £53.5million three years ago, say it will provide a £69million boost to the UK and create up to 7,500 jobs in the area.\nHaving strongly objected to the campus being built on green belt land, residents in three quaint villages surrounding the site are in disbelief that they could be burdened with an additional 1,550 homes.\nRugby Borough Council's Local Plan includes allocations of 710 homes in Wolvey, 415 homes in Brinklow and 400 at Long Lawford - all of which are villages nestled in the heart of Warwickshire green belt.\nHomeowners whose properties back onto 'sacrosanct' fields earmarked for development say they face living in the 'middle of a housing estate', with some warned their houses may have dropped in value by as much as £200,000.\nAdrian Warwick, Conservative County Councillor and Chair of Wolvey Parish Council, told MailOnline: 'This has been driven, in our view, by the Mike Ashley Frasers development at Ansty. \n'They've brought an 8,000-staff employment hub down from Shirebrook, relocated it to here and it's an area of high employment. Where are the workers going to live?\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nWOLVEY: Graham Bassett built a balcony so he could admire the stunning views, but he now faces staring at a housing estate amid the threat of 710 new homes. He says his property has gone down in value by £200,000\n\nBRINKLOW: Councillor John Reid's house also backs onto fields earmarked for development in villages around Ansty\n\nLONG LAWFORD: Colin Hewson moved to the countryside with his wife and autistic son for the peace and quiet. His house backs onto fields where 400 houses could be built and he has been told it has dropped by £100,000 in value\n'We think the driver to this is the sudden need to build a lot of houses quickly in the rural area and the most affected are the three villages around Ansty where this development is going.'\nHe added: 'This is going to change and destroy the character of our village. I'm embedded here and to see where I've grown up basically destroyed by the actions of this Local Plan is intolerable.'\nMailOnline visited the three villages surrounding the Ansty campus, where residents were up in arms over plans to bring more than 1,500 homes to their doorsteps.\nClosest to the Ashley 'mega-campus' is Wolvey, where homeowners and business owners are fearing for their livelihoods.\nAmong them is Graham Bassett who was 'born and bred in Wolvey' before returning to the 'sleepy village' when he was older.\nMr Bassett, whose house backs onto fields earmarked for development, told MailOnline: 'I bought a nice house on the edge of the village, put balconies on it for a nice view and now right up to my garden is where they are going to be building.\n'I've had it valued and they revalued it £200,000 less than what it was before just because of the proposals. I think it's so wrong, it's a village. We don't want building on this mass scale.'\nThe 54-year-old added: 'It's absolutely crazy, it's more than doubling the size. It affects so many people.'\n\nWOLVEY: Villagers (pictured) say they will 'fight to the end' to stop 710 homes being built\n\nWOLVEY: Adrian Warwick (pictured in front of fields that could be built over), Conservative County Councillor and Chair of Wolvey Parish Council, told MailOnline: 'It's been driven, in our view, by the Mike Ashley development and Frasers group at Ansty.\n\nWOLVEY: An aerial views show the village of Wolvey and the fields where houses could be built\n\nWOLVEY: In January, the village flooded and residents fear overdevelopment near the river will lead to more of this \n\n Mike Ashley wins backing for 275-acre Frasers 'mega-campus' on green belt land \nUp the road from one of the proposed housing estates is Ian Nicholson, who has owned the Wolvey village store for 13 years, but fears his business will go under if the development goes ahead.\nThe 63-year-old explained: 'I've got a personal issue that I own a local shop and part of the plans involve a 250-500 square metre supermarket. That's five to 10 times the size of mine. If that opens, that wipes us out. It's part of the community, I've owned it for 13 years. This hasn't got the density of population to fill it, even with 700 houses.\n'To put 710 houses here, it will destroy the village.'\nJP Downs, an ex-army officer who is striving to become an MP, said: 'It starts with the whole Mike Ashley development. It's green belt land, but more than that, look at Coventry town centre, look at Rugby town centre, they are dying. Is the solution to create a new retail park on green belt? \n'Now we are faced with all the houses in the new plan being dumped on villages and there isn't infrastructure to support them.\n'None of it seems thought through and it does feel like with the current Government, they don't care about the countryside and it feels like we are at war with them.'\nThe 50-year-old said the Ashley project and the Local Plan does 'feel very linked'.\nCllr Warwick, who is leading the fight against 710 houses in Wolvey agreed, telling MailOnline: 'The impact's going to be catastrophic. You're removing landscape that you just can't replace and doing damage to the environment and to people's lives.\n'We're going to fight. We are all sort of still weary from the fight we had over the Ashley development for Fraser Group at Ansty. But we will fight this, and we will fight it to the end.\n\nWOLVEY: Graham Bassett was born in the village and returned here when he was older. He has done up his house which overlooks the fields, but now faces the threat of a housing estate\n\nWOLVEY: Shop owner Ian Nicholson (pictured) says his business could go under amid plans to bring a huge supermarket to the area to support the extra houses\n\nWOLVEY: Residents say their village is 'full' and that the opinions of locals are being 'ignored'\n'We're all feeling a bit battered and bruised, having fought a greenbelt development that in most right-minded people's opinion would not be developed as it's on greenbelt.\n'We are concerned that this is just going to be hoisted onto us again.'\nMr Warwick condemned the Labour-run council for happily 'welcoming Mike Ashley with open arms'.\nBill Allen, who has lived in the village for 70 years, said: 'Wolvey is currently full, we have a surgery which isn't fit for purpose, we have a school which is full. We have problems with speeding and litter which are not being addressed by Rugby, it has to be done by volunteers.\n'The village is full and until Rugby address the issues that residents are facing, by doubling the size of the village there is no chance at all of anybody here having a decent life and it's gross.\nBob Hilliard, who has lived in Wolvey for 28 years, said: 'I always thought the green belt was sacrosanct and there would be no development unless there were special circumstances. \n'Now the onion of local people seems to be being ignored because of targets from national government.'\nResidents in nearby Brinklow say their tiny historical village will be doubled by an additional 415 homes.\nAppropriately stood by a war memorial, this army of villagers say they are now preparing for the 'Battle of Brinklow'.\n\nWOLVEY: These are the fields behind Wolvey that some of the 710 homes could be built\n\nBRINKLOW: Residents referred to their fight against 415 houses as the 'Battle of Brinklow'\n\nBRINKLOW: Aerial shots show fields in the village earmarked for development in the Local Plan\nAmanda Hayhurst, a PR company director: 'It's the Battle of Brinklow. It's David vs Goliath. No one is listening to us, it's anti-democratic. I think it;s revenge because we are a happy community, there are no problems here. They'll just import a load of problems.\n'It just makes me really angry. Frankly it doesn't make any difference to me except it will ruin the village I live in and I know everyone is upset about it.\n'Why do we move to a village? Why do we want to move to the countryside? We don't want big estates here. No one who works on the Ansty [Frasers] site will be able to afford a house in Brinklow, that doesn't stand up to common sense.\n'When we have the Ansty development there will be more traffic, then add another 415 houses to this. At rush hour, it's backed up. I can't back out my drive to take my daughter to school, I live in a village. It's ludicrous.'\nThe 57-year-old added: 'It's grown organically for 1,000 years and suddenly you are going to double it.\n'What we want to do is suggest small pockets of development which could happen with the consent of the village. We just want common sense, not ludicrous.'\nHeather Timms, a Conservative councillor for Rugby Borough Council, said: 'It just seems paradoxical that we have just had the huge Frasers site approved in green belt for exceptional circumstances and now we are being absolutely hammered with housing coming into the green belt, close to the site.\n\nBRINKLOW: Amanda Hayhurst (pictured in front of fields where houses could be built) says there needs to be 'common sense' shown\n\nBRINKLOW: Residents say their historical village could not meet the needs of an additional 415 houses\n'I don't think anyone objects to some organic growth to meet the needs of affordable housing, but to have this scale of development that doubles the village is a different matter.'\nShe added: 'They are just handing him a blank cheque… it's just beyond belief. It's in the wrong place, it's completely in green belt, it's adjacent to a hamlet of village in Ansty.'\nMs Timms also fumed at how the Frasers site has been taken out of the green belt in the Local Plan.\nShe added: 'It's not even built yet. They are handing Mike Ashley a blank cheque because then he can turn around and say 'Well I don't have to build what I have planning permission for now, I've got a free development site'.\n'That's what their preferred option says. He can come along and sell it along to someone else to develop something completely different. And he'd just have to apply for planning permission again and it wouldn't need to have special circumstances.'\nEchoing her concerns, John Reid, Chair of Brinklow Parish Council, said: '415 homes would double the size of Brinklow. We've got 496 homes at the moment and just over 1,000 residents. 415 houses will bring us a lot of people, for which the services will not be able to cope.\n'Our surgery deals with a lot of the outlying villages, it's already dealing with nearly 7,000 patients. They won't be able to cope.\n'It's not that we don't want them, we understand there is a need for a certain amount of housing, but not 415 all in one place.'\n\nBRINKLOW: Councillor John Reid poses in front of his house which has a stunning view over the fields which could be transformed into a housing estate \n\nBRINKLOW: Residents told how their only GP surgery deals with a lot of patients from outlying villages as well \nCllr Reid, whose house backs onto one of the proposed development sites, added: 'The Mike Ashley development, they always put forward we're gonna bring 8,000 jobs to the area. \n'We dispute that figure and we think it will be more like 3,200. Whatever it is, he's already published that he is going to draw his workers from Coventry, Birmingham, Hinkley, miles around and not necessarily from Brinklow.\n'We don't mind having a few of them, but it's not going to be 8,000. You can't help draw the conclusion that [they are linked].'\nBut Dale Aston, 60, a land owner, disagreed with the campaign to stop the development in Brinklow.\nHe said: 'I think there's some benefits to be had from it actually, because if you go speak to the pubs they want the customers. We need to support the village, it's got a lot of benefits. \n'The village surgery gets people from miles away, something should be done about that to support our local people first.\n'Rather than having an attitude of rejecting it, we should have an attitude of helping it benefit the village. My local workers can't afford to live in the village, the demographic is very very high over 60. There's no young people.'\n\nBRINKLOW: Residents say they are not NIMBYs but think it's the wrong place to pile in 415 homes \n\nBRINKLOW: The picturesque village is in the heart of the Warwickshire countryside \nMarie Nichols, who has lived in Brinklow 50 years, revealed her son has been forced to move out of the area because there is nothing affordable.\n'They use this word, affordable housing, but it is still too expensive for what the young people of the village need,' she said.\n'It's the wrong place to put it, probably the wrong housing for what we need, the school buses are full. The traffic is dangerous as it is.'\nAnd Dave, who moved into the house next to the proposed development a year ago before the Local Plan was published, said: 'I find it devastating that they are going to put 415 houses in the village. It's absolute chaos as it is with the tractors going down narrow lanes. I don't want to see a village broken.\n'We are already having a development over in Ansty, the big battery plant.'\nIn Long Lawford, father-of-one Colin Hewson couldn't be more in the eye of the storm.\nThe 60-year-old moved to the countryside with his wife and autistic son three years ago to get away from the noisy town centre they lived in before.\nMr Hewhurst's £780,000 property backs onto the sprawling fields where 400 homes are proposed - and he has already been told it has likely dropped in value by £100,000.\nDevastated by the proposals, he said he faces now living in the 'middle of a housing estate'.\nHe said: 'It came as a surprise to us because we bought this house because of its setting, it used to be a farm. It's all open fields behind us.\n\nLONG CRAWFORD: Colin Hewson moved to the countryside for peace and quiet but now faces living behind a housing estate \n\nLONG CRAWFORD: Pictured is the front of Colin Hewson's home which shows the views of fields he has at the moment \n\nLONG CRAWFORD: His view could soon become hundreds of homes if 415 homes are built\n'This just feels like it's completely contradicting everything they have been saying for years about encroaching on green space.\n'It just feels it's just another incremental step to making some of these local areas bigger and bigger.\n'We've been here for three years… we wouldn't have bought here if we'd known. We've got an autistic son and our previous property was right in the centre of town, it was very noisy and distracting for him.\n'We wanted a property that would give him some of that access to open space which is why we bought here and to be closer to the school he is going to in Rugby. \n'If we had known there was any inclination of 400 houses being built around us, effectively putting us in the middle of a housing estate, we probably wouldn't have considered this property.\nMr Hewhurst, who has faced three years of disruption from a separate development on the other side of his house, added: 'To have another development right on our doorstep is going to be affecting views from every direction from our house. \n'At the moment, we look over open fields and countryside and rolling hills, that's going to be a building site.'\nHe has 'major concerns' over the access points for the new proposed development, with one by his driveway and the other at the rear of the house.\nAlso fearing noise and air pollution, Mr Hewhurst said: 'Our quality of life will go down significantly because of this.'\n\nLONG CRAWFORD: These are the fields where the houses would be built, with the village seen in the background\n\nLONG CRAWFORD: Mr Hewson (his view pictured) says £100,000 could be knocked off the value of his house due to the plans\nRevealing the impact the Local Plan has had already, he said: 'We had an estate agent come around in the past month or so to get the house revalued for insurance purposes. \n'He was saying this could easily knock £100,000 off the property. Nobody wants to live in the middle of a housing estate, if you buy a property like this, you want to be in the countryside.'\nRuby Borough councillors voted for their preferred Local Plan to go to an eight-week consultation, which began last month.\nA Local Plan sets out local planning policies for a council, identifying how land will be used and determining where it will be built.\nThe Local Plan also includes allocations for 150 homes in Clifton-upon-Dunsmore, 210 at Dunchurch, 525 for Hillmorton and 165 at Stretton-on-Dunsmore.\nIt marks a new battle for locals, who strongly opposed to Ashley's Ansty HQ. The council received around 200 objections, including from eight parish councils.\n\nIt comes after Mike Ashley won backing for a 275-acre Frasers facility on the country's green belt in December\n\nThe proposed plans for a 275-acre Frasers facility on the country's green belt in Ansty\n\nThis is where the Mike Ashley Frasers campus is set to be built on green belt land next to the tiny Warwickshire village\n\nThese are the fields which run along the M6 where the Frasers HQ could be built\n\nThe project includes five large warehouses (pictured), a 100-bed hotel, and a space to test out retail concepts\n\nThe headquarters will be largest facility of its type in the UK, it is believed \n\nPlanning officers ruled that the benefits of the facility justify the damage to the green belt, branding it 'very special circumstances'\nA report concluded that the project created 'very special circumstances' which justified building on green belt land.\nA spokesperson for Rugby Borough Council said: 'The council is currently consulting on its local plan preferred option consultation document, which proposes to allocate housing to villages best able to support local services. \n'For example, some rural schools face a dwindling roll and concerns over their long-term sustainability. This is proposed instead of identifying further large, new settlements or urban extensions on top of those being built at Houlton and South West Rugby that are difficult to bring forward quickly and are not delivering enough affordable housing.\n'We need to identify available land for an additional 3300 homes, down from around 5700 homes that would have been required under the approach that would have been followed under the previous government.\n'The borough council is following an evidence-based process of site selection following advice from professional planning officers to bring forward a plan that can be found sound and ensure future development is properly planned. New homes built under the new plan will be built to the higher green standards than any homes ever built in the borough. Design codes would be used to ensure high quality development.\n'We encourage all residents to contribute to the consultation with well-considered evidence that will influence the next stage of the local plan review.'\nMailOnline has contacted Frasers for comment. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFury over Mike Ashley's 275-acre greenbelt 'mega-campus': Now locals fight to stop 'catastrophic' plans to build 1,500 homes 'for workers' in surrounding villages\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Angus King fumes at removal of climate change from US threat assessment","text":"Maine has been described as a “climate haven,” a place expected to remain relatively sheltered from the most extreme and dangerous impacts of global climate change. But the Pine Tree State is far from immune.\n\nFossil fuel-driven climate change is intensifying heat waves, flooding and other extreme weather events. Waters in the Gulf of Maine are warming faster than nearly every other swath of ocean on the planet, threatening the future of the state’s signature lobster industry and other fisheries.\n\nSea levels here are forecast to rise approximately 4 feet by the end of the century, forcing coastal communities, shipyards and military installations to prepare and adapt.\n\n“This is a guaranteed threat,” said Amy Eshoo, director of Maine Climate Action Now. “It’s not one we can negotiate with. It’s not one that we can put tariffs on. It’s not one we can go to the table with. We unleashed it. It’s here. We’re feeling its effects. Maine is definitely feeling them.”\n\nFor more than a decade, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence included the mounting impacts of climate change in its annual reports on global and regional threats to U.S. national security.\n\nThose reports have historically covered everything from terrorist groups, foreign adversaries like Iran and North Korea, drug trafficking and organized crime, nuclear weapons, cyber threats and, yes, climate change, which is already supercharging natural disasters, threatening energy and military infrastructure, and fueling food and water shortages that often lead to interstate conflict and migration.\n\nBut the U.S. intelligence community’s fact-based, nonpolitical streak came to a screeching halt last month.\n\nThe 2025 threat assessment, which the Trump administration released on March 18, makes no mention of climate change or other environmental threats, part of a broader administrative effort to scrub such references from government websites and documents.\n\nAt a Senate hearing last week, Maine Sen. Angus King (I) used part of his allotted time to interrogate Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard about the sudden change.\n\n“Every single one of these reports that we have had has mentioned global climate change as a significant national security threat, except this one,” King said. “Has something happened? Has global climate change been solved? Why is that not in this report? And who made the decision that it should not be in the report, when it’s been in every one of the 11 prior reports?”\n\nGabbard told King that the report focuses on the “most extreme and critical” national security threats.\n\n“Obviously, we’re aware of occurrences within the environment and how they may impact operations, but we’re focused on the direct threats to Americans’ safety, well-being, and security,” she said.\n\nTo argue that climate change isn’t a direct threat to safety and security flies in the face of an ever-growing mountain of science — research that Gabbard and even intelligence officials in the first Trump administration once embraced. Before leaving the Democratic party and joining President Donald Trump’s orbit, Gabbard described climate change as a “global crisis” and called for global action to safeguard communities around the world.\n\nThe 2019 threat assessment from the first Trump administration, which King referenced in his exchange with Gabbard, notes, “Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond. Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security.”\n\nGabbard stuck close to her initial answer when King pressed her about the link between climate change and mass migration, famine and political violence. She said she did not recall instructing the report’s authors to exclude climate.\n\nErin Sikorsky is the director of the Center for Climate and Security, a Washington D.C.-based think tank, and spent more than a decade working in the U.S. intelligence community. The erasure of climate change from the latest assessment “suggests some kind of political change,” she told The Maine Monitor, noting that climate hazards have only gotten worse in the decade since climate began appearing in the annual reports.\n\n“I think it’s a narrowing of the definition of ‘U.S. national security.’ It’s refusing to look at the facts,” Sikorsky said.\n\n“[Gabbard] said, ‘We’re focused on the direct threats to Americans’ safety, well-being and security.’ I think if you asked Mainers about their safety, well-being and security, they’d point to the extreme storms they faced last year in January that caused millions of dollars in damage.”\n\nKing’s office did not make the senator available for an interview last week, but a spokesperson told The Monitor his exchange with Gabbard was “fairly fulsome.”\n\nEshoo and Anya Fetcher, federal policy advocate at the Natural Resource Council of Maine, both likened the latest U.S. threat assessment to an ostrich burying its head in the sand.\n\n“The story of the ostrich sticking its head in the sand to avoid danger is a myth, but it’s not one we should emulate, because the threats and risks of climate change are very real, for Maine and the United States,” Fetcher wrote in an email, adding that she appreciates King raising the issue and holding the Trump administration accountable.\n\nSikorsky worries that the recent change could have a chilling effect within intelligence agencies, ultimately putting national security at greater risk.\n\n“When your leadership says, ‘Don’t talk about this stuff, we’re going to take this down from all our websites, we’re not going to mention climate at all,’ no one wants to lean forward to be the one to put their head up when people are getting fired right and left,” she said. “It doesn’t create a culture where people will be forward-leaning to make sure they get this right.”\n\nThis story was originally published by The Maine Monitor, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization.

They rolled back f------ civil rights. So I was, like, if I make this equal, then I’m also a piece of s---. I can’t f------ do that.”\n\n The White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) announced the news that Ruffin would no longer be hosting the dinner in a statement to members on March 29 — soon after the comedian publicly joked about President Donald Trump’s policies.\n\n \"The WHCA board has unanimously decided we are no longer featuring a comedic performance this year,” WHCA President Eugene Daniels wrote in the announcement, which was shared two months after Ruffin was announced as host.\n\n “At this consequential moment for journalism,” Daniels continued. “I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists.”\n\n The organization's announcement came just one day after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich criticized the Emmy-nominated comedian for her criticisms of the Trump administration.\n\n On March 28, Budowich shared a post on X calling Ruffin “a 2nd rate comedian” alongside a clip of her discussing her thoughts about the upcoming dinner in a recent interview.\n\n “What kind of responsible, sensible journalist would attend something like this?” Budowich wrote of her comments in the post. “More importantly, what kind of company would sponsor such as [sic] hate-filled and violence-inspiring event?”\n\n In the clip, Ruffin said: “You’re kind of a bunch of murderers,” seemingly in reference to the current administration.\n\n Ruffin also recalled a request to keep her speech at the event “equal,” to which she said, “There’s no way I’m going to be freaking doing that, dude.

Hybrids will also be allowed to be sold until 2035.\n\nSir Keir will vow on Monday that Labour’s plans will “ensure home-grown firms can export British cars built by British workers around the world and the industry can look forward with confidence, as well as back with pride”.\n\nHe is also expected to set out further measures aimed at supporting British industries later in the week.\n\nThe Conservatives say the changes “will not undo the damage this Labour government has already caused” through tax hikes and a lack of preparation for President Trump’s tariffs.\n\nShadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said: “Although the government has performed a U-turn, they are firing on half cylinders when nothing less than full throttle to support our car makers is required.\n\n\"After nearly a year, Labour’s industrial strategy remains stuck on the grid and the business secretary and chancellor are busy undermining competitiveness in the form of higher taxes and new employment red tape.”\n\nTransport secretary Heidi Alexander has said the motor industry deserves “clarity” in the economic context.\n\nShe said: “Our ambitious package of strengthening reforms will protect and create jobs, making the UK a global automotive leader in the switch to EVs, all the while meeting our core manifesto commitment to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.”\n\nMotoring industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has said that “greater action will almost certainly be needed” to safeguard manufacturers, given the tariff changes.\n\nChief executive Mike Hawes said: “UK-US negotiations must continue at pace, while the long-awaited industrial and trade strategies should prioritise automotive and be delivered at speed.”\n\nThe government’s announcement comes after Sir Keir spent the weekend in calls with foreign leaders about Trump’s tariffs, after he promised to do “everything necessary” to protect Britain’s national interest.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: “Discussing the announcement of additional tariffs by the United States, they all agreed that – as with defence and security – this is a new era for the global economy. Europe must rise to meet the moment and ensure the impact on hard-working people is minimised, while working closely with other countries to help maintain wider economic stability.\n\n“The prime minister added that it would be important for the UK to strengthen its trading relationships with others across the globe at the same time.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/starmer-promises-bold-changes-rules-213835754.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3912c74ed690d2228d46edff99f669d2","video":"","publish_date":"2025-04-06 23:25:51","author":"Archie Mitchell And David Maddox","authors":["Archie Mitchell And David Maddox"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.087},{"id":308374226,"title":"Notes on Civil Society’s Quasi-War with A Renegade President","text":"This post isn’t quite a post in the way I normally do them, more jotting down some of my brainstorming over the weekend. Universities are a core pillar of civil society. Law firms are not. Observers have been waiting to see what would come of an amicus brief organizing campaign in support of Perkins Coie, the Seattle-based firm which was the first to be targeted by the Trump administration. Perkins Coie is also, significantly, the law firm for much of the institutional Democratic party. That finally came out and the brief was signed by more than 500 firms across the country. But it was not signed by any of the nation’s Top 20 firms, measured by revenue. I don’t know enough about the internal finances of the nation’s top grossing firms. But I suspect they’re mostly like Paul, Weiss, which is to say they’re largely M&A firms, at least in terms of where they make their money – M&A and the management of other corporate transactions I don’t know acronyms for. It’s basically impossible to be in that business if you’re at war with the state that regulates mergers and acquisitions. \n\nJust after Paul, Weiss cut their deal with President Trump I spoke to a number of people either at the firm or proximate to it. One thing they helped me understand is that for firms like that, with a big M&A practice centered on partners with books of business ranging well into the tens of millions of dollars, it’s not just the clients who disappear in a flash. The money-making partners can too. So these vast, hugely money-making entities are actually quite fragile in their own way. The equivalent of a bank run dynamic and poof, they’re gone. But law firms come and law firms go. It is what it is. \n\nI’ve gotten used to not expecting much from Barack Obama’s rare forays into the public realm in recent years. But he’s right in this latest speech. Universities need to be ready to do without federal funding in order to play their role in our society, as bulwark’s of civil society. I don’t discount the extreme challenge of that. It’s easy to talk big until you have to pay people’s salaries. I know that from personal experience. But the reality is simple. I’m not saying Universities should write-off public moneys for their missions and especially public support for scientific research. But if universities aren’t prepared to do without it, when push comes to shove, they’ve lost before they begin. \n\nThis won’t come as a surprise to anyone. But it’s worth saying nonetheless. The modern major university presidency has become largely one of fundraising and managing all that goes into and comes out of fundraising. That made sense in a different era. But it’s a different skillset than leading a bulwark of civil society during an attempted autocratic takeover. If your university president doesn’t have or isn’t willing to use that skillset you probably need a different university president. \n\nFrom a number of quarters I have seen evidence that universities are preparing themselves to play this role. There’s clearly going to be a round two of the White House’s effort to bring the universities to heel. Round one didn’t go very well, to put it mildly. But they were also unprepared. Equally significant the White House hit them on issues on which they were themselves institutionally divided – reaction to the 2023/24 Gaza protests, post-2016 DEI. The White House has exerted full control over the tens of billions of dollars that the United States government uses to fund basic research both internally at institutions like NIH and also at universities and research centers around the country. But research, especially biomedical research can be more than just a vast undefended vulnerability. It can actually be an offensive weapon, not just for universities but for the opposition to Donald Trump’s oligarchic autocracy more generally.\n\nI have spent a lot of time in the last few months talking to people at NIH, people in the biomedical research world and also outside that world. My biggest takeaway, with new examples just over this weekend is this: most people outside that world, indeed, most people even in that world outside of NIH, don’t grasp what’s happening to the world of disease research and cure-finding. And the biggest barrier to is not just speed of what’s happened and lack of good information. It’s that people have a very difficult time believing it. We know that some people don’t want to fund Medicaid that goes to poor people. You may not think that way but it probably doesn’t surprise you that many people do. It’s very hard to people to believe that anyone is trying to end research into finding cures for diseases that affect everyone. The richest people get cancer and Alzheimers and Parkinson’s. Just yesterday I heard second hand from a power player in our society saying, ‘That makes no sense. Who would go after cancer research?’ And yet it is happening.\n\nAs I have had these many conversations what has coalesced in my mind is that the people on the front lines of this battle – the basic science researchers, the MD-PhDs, the early career research fellows, the peer reviewers, the major lab managers – are operating through the lines of power and streams of funding that the Trump-Musk reactionaries have secured control over. That battle is already lost. They’ve secured control of the arteries and nerve system and they’re running it in reverse. That’s done. \n\nThe community of research scientists is also thinking and arguing in the language and concept structure of grants, peer review cycles, studies, ecosystems of training new generations of research physicians. That language is alien and irrelevant to the vast bulk of the population. I don’t say that dismissively. I was raised by a Phd life scientist. I spent my twenties getting a doctorate myself, albeit not in the sciences. I understand it. I get its importance. In most respects it is my native language. But it has little to no valence or traction in itself with the public at large and the path to reversing the trajectory of destruction is by going to the public at large. That revolves entirely around the end-product the public has an immediate interest in and understanding of: not wanting to die or have a loved one die of a disease advanced research might be able to prevent or cure. Simple: cancer’s brand is in the toilet. The White House and DOGE have entered the war on cancer on the side of cancer. You can make a lot of hay about that and a lot of opposition. \n\nThere are disease communities around every major disease in this country, breast cancer, colon cancer, Alzheimers, etc. I don’t mean the professional societies. I mean, the organizations and informal communities of people who are survivors, who’ve been directly affected by these afflictions, who have genetic predispositions, who are doctors and caregivers. It is totally outside the experience and comfort zone of people from the research community to speak directly to what we might call the end user and say your chance at a cure or your child’s cure is going up in flames as we speak. And I get why it’s outside that experience. Research is inherently uncertain, tentative. You don’t want to overpromise. But these people and really all of us – because we’re all in some or multiple risk communities – are the ones who are being directly harmed. No single line of research is a sure thing but biomedical research as a whole really is. There are pre-existing networks and communities of concern waiting to hear this urgent message and they are, at present, not hearing it. That’s because the destroyers are moving fast along pathways of funding and control that they understand and have seized control of. They caught the good guys unprepared, without a clear strategy or language for telling the public what’s happening. \n\nQuite simply, until elected officials start hearing from angry constituents in town halls who are pissed that their futures and the futures of their loved ones are being lit on fire for no reason then nothing matters. The first front in this war has already been lost. The second front, where the forces of cures, treatments and health have the advantage has only barely gotten off the ground. This is like Heraklios abandoning the main battle in the Levant in the 620s, leading his armies through the Armenian highlands and catching the Persian armies unprepared on their home territory in Mesopotamia and destroying them. You don’t get the analogy? Well, trust me: it’s really good one. (Just don’t go too far into the 630s.) Basically it means abandoning a stalemated or losing struggle and doing a colossal end-run or flanking maneuver that your foes aren’t prepared for or expecting and beating them that way. The analogy operates on a couple levels because if you haven’t read a lot of ancient history its meaning is likely lost on you without a clear explanation. Which is to say you need to speak to people in language they understand, which is the whole point of the second half of this post. \n\nWhat I’m describing here also connects up with the universities, where a lot of this research takes place and which are home to a lot of academic medical centers which are the places many communities rely on for their health care.","summary":"This post isn&#8217;t quite a post in the way I normally do them, more jotting down some of my brainstorming...","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/notes-on-civil-societys-quasi-war-with-a-renegade-president","image":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/l2tyuifkiykccyni2qnp.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-06 23:21:26","author":"Josh Marshall","authors":["Josh Marshall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":308368056,"title":"Elise Stefanik will get over losing UN ambassador gig — she’s faced worse in DC","text":"Sex shouldn’t feel like work\n\nI interviewed a sex therapist.

Stocks were set to open sharply lower Monday, putting the S&P 500 on the precipice of a bear market — a decline of 20% from its peak and an ominous sign for investors and perhaps the broader economy.\n\nDow futures were down 1,500 points, or 4%. S&P 500 futures fell 4.3%, while Nasdaq futures tumbled 4.7%.\n\nThe price of US oil fell more than 3%, sinking below $60 a barrel for the first time since April 2021. Oil prices have been in a freefall as investors fear tariffs could plunge the global economy into a recession that would sap demand for flights, shipments, transportation and travel — all activities that require fuel.\n\nBitcoin joined the declines, too — falling 5.6% to $78,736.93. Bitcoin had surged above $100,000 shortly after Trump was elected in the hopes that he’d help boost support for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe massive declines in futures follow the worst two-day stretch for stocks in five years – since the pandemic. The markets have rejected President Donald Trump’s massive tariff regime, some of which went into effect early Saturday morning and even larger tariffs are set to launch on Wednesday morning. China retaliated fiercely Friday, imposing a 34% tariff on all US goods, raising fears of an escalating and damaging trade war.\n\n“Last week’s brutal selling pressure is set to continue on Monday, as the market is telling us that investors still lack clarity on the implications of tariffs, tariff retaliation and are worried that economic growth is likely to slow to a complete stall or recession,” said James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research.\n\nA universal tariff went into effect Saturday after Trump signed an executive order earlier in the week requiring a baseline tax for all imports. The announcement sparked an outcry from America’s trading partners — allies and foes alike — along with American businesses, investors and consumers.\n\nOn Wednesday, America will impose significantly higher “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly 90 countries that have the highest trade imbalances with the United States.\n\nTrump has also put in place tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum. He placed 25% tariffs on certain goods from Canada and Mexico.\n\nAnd more tariffs could be on their way, too: Tariffs on auto parts are set to go into effect no later than May 3. And Trump has also threatened tariffs on lumber, pharmaceuticals, copper and microchips, among other products.\n\n“The tariffs are coming. (Trump) announced it, and he wasn’t kidding. The tariffs are coming. Of course they are,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday.\n\nMarket mayhem\n\nRecession fear has gripped Wall Street in recent days. JPMorgan analysts said last week that the tariffs would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year — the largest tax increase (by a longshot) in recent memory. It will cause prices to surge, too, adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index, a measure of US inflation that has struggled to come back down to earth in recent years.\n\nIf Trump maintains the massive tariffs he announced Wednesday, his unprecedented trade policies will probably cause both the US and global economies to fall into a recession in 2025, JPMorgan analysts said. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday raised the risk of a recession to 60%, while Goldman Sachs last week raised its probability of a recession in the next 12 months to about 35%.\n\nThe Dow closed in correction territory Friday, down more than 10% from its record high in December — the first time the index has closed in correction in more than three years. The Nasdaq closed in a bear market for the first time since 2022, down more than 20% from its record high in December.\n\nAnd the S&P 500 is on the precipice of a bear market. It has fallen 17.4% since setting an all-time high on February 19, and it is set to open Monday in bear market territory.\n\nInvestors did not appear to be calmed by the fact that Trump has been meeting with leaders of multiple countries, perhaps to strike deals that could lower the tariffs. Trump is scheduled to hold a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday afternoon following a meeting that is set to include discussion of tariffs.\n\nMarkets have tumbled because the tariffs could raise prices significantly for American businesses and consumers. That’s because importers pay the tariffs, not the countries exporting the goods that Trump has been targeting.\n\nCompanies that import the goods typically pass along all or some of that cost to wholesalers, retailers and, ultimately, consumers. Although some retailers with strong supply chain controls may eat some of the cost, others will be unable to take such a hit.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday acknowledged that Trump’s tariffs, which were significantly more aggressive than the central bank had expected, would drive prices higher and slow down the economy. Powell said the Fed wasn’t in a rush to act but was monitoring the effect tariffs have on the economy.\n\nThe nonpartisan Tax Foundation said the average American household will pay $2,100 a year more for goods because of the significant universal and reciprocal tariffs Trump announced Wednesday. It said America’s average import tax will surge to 19% this year from 2.5% last year — the highest rate since the Smoot-Hawley era in 1933. Fitch Ratings said the rate would rise even higher, sending America’s effective tariff rate to its highest level in more than a century.\n\nAs a result, Americans’ after-tax incomes will decline 2.1% on average this year, the Tax Foundation said.\n\nThe good news, perhaps, is that the stock plunge has created some buying opportunities for investors. Stocks are trading at a historically cheap 15 times future earnings projections now. That could help markets rebound if investors believe stocks are oversold.\n\n“We are getting close to a bottom,” said Demmert. “The fact that stocks have dropped so significantly in these deep intraday moves is a clear sign o﻿f indiscriminate and fear-based selling.

You are reminded of the place where this all happened,” she told AFP. An 11-metre statue of Ramses II greets visitors, leading to a grand staircase lined with statues of pharaohs, gods and sarcophagi, and ending at a window framing the pyramids. \n\nCurrently, 12 galleries display around 15,000 artefacts arranged chronologically from prehistory to the Greco-Roman period. \n\nThey include Queen Hetepheres’ treasures, such as her intricately carved armchair, in sophisticated lighting after years of being tucked away in the old Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square. \n\nEven before the official opening, the museum left some of its first visitors awestruck. \n\n“I cannot get over how the lighting is. It is just atmospheric and helpful, and you end up just drawn to everything that is around,” said tourist from the United Kingdom Philippa Hunt.\n\nSouth African visitor Leon Wolmarans said the GEM was a significant upgrade from the old one. \n\n“This is much better organised, much better lit. The architecture is impressive,” he told AFP. \n\nAmong the most anticipated displays for the grand opening are the treasures of Tutankhamun, including his iconic gold mask, which will take pride of place in a dedicated gallery. \n\nMore than 5,000 Tutankhamun artefacts have been transferred to the GEM, though his full collection, including his sarcophagus and the embalmed remains of his daughters, will be revealed at the official opening. \n\nThe GEM will also showcase the 44-metre-long cedarwood solar barque, buried near the Great Pyramid around 2,500 BC. \n\nAnother boat, still being restored, will offer an immersive experience, with visitors watching conservators at work over the next three years. \n\nWith cutting-edge technology such as virtual reality and interactive exhibits, the GEM promises a fresh take on storytelling, making history come alive for younger generations. \n\nThe museum website lists entry prices starting at EGP200 for adult nationals, and EGP1,200 for foreigners. \n\nBeyond archaeology, the GEM is central to Egypt’s efforts to revive an economy battered by inflation and debt. \n\nWith tourism recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, the GEM is expected to attract five million visitors annually, adding to a record 15.7 million tourists in 2024. \n\nFormer chairman of the Egyptian Tourism Federation Elhamy al-Zayat said the museum’s proximity to the newly opened Sphinx International Airport, the pyramids and a growing number of nearby hotels will be a game-changer for Egypt’s tourism sector. \n\n“There will be easy transportation options to and from the museum, making it accessible from anywhere,” he told AFP. \n\n“This will definitely transform Egypt’s tourism industry.”","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/timeless-treasures/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/page-7-c_07042025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-06 23:02:39","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.249},{"id":308370272,"title":"Sir Elton John says he was 'letting himself down' while recording his new album because he 'wasn't feeling very well' amid his blindness battle","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Apr 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore devastating news for artist behind THAT hated Trump portrait\n\nPep Guardiola tells Man United fans they should be 'ashamed' over vile chants about Phil Foden's mother and accuses them of 'lacking class'\n\nTube passenger openly smokes crack cocaine triggering a shocking police response - just another day in London's transport crime epidemic\n\nThis is the REAL cause of the explosion of autism and depression: Top psychiatrist DR ALISTAIR SANTHOUSE delivers his damning verdict... and reveals the only answer\n\nDEAR JANE: My girlfriend loves her new cosmetic enhancement... but I hate it.

It said that “from the start of April, the public are being warned to expect a reduction in opening hours and staff levels, together with longer waits for appointments and services, as contractors struggle to meet demand in the face of these unprecedented financial pressures”. The amount which employers will have to pay in National Insurance rose yesterday from 13.8% to 15% of employees’ wages. Meanwhile, these payments now kick in once an employee earns £5,000, down from the previous level of £9,100. It comes after the Labour government also raised the minimum wage one week earlier. It jumped by 77p to £12.21 for those aged 21 upwards – an increase of 6.7%. The four groups above issued a joint statement yesterday saying that the rises mean that “health services risk collapse”. It said: “The National Insurance and Minimum Wage changes, effective from April 2025, add significantly to staff costs … “The impact of these additional overheads will be an inevitable reduction in opening hours, cuts to staffing levels, and reduced access to patient care. “Although commissioned to deliver primary care health services on behalf of the Department of Health, these practitioners are not shielded from the UK government’s latest revenue-raising measures. “Unlike hospitals or health trusts, which fund staff costs through national health service pay agreements, many of these practitioners (dentists, opticians, community pharmacists and GPs) operate as small businesses and are therefore responsible for their own wage bills. “For community pharmacy alone, the estimated additional cost from the new rates of National Insurance and minimum wages is £12.4m per annum, with the first hit on wages bills being felt this week.” Gerard Greene, chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, was quoted as saying: “The situation is becoming wholly unsustainable and goes entirely against the ethos of delivering public health services. “Individual pharmacy contractors are personally propping up this service out of their own pockets. We are at the point where, regrettably, this now means difficult decisions on staff numbers and opening hours.” And Dr Frances O’Hagan, BMA Northern Ireland general practitioners committee chairwoman said: “We cannot overstate the severe financial pressures family practitioner services in Northern Ireland collectively are now under. “This will inevitably mean increased patient access issues, further shrinkage of health service dentistry in NI, further closure of general practices and community pharmacies, and reduced access to NHS services in optometry practices caused by the removal of automatic access to care for those patients on universal credit. “The scope for each of us to raise additional revenue is extremely limited and we would not want patients having to pay more when their own finances will be similarly stretched. “We call on the health minister and the executive to intervene immediately and provide the mitigation and support needed to offset these latest cost increases we now face.” The Conservatives have labelled the National Insurance change a “jobs tax”. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said at last year’s budget that the National Insurance move would raise £25bn per year by 2029, and that she did not “take this decision lightly”. Pointing also to the tariffs unveiled by US President Donald Trump, shadow business and trade secretary Andrew Griffith said: “British firms are already on their knees. Now Labour delivers a one-two punch that could flatten them.”","summary":"​​A group of bodies representing much of Northern Ireland’s health sector have warned of a pending “collapse” in services due to hikes in how much employers such as GP surgeries have to pay staff.","url":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/health/dentists-pharmacies-and-gps-warn-of-pending-collapse-in-services-due-to-national-insurance-hike-5069756","image":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjIwYmM2ZmIwLTQ5NmUtNGI0Yi1hMDc0LThhZmZjZTg3NzY5MTphNmQ4ODFmMy0wZTA0LTQ5M2YtOTFiZi00ODdiYzgwZWRiYzY=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-06 23:01:00","author":"Adam Kula","authors":["Adam Kula"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":308366056,"title":"Give it a chance: Trump economic advisers make the rounds to boost tariff rollout","text":"The Trump administration spent the weekend trying to assure the nation that the sudden dive seen in the markets last week is all part of the bigger plan to make the U.S. stronger, even if it seems like the opposite may be occurring at the moment.\n\nTrump said his effort to make America great again via tariffs will come to fruition — eventually — but in the meantime “only the weak will fail.”\n\n“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,’ but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic,” Trump wrote in Saturday Truth Social posts, emphasis his.\n\nThe president’s top economic advisors made the talk show rounds on Sunday to make the case for the tariffs after the stock market shed more than $6 trillion in value in the days following the announcement\n\n“Look, the markets are organic animals,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during an appearance on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press with Kristen Welker’.\n\n“You never know what the reaction is going to be. One thing that I can tell you, as the treasury secretary, what I’ve been very impressed with is the market infrastructure, that we had record volume on Friday,” the billionaire former hedge fund manager said.\n\nThe “record volume” Bessent referenced came in the form of a 2,231.07 point, or 5.5%, single-day drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell to 38,314.86 on Friday.\n\nCombined with Thursday’s losses, the markets are down around 10% and have shed more value than the annual gross domestic production of the United Kingdom and Canada, representing the largest 2-day loss in history.\n\nAccording to Bessent, at the very least, “everything is working very smoothly” as the markets spiral downward, “so the American people, they can take great comfort in that.”\n\nWithout being asked if a recession were imminent, Bessent denied that one is looming on the horizon.\n\n“I reject that the assumption…there doesn’t have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity that I think the previous administration had put us on a course toward financial calamity,” he said.\n\nTop White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett acknowledged that other countries are “angry and retaliating,” after the tariff rollout — but he also added that they are, “by the way, coming to the table.”\n\nHassett said according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, more than 50 nations had reached out to the White House to begin talks on tariff reductions\n\nUnder the previous administration the U.S. stock market saw record growth and the nation recovered — according to most of the world’s economic experts — from the economic ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic better than the rest of the world’s wealthiest nations.\n\nBessent said that what we’re seeing in the markets right now is “an adjustment process” which will work out in the end. Your average American, he said, including those close to retirement, won’t be bothered by the “day-to-day fluctuations of what’s happening.”\n\n“You know, in fact, most Americans don’t have everything in the market. Most Americans in a 401(k) have what’s called a ’60/40′ account. The 60/40 accounts are down 5% or 6% on the year. People have a long-term view, you know, they have a program. The reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it’s a long-term investment. If you look day-to-day, week-to-week, it’s very risky. Over the long-term, it’s a good investment,” he said.\n\nTrump also claimed U.S. corporations aren’t concerned over the tariffs because there is another “deal” in the works which will apparently turn the economy right back around.\n\n“Big business is not worried about the Tariffs, because they know they are here to stay, but they are focused on the BIG, BEAUTIFUL DEAL, which will SUPERCHARGE our Economy. Very important. Going on right now,” he wrote, emphasis his.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — another of the Trump administration’s billionaire officials — joined CBS news on Sunday. Asked if the White House was surprised by the market plunge seen at the end of last week, he said “no.”\n\n“I think the point is, you need to reset the power of the United States of America and reset it against all our allies and our enemies alike,” he said.\n\nAccording to Lutnick, the tariffs scheduled to go live on April 9 aren’t going away, no matter how much other countries try to negotiate their way out of them. The U.S. he said, has been “taken advantage of” for far too long.\n\n“It’s because it’s not fair. The rules are not fair, and President Trump is going to fix them, and he’s doing it for America, and he’s doing it for your children and mine and our grandchildren. This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump’s been talking about this his whole life. This is Donald Trump’s agenda, and we’re all here to help him execute it,” Lutnick said.\n\nDespite the insistence that the tariff plan is here to stay, numerous countries are trying to broker a deal.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House and speak at a press conference with Trump on Monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion, along with the war in Gaza and other issues.\n\nAnother American ally, Vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs.\n\nTrump said Vietnam’s leader said in a telephone call that his country “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.”\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, said she disagreed with Trump’s move but was “ready to deploy all the tools — negotiating and economic — necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized.”\n\nHerald wire service contributed.","summary":"The Trump Administration spent the weekend trying to assure the nation that the sudden dive seen in the markets at the end of last week is all part of the bigger plan to make the U.S. stronger, even if it seems like the opposite may be occurring at the moment.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/06/give-it-a-chance-trump-economic-advisers-make-the-rounds-to-boost-tariff-rollout/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207735345.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-06 23:00:59","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":308367482,"title":"America thinks Trump is screwing up. Plus, data on the CEO murder","text":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about. You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nTrump flails on major issues\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s job-approval numbers are sliding—and new data shows it could be because Americans aren’t big fans of his agenda.\n\nA new poll from Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that Trump doesn’t have a net approval rating in any of the eight policy areas surveyed. No, not even immigration.\n\nHe may have earned the highest marks on immigration, but only 49% of Americans approve of how he's handling it, compared with 50% who disapprove. On other issues, however, Trump fared much worse, including his handling of the economy. Only 40% approve of how he is handling it, while 58% disapprove. \n\nHis worst marks came on his handling of trade negotiations with other nations: 38% approve, 60% disapprove. And this survey was conducted before he tanked the global stock markets with his idiotic tariffs.\n\nThese numbers are part of a broader trend. Other new polls show Americans aren’t happy with Trump, particularly on the economy.\n\nA Gallup poll released Thursday found that the economy topped Americans’ list of concerns, with 87% worrying about it at least a fair amount. Right behind it are inflation (85%) and the availability and affordability of health care (82%). Worse for Trump, the share of Americans who worry “a great deal” about all three have jumped since last year.\n\nTrump’s chaotic tariffs appear to be driving worries about the economy, likely because the tariffs are expected to raise consumer prices.\n\nFollowing Trump’s bizarre “Liberation Day” press conference on Wednesday, YouGov finds that 51% of Americans disapprove of “recent tariffs announced by the U.S. government, including a minimum tariff of 10% on all imports to the U.S. from other countries.” Just 34% approve.\n\nHowever, 67% of Republicans approve of Trump’s tariffs. And Gallup’s data finds that GOP voters express less worry than Democrats about the economy. It’s a stark reminder that even as the tariffs threaten to kick the country into a recession, Republicans are sticking by their man. It’s a loyalty that’s less about sound policy and more about tribalism, no matter the cost.\n\nNumbers on the CEO murder\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced Tuesday that the Justice Department will seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. While the public widely condemned the killing, Mangione has garnered a cult following since his arrest, driven by contempt for the U.S. health care industry.\n\nHowever, public sentiment around Thompson’s murder is more complex than simple outrage. Fresh YouGov data finds that only 56% of Americans disapprove of the killing, which is slightly lower than the 60% who disapproved in December, shortly after the crime.\n\nYouGov, known for its rigorous polling, framed the question carefully, allowing respondents to express ambivalence or subtle approval without outright endorsing the murder. When asked whether they \"approve or disapprove\" of Thompson’s killing, respondents could choose from the following options: approve (8%), neither approve nor disapprove (12%), disapprove (56%), not sure (18%), or prefer not to say (7%). \n\nInterpreting these numbers is tricky. Respondents who selected “prefer not to say” or “not sure” may, in fact, sympathize with Mangione but are unwilling to admit it to a pollster—perhaps out of discomfort with openly approving of a violent crime. (In survey research, this is known “social-desirability bias.”)\n\nBut there’s also a deeper anti-corporate sentiment at play. Mangione’s case is intertwined with broader frustrations over health insurance in the U.S. YouGov’s March poll finds that only 30% of Americans have a favorable view of the health insurance industry, while a staggering 62% hold an unfavorable opinion. Majorities of Democrats (64%), independents (63%), and Republicans (57%) hold an unfavorable view.\n\nMangione has also attracted a cult following, particularly among young voters and women—a phenomenon primarily arising from his anti-corporate cause, young age (26), and physical appearance. Strikingly, in YouGov’s poll, 18% of Americans view Mangione favorably—the same share who views Thompson favorably. The key difference lies in their unfavorability ratings: 48% hold an unfavorable opinion of Mangione, compared with just 36% for Thompson.\n\nWhether fueled by populist rage, personal sympathies, or online fandom, public reaction to the case remains profoundly divided—and unlikely to quiet down anytime soon.\n\nAll the news that’s fit to be doom-scrolled\n\nAmericans are consuming more news amid the destructive kickoff to Trump’s second term, though Democrats and Republicans are tuning in for very different reasons.\n\nOverall, 71% of Americans have been following news about the Trump administration’s actions—up 5 percentage points from 2021, during President Joe Biden’s tenure—according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nSeeing more people engaged with the news is certainly encouraging to us at Daily Kos. But what’s particularly striking is why Americans are paying closer attention. \n\nThe biggest driver seems to be fear.\n\nSixty-six percent of those following the news say a major reason for them doing so is that they’re “concerned” for what Trump might do next, while another 62% are following the news because Trump’s actions are “relevant” to their lives. One thing is clear: Few are tuning in because they like what Trump’s doing. Just 36% of those following the news say a major reason is because they “like” what his administration is doing.\n\nSixty-two percent of both Republicans and Democrats are following the news because his decisions are “relevant” to their lives. But when it comes to fear, the partisan divide is clear: 88% of Democrats are watching out of “concern,” compared with 45% of Republicans.\n\nThat 45% is still significant, though. It suggests that even within the GOP, Trump’s decisions aren’t sitting well with nearly half of his base. We’ve seen some of that concern play out at Republican congressional town halls, where angry constituents are showing up to grill their representatives.\n\nOf course, Republicans are still more likely than Democrats to say they approve of Trump’s actions, but the numbers aren’t exactly strong. Among those following the news, 64% of Republicans say a major reason why is because they “like” what Trump’s administration is doing. Just 8% of news-attuned Democrats say the same.\n\nIn other words, fear and uncertainty—not admiration—are driving America’s political attention right now.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Trump is “not joking” about possibly running for an unconstitutional third term, insisting that “a lot of people would like” for him to remain in power—but polling suggests otherwise. A new YouGov poll finds that 69% of Americans oppose allowing Trump to serve for a third term—a 6-point increase since February. Even among Republicans, the enthusiasm just isn’t there. The latest survey finds Republicans split on the issue: 43% in favor of allowing it, 42% not in favor.\n\n The infamous “Signalgate” scandal hasn’t impacted Trump’s support—at least not yet. A new Morning Consult poll shows that 52% of voters approve of his handling of national security, a 1-point increase from before The Atlantic’s bombshell report. This is despite Trump’s national security adviser using an unsecured messaging app to discuss everything from attack plans in Yemen to peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. \n\n Musk’s shady attempt to buy a state Supreme Court election in Wisconsin backfired spectacularly. Part of his scheme involved paying people $100 to sign a petition against “activist judges.” And as it turns out, 65% of Americans believe paying people to sign a political petition should be illegal, according to YouGov. \n\nDespite some wins this week—most notably, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s marathon floor speech—the Democratic Party is still paying the price for yielding to Trump. According to data from Civiqs on Friday, 60% of registered voters have an unfavorable view of the party, while just 32% view it favorably—a drop of 2 points on net since early March. \n\nAmong Democratic voters, support is slipping too: 70% have a favorable view of their party, but that’s a steep 12-point decline from Election Day 2024. Meanwhile, 15% of Democrats now say they view their own party unfavorably, and another 15% aren’t sure how they view it.\n\nThe exact root of this increased negativity isn’t clear from Civiqs’ data, but Democrats now have a chance to potentially turn things around—especially with the GOP in total disarray. Let’s hope they seize it.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.
