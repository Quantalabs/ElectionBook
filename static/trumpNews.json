He was smart. He was very down to Earth. It started with X interactions and he slid into my DMs. I think it was a meme,' St. Clair said as she detailed how the back and forth soon blossomed into a clandestine romance.\n\nIn St. Clair's stunning announcement she revealed how she was forced to go public after relentless tabloid inquiries threatened to expose her secret.\n\n'I was told to keep it secret. I was being asked to keep it a secret forever,' she admitted to the New York Post while declining to provide material proof of Musk's paternity.\n\nMusk, for his part, has remained silent on the claims, making numerous posts on X unrelated to the allegations surrounding him.\n\nHowever, St. Clair's camp insists there has been ongoing private discourse about Musk's involvement in their child's life although she agreed to leave the billionaire’s name off the birth certificate to preserve his privacy, security and confidentiality.\n\n'Ashley & Elon have been privately working towards the creation of an agreement about raising their child for some time,' her representative Brian Glicklich stated.\n\nSt. Clair alleges that Musk provided her with a lavish apartment in New York's Financial District, where rent for a two-bedroom can skyrocket to nearly $40,000 a month.\n\nAlong with the residence came a security detail - but no public acknowledgment.\n\n'I was completely isolated during my pregnancy. Every part of my career and everything I used to do I couldn't do anymore. I was told not to tell anybody,' she claimed. \n\nThe influencer, who previously worked for the conservative satirical website The Babylon Bee, says she first met Musk in May 2023 after a sudden work trip to Twitter's headquarters. \n\nAt the age of 24, she claims she was quickly swept into a world of secrecy and luxury. \n\n'At one point, he asked, \"Are you ever in San Francisco or Austin?\" And I said, \"I am in Austin a good amount for work.\"'\n\nAccording to St. Clair, the relationship only intensified from there culminating in her pregnancy, which she alleges Musk was adamant about keeping under wraps. \n\n'It is very hard to understate how much I am processing right now. I am sad that my hand was forced by the media to do this now. But there is also a sense of relief because I have been forced to live in secrecy for almost a year of my life,' she wrote on X. \n\nSt. Clair also admits she has not spoken with Musk since posting her revelation, though she did notify his team beforehand. \n\n'He ignored it,' she claimed, but notes how she has no regrets and has chosen to chosen to keep the baby's name and gender a secret.\n\n'My child is the most perfect thing that happened to me. I wouldn't change anything,' she said. \n\n'Almost every relationship in my life would be bastardized and disingenuous because I couldn't tell them what was going on. My son has never taken a walk outside — in five months. I have never been able to take my baby for a walk. I was terrified that someone would see I had a baby and it would get out,' she revealed.\n\nNow that the secret is out, St. Clair is hoping for Elon to publicly acknowledge the allegations. \n\n'We are waiting for Elon to publicly acknowledge his parental role... Ashley trusts that Elon intends to finish their agreement quickly, in the best interests of the wellbeing and security of the child they share,' her representative stated.\n\n'Whoa,' Musk wrote on X in response to a post that claimed, 'Ashley St. Clair plotted for HALF A DECADE to ensnare Elon Musk.'\n\nSt. Clair then replied criticizing Musk for replying in public.\n\n'Elon, we have been trying to communicate for the past several days and you have not responded. When are you going to reply to us instead of publicly responding to smears from an individual who just posted photos of me in underwear at 15 years old?' she wrote minutes later.\n\nDailyMail.com revealed on Friday that St Clair moved about a year ago into a swanky Manhattan apartment near City Hall, costing an estimated $12,000 to $15,000 per month. \n\nOne resident of the exclusive condo tower, which has been home to VIPs including Fox anchor Jesse Watters and Bill Gates’ daughter, said St Clair was the first person he knew to get a Tesla Cybertruck – and he wondered how the young influencer afforded it. \n\nNeighbors also said that St Clair was apparently living as a single mom, but has a full-time nanny looking after her two children: Musk’s alleged baby and a toddler from her previous relationship.\n\n Musk has at least 12 other children with three women: Justine Wilson, Claire Elise Boucher AKA Grimes, and Shivon Zilis. \n\nHis list of rumored past girlfriends is extensive. St Clair and the billionaire had already set tongues wagging over her public flirtation with the world’s richest man, 53, on his social media site, X. \n\nThey had been messaging each other in public since May 2023 with risqué jokes about ‘dick pics’, innuendo-laden references to ‘pulling out’, ‘how babies are made’ and ‘horny jail’. \n\nHe wished her happy birthday last July, she sent him heart emojis, he sent her a lengthy list of book suggestions and told her ‘this is the absolute *best* time in history to have kids!’ \n\nColorado-born St. Clair has built up a million followers on X with a conservative firebrand persona, has authored an anti-woke children's book about gender identity, and has faced criticism for hanging out with alleged white supremacists. \n\nFriends of the conservative influencer knew something big was happening in their friend’s life when she allegedly asked them to sign NDAs, as rumors of her relationship with Musk began to spread. \n\nA resident of the Manhattan residence familiar with St Clair told DailyMail.com that she kept to herself and was very security-conscious, installing a Ring doorbell camera on her apartment door despite the high security at the building. \n\nSome had noticed a few packages piling up outside her door, suggesting that she even had minimal interactions with the building’s staff who deliver mail to each resident. \n\nSt Clair kept her pregnancy largely under wraps, keeping her on-camera appearances last year tightly cropped, and not appearing at public events for several months. \n\nBut once the baby was born, she continued her meteoric rise in MAGA circles, including showing up at Donald Trump’s election night party at Mar-a-Lago. \n\nSt Clair shared photos on X of herself at Trump’s estate congressman Matt Gaetz’s wife Ginger and GOP spokeswoman Elizabeth Pipko. \n\nShe has also been pictured with Vivek Ramaswamy and Trump’s FBI Director pick Kash Patel. \n\nStaff at St Clair’s luxury condo tower say they have not seen any sign of Musk – adding that they would have had to ‘shut down’ the building to accommodate his security detail had he visited. \n\n‘The Elon Musk thing doesn’t surprise me,’ a resident of the building told DailyMail.com. ‘She was definitely one of the first people in a pretty large, luxury building to get a Cybertruck. \n\n‘I’ve seen her in the driveway with it quite a few times.’ However, a source close to St Clair denied that she owned a Cybertruck. \n\nThe resident familiar with St Clair said that they had not seen any men visiting the apartment, which they said is on one of the building’s highest floors, which come at a rent premium. \n\n‘I have never seen any indication of any man coming in or out of there,’ they told DailyMail.com. ‘She’s not particularly social with other residents,’ they added. \n\n‘There’s definitely a baby, and I believe there’s a toddler as well. ‘Her nanny is very much full time.’ \n\nSt Clair talked about her first child, a three-year-old boy, in an interview with the New York Post in July 2021 in which she railed against liberal attitudes towards gender identity. \n\n‘I am going to have a little boy in November, and it’s scary to think he could come home and say, “My friends all identify as something else and that’s how I feel” and have my son crying because he’s not put on hormone replacement therapy,’ she told the newspaper. \n\nSt Clair has appeared on Fox News, podcasts and web shows, a number of times, speaking on topics including declining birth rates in prosperous nations. \n\nShe stepped aside as a 'brand ambassador' for conservative youth organization Turning Point USA in 2019 after posing for a photo with white nationalists. \n\nAmong those in the photo were Nicholas Fuentes and Tim Gionet, better know at the time as 'Baked Alaska'.\n\n St Clair said the photo was taken at a 'diverse dinner' that gave her the chance to confront people she disagreed with. \n\n'Some of the people pictured had been vicious to me online and I'm not above confronting people or forgiving people,' she said at the time.\n\n 'I'm a strong Jewish woman and don't need to be told where I can and cannot go.' \n\nSt Clair is also known for publishing conservative children books, starting with Elephants are Not Birds in 2021. \n\nThe book 'tackles the topic of gender identity' and functioned as an 'unapologetic rebuke of transgender acceptance'.\n\nIt follows an elephant named Kevin and a vulture named Culture that tries to convince him he's actually a bird because he can sing well. \n\nThe vulture gives Kevin a beak and wings to wear - though the elephant struggles to live as a bird despite identifying as one. \n\nWhen describing the book's plot, St Clair said in the end Kevin 'realizes he's better the way he was made and he can like to sing and still be an elephant. \n\nSt Clair was in the news last year when she claimed Delta was flying undocumented immigrants from Arizona to New York City on her flight. \n\n'My Delta flight from Phoenix appears to be flying migrants who crossed the border and are being shipped to New York,' she wrote on X.","summary":"Conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair says Elon Musk wanted the child kept secret for security reasons, providing her with a lavish apartment but leaving her isolated during pregnancy.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14402109/MAGA-influencer-Ashley-St-Clair-Elon-Musk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/16/00/95237265-0-image-m-17_1739667116662.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 01:09:56","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":290934464,"title":"LIV Golf will be played on a brand new course designed by Greg Norman as part of long-term Adelaide deal","text":"The LIV Adelaide event will shift to a Greg Norman designed, purpose-built course as soon as 2028 as part of the Saudi-backed league’s longest existing commitment amid positive talks about “reunification” with the PGA Tour.\n\nAfter a possible poaching bid from Victoria, with the current deal to play at the Grange Golf Club expiring at the end of 2026, LIV officials have committed to stay in Adelaide until 2031 despite a lack of clarity what the golf landscape could look like by that time.\n\nNorman revealed the plan had been in the works for more than a year, as talks between the PGA Tour and the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which has spent as much as $3 billion funding LIV, around a framework agreement stalled.\n\nBut this week US PGA Tour boss Jay Monahan this week revealed talks with President Donald Trump to help hasten the framework agreement were so positive the “reunification of the game” was a big step closer.\n\nPresident Trump confirmed his ideal for “one tour with all the top players playing on that one tour” but the bold LIV commitment in Adelaide, including a massive state government investment in Norman redesigning the North Adelaide public golf course to host the event in the future, suggests LIV will be part of the future landscape.\n\n“North Adelaide Golf Club is a diamond in the rough and we are going to unpick it,” Norman said.\n\n“I’ve been a small piece of a lot of moving parts here but from my perspective as an Australian, I’m proud of the opportunity that we can breathe a little bit more fresh life into the opportunity here in Adelaide.\n\nNew LIV CEO, Scot O’Neill, who replaced Norman said there was “nothing quite like this event in the world”.\n\n“And we are thrilled to be a part of it,” he said.\n\nCrowds increased from just shy of 80,000 in the first year in 2023, to more than 90,000 in 2024 and expectations the final tally will pass 100,000 for this year’s third installment of what is LIV’s most successful event of any of the 14 held around the world.","summary":"Talk about reunification in golf haven’t stopped LIV officials making a major move in Adelaide with the longest commitment of any event and a brand new course.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/liv-golf-will-be-played-on-a-brand-new-course-designed-by-greg-norman-as-part-of-long-term-adelaide-deal-c-17738838","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17738838/b403bc03d337bee6a4b4cd77963893344650c110-16x9-x0y0w2047h1151.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 01:08:14","author":"Greg Norman,Russell Gould","authors":["Greg Norman","Russell Gould"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":290934428,"title":"Comedian Bill Burr shocks audience with savage attack on billionaires: 'Put down like f***ing rabid dogs'","text":"Comedian Bill Burr launched a blistering attack on the ultra-wealthy, declaring that billionaires should be 'put down like f***ing rabid dogs' for their role in perpetuating economic inequality.\n\nBurr's explosive remarks came in response to a message from a fan - a working mother who said she was struggling to make ends meet despite holding a full-time job. \n\nIn a fiery, expletive-laden tirade on his Monday Morning Podcast, Burr, 56, expressed his frustration with the financial hardship faced by countless Americans, denouncing the way billionaires hoard wealth while the working class remains trapped in a cycle of exhaustion and uncertainty.\n\n'The amount of people struggling out there because of these f***ing billionaires, and they got us all arguing liberal and conservative,' Burr raged. \n\n'We gotta stop doing that. I'm so tired of hearing about people going to bed worried about what's going to happen next week. There is so much f***ing money in this country and there's so much work being done.' \n\nThe comedian, known for his brutally honest comedic style, took aim at the growing wealth gap, arguing that people who work full-time jobs should not have to take on additional employment just to survive. \n\nHe noted the impact it can have on families, particularly children who suffer from overworked parents who are often absent.\n\n'If you work a full f***ing week at a job, you should be able to pay your f***ing rent,' he said. 'You shouldn't have to go out and get another f***ing job and still be struggling. \n\n'It's bad for the country because then the kids don't see their parents and they're not getting the upbringing they need.'\n\nBurr's attack on billionaires was relentless as he claiming rabid animals driven by greed are in turn fueling division in the country.\n\n'These f***ing billionaires, they need to be put down, you know, like f***ing rabid dogs,' Burr said. 'They're like rabid with f***ing greed, just going out and dividing everybody.'\n\nBurr's remarks come at a time of heightened scrutiny over wealth inequality, only months after Luigi Mangione allegedly shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. \n\nThe murder reignited discussions on economic injustice, particularly in healthcare. \n\nAlthough Burr did not explicitly endorse violence, his rhetoric echoes the frustrations of Americans who feel suffocated by an economy skewed in favor of the ultra-rich.\n\nBurr then veered into a scathing critique of Donald Trump's decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America - a move the comedian saw as both meaningless and racially charged.\n\n'The f***ing epitome of this time right now, like how divisive we are, that, like, the Gulf of Mexico is now the Gulf of America, and people get excited,' Burr scoffed. \n\n'Like, how the f*** does that help your wallet? It's an empty gesture. And then it's also like a racist gesture.\n\nBurr believed the renaming was in fact a thinly veiled act of xenophobia designed to appease a nationalist base and offering no tangible benefits to struggling Americans.\n\n'That's the white guy saying 'F*** Mexicans' without saying it,' Burr argued. \n\n'Who has a f***ing problem with Mexicans? What is the real problem? This is just such an ugly f***ing time.","summary":"Comedian Bill Burr drew controversy on his Monday Morning Podcast, declaring that billionaires should be 'put down like f***ing rabid dogs' for their role in economic inequality.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14401895/Comedian-Bill-Burr-attack-billionaires-rabid-dogs.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/15/23/95255509-0-image-m-9_1739661566151.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/20/4111861878471411606/1024x576_MP4_4111861878471411606.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-16 01:00:13","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":290934114,"title":"Unveiling the Intimate Details: MAGA Influencer Shares Experience of ‘Having Musk’s Baby’ and Discusses ‘Co-Parenting Arrangement’","text":"MAGA influencer Ashley St. Clair who came forward on Friday claiming she secretly gave birth to Elon Musk’s 13th child has shared more details about an alleged secret relationship with the billionaire tech mogul.\n\nSt. Clair, 26, claims it all began with a simple direct message on Musk’s X platform.\n\n‘Musk was very funny.

emergency summit in a ‘once-in-a generation moment’ as Donald Trump pushes for an end to the Ukraine war.\n\nThe Prime Minister, who plans to visit Washington later this month, hopes to act as an intermediary between Europe and the US after Trump’s decision to begin negotiations with Vladimir Putin placed pressure on the transatlantic relationship.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is expected to gather European counterparts, and Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, for the crisis talks on Monday.\n\nMacron’s diplomatic initiative has yet to be formally confirmed but the PM said he would work to ‘keep the US and Europe together’.\n\nTrump’s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine said on Saturday that European leaders could be sidelined from negotiations on a peace deal, heightening concerns about the possible appeasement of Putin.\n\nAnd Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested the creation of a new European army if the US cannot be relied on to guarantee the security of the continent.\n\nSir Keir is expected to relay messages from the meeting to Washington the following week when he meets President Trump.\n\nA further meeting of European leaders, including Zelensky, is expected upon Sir Keir’s returns from the US.\n\nThe PM said: ‘This is a once-in-a-generation moment for our national security, where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia.\n\n‘It’s clear Europe must take on a greater role in Nato as we work with the United States to secure Ukraine’s future and face down the threat we face from Russia.\n\n‘The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together.

He also said he doesn’t think it would’ve happened without the NFL’s DEI initiatives.\n\n “To put it nicely, it wasn’t my cup of tea, but I got to respect it,” he told Maher on the Valentine’s Day episode of Real Time. “And here’s why. You know, I grew up loving, emulating hip-hop, all things hip-hop — break dancing, deejaying, graffiti, rapping, and so I understand the culture a little bit more than most. And when I say most, of course, I mean white people.”\n\n Kid Rock continued, “So when you’re watching it, after, there’s a lot of things going through your head. You know, everyone’s like, ‘That sucked,’ this, that and the other. I’m like, man, this kid pretty much came out figuratively with both middle fingers in the air, doing what he does for the people who love what he does, unapologetically. And I don’t think he gives a frog’s fat a– what anyone thinks about it.”\n\n “So I go, huh, it’s pretty much how I built my whole career. I gotta respect it,” said Kid Rock, who recently performed in support of Donald Trump’s inauguration and said the president is “one of the greatest men to ever walk the Earth” and “screams ‘American Badass,’ just by the way he walks.”\n\n Kid Rock then attempted to theorize how Lamar — a frequent Billboard chart topper and 22-time Grammy Award winner, and the top Grammy winner this year (with five wins, including record and song of the year) — got the Super Bowl gig, which made history as the most-watched Halftime Show of all time, with 133.5 million viewers.\n\n “How did he get there?” he wondered out loud. “I’ve heard nobody answer this question. How did he get that gig? Jay-Z. What happened there? I think Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar should both send Colin Kaepernick a Bundt cake and a six-pack of beer and a ‘thank you’ note with a bunch of money in it because without him kneeling and getting everyone’s panties in a bunch over the anthem, self-included, I don’t think that happens.”\n\n Maher started to move the conversation along at that point, but Kid Rock kept going.\n\n “And by the way, one more point,” Kid Rock said. “This was the epitome of DEI blowing up. Because the NFL was all this DEI, end racism, all this stuff. They got Jay-Z in there booking this. Kendrick Lamar goes out there and basically turns DEI into an IED. It’s all Black people, or all people of color, speaking to his crowd, in the hood, Black people. It was like the most exclusive thing ever and I’m like, ‘F— yeah, that’s awesome.’ I’m laughing my a– off.”\n\n Later in the interview, when asked his thoughts on democrats, Kid Rock told Maher, “Half my band’s liberal, or gay, or Black, or this. I have one of the most diverse bands out there. Not because of this DEI s—. Just because they’re the best at what they do. We all love each other and get along.”\n\n As the conversation shifted over to Kid Rock’s upcoming tour dates, he spoke of the need for an upheaval in the concert ticket business. The TICKET Act, a ticketing reform law meant to clean up the concert industry, was recently revived in the U.S. Senate after nearly becoming law in 2024. The TICKET Act would introduce mandatory all-in pricing, require refunds for canceled events and ban speculative ticket sales.\n\n “In the last however long, it’s complete horse s—,” Kid Rock said of what it’s currently like to purchase a concert ticket, adding that “the customers get screwed.”\n\n “What we have to really look at right now is what’s going on in some of these European markets, like France. They basically put a price cap on reselling a ticket of like 10 or 15%,” he suggested.\n\n In another clip from the show, which aired during the “Overtime” segment and can be watched below, Kid Rock confirmed that he’s got a gospel album in the works.\n\n “Early beginnings now,” he told Maher. “Doing a gospel album with my old friend Rick Rubin.”\n\n Rubin previously produced Kid Rock’s 2010 album Born Free, which reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.","summary":"Kid Rock showed some respect for Kendrick Lamar‘s Super Bowl Halftime Show performance in an appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher.

discrimination cases, citing Trump’s executive order","text":"Signaling a major shift in civil rights enforcement, the federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws has moved to dismiss six of its own cases on behalf of workers alleging gender identity discrimination, arguing that the cases now conflict with President Donald Trump’s recent executive order, court documents say.\n\nThe requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law, and a stark contrast to a decade ago when the agency issued a landmark finding that a transgender civilian employee of the U.S. Army had been discriminated against because her employer refused to use her preferred pronouns or allow her to use bathrooms based on her gender identity.\n\nJust last year, the EEOC updated its guidance to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment. That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.\n\nNearly all workplace discrimination charges must pass through the EEOC — at least initially — and the agency’s decision to drop at least six of the cases raises serious questions about whether its protections will continue to extend to transgender and gender nonconforming people going forward.\n\nThe EEOC is seeking to dismiss three cases in Illinois as well as one in Alabama, New York and California. In each instance, the original complaints allege discrimination against transgender or gender nonconforming workers. The agency cites Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two “immutable” sexes — male and female — as the reason for why it no longer intends to pursue the cases.\n\nThe Alabama case charged that Harmony Hospitality LLC discriminated against an employee who identifies as a gay nonbinary male by firing him hours after co-owners learned of his gender identity. The New York lawsuit alleged that Boxwood Hotels LLC fired a transgender housekeeper who complained that a supervisor repeatedly misgendered them and made anti-transgender statements, referring to the housekeeper as a “transformer” and “it.”\n\nAnother suit alleged that Wendy’s franchisee Starboard Group, Inc. subjected three transgender employees to pervasive sexual harassment at a Wendy’s restaurant in Carbondale, Illinois, claiming a supervisor demanded to know if one employee had a penis. In another Illinois case, a transgender Reggio’s Pizza cashier at Chicago O’Hare International Airport was “outed” by her manager, called a racist, homophobic slur by coworkers, and fired when she complained. In southern Illinois, at a hog farm called Sis-Bro, Inc., a coworker allegedly exposed his genitals to a transgender employee and touched her breasts.\n\nAnd in Santa Clara, California, the EEOC charged that a Lush Handmade Cosmetics store manager sexually harassed three gender nonconforming employees with “offensive physical and verbal sexual conduct.”\n\nFormer EEOC General Counsel and Professor and Co-Dean Emeritus at Rutgers Law School David Lopez, who served in the agency for more than 20 years, on Friday said in his experience, the EEOC has never dismissed cases based on substance rather than merit — until now.\n\nFor the country’s anti-discrimination agency “to discriminate against a group, and say, ‘We’re not going to enforce the law on their behalf’ itself is discrimination, in my view,” Lopez said. “It’s like a complete abdication of responsibility.”\n\nThe EEOC’s requests to dismiss the cases come just weeks after Trump dismissed two Democratic commissioners of the five-member EEOC before their terms expired, an unprecedented decision that removed what would have been a major obstacle to his administration efforts to upend interpretation of the nation’s civil rights laws. Had the commissioners been allowed to carry out their terms, the EEOC would have had a Democratic majority well into Trump’s term. The administration also fired Karla Gilbride as the EEOC’s general counsel, replacing her with Andrew Rogers as acting counsel.\n\nShortly after their dismissals, acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, signaled her intent to put the agency’s resources behind enforcing Trump’s executive order on gender. She announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be “defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.” Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that “implicate” Trump’s order should be elevated to headquarters for “review.”\n\n“Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,” Lucas said in her statement. “Sex is binary (male and female) and immutable. It is not harassment to acknowledge these truths — or to use language like pronouns that flow from these realities, even repeatedly.” She removed the agency’s “pronoun app,” which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their Microsoft 365 profiles, among other changes.\n\nThe EEOC in fiscal year 2023 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, “the most since the agency started tracking these charges in FY 2013, and up more than 36% from the previous year,” according to the agency’s website, which also provides a link for more information on discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But the information appears to have been removed and the link now leads to a blank page with the message: “The requested page could not be found.”\n\nJocelyn Samuels, one of the Democratic EEOC commissioners who was fired last month, said via email that Trump’s executive order and the EEOC’s response to it “is truly regrettable.”\n\n“The Administration’s efforts to erase trans people are deeply harmful to a vulnerable community and inconsistent with governing law,” she said.\n\nSarah Warbelow, vice president of legal at LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign, added in an emailed statement: “This is the inevitable outcome when the EEOC is weaponized to greenlight discrimination against American workers.\n\n“Instead of standing up for the rights of everyone to a workplace free from discrimination, including harassment and bias, the Trump administration is making it abundantly clear they will not protect working people.”","summary":"Signaling a major shift in civil rights enforcement, the federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws has moved to dismiss six of its own cases on behalf of workers alleging gender identity discrimination, arguing that the cases now conflict with President Donald Trump&#8217;s recent executive order, court documents say.

Others said they were forced to return to their offices after Trump axed work-from-home opportunities.\n\nThen on Thursday, thousands of probationary workers across the United States were laid off, and now, many in the city are worried about the effects of an executive order Trump signed Tuesday, the Huntsville Times reports.\n\nIt directs federal agencies to prepare for 'large scale reductions in force,' stating that any government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted.\n\nWith exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four that leave. In addition, new hires would generally need the approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Elon Musk´s team.\n\nThat could apply to most of the 7,000 employees at the Marshall Space Flight Center, which is now leading the development of NASA's Space Launch System rockets as part of the agency's efforts to bring astronauts back to the moon, according to the New York Times.\n\nBut under a continuity plan NASA submitted to the Office of Management and Budget in 2023, over 92 percent of the space agency's employees would be considered nonessential next time a government shutdown were to occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday directing federal agencies to prepare for 'large scale reductions in force,' stating that any government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts\n\nMany in Huntsville, Alabama are now bracing for the impact of that decision\n\nAdding to the concerns are 'First Buddy' Musk's criticisms of the Space Launch system project, which he has previously said is outdated.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also previously declared that the thinking behind the rockets makes him 'sad' as the project remains years behind schedule and way over budget.\n\nIt is now estimated that each launch could cost up to $4billion - and the rockets cannot be reused, according to Reuters.\n\nIn light of the threat, would-be homeowners have backtracked from their plans to buy a house in the city because they are worried about their job security, real estate agent Terrence Harris told the Times.\n\n'These extreme swings at federal jobs, it really does affect people's buying confidence,' he explained.\n\n'It affects what kind of investor comes to this city, how much they are willing to invest.'\n\nFormer Congressman Parker Griffith also warned that it could harm the local economy.\n\nTheir concerns seem to be tied to past experience, after more than 1,000 jobs were lost when Constellation - a program to return astronauts to the moon - was shut down in 2010.\n\nTrump's order could apply to many of the Marshall Flight Center's 7,000 employees \n\nIt is leading the development of NASA 's Space Launch System rockets as part of the agency's efforts to bring astronauts back to the moon\n\n'They remember Constellation and the shuttle program coming to an end,' Steve Cash, who ran NASA's shuttle propulsion program and held other jobs at the Space Center before retiring in 2016, said of the city's space industry workers.\n\n'Fear of the unknown is the worst thing.'\n\nThere are also concerns that Trump's cuts would not just affect those in the aerospace industry, as his plans to cut $4billion in federal funding for research at universities, cancer centers and hospitals could affect programs at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. \n\nNow, some are holding on to hope that Trump visits the home of the nation's Space Command in Huntsville and reverses some of his decisions.\n\nBut the cuts are not likely to affect the FBI and ATF agents in the city, who are considered exempted from furlough in the case of a government shutdown.\n\nAdding to the concerns are 'First Buddy' Elon Musk's criticisms of the Space Launch System project, which he has previously called outdated.\n\nAs a result, some city leaders say the concerns are unwarranted.\n\n'It's very normal to be anxious in these times because they just don't know,' Mayor Tommy Battle, a Republican, said of the city's federal workers. \n\nBut he added, 'We've got a pretty good portfolio and it's diverse. And it's diverse enough that if one goes down, another area goes up.' \n\nJake Griffin, a government contracting consultant, added that the 'defense budget is probably not going to shrink' under Trump 'so overall, I don't think we're going to see a true economic downturn any times soon in Huntsville.'\n\nIn fact, he said, if the Trump administration 'reallocates some of those wasted dollars to the defense budget, I do think that Huntsville has the chance to boom even more again.' \n\nAlabamaFBIDonald TrumpNasa\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAmerica's 'Rocket City' faces total shutdown as Trump's federal worker bloodbath leaves town spiraling into the abyss\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Residents of a southern city known for its rocket programs are bracing for the impacts of President Donald Trump's executive order to cut the federal workforce.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14401883/Huntsville-Alabama-Trump-cut-federal-workforce.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/15/23/95255661-0-image-a-13_1739662626617.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 00:20:12","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":290931646,"title":"What the papers say – February 16","text":"Increased defence spending and foreign affairs dominate Sunday’s newspaper headlines after the Prime Minister attended a dramatic security summit in Munich.\n\nThe Sunday Times reports Sir Keir Starmer is preparing to overrule Chancellor Rachel Reeves and increase defence spending after the US “piled pressure” on Ukraine to strike a peace deal with Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mail on Sunday focuses on calls from former Army chief Lord Richard Dannatt, who says the Prime Minister needs to increase defence spending “dramatically” to counter the threat of Russia.\n\nAnd the Independent leads on calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who says Europe should unite to form a new common army to guard against Russia.\n\nThe Observer reports French President Emmanuel Macron wants to convene an emergency summit of European leaders, including Sir Keir, amid growing concerns about US President Donald Trump’s attempts to seize control of the Ukraine peace process.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph writes the Government’s Chagos Islands deal has been “plunged into controversy” after the former Mauritian prime minister who orchestrated it was interrogated in a money laundering scandal.\n\nBack on British soil, the Sunday Mirror leads on a former royal aide who murdered her tycoon lover and is now looking after people’s sick pets.\n\nThe Sunday Express splashes on a new poll, which claims just 15% of respondents felt Ms Reeves is doing a good job balancing the nation’s books.\n\nThe Sun on Sunday reveals the latest drama between I’m A Celeb’s Maura Higgins and ex-boyfriend Pete Wicks.\n\nLastly, the Daily Star Sunday says comedian Alan Carr stopped using a Ouija board after a “potty-mouth ghost” questioned his mother’s chastity.","summary":"Here are the biggest stories leading Sunday’s front pages.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/rachel-reeves-keir-starmer-prime-minister-volodymyr-zelensky-army-b1211417.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/16/00/8884ea349c5cf7c771346e20d3a26ad9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM5NzUwMzE4-2.33243397.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 00:10:52","author":"Pa Reporter","authors":["Pa Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.431},{"id":290929984,"title":"DOJ fires 20 immigration judges: Reports","text":"A union president told the Associated Press that the firings included 13 new judges who hadn’t been sworn in yet and five assistant chief immigration judges, while the two others were fired earlier this week.

I think it underscores the fact that we're just regular, middle-class people, just like the people we're trying to serve.\"\n\nHickman was senior litigation counsel for the Division of Enforcement at the CFPB in Washington, D.C. She is one of thousands of mostly new employees known as probationary workers laid off this week across the federal government. Those recent hires had joined the federal workforce within the last one to two years, depending on the agency, and have fewer protections.\n\nHickman was a probationary hire who had been at the CFPB just under two years until Tuesday around 9 p.m., when she saw a termination notice pop up on her phone.\n\n\"It was shocking, frankly -- not just to us but to our direct managers, who had not been told this would happen and received notice of the terminations at the same time we did because they were CC'd,\" Hickman told ABC News.\n\nThe mass layoffs have wreaked havoc on scores of federal employees, including at the Department of Education, the CFPB, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other agencies. Hickman stressed that last Tuesday was surreal because CFPB employees had already been told last weekend that they could not show up to work in person. Her belongings are still inside the bureau.\n\n\"It's really a shock,\" she said, \"especially for a lawyer because we have professional obligations. I have a case that I'm currently litigating for the bureau, and all of a sudden, I'm cut off from our systems, and it's the equivalent of being escorted out of the building and fired. It's just, it's absolutely shocking, especially when there have been no concerns about my performance during my time at the bureau.\"\n\nHickman hasn't been inside the CFPB in over a week since that Friday, Feb. 7, when Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency descended on the CFPB headquarters. That day, Musk posted on X: \"CFPB RIP.\"\n\n\"We're under attack by billionaires, but I'm not a billionaire, so, you know, for me, the next steps are scary. I'm trying to stay focused working productively, but it's a scary moment,\" Hickman said.\n\nHickman said she believes Musk is attempting to \"destroy\" the agency started by Congress. But she and several of her former colleagues vowed to continue fighting, looking into all available legal options, because she said that's what civil servants do.\n\n\"Civil servants do this work to fight for regular Americans,\" she said. \"That's what the job is. That's why it's intended to be insulated from partisan swings. That's why it requires expert people skills and experience, and that's why there are these protections around the jobs. I mean, we are people who go to work every day to fight for regular people.\"\n\nCFPB employs the \"cops on the beat for the financial market,\" according to Hickman. She said her job was critical to safeguarding the public from financial market crashes, loan schemes and hiked interest rates.\n\n\"Donald Trump and Elon Musk can just call their lawyers,\" Hickman said. \"But regular people don't just have a lawyer they can call, and these agencies are intended to fill that gap and to keep people safe. … For me, this was, you know, a calling.\n\n\"It was something that I felt really passionate about doing in this next phase of my career,\" she added. \"I've been in private practice for 15 years before this, and this is just a whole different type of practice -- and one that was incredibly fulfilling for me before I was terminated.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows anything\"\n\nEarlier this week, ABC News spoke to several other federal government probationary employees who had been fired by receiving notices that said: \"The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest.\"\n\nChelsea Wilburn, a disabled veteran, said she was fired on Wednesday from the Department of Education via a memo that \"didn't give any specific reasons as to why\" she was let go.\n\n\"I was definitely upset,\" Wilburn told ABC News. \"I've only ever gotten positive feedback from my team and leadership, so I was pretty surprised to get that email.\"\n\nA former Federal Student Aid probationary hire at the Department of Education received an unexpected call on Wednesday from a supervisor who was on the other line crying. The supervisor told the former probationary employee: \"I'm getting word that you've been terminated.\"\n\nThe person, who spoke with ABC News on the condition of anonymity for fear of it affecting future employment opportunities, said it is \"devastating\" and they don't know where, or when, their next paycheck will come from.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking,\" the former employee said. \"When I went up to my computer, it was already locked down. I couldn't access anything. I'm still trying to reach out to HR to find out, do I get a severance package? What is my health insurance benefits? When does it end?

That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.Nearly all workplace discrimination charges must pass through the EEOC — at least initially — and the agency's decision to drop at least six of the cases raises serious questions about whether its protections will continue to extend to transgender and gender nonconforming people going forward.The EEOC is seeking to dismiss three cases in Illinois as well as one in Alabama, New York and California. In each instance, the original complaints allege discrimination against transgender or gender nonconforming workers. The agency cites Trump's Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \"immutable\" sexes — male and female — as the reason for why it no longer intends to pursue the cases.The Alabama case charged that Harmony Hospitality LLC discriminated against an employee who identifies as a gay nonbinary male by firing him hours after co-owners learned of his gender identity. The New York lawsuit alleged that Boxwood Hotels LLC fired a transgender housekeeper who complained that a supervisor repeatedly misgendered them and made anti-transgender statements, referring to the housekeeper as a \"transformer\" and \"it.\"Another suit alleged that Wendy's franchisee Starboard Group, Inc. subjected three transgender employees to pervasive sexual harassment at a Wendy's restaurant in Carbondale, Illinois, claiming a supervisor demanded to know if one employee had a penis. In another Illinois case, a transgender Reggio's Pizza cashier at Chicago O'Hare International Airport was \"outed\" by her manager, called a racist, homophobic slur by coworkers, and fired when she complained. In southern Illinois, at a hog farm called Sis-Bro, Inc., a coworker allegedly exposed his genitals to a transgender employee and touched her breasts.And in Santa Clara, California, the EEOC charged that a Lush Handmade Cosmetics store manager sexually harassed three gender nonconforming employees with \"offensive physical and verbal sexual conduct.\"Former EEOC General Counsel and Professor and Co-Dean Emeritus at Rutgers Law School David Lopez, who served in the agency for more than 20 years, on Friday said in his experience, the EEOC has never dismissed cases based on substance rather than merit — until now.For the country's anti-discrimination agency \"to discriminate against a group, and say, 'We're not going to enforce the law on their behalf' itself is discrimination, in my view,\" Lopez said. \"It's like a complete abdication of responsibility.\"The EEOC's requests to dismiss the cases come just weeks after Trump dismissed two Democratic commissioners of the five-member EEOC before their terms expired, an unprecedented decision that removed what would have been a major obstacle to his administration efforts to upend interpretation of the nation's civil rights laws. Had the commissioners been allowed to carry out their terms, the EEOC would have had a Democratic majority well into Trump's term. The administration also fired Karla Gilbride as the EEOC's general counsel, replacing her with Andrew Rogers as acting counsel.Shortly after their dismissals, acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, signaled her intent to put the agency's resources behind enforcing Trump's executive order on gender. She announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be \"defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\" Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that \"implicate\" Trump's order should be elevated to headquarters for \"review.\"\"Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,\" Lucas said in her statement. \"Sex is binary (male and female) and immutable. It is not harassment to acknowledge these truths — or to use language like pronouns that flow from these realities, even repeatedly.\" She removed the agency's \"pronoun app,\" which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their Microsoft 365 profiles, among other changes.The EEOC in fiscal year 2023 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, \"the most since the agency started tracking these charges in FY 2013, and up more than 36% from the previous year,\" according to the agency's website, which also provides a link for more information on discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But the information appears to have been removed and the link now leads to a blank page with the message: \"The requested page could not be found.\"Jocelyn Samuels, one of the Democratic EEOC commissioners who was fired last month, said via email that Trump's executive order and the EEOC's response to it \"is truly regrettable.\"\"The Administration's efforts to erase trans people are deeply harmful to a vulnerable community and inconsistent with governing law,\" she said.Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal at LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign, added in an emailed statement: \"This is the inevitable outcome when the EEOC is weaponized to greenlight discrimination against American workers.\"Instead of standing up for the rights of everyone to a workplace free from discrimination, including harassment and bias, the Trump administration is making it abundantly clear they will not protect working people.\"","summary":"The requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eeoc-transgender-discrimination-cases/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/08/21/dda9534c-a427-439a-b8e8-221447a2290f/thumbnail/1200x630/952f1abf04c04a59f54803018255a651/gettyimages-1555232515.jpg?v=f303dc12868a012283443d8b9123e5fe","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3518928_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-02-16 00:00:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":290933832,"title":"Why conservatives are obsessed with phony masculinity","text":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been a leading voice within the Trump administration for purported masculinity. \n\nHegseth, who was chosen by Donald Trump to lead the entire U.S. armed forces because he talked tough as a Fox News pundit, has used his new position to extol the virtues of “warfighters” over soft power as the U.S. military’s approach.\n\nThis principle might have best been demonstrated when Hegseth threw an axe during an episode of “Fox & Friends,” nearly killing a musician.\n\nHegseth has attacked military leadership’s efforts to diversify the ranks, recently saying that the notion that “diversity is our strength” is the “single dumbest phrase in military history.” \n\nHe returned to this theme during his recent trip to the NATO summit in Brussels, telling reporters that “we can talk all we want about values. Values are important. But you can't shoot values.”\n\nTrump has also embraced this “tough guy” ethos for much of his time in the public sphere, from his recently released glowering official portrait—compared to the traditional portraits of former Presidents Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and even George W. Bush—to his repeated arguments that Americans need to be “tough.” \n\nTrump even derided the purported weakness of the entire country with the ableist title of his 2015 book, “Crippled America: How To Make America Great Again.”\n\nWhile campaigning for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, Obama poked fun at Trump and other Republicans for embracing “the fake macho thing.”\n\nBut this has been an issue among Republicans predating Trump. \n\nBush infamously dressed up in a flight suit and landed an aircraft carrier to prematurely—and incorrectly—declare victory in the Iraq War while his father, George H.W. Bush, claimed that victory in the first Gulf War meant that the United States “kicked the Vietnam syndrome.”\n\nBut that isn’t how modern superpowers win wars. Rather, it’s intelligence, coalition building, and strategic planning that end conflicts. \n\nIn World War II, the Allied nations did not simply throw military might at the Axis powers in a pure test of “manly” strength. In fact, until the Allies put together a coherent plan of attack in response to German and Japanese aggression, it was the Axis that had more raw firepower.\n\nOne of the most vital breakthroughs of that conflict didn’t come from the “warfighters” that Hegseth goes on about, but by a team of dedicated codebreakers at Bletchley Park in England.\n\nMathematician Alan Turing led the team that cracked the German “Enigma” code, which then allowed the forces on the ground to engage in a strategic fashion, leading to the liberation of Europe and victory in the war. Turing was gay and later persecuted by the British government for his sexual orientation despite his heroism, echoing the attacks on LGBTQ+ military service members that have been renewed by the Trump administration.\n\nModern military experts—not Fox News pundits—have studied the benefits of diversity in the armed forces, and unlike Hegseth, they know that it’s important. \n\nDartmouth College professor Jason Lyall analyzed the issue, which he wrote about in a 2020 article for the Washington Post.\n\n“My research shows that inclusive armies fight harder, suffer lower rates of desertion and defection, and exhibit more creative problem-solving on complex battlefields than armies drawn from marginalized or repressed groups,” he wrote. “Victory on the battlefield over the past 200 years has usually gone to the most inclusive armies, not the largest or best-equipped ones. Inclusion, in other words, is good for military effectiveness.”\n\nAnd despite Hegseth and Trump’s rhetoric, some of the most significant recent U.S. military victories and security advances have come under the leaders the right has attacked for insufficient masculinity.\n\nOsama bin Laden, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, wasn’t caught because Bush donned his flight suit. Rather, he was apprehended and killed following Obama’s order in 2011.\n\nMany believed that Ukraine would quickly fold when Russia invaded, but Biden stood behind Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Russia has been unable to triumph—though Trump is now pivoting away from that stance.\n\nConservatives like to talk tough, particularly when bolstering the image of straight, white men over women and ethnic minorities. But modern power is more often than not backed by strategic planning, diplomacy, and soft power. It’s what has been used by the United States and other nations in avoiding another calamity like the World Wars, which were tied to the notion that international conflicts were solely the domain of “warfighters.”\n\nBut figures like Hegseth and Trump are locked into the worldview that only people who look like them are legitimate, and everyone else must fall to the wayside. That has historically been the path that leads to unwinnable quagmires, claiming the lives of millions of innocent people.\n\nHistory tells us that this time won’t be any different.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been a leading voice within the Trump administration for purported masculinity. \n\n\n\nHegseth, who was chosen by Donald Trump to lead the entire U.S. armed forces because he talked tough as a Fox News pundit, has used his new position to extol the virtues of “warfighters” over soft power as the U.S. military’s approach.\n\n\n\nThis principle might have best been demonstrated when Hegseth threw an axe during an episode of “Fox &amp; Friends,” nearly killing a musician.\n\n\n\nxHegseth had his first real test on the world stage yesterday. \n\nIt went about as well as his axe throwing career.\n\n— Pat Ryan (@pkryan.bsky.social) 2025-02-13T17:50:58.064Z\n\nHegseth has attacked military leadership’s efforts to diversify the ranks, recently saying that the notion that “diversity is our strength” is the “single dumbest phrase in military","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/2/15/2303779/-Why-conservatives-are-obsessed-with-phony-masculinity?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1398594/story_image/ETR_2.14.png?1739563791","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 00:00:06","author":"Oliver Willis","authors":["Oliver Willis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":290929874,"title":"Indications That Tiffany Trump May Not Be as Close to Donald Trump as She Claims","text":"Although Tiffany Trump spent most of her childhood apart from Donald Trump, she has seemingly worked hard to develop a relationship with him as an adult. Tiffany, the only child from Donald’s scandalous marriage to Marla Maples, wastes no opportunity to praise her dad, often highlighting his strengths as a father. “Thank you for your constant love, guidance and for always believing in me!” she captioned a 2020 Instagram post. However, some signs suggest their bond isn’t as tight as she tries to portray. \n\nDespite the signs, she continues to show up for him. According to Dr. Sanam Hafeez, a New York neuropsychologist and the director of Comprehend the Mind, in an exclusive analysis for Nicki Swift, her loyalty to Donald may have different roots. “A mix of family loyalty, social expectations, and personal motivations could motivate Tiffany Trump’s decision to remain by her father’s side,” she said. Donald wasn’t a big part of Tiffany’s life until 2016, when she joined him on the campaign trail, but Dr. Hafeez reasons that Tiffany likely maintains “the desire to have a good relationship with him.”\n\nHer attempts to get closer to her father worked, but they didn’t last. “They always had a strained relationship her whole life, and it got exacerbated by the presidency,” a source told People. While the reasons are unclear, Donald’s former personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, claimed he avoided being photographed with Tiffany because he had issues with her weight, Politico reported in 2019. He denied it. “I love Tiffany,” he said. Tiffany’s relationship with Donald hasn’t been simple — and it most likely took a toll on her.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; &#013; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Although Tiffany Trump spent most of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Indications That Tiffany Trump May Not Be as Close to Donald Trump as She Claims first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/indications-that-tiffany-trump-may-not-be-as-close-to-donald-trump-as-she-claims/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Signs-Tiffany-Trump-Might-Not-Be-As.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 23:59:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":290929596,"title":"Canada’s position on having Russia back in G7: ‘No way this will happen,’ Joly says","text":"Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly says Canada is firmly opposed to having Russia reinstated in the G7 as U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested.\n\nDuring a news conference at an international security conference in Munich, Germany on Saturday, Joly was asked if she and her international colleagues discussed re-admitting Russia into the group.\n\n“No we didn’t, and I am telling the position of Canada: No way this will happen,” she said.\n\nThe meeting of foreign ministers during the Munich Security Conference was the first one under Canada’s 2025 presidency. Joly also announced she will host her counterparts in Charlevoix, Que., on March 12-14.\n\nRussia used to be part of what was known as the Group of Eight until other members suspended Moscow in 2014 over the invasion of Ukraine that resulted in Russia taking over Crimea.\n\nTrump argued Thursday that Russia should have retained its membership in the group and suggested it could have prevented the full-scale invasion that Moscow launched in February 2022.\n\n“It’s not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia,” Trump said. “I’d love to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out.”\n\nFederal Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre has said Russia should not be let back in.\n\n“Russia’s exclusion from the G7 is every bit as justifiable today,” he posted on X, arguing the Conservatives led the push to exclude Moscow in 2014.\n\nJoly said the G7 remains committed to supporting Ukraine, and that Ukraine and European allies must have a seat at the table for any peace talks to end the war.\n\nDuring a panel discussion on trade at the Munich conference, Joly said Canada’s plan to retaliate if Trump follows through on his threat to slap Canadian goods with across-the-board tariffs has drawn the attention of the Republican administration and fuelled a recent surge in support for the Liberal party.\n\nJoly told European leaders they could learn from Canada’s experiences dealing with Trump.\n\n“So my point to all of you is, we are the canary in the coal mine,” she told the audience. “If the U.S. administration is doing that to Canada, you’re next.”\n\nThe minister said there was a “big change” when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to Trump’s initial threats by saying Canada would impose 25 per cent retaliatory tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. goods and respond swiftly to any steel and aluminum import taxes if they are imposed on Canada.\n\nThe U.S. government immediately took notice when stock markets started “tanking” and American consumers started fretting about the price of gasoline going up, Joly said.\n\n“Ultimately, none of us will change the perceptions of President Trump,” she said. “The only people in the world that will make sure that tariffs are not imposed are the American people themselves. When they understand that this is affecting the (price of) gas at the pump and groceries — they’ll say, ‘enough!'”\n\nJoly said the proposed U.S. tariffs represent an “existential threat” to Canada because they could lead to the elimination of hundreds of thousands of jobs. She said Canada and the European Union should co-ordinate efforts to respond to Trump’s threats.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has already signalled his intention to impose tariffs on the EU, suggesting the economic union continues to take advantage of an imbalanced trading relationship.\n\nIn Munich, Joly suggested Canadians have responded favourably to the Liberal government’s moves, saying the result has been a significant leap in public opinion polls that has largely erased the big lead the Conservatives have enjoyed for the past two years.\n\n“I think our people in Canada reacted so strongly to the fact that we were so strong,” the minister said. “Within a week, we’re nearly at par with the Opposition because Canadians are afraid, are anxious and love the fact that we’re standing strong.”\n\nDuring the panel discussion, U.S. Democratic Senator Andy Kim said Trump sold voters on the idea that U.S tariffs will be “paid for by other people, not the American people.” Kim said Trump is capitalizing on polls suggesting 73 per cent of Americans believe the U.S. loses more than it gains through international trade.\n\nTrump remains vulnerable to backlash because 64 per cent of Americans believe tariffs will raise domestic prices, Kim said, adding that 60 per cent of Americans disapprove of imposing tariffs on European countries.\n\nKim told the audience that European leaders must articulate the harm tariffs will bring to Europe, but also to the United States.\n\n“The person who will ultimately make the decision about this is not ideological about this,” the New Jersey senator said, referring to Trump. “He’s thinking about a political stance, (but) it’s deeply unpopular amongst the American people, and it is perhaps an extraordinary vulnerability on his part.”\n\nWith files from Dylan Robertson in Ottawa.","summary":"Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister says Canada is firmly opposed to allowing Russia to rejoin the G7 (formerly known as the G8) as U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11021226/canadas-position-on-having-russia-back-in-g7-no-way-this-will-happen-joly-says/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Germany-Munich-Security-Conference.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 23:57:45","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Canadian Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.007},{"id":290929888,"title":"“Keir Starmer: Urgent Warning About Security at a ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Moment for Nato’s Future”","text":"Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, raised concerns about the current security situation, describing it as a critical moment that happens only once in a generation. This uncertainty has cast a shadow over the future of Nato.\n\nThe PM vowed to act as a bridge between the US and Europe to try to broker a deal to secure Ukraine’s future and face down Russia.\n\nFrance is set to convene an emergency summit next Monday, bringing together Sir Keir along with other European leaders and the Nato Secretary General to engage in crucial discussions regarding defense.\n\nThe urgency of the situation has been underscored by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s proposal to establish a new European military force to confront Russia’s President Putin. Zelensky stressed the need for this new entity, emphasizing that there is a diminishing reliance on the United States for security protection.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Britain might need to up its defence spending to Cold War levels in this new era of aggression.\n\nSir Keir said: “This is a once-in-a-generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia.\n\n“It’s clear Europe must take on a greater role in Nato as we work with the United States to secure Ukraine’s future and face down the threat we face from Russia.\n\n“The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together.

Former head of the British Army Gen Lord Richard Dannatt said defence spending should be ramped up to three per cent or higher.\n\nHe warned that PM Sir Keir will be consigned to the “bin of history” unless he finds more money for our military.\n\nHe added: “We need to deter Putin in a way we failed to deter Hitler.”\n\nTory former Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: “For too long, we’ve relied on America to shield us while some nations contribute next to nothing.”\n\nBut the answer was not in a Euro Army but in Europe spending more to protect its borders through Nato. “If we don’t wake up now, we’ll sleepwalk into disaster,” he added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, raised concerns about the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Keir Starmer: Urgent Warning About Security at a &#8216;Once-in-a-Generation&#8217; Moment for Nato&#8217;s Future&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/keir-starmer-urgent-warning-about-security-at-a-once-in-a-generation-moment-for-natos-future/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sir-Keir-Starmer-warns-world-faces-‘once-in-a-generation-moment-for-security.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 23:52:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.011},{"id":290930048,"title":"Vile trans migrant is arrested for raping 14-year-old boy in NYC park bathroom","text":"A trans migrant wanted by ICE has been arrested after allegedly stalking and raping a 14-year-old boy in New York City this week. \n\nNicol Suarez, 30, allegedly followed the boy into a bathroom at Thomas Jefferson Park in East Harlem on Tuesday at around midday, police told DailyMail.com. \n\nThe boy reportedly left the bathroom and flagged down witnesses, who called the police, according to a source the New York Post reported. \n\nSuarez was arrested on Wednesday and charged with first-degree rape and stalking, according to police. \n\nOriginally from Colombia, Suarez was also wanted in New Jersey and Massachusetts and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement had a detainer on her, according to the outlet. \n\nHer other charges out-of-state were not immediately available. \n\nA source for the outlet blamed New York City's sanctuary laws for the attack and said: 'ICE could just pick this person up and deport them back, but due to our sanctuary laws we can't do anything.' \n\nSources of the Post said prosecutors initially asked for $500,000 bail and a $1.5 million bond, but the amount was lowered by Democratic Judge Elizabeth Shamahs. Suarez is being held on a $100,000 bail or $250,000 bond. \n\nOnline records show that she is currently being held at Rikers Island and is set to next appear in court on Tuesday. \n\n'I feel really bad for the kid that has to go through this because his life will never be the same,' the source added. \n\n'We worry about the migrants but what about the victim?

I feel bad for him because I'm a mother.' \n\nThe story comes after Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan and Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced a joint effort to crack down on illegal immigration in the city. \n\nOn Fox & Friends on Friday morning, the pair announced an array of policy objectives to help ICE better operate in NYC. \n\nAdams welcomed Homan's help, claiming he has tried to fight the city's immigration-related woes for years, adding 'we need to go after these dangerous people in our streets, and now I have someone that understands that narrative, and we are fighting together to get it done.'\n\nThe friendly duo then shared some initiatives they are planning to help ICE and New York law enforcement get illegal aliens out of town despite roadblocks put up by the city council.\n\nThe city's most famous jail, Rikers Island, will now host ICE agents who can collaborate with NYPD to identify dangerous criminals, the pair announced.\n\n'As I sat down with Tom earlier, I said that we're going to look at all the legalese,' Adams said of reestablishing an ICE office at Rikers.\n\n'I'm able to do an executive order to put them back on Rikers Island where they should be with part of our criminal justice apparatus,' the Democrat shared.\n\nHoman lauded the mayor for reestablishing the ICE office.\n\n'Getting back in Rikers Island is a game changer,' the border czar said.\n\n'Not only will we get the bad guys when they hit the street, the intelligence of how TDA operates, where they're operating, all this intelligence they gather at Rikers we'll have access to,' Homan added.","summary":"A trans migrant wanted by ICE has been arrested after allegedly stalking and raping a 14-year-old boy in New York City this week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14401887/trans-migrant-arrested-rape-boy-NYC-park-nicol-suarez.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/15/23/95255889-0-Nicol_Suarez_30_allegedly_followed_the_boy_into_a_bathroom_at_Th-a-12_1739660579354.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 23:49:44","author":"Editor,Lauren Acton-Taylor","authors":["Editor","Lauren Acton-Taylor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.619},{"id":290925968,"title":"Ukraine not invited to Russia-US talks – Zelensky","text":"Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has confirmed that Kiev was not invited to discussions between delegations from Washington and Moscow, which are expected to take place in Saudi Arabia next week.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump spoke by phone on Wednesday, marking their first known direct conversation since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. On Saturday, the countries’ top diplomats followed up with a call to discuss “preparations for a potential high-level Russian-American summit.”\n\nMoscow has yet to confirm any details, but according to multiple media reports, a US delegation – likely composed of national security advisers – will travel to Saudi Arabia in the coming days for talks with their Russian counterparts.\n\n“Maybe there is something at the table, but not on our table. I didn’t see any invitations, invoices, et cetera, for Ukraine to meet with some other…,” Zelensky told journalists on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.\n\n“We don’t have any papers, any invitations,” he reiterated. “And it’s something strange for me to speak in this case, in this format, if before we don’t have any negotiations between us and our strategic partners.”\n\nThe Ukrainian side was “neither invited to, nor informed about” the upcoming US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, Fox News reporter Nana Sajaia said earlier in the day, citing an unnamed senior Ukrainian official. According to Politico, there are also “no plans for representatives from other major European powers to join the talks,” while Bloomberg reported that European officials had not even been notified.\n\nKiev and its Western backers, including the previous US administration, have long insisted that no discussions about Ukraine’s future should take place without its direct participation. Following his call with Putin on Wednesday, Trump phoned Zelensky “to inform him of the conversation” with the Russian leader. The Ukrainian leader allegedly told Trump that he, just “like President Putin, wants to make PEACE.”\n\nAddressing attendees at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Zelensky reiterated that he was “not going to meet with Russians.”\n\n“I will meet with one Russian only – with Putin,” he stated, stressing that he would sit down with the Russian leader to “stop the war” only after Ukraine, the US, and the EU had devised a “common plan.”\n\nLast month, Putin stated that while it is “possible to negotiate with anyone,” Zelensky no longer has the legitimacy to override his own decree banning talks with the Russian president. Zelensky’s presidential term expired in May 2024, but he has refused to hold elections, citing martial law. The Kremlin has stressed that any potential peace agreement between Moscow and Kiev must be legally binding.\n\nTrump has also acknowledged that Kiev will eventually have to hold elections and noted that Zelensky might not serve another term, saying his domestic poll numbers “aren’t particularly great, to put it mildly.”","summary":"Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has confirmed that Kiev was not invited to discussions between Washington and Moscow in Saudi Arabia \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/612798-ukraine-not-invited-zelensky/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.02/article/67b1266b2030273a6e62ba24.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 23:43:18","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":290932144,"title":"Blake Lively's legal team says Justin Baldoni is 'afraid to produce receipts' after she filed subpoenas","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Feb 16th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: Lily Allen's husband David Harbour, 49, has a new model girlfriend 22 years his junior - as friends reveal 'very upset' singer is convinced the relationship started before marriage broke down\n\nTrump envoy sparks fury as 'Europe is excluded' from Ukraine-Russia peace talks: Macron calls emergency summit\n\nElon Musk, 53, could 'keep fathering children for another 30 years in bid to repopulate the Earth' - as MAGA influencer claims she has had his THIRTEENTH kid\n\nHeartbreaking new details of Caroline Flack's desperate final hours... and why friends fear 'blame game' will tear open old wounds: KATIE HIND\n\n'We're sick of Downing Street': Labour ministers lift the lid on the brutal civil war raging in No10 as one whispers 'we're about to commit electoral suicide': DAN HODGES\n\nCaptive British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman's haunting post about 'ignoring advice' to travel to Iran as 'we believe that most people are good' - as desperate family say they are in 'distressing situation'\n\n'Grinning' Syrian man, 23, 'stabs 14-year-old boy to death and wounds four others in knife rampage' in Austria\n\nAt 66, I don't think I've ever had sex sober - now I'm trapped in a dry hotel in Turkey (with little prospect of a kiss, much less anything else): LIZ JONES\n\nMeghan and Harry spent staggering sum on Democratic Party operatives including 'disinformation guru'\n\nWe couldn't wait to start our new life in Australia - until a routine health check put us through five years of hell: British family warns of little-known rule that could turn your Down Under dream into a nightmare\n\n'Beautiful' periodic home slammed as 'sterile' and 'soulless' - just wait until you see the inside\n\nLiam Payne asked me to be his best man.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JACQUELINE LINDENBERG and SONIA HORON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:32 GMT, 15 February 2025 |Updated:23:41 GMT, 15 February 2025 \n\nBlake Lively's legal team claimed that Justin Baldoni is 'afraid to produce receipts' after she sent subpoenas to cell carriers this week amid their ongoing lawsuit drama. \nIn response, Baldoni's lawyer Mitchell Schuster filed a letter on Friday to U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman and labeled the recent subpoenas as 'flagrantly overboard,' per People. \nThe actor's attorney further stated that the Gossip Girl alum, 37, and her husband Ryan Reynolds 'are not the FBI.' \nThe legal battle began when Lively accused Justin — whom she worked with on It Ends With Us — of sexual assault and launching a smear campaign against her in December 2024. He responded by filing a $400 million lawsuit against Blake. \nIn regards to the letter, a spokesperson for Lively referenced Justin's other lawyer Bryan Freedman alleging they have 'receipts' that would back up claims that she was a 'bully.' \n'If they have so many receipts why are they so afraid to produce them,' they told People. \n\nBlake Lively's, 37, legal team claimed that Justin Baldoni, 41, is 'afraid to produce receipts' after she sent subpoenas to cell carriers this week amid their ongoing lawsuit drama; seen in 2024 in London\n\nIn response, Baldoni's lawyer Mitchell Schuster filed a letter on Friday to U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman and labeled the recent subpoenas as 'flagrantly overboard,' per People; seen in 2024 in NYC\nThe spokesperson also mentioned Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios and added, 'Mr. Baldoni and the Wayfarer parties have already admitted that Ms. Lively raised concerns multiple times.'\n'They have admitted that they created a plan in case she \"made her grievances public,\" in which they planned to plant stories suggesting Ms. Lively was a \"bully\" and \"weaponizing feminism.\" They have admitted that they were able to \"bury\" anyone.'\n'They have admitted that they bragged and laughed at how negatively the narrative had shifted against Ms. Lively, and how successful they were at \"confusing\" people.' \nBlake's spokesperson continued, 'They have admitted that they said they \"started to see a shift on social, due largely to [Jed Wallace, an independent contractor] and his team’s efforts to shift the narrative,\" yet they deny that they implemented their plan.'\n'Now they want to block the very discovery that would expose them. If they didn't do it, they would have nothing to hide.' \nIn the letter filed by Baldoni's attorney Mitchell Shuster on Friday, he slammed the subpoenas by Lively. \n'It is hard to overstate how broad, invasive, and atypical these Subpoenas truly are. This is civil litigation, not a criminal prosecution, and the Lively Parties [Lively and Reynolds] are not the FBI.' \nHe added that the subpoenas — which were sent to AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon — could disclose 'the complete call and text history of each of the targets.' \n\n'If they have so many receipts why are they so afraid to produce them,' they told People; seen above in It Ends With Us\n\n'It is hard to overstate how broad, invasive, and atypical these Subpoenas truly are. This is civil litigation, not a criminal prosecution, and the Lively Parties [Lively and Reynolds] are not the FBI,' Baldoni's lawyer said; seen in 2024 in NYC \nHowever, it could also reveal legally protected information as well as location data and web browser history. \nOther defendants were included in the subpoenas, including publicists Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel, and also Wayfarer's Steve Sarowitz and Jamey Heath. \n\nEXCLUSIVE Justin Baldoni issues retort after Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' Hollywood agent mocked his name \nSchuster stated that the subpoenas are 'wildly disproportionate to the needs of the case.' \n'And unnecessarily invades the privacy of untold numbers of third parties, including family, friends, business partners, and — quite literally — any other person with whom any of the targets have communicated with over a period of years.' \nBaldoni's lawyer further labeled the subpoenas as a 'media ploy' and asked the judge to look into the issue 'at the soonest possible opportunity.'\nThis week, it was revealed that Blake sent subpoenas to cell carriers AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon as she looks for more 'receipts' amid the ongoing legal battle. \nHer lawyers also sent subpoenas to two internet providers, Cloudflare and AOL, as well as to Jed Wallace, a crisis consultant accused of launching a 'digital army' against the actress on Baldoni's behalf. \nWallace has denied the allegations and recently filed a $7 million defamation suit against Lively.\n'Ms. Lively has initiated discovery that will expose the people, tactics, and methods that have worked to \"destroy\" and \"bury\" her reputation and family over the past year,' her attorneys, Esra Hudson and Michael Gottlieb, shared with Deadline on Wednesday.\n\nBaldoni's lawyer further labeled the subpoenas as a 'media ploy' and asked the judge to look into the issue 'at the soonest possible opportunity'; seen in December 2024 in NYC\n'We will now receive all of the \"receipts\" that, unsurprisingly, are nowhere to be found on Mr. Freedman’s website, and like Ms. Lively, those \"receipts\" will have their day in court,' they added, in reference to Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, and the website thelawsuitinfo.com, outlining Baldoni's version of events.\nSpeaking of well-known PR guru, Jed, Lively’s spokesperson stated, 'We look forward to investigating more about Jed Wallace’s entire business model and what else he was doing to distract from the very real sexual harassment and retaliation claims made by Ms. Lively.'\n'We are delighted to be able to start discovery on it,' the spokesperson added.\nHer rep also noted that Wallace's involvement was detailed in messages the team had already obtained, where Baldoni's team allegedly gloated about how easily the public was swayed to dislike her. \nThe New York Times published text messages Lively cited as evidence. Baldoni responded by claiming the published messages were incomplete and released what he alleged were the full exchanges in a lawsuit against the NYT in early January.\nFurther messages were included in a subsequent lawsuit against Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds.\nEarlier this month, the filmmaker published a website that his legal team alleged had all of the 'receipts' for his and Lively's court battle.\nLively alleges that Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios hired Crisis PR chief Melissa Nathan to discredit any accusations she might make about his behavior on the set of It Ends With Us. \n\nThis week, it was revealed that Blake sent subpoenas to cell carriers AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon as she looks for more 'receipts' amid the ongoing legal battle; seen in 2024 in NYC \n\nEarlier this month, the filmmaker published a website that his legal team alleged had all of the 'receipts' for his and Lively's court battle; seen in 2023 in NYC \nHer TAG firm allegedly then employed Wallace to run an online smear campaign against Lively, damaging her reputation and the launch of her new product line.\nNathan and publicist Jennifer Abel acknowledged planning a strategy for their client, but claim they never implemented it because public opinion turned against Lively organically.\nThe texts included in Lively's original complaint appear to show the moment-to-moment breakdown of how Baldoni and his PR team discussed her.\nHis publicity team, according to a strategy document for Baldoni that Lively filed with her complaint, identified 'several potential scenarios at play here which we should be prepared for, should [Lively] and her team make her grievances public.'\nBaldoni — who served as director and starred as Ryle Kincaid, the partner of Lively's character Lily Bloom in It Ends With Us — has refuted the claims of orchestrating a smear campaign through his lawyer.\n'It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \"fix\" her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film,' he said.\n'Interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions.'\nAt the beginning of the month Baldoni launched his own website dedicated to defending himself against Lively's sexual harassment allegations.\nIn an attempt to share his side of the story, the actor, who is seeking to offer transparency to the public amid his legal battle, shared a website containing his amended complaint and a timeline of relevant events related to the case.\n\nThe texts included in Lively's original complaint appear to show the moment-to-moment breakdown of how Baldoni and his PR team discussed her\nThe decision to publish the site came after the star amended his $400 million suit accusing Lively of giving The New York Times advance access to her sexual harassment complaint.\nHis attorney told DailyMail.com that Baldoni's amended his lawsuit due 'to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light.'\n'This fresh evidence corroborates what we knew all along, that due to purely egotistical reasons Ms. Lively and her entire team colluded for months to destroy reputations through a complex web of lies, false accusations and the manipulation of illicitly received communications,' Freedman continued.\nHe concluded: 'The ongoing public interest in this case online has ironically shed light on the undeniable facts pertaining to The New York Times and how heavily Ms. Lively and her representatives were not only deeply involved in the attempted take down and smear campaign of Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and their teams but that they themselves initiated it.'\nThe list of Lively's grievances against Baldoni is a long one, but the most damning of all is her claim that he sexually harassed her while filming It Ends With Us with unwanted kissing, talking about his sex life and trying to insert gratuitous raunchy scenes into the script.\nAfter Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni in January, he quickly filed a $400million countersuit against Blake, her husband Ryan and their publicist Leslie Sloane over claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.\nAmongst the pages of documents, emails and text messages he recently shared on his website is an intriguing set of handwritten notes made by Baldoni during his meeting with the film's intimacy coordinator which may well prove to be the key to the whole case.\n\nHis attorney told DailyMail.com that Baldoni's amended his lawsuit due 'to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light'; seen in 2024 in L.A. \nLively has painted a picture whereby there was no intimacy coordinator involved in the production until she demanded one; Baldoni introduced unwanted kissing in intimate scenes, and he spoke to her about his own sex life.\nHowever, his timeline appears to show that there was in fact an intimacy coordinator engaged from the outset, who Lively declined to meet until filming began. \nThis ultimately resulted in Baldoni, who was also the director, having to convey the intimacy coordinator's notes to Lively himself.\nBaldoni, Lively, and Reynolds are scheduled to go to trial in New York on March 29, 2026. \nJustin Baldoni\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively's legal team says Justin Baldoni is 'afraid to produce receipts' after she filed subpoenas\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nRevealed: Lily Allen's husband David Harbour, 49, has a new model girlfriend 22 years his junior \n\nMaura Higgins takes a brutal swipe at 'cheating' ex Pete Wicks during Valentine's Day night out as she addresses split for first time\n\nWho won the Masked Singer?

We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face.’\n\nFrance’s President Emmanuel Macron is expected to gather European counterparts and Nato secretary general Mark Rutte for the crisis talks.\n\nIt comes after Mr Trump’s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, suggested on Saturday that European leaders would be sidelined from negotiations on a peace deal, heightening concerns on the continent about the possible appeasement of Mr Putin.\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested a new European army might be needed in future if the US cannot be relied on to guarantee the security of the continent.\n\nIn his keynote speech, Mr Zelensky said ‘we can’t rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it’.\n\nMr Zelensky said: ‘A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin.

That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.\n\nNearly all workplace discrimination charges must pass through the EEOC — at least initially — and the agency’s decision to drop at least six of the cases raises serious questions about whether its protections will continue to extend to transgender and gender nonconforming people going forward.\n\nThe EEOC is seeking to dismiss three cases in Illinois as well as one in Alabama, New York and California. In each instance, the original complaints allege discrimination against transgender or gender nonconforming workers. The agency cites Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two “immutable” sexes — male and female — as the reason for why it no longer intends to pursue the cases.\n\nThe Alabama case charged that Harmony Hospitality LLC discriminated against an employee who identifies as a gay nonbinary male by firing him hours after co-owners learned of his gender identity. The New York lawsuit alleged that Boxwood Hotels LLC fired a transgender housekeeper who complained that a supervisor repeatedly misgendered them and made anti-transgender statements, referring to the housekeeper as a “transformer” and “it.”\n\nAnother suit alleged that Wendy’s franchisee Starboard Group, Inc. subjected three transgender employees to pervasive sexual harassment at a Wendy’s restaurant in Carbondale, Illinois, claiming a supervisor demanded to know if one employee had a penis. In another Illinois case, a transgender Reggio’s Pizza cashier at Chicago O’Hare International Airport was “outed” by her manager, called a racist, homophobic slur by coworkers, and fired when she complained. In southern Illinois, at a hog farm called Sis-Bro, Inc., a coworker allegedly exposed his genitals to a transgender employee and touched her breasts.\n\nAnd in Santa Clara, California, the EEOC charged that a Lush Handmade Cosmetics store manager sexually harassed three gender nonconforming employees with “offensive physical and verbal sexual conduct.”\n\nFormer EEOC General Counsel and Professor and Co-Dean Emeritus at Rutgers Law School David Lopez, who served in the agency for more than 20 years, on Friday said in his experience, the EEOC has never dismissed cases based on substance rather than merit — until now.\n\nFor the country’s anti-discrimination agency “to discriminate against a group, and say, ‘We’re not going to enforce the law on their behalf’ itself is discrimination, in my view,” Lopez said. “It’s like a complete abdication of responsibility.”\n\nThe EEOC’s requests to dismiss the cases come just weeks after Trump dismissed two Democratic commissioners of the five-member EEOC before their terms expired, an unprecedented decision that removed what would have been a major obstacle to his administration efforts to upend interpretation of the nation’s civil rights laws. Had the commissioners been allowed to carry out their terms, the EEOC would have had a Democratic majority well into Trump’s term. The administration also fired Karla Gilbride as the EEOC’s general counsel, replacing her with Andrew Rogers as acting counsel.\n\nShortly after their dismissals, acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, signaled her intent to put the agency’s resources behind enforcing Trump’s executive order on gender. She announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be “defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.” Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that “implicate” Trump’s order should be elevated to headquarters for “review.”\n\n“Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,” Lucas said in her statement. “Sex is binary (male and female) and immutable. It is not harassment to acknowledge these truths — or to use language like pronouns that flow from these realities, even repeatedly.” She removed the agency’s “pronoun app,” which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their Microsoft 365 profiles, among other changes.\n\nThe EEOC in fiscal year 2023 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, “the most since the agency started tracking these charges in FY 2013, and up more than 36% from the previous year,” according to the agency’s website, which also provides a link for more information on discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But the information appears to have been removed and the link now leads to a blank page with the message: “The requested page could not be found.”\n\nJocelyn Samuels, one of the Democratic EEOC commissioners who was fired last month, said via email that Trump’s executive order and the EEOC’s response to it “is truly regrettable.”\n\n“The Administration’s efforts to erase trans people are deeply harmful to a vulnerable community and inconsistent with governing law,” she said.\n\nSarah Warbelow, vice president of legal at LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign, added in an emailed statement: “This is the inevitable outcome when the EEOC is weaponized to greenlight discrimination against American workers.\n\n“Instead of standing up for the rights of everyone to a workplace free from discrimination, including harassment and bias, the Trump administration is making it abundantly clear they will not protect working people.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

not be on Trump's menu","text":"Donald Trump loves tariffs.\n\n\"I always say tariffs is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,\" he told crowds after his inauguration.\n\n\"Those tariffs are going to make us rich as hell.\"\n\nWhen announcing reciprocal tariffs this week, he was asked by a journalist if prices would go up for American consumers.\n\n\"Not necessarily, but I'll tell you what will go up is jobs,\" the president replied.\n\n\"This [tariffs] is something that should have been done many years ago.\n\nBut Donald Trump also loves hamburgers and would understand the political importance of keeping burger prices affordable.\n\nPerhaps that's why Australia's cattle industry is quietly confident of having another strong year of beef exports to the US.\n\nA record 2024\n\nLast year Australia exported a record 1.34 million tonnes of beef around the world.\n\nThe biggest customer was the US which took 394,716 tonnes, up 60 per cent on the previous year, and valued at $4.37 billion according to Meat and Livestock Australia.\n\nThis year is again off to a strong start, with 25,809 tonnes exported to the US last month, up 22 per cent from January 2024.\n\nThe size of the US cattle herd has fallen to its lowest level since 1951 because of drought, and the price of ground beef in the US — a key ingredient for those famous hamburgers — is on the rise.\n\nReasons to be confident\n\nThe chief executive of the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, Will Evans, spoke to ABC Landline from Washington DC this week.\n\nHe has been touring the US and said he was optimistic about the year ahead for trade.\n\n\"We're sending a lean product that they call trimmings, which they use to make hamburgers.\n\n\"Our product gets blended with their product and it enables a better product to be served to the consumer.\n\n\"I think if we can continue positive dialogue and relationships with our American counterparts and reinforce the message that 'our product doesn't compete with yours, it enables yours', then we can benefit.\"\n\nMr Evans said cattle and beef prices in the US seemed to be at record highs across the board after years of drought.\n\nHe said weather conditions in Australia would now play a big factor in whether exports to the US would reach similar heights to last year.\n\nPressure on Trump\n\nEven though cattle prices are soaring for US producers, there are some industry groups pressuring the president to force his love of tariffs onto Australian beef imports.\n\nOn social media, lobby group R-Calf USA wrote: \"In 2024 we imported nearly 1 billion pounds of beef from Australia, but we exported only about 1 million pounds to them\".\n\n\"We need tariffs and tariff rate quotas on these countries to ensure they cannot continually displace our American farmers and ranchers,\" it said.\n\nBut is Australian beef \"displacing\" American product?\n\nAs Daryl Peel, from Oklahoma State University, explained to The Farm Ranch Guide, \"some products we just don't make enough of, so we import and one item that is imported to the US is lean beef\".\n\n\"We don't produce enough lean beef to keep up with the fat trimmings from our fed cattle so it can be turned into ground beef,\" Dr Peel said. \n\nSo the numbers suggest it would make sense for the US to keep up its volumes of lean beef imports, especially in the short term.\n\nAustralia is ready to supply.\n\nBut Trump loves tariffs.\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm on Sunday or on ABC iview.","summary":"Donald Trump loves tariffs, but he also loves

crimes' refuses to step down amid sex assault probe","text":"The British chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is defying pressure from senior colleagues to step aside amid a probe into sexual misconduct allegations, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Well-placed sources have told this newspaper that Karim Khan KC, the controversial barrister seeking the arrest of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is ignoring direct pleas from three of his highest-ranking colleagues who say he should withdraw from his role immediately.\n\nMr Khan, 54, announced his war crimes case against Israel in May just two weeks after being told that a female lawyer at the International Criminal Court (ICC) had made serious allegations of sexual misconduct against him.\n\nAn external investigation was launched six months later in November and was understood at the time to be examining allegations that Mr Khan groped the woman in his office and 'sexually touched' her while on a work trip, which he has strenuously denied.\n\nThe MoS has since been told that the complaint also includes other serious allegations of sexual misconduct. It comes amid a crisis for the ICC, and for Mr Khan himself, who last week was banned from entering the United States by Donald Trump as part of an executive order sanctioning court officials.\n\nNow the MoS has been told that three of Mr Khan's senior colleagues have told him he should take a leave of absence while the investigation into his conduct goes on.\n\nThey are said to include American lawyer Brenda Hollis, the leader of the ICC's Palestine investigation, who stood at Mr Khan's side when he controversially announced that he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nInsiders claim there is mounting anger within the ICC at Mr Khan's refusal to step aside and over the way the sexual misconduct investigation, which is being led by a UN body named the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), is being handled.\n\nLast night one ICC source said: '[Mr Khan] has been asked to step aside by senior management and he is just refusing to do it. That's been happening for a while. Almost all of his senior management have told him he should step aside and he just adamantly refuses.'\n\nAnother said: 'It was being recommended that he take a leave of absence even when the investigation was being set up, and I think there's increasing pressure now but he is still deciding not to go ahead with it.'\n\nThe MoS has discovered that, since he was elected in 2021 for a nine-year term, Mr Khan has personally decided that at least five ICC staff members should be suspended from duty when separate allegations of misconduct were made against them and before they had been investigated.\n\nCourt insiders also claim that the alleged victim has been subject to a vicious smear campaign in recent months. Multiple sources said that a small group of ICC officials have been spreading grotesque and baseless rumours about her motives in what is thought to be an attempt to discredit and silence her. The MoS has chosen not to repeat the unsubstantiated rumours.\n\n'A lot of staff have been very supportive,' one source said. 'But then there are some people that are in key positions who are actively working to undermine her credibility and to dismiss her allegations.'\n\nSome at the ICC fear that the controversy, coupled with the new threat from President Trump, is placing the court's entire future in peril.\n\n'The sad thing is, it is just going to bring the court into disrepute in terms of how long it's going to take,' a source said. 'Someone obviously at some point is going to look into how the institution as a whole handled it, and it's not going to be good.'\n\nLawyers representing Mr Khan last night said that previous investigations into elected ICC officials have not required those officials to step aside, while the move to suspend other non-elected staff members during investigations 'involved materially different circumstances'.\n\nMr Khan's lawyers added: 'Mr Khan's decision not to step aside was made following extensive consultations with current and former elected officials, as well as senior staff.'\n\nWhen the allegations were first reported in October, Mr Khan said: 'There is no truth to suggestions of such misconduct. I have worked in diverse contexts for 30 years and there has never been such a complaint lodged against me by anyone.'\n\nThe ICC declined to comment.","summary":"The British chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan KC (pictured), is defying pressure from colleagues to step aside amid a sexual assault probe.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14401701/UK-lawyer-called-Netanyahu-arrested-war-crimes-refuses-step-aside-sex-assault-probe.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/15/21/95253873-0-image-m-34_1739655238109.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 23:16:46","author":"Daisy Graham-Brown,Editor,Mark Hookham","authors":["Daisy Graham-Brown","Editor","Mark Hookham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":290924660,"title":"Sir Keir Starmer warns world faces ‘once-in-a-generation moment’ for security as Nato future plunged into doubt","text":"SIR Keir Starmer last night warned the world faces a “once-in-a-generation moment” for security as the very future of Nato has been plunged into doubt.\n\nThe PM vowed to act as a bridge between the US and Europe to try to broker a deal to secure Ukraine’s future and face down Russia.\n\nFrance is holding an emergency summit as early as Monday, where Sir Keir will join European leaders and the Nato Secretary General for crunch defence talks.\n\nIt comes after Volodymyr Zelensky called for the creation of a new European army to defeat Putin’s Russia, as he warned they can no longer rely on the US for protection.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Britain might need to up its defence spending to Cold War levels in this new era of aggression.\n\nSir Keir said: “This is a once-in-a-generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia.\n\n“It’s clear Europe must take on a greater role in Nato as we work with the United States to secure Ukraine’s future and face down the threat we face from Russia.\n\n“The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together.

He believes Britain can bring the US and Europe together to ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty is secured.\n\nThe PM will relay messages from the France summit to Mr Trump.\n\nHe will then return for another summit with Europe and Mr Zelensky where he will relay President Trump’s response.\n\nIn a blistering speech, Mr Zelensky said the “old days” of Europe relying on American military might to protect them “are over”.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader’s comments, in front of a stunned audience of world leaders in Munich, piled more pressure on Britain and Europe to ramp up -military spending.\n\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference, Mr Zelensky said Europe had entered a new chapter in history and must take responsibility for its military defence.\n\nHe said: “As we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the Armed Forces of Europe so that Europe’s future depends only on Europeans, and decisions about Europe are made in Europe.”\n\nThe new US administration has told Europe it must start paying for its own defence after decades of under-investment.\n\nThe UK only spends 2.3 per cent of GDP on defence and will “set out a path” to hit 2.5 per cent within the next few months.\n\nGovernment sources said the plan was to hit 2.5 per cent by 2032.\n\nBut senior figures are urging the PM to spend more.\n\nWe need to deter Putin in a way we failed to deter Hitler.Lord Richard Dannatt\n\nHinting at the row, Mr Lammy told the conference: “All of us as foreign ministers have had detailed conversations with our Treasury departments.\n\n\"One of the messages we are deadly serious about is if Ukraine were to fail the costs would be considerably more.”\n\nHe pointed out countries were spending around seven per cent of GDP on defence in the Cold War. Former head of the British Army Gen Lord Richard Dannatt said defence spending should be ramped up to three per cent or higher.\n\nHe warned that PM Sir Keir will be consigned to the “bin of history” unless he finds more money for our military.\n\nHe added: “We need to deter Putin in a way we failed to deter Hitler.”\n\nTory former Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: “For too long, we’ve relied on America to shield us while some nations contribute next to nothing.”\n\nBut the answer was not in a Euro Army but in Europe spending more to protect its borders through Nato. “If we don’t wake up now, we’ll sleepwalk into disaster,” he added.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/33400577/keir-starmer-world-security-nato-future/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/crop-33401016.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 23:00:44","author":"Kate Ferguson","authors":["Kate Ferguson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.02},{"id":290923072,"title":"Prince Harry facing fresh visa row blow amid judge's ruling after Trump's dig","text":"Prince Harry could face a fresh blow in his US visa row following the latest ruling by a judge. \n\n Earlier this month, a judge hinted that he is open to the possibility of releasing some of the sealed documents from Harry's US visa application. The long-running legal case was sparked when conservative Washington DC think tank The Heritage Foundation questioned why the Duke of Sussex was allowed into the US in 2020 after he admitted in his book Spare taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms. \n\nThe think tank has argued that Harry either received special treatment from the Biden administration or had lied on his immigration forms. Several weeks ago, Judge Carl Nichols told a hearing in Washington DC that he wanted \"maximum disclosure as long as it doesn't violate privacy.\"\n\nAnd now court documents reveal that the judge has now set a date for next Thursday (February 20) for the US government to state which legal documents related to the case can be disclosed. After that, the judge says \"the Court will determine what portions of those materials can be produced to Heritage\".\n\n The ruling also comes just days after US President Donald Trump publicly spoke out about the case saying he would not deport Harry. But in a brutal dig at Meghan, he added: \"I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.\" \n\nUS visa applications specifically ask the individual about current and past drug use, which can have a detrimental impact on the progress of the application. Prolific drug use can lead to applications being rejected, however, immigration officers use their discretion against a range of factors.\n\nIn a previous hearing for the case in September, a judge ruled that the public did not have a strong interest in disclosure of the duke’s immigration records, but the Heritage Foundation is asking for the judgment to be changed. The organisation originally brought the lawsuit against the Department for Homeland Security (DHS) after a Freedom of Information Act request was rejected, with the think tank claiming it was of \"immense public interest\".\n\nIn his controversial memoir, the duke said cocaine \"didn’t do anything for me\", adding: \"Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.\" The Heritage Foundation’s lawsuit argued that US law \"generally renders such a person inadmissible for entry\" to the country.\n\nThe think tank also said answers on the duke’s prior drug use in his visa application should have been disclosed as they could raise questions over the US government’s integrity. In the DHS’s response to the legal claim, it said: \"Much like health, financial, or employment information, a person’s immigration information is private personal information.\"\n\n The submissions previously made by lawyer John Bardo on behalf of DHS also said no \"publicly available information, shows that Prince Harry was ever convicted for a drug-related offence\". Mr Bardo added that any suggestion from the Heritage Foundation of wrongdoing on behalf of the US government was \"purely speculative\".","summary":"Prince Harry's US visa is currently at the centre of a long-running legal case after a US-based conservative think tank questioned why he was allowed into the US in 2020after he admitted in his book Spare to taking drugs","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/prince-harry-facing-fresh-visa-34687183","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34687197.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Invictus-Games-Vancouver-Whistler.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 22:57:57","author":"Jennifer Newton","authors":["Jennifer Newton"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":290922140,"title":"Trump and Musk claim the media is trying to drive them apart in Fox News interview","text":"President Donald Trump and Elon Musk told Fox News host Sean Hannity that they believe media outlets are trying to drive a wedge between them.\n\nTrump and the world’s richest man, who is spearheading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s sweeping layoffs across the federal workforce, sat down with Hannity last week in an interview that will air on the network Tuesday.\n\nIn a preview, Hannity tells them that the media — namely The New York Times, The Washington Post, and late-night variety shows, according to the Fox anchor — “want you two to start hating each other.”\n\n“They want a divorce,” Hannity said. “And they try all, ‘President Elon Musk’, for example.

As a global player, China has a crucial role to play in achieving peace,” Yermak said. “The Chinese foreign minister expressed confidence that Ukraine must be a party to any peace negotiations, just as Europe’s participation in them is also essential.”\nThe latter statement comes amid moves from US President Donald Trump to negotiate directly with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to end the near-three-year war.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump’s Ukraine special envoy Keith Kellogg said European leaders would not be involved in peace talks, amid concern from Kyiv and its supporters about whether Ukraine would be involved on an equal footing with Russia.\n“It may be like chalk on the blackboard. It may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest,” Kellogg told the Munich summit.\n“And to my European friends, I would say: ‘Get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending.’”\nOn Friday, Wang told Kaja Kallas, the EU’s top diplomat, that he “supports Europe’s important role in the peace talks process”, drawing a sharp contrast with Kellogg’s statement.\nLate on Saturday, the Financial Times reported that US and Russian officials would meet in Saudi Arabia next week in a bid to start negotiations about settling the conflict, which was launched by a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier on Saturday to prepare for the meeting, the FT reported. This comes after Trump and Putin last week spoke to confirm they would start negotiations “immediately”.\nChina’s role in the situation is unclear, but Beijing has said since the war’s outset that it supports a negotiated settlement.\nWhile parts of Europe have remained critical of China’s close ties with Russia, Ukraine’s leaders have kept their counsel, and have been largely reluctant to criticise China. According to European diplomatic sources, Kyiv has expected that eventually, the Asian giant could play a role given its large influence over Russia.\nFurthermore, Ukraine officials see China as the leader of the “global south” and essential to whipping up support for future agreements at the United Nations.\n“We reaffirmed our mutual respect for the territorial integrity of both Ukraine and China as the foundation of Ukrainian-Chinese bilateral relations,” Yermak wrote after the meeting.\n\n“We positively noted the intensification of political dialogue between Ukraine and China in 2024 and discussed the possibility of further high-level contacts. We also discussed the development of bilateral relations and trade. China remains one of Ukraine’s largest trading partners,” he added.\nIn a blog post published on Saturday evening, the former Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis added to speculation about Beijing’s role in the war’s resolution, writing that “China could win the war against Ukraine without firing a shot”.\n“If the US and Europe don’t offer security to Ukraine, China might step into the gap, using its leverage on Russia. They could even offer a better deal than Trump’s,” wrote Landsbergis, who was known for his hawkish stance on Beijing during his time in office.\n“Ukraine has a lot to offer to China in return for security—rebuilding, ports, agricultural produce. There will be those in Europe who will support this. This gambit could be called a ‘Kissinger’, splitting the US and Europe as Kissinger split the Soviet Union and China,” he continued.","summary":"Top diplomats from Beijing and Kyiv met in Munich, as three-year war appears to be moving into a new stage.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3298860/ukraine-says-china-has-crucial-role-play-achieving-peace","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/16/832b012b-584f-4464-b9ab-7a6ce99813af_f048b8b6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 22:47:23","author":"Finbarr Bermingham","authors":["Finbarr Bermingham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.232},{"id":290918968,"title":"Deregulation commission soon to curb govt interference: PM Modi","text":"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday said the Centre would soon set up a deregulation commission to ease the compliance burden on society and minimise govt interference.\"We have ended hundreds of compliances, and now with Jan Vishwas 2.0, we are further reducing compliances.

We have opened the nuclear sector for private participation,\" the PM said, adding that India missed the first three industrial revolutions but is ready to move forward with the world in the fourth.Modi highlighted that India entered in the top 5 largest economies in the world in just the last decade, denoting the speed of development of Viksit Bharat. He said people would soon witness India becoming the third largest economy in the world in a few years. He emphasised that this was the necessary pace for a young country like India and stressed that India was moving ahead with this very speed.Modi detailed the reforms undertaken in the past 10 years which he said has transformed India's economy. He said the banking sector was reformed and now public sector banks have reported record profits and access to credit has been accelerated to cover a wide section of the population, including the poor, with \"banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured, funding the unfunded\" being the govt's strategy.He said such initiatives may not have generated headlines, but changed the lives of all across the country. \"Swamitva Yojana has resulted in the recognition of rights of properties, enabling people in poor sections of the society to access loans, which are now far more easily available because of the growing network of bank branches and banking correspondents. Property worth Rs 1 lakh crore have been unlocked,\" the PM said, quoting a UN study.\"This is the real story of reform - perform and transform,\" said the PM, adding that reforms earlier were undertaken only due to compulsion but now they were being taken with conviction.Reforms undertaken by his govt have strengthened the pillars of the economy, he said, while also mentioning that the private sector is benefiting from GST. Modi also referred to the reforms undertaken to revamp the colonial era Indian Penal Code and bring about tthe Bharatiya Nyay Samhita.PM Modi also referred to the steps taken to transform backward districts and pointed to the development in the Aspirational Districts.

come in for another SEVEN YEARS?\n\nOr that £250billion in frozen Russian assets have still not been released for use in the defence of Ukraine?\n\nSir Keir is right when he says this is a “once-in-a-generation moment for our national security”.\n\nThe PM can be a vital bridge between the US and Europe. \n\nBut this week’s emergency French summit must act fast.\n\nThe stakes are simply too high for delay.\n\nHermer’s permits\n\nANOTHER day, another disturbing revelation about smug, EU-loving Attorney General Lord Hermer.\n\nOnly the year before last, he described eco-zealots as

cricket.\n\nOr throw soup over a masterpiece in a gallery.\n\nIs it any wonder these fanatics feel emboldened?\n\nThey are right to think they have support at the very top when leading lawyers such as Lord Hermer show them such respect.\n\nNow he is the most senior legal chief in the country he should reserve his warped admiration.\n\nAnd concentrate on his job of punishing their

bringing the student magazine into the digital age","text":"As the lunch bell rings at Darwin High School, students shuffle into the sticky, monsoon-season heat, eager to make the most of their fleeting 45 minutes of free time.\n\nBut against the tide, two students return to the classroom and prepare to hit the phones.\n\nIt's only a few weeks into the school year, but Pak and Nicole need to publish issue seven of the Student Spotlight magazine.\n\n\"Normally if I'm just running some stories, it would probably be just five hours [of work each week],\" Pak said.\n\n\"If it's a busy week when everything needs to be published, it would be a bit more than [6-10 hours of work].\"\n\nThe zine covers everything from student achievements to crime thriller fiction, incisive opinion pieces on gym culture, Donald Trump and the school band's latest performances.\n\nIts team has exponentially grown since the first issue in April 2024, now boasting between 20 and 30 volunteer student writers, editors, photographers and graphic designers.\n\nOn a count of contributors, Student Spotlight is one of Darwin's largest news operations. \n\nFrom Hong Kong protests to a Darwin school\n\nStudent Spotlight's 16-year-old founder Pak grew up in Hong Kong, before moving to Darwin.\n\nHe was 10 when huge throngs of peaceful pro-democracy protesters marched through the city and were met with violence.\n\n\"A lot of those protesters were very young people, as young as 13, and a lot of young journalists,\" he said.\n\n\"Just seeing those protests and seeing so many young people not being heard left a long-lasting impact in how I think and how I act.\"\n\nWhile Hong Kong is a very different place to Australia, Pak's concerned teenagers rarely get a say in national conversations that affect their lives.\n\nLast year, the Northern Territory enacted \"youth curfews\" to address crime and became the first Australian jurisdiction to lower the age of criminal responsibility, after the previous government raised the age.\n\nIn recent years, Pak believes the negative press has outweighed the positive, disproportionately giving Territory teenagers a bad name.\n\nFor that reason, he founded the zine with three objectives in mind.\n\n\"To showcase young peoples' abilities, to provide more opportunities and to create a sense of social cohesion around schools and students,\" he said.\n\n\"There must be a way to showcase that.\"\n\nSchool magazine for the digital age\n\nBuilding a school magazine for a generation saturated with social media and generative AI has proven quite the uphill battle.\n\nPak and the team are currently online-only; they circulate a PDF link to Darwin High School's website and other local schools, and post to an Instagram page.\n\nHe estimates the publication has up to 1,000 readers each issue and the team is looking to expand that by distributing it to Darwin's public libraries too.\n\nStudent Spotlight writer Nicole said social media had \"definitely taken over\" from magazines for her generation, but believes there is value in carefully curating stories on a page.\n\n\"Someone has sat down and really put their time and effort into this. I feel like there's more care and people will take that more seriously.\"\n\nTrilokesh Changmugam is one of a number of teachers who have thrown their support behind the project.\n\n\"Nobody knows Territory kids like themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm just here as a supervisor and I think they're showing what students are capable of when we sit back and let them take charge.\"\n\nPak took part in work experience at ABC News Darwin last year.\n\nSince the ABC began working on this story, he has started working casually in the ABC's news operations.","summary":"They may be the TikTok generation, but a group of Darwin teenagers are breathing new life into the traditional student magazine.

The US president shocked European allies this week by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin without consulting them or Kyiv beforehand and declaring an immediate start to Ukraine peace talks. Trump administration officials have also made clear in recent days that they expect European allies in NATO to take primary responsibility for the region as the US now has other priorities, such as border security and countering China. Asked at a global security conference in Munich on Saturday (local time) if he could assure the audience that Ukrainians and Europeans would be at the table for talks, General Keith Kellogg said: \"The answer to that last question (regarding Europeans), just as you framed it, the answer is no\". Ukrainians, however, will \"of course\" be at the table, he said, adding it would be foolish to suggest otherwise. This triggered an immediate rebuke from European leaders. \"There&apos;s no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s future or European security structure, without Europeans,\" Finland&apos;s President Alexander Stubb told the same security conference in Munich. \"But this means that Europe needs to get its act together. Europe needs to talk less and do more.\" Stubb said the questionnaire the US sent to Europeans \"will force Europeans to think\". A European diplomat said the US document included six questions with one specifically for European Union member states. \"The Americans are approaching European capitals and asking how many soldiers they are ready to deploy,\" one diplomat said. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also urged Europeans to get their act together. \"And to my European friends, I would say, get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up (defence) spending,\" he said in Munich. France is discussing with its allies the possibility of holding an informal meeting among European leaders on Ukraine to discuss these matters, although nothing has been decided at this stage, a French presidency official said on Saturday. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said it would take place on Monday. Kellogg told the conference that talks aimed at ending the war between Russia and Ukraine could focus on territorial concessions from Russia and targeting Putin&apos;s oil revenues. \"Russia is really a petrostate,\" he said, adding that Western powers needed to do more regarding effectively enforcing sanctions on Russia. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for the creation of a European army, saying the continent could no longer be sure of protection from the United States and would only get respect from Washington with a strong military. In an impassioned speech to the annual Munich Security Conference of global policymakers, Zelenskyy said an address by US Vice President JD Vance the previous day had made clear the relationship between Europe and the US was changing. \"Let&apos;s be honest — now we can&apos;t rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it,\" said Zelenskyy, speaking as the war triggered by Russia&apos;s invasion of his country is set to enter its fourth year. \"I really believe that time has come. The armed forces of Europe must be created.\" He said a European army — which would include Ukraine — was necessary so that the continent&apos;s \"future depends only on Europeans - and decisions about Europeans are made in Europe\". European nations cooperate militarily primarily within NATO, but governments have so far rejected various calls for the creation of a single European army over the years, arguing that defence is a matter of national sovereignty. A senior official from an eastern member state of the European Union responded sceptically to Zelenskyy&apos;s proposal for a European army, saying: \"There is a European military force called NATO.\" Zelenskyy said Kyiv would never accept a deal made behind its back.","summary":"As Ukraine's president voices the need for the creation of an \"armed forces of Europe\", the US says Europe will not have a seat at the table for Ukraine peace talks.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/europe-wont-be-part-of-ukraine-peace-talks-us-says-zelenskyy-makes-armed-forces-call/pw5qeklwk","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/33f6bfd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1350+0+126/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbc%2F53%2F79ce345d4e4aba22abb975cc7acc%2F20250215184357784213-original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 22:38:05","author":"Aap / Ukrainian Presidential Press Service / Epa","authors":["Aap / Ukrainian Presidential Press Service / Epa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":290924612,"title":"EDWARD LUCAS: Trump wants his Nobel Peace Prize whatever the cost to Ukraine, Europe and Britain...","text":"Confused, contradictory and deeply concerning. That is the verdict at the Munich Security Conference on Donald Trump’s hectic first month in the White House. As the bigwigs hurtle between meetings, the alarm in the air is unmistakable.\n\nChiefly because the Trump administration is in the driving seat and the Europeans are not even on the bus. Though his destination is unclear to many of us, what we do know is the US President wants a Nobel Peace Prize and believes a deal with Vladimir Putin will deliver it – no matter the cost to Ukraine, Europe and Britain.\n\nTrump believes in a might-is-right world where the strong do what they can and the weak accept what they must. So forget high-minded appeals to past sacrifice and shared values. Flattery and greed are the currencies that count now.\n\nThe latter could be sated by Ukraine’s mineral riches. Lindsey Graham, the US Senator who represents the old-style Atlanticist wing of the Republican Party, has told Trump that Ukraine is valuable real estate and that Russia must not be allowed to develop it.\n\nSo it is mystifying that Trump, the supposedly hard-nosed author of The Art Of The Deal, has given Putin big concessions before talks have even started.\n\nWill he allow Putin to dominate Europe in return for Moscow severing its alliance with Beijing? He’s capable of pushing such a horribly mistaken policy that could be disastrous for our security.\n\nThe good news is yesterday’s dreadful positions – inviting Russia back into the G7, promising chummy summits with Putin and abandoning Ukraine outside Nato – may be dumped tomorrow.\n\nTrump changes his mind with impunity. His desire, a senior European politician told me, is to lead the news every hour of every day. Forget consistency and predictability, attention is what matters.\n\nThe bad news is that his bullying streak is consistent. European leaders are playing with fire when they rebuke him publicly. It will be all too easy for Trump to withdraw the vital 8,000 US troops who protect Nato’s eastern frontier.\n\nHe can cancel the intelligence-sharing with Ukraine that provides its hard-pressed troops with their electronic eyes and ears.\n\nA broken, defeated Ukraine will be a catastrophe for Europe, with millions of refugees fleeing west.\n\nIt will embolden Putin to find his next victim – perhaps Estonia, where Britain has scraped together 1,000 troops as part of a Nato tripwire force. But without Americans, that tripwire rings no bells.\n\nTrue, European countries are belatedly boosting defence spending. But it will take years before they can fill the gap the Americans would leave. \n\nThey cannot even provide a credible force to protect Ukraine after a ceasefire deal. For now, when it comes to European security, the Americans are the only game in town.\n\nAll this leaves Britain in a dreadful position. We cannot join the Europeans in denouncing Trump’s selfish, cynical approach. \n\nOur intelligence and nuclear relationship with the US is central to our defence. We know they can be a difficult ally but the alternative is worse.\n\nYet we do not want to see Europe isolated, failing and splintering, falling prey to Russian – and Chinese – influence. That would be a catastrophe for our own security.\n\nWe should also worry about a European superstate taking shape without our participation. Yesterday President Zelensky called for a European army and certainly fear of Putin is driving continental leaders to take collective security seriously as never before.\n\nThe bleak truth is that Britain’s hollowed-out Armed Forces, stagnant economy and lightweight political leadership risk leaving us on the sidelines. And for that we have only ourselves to blame.","summary":"Trump believes in a might-is-right world where the strong do what they can and the weak accept what they must.

What are the dangers?","text":"Ukraine’s nuclear ghosts were raised again on Friday after a drone armed with a warhead hit the protective outer shell of the plant at Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident.\n\nThe strike, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, did not breach the plant’s inner containment shell and radiation levels did not increase, according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nRussia denied involvement, and accused Ukraine of waging a false flag attack. Their competing claims could not be independently verified.\n\nWhat’s at stake?\n\nThe timing is sensitive as the incident comes against the backdrop of the Munich Security Conference, a gathering of world leaders meant to hash out paths to ending the nearly three-year war.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations, claiming the other is trying to derail President Donald Trump’s efforts to help broker a peace deal.\n\nRafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the U.N. watchdog, the IAEA, said Friday’s incident was deeply concerning and underlines the persistent risks to nuclear safety during the ongoing war.\n\n“There is no room for complacency, and the IAEA remains on high alert,” he said in a statement. “I once again call for maximum military restraint around Ukraine’s nuclear sites.”\n\nHow dangerous can it be?\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a Russian drone slammed into the shell covering the remains of Chernobyl’s reactor No. 4 — the same one that exploded on April 26, 1986, spewing radioactive fallout over much of Europe.\n\nThe 2-billion euro ($2.1 billion) structure, built in 2019, enclosed the original concrete shelter that was built over what was left of the exploded reactor.\n\nMade of metal and designed to prevent any radioactive release from the exploded reactor, the outer shell is meant to protect it from any external hazards.\n\nExperts have said the drone didn’t threaten the integrity of the original concrete shelter, which can withstand a much heavier impact.\n\nThree other nuclear reactors at Chernobyl have been shut down long ago, but the plant houses spent fuel and contaminated equipment awaiting to be dismantled during a long decommissioning process.\n\nSome parts of the Russia-captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is Europe’s biggest, have been repeatedly struck by drones — attacks Russia and Ukraine blamed on each other — but none have led to radioactive threats.\n\nStill, a slew of attacks earlier this week prompted the cancellation of a planned rotation of IAEA monitors at the Zaporizhzhia plant.\n\nRussian troops occupied Chernobyl in the opening weeks of the war, raising fears that they could cause damage and trigger a radioactive accident. Since the Russians' withdrawal in late March 2022, Ukraine has mounted a drive to install further protections at the defunct site, including anti-drone systems and anti-tank barriers.\n\nWhat about other risks?\n\nThe nearly three years of fighting have seen repeated power cuts to the critical cooling system at Chernobyl, as well as at Ukraine’s four active nuclear plants, causing fears that spent nuclear fuel could overheat.\n\nThe cuts often follow shelling or drone strikes on nearby power lines, disrupting supply.\n\nNuclear safety experts have told The Associated Press that internal radioactive decay continues for thousands of years inside fuel rods after they have been used to generate power, giving off heat. Because of this, the rods are put in cooling pools, where they are cooled by both water and an electric-powered heat exchange pump.\n\nThe Swedish Radiation Safety Authority and others estimate that a power outage at Chernobyl would not lead to a risky radiation incident for at least a couple of weeks. This is because the fuel storage ponds are very deep, and it would take a long time for the water inside them to boil down, even if the cooling pumps were to stop.\n\nStill, a lack of electricity would blind the IAEA’s radiation monitoring systems, installed to boost security.\n\nAnd even if experts say a drone or missile strike is unlikely to trigger a major radioactive release, at least not without giving authorities time to take action, a power shutoff or the deliberate targeting of nuclear plants during the war can still cause significant panic and undermine peace efforts.","summary":"Ukraine’s nuclear ghosts have been stirred up again after a drone armed with a warhead hit the protective outer shell of the plant at Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident.

Some Democrats and Trump critics have warned of a looming \"constitutional crisis,\" accusing Trump of overstepping presidential authority and disregarding legal constraints.Recent commentary from the White House, Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk on the judiciary and the rule of law has raised concerns among some critics of Trump, with fears that the president is overextending his power. Prior to taking office a second time, some critics warned of the possibility that Trump could undermine American democracy.What To Know Early Saturday afternoon, Trump wrote in a short social media post on Truth Social, \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\"The quote has often been attributed to Bonaparte, although there is no official verification of this. Bonaparte rose to prominence during the French Revolution after leading a series of military campaigns across Italy and elsewhere. He later crowned himself emperor in 1804, ruling France for a decade.It is unclear what Trump was posting the statement in response to.His administration, meanwhile, has been hit with a flurry of lawsuits regarding federal firings and restructuring. When asked earlier this week if he would comply with court orders that blocked his policy agenda, Trump said, \"The answer is I always abide by the courts, always abide by them.
