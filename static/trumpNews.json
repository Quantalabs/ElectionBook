{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":12636,"news":[{"id":387849048,"title":"How Trump is isolating America","text":"Winston Churchill famously said, 'Russia is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.' In that vein, Donald Trump is aerogel, wrapped in contradictions, packaged in business deals. In 2019, aerogel beat glass to hold the Guinness World Records as the world's most transparent material. It is solid, but mostly air, an obvious contradiction. It is almost disarming how transparent Trump is about his prejudices, peeves, methods and goals. He publicly threatens to capture Denmark's Greenland. He plans to turn war-shattered Gaza into a luxury Mediterranean Riviera. He forces Ukraine into signing a critical minerals mining deal. He covets the Nobel Prize. Only he can bring peace to warring nations, only he can talk to Azerbaijan's leader. In the Trumpian world, 'yes we can' becomes 'only I can'. All this we know because Trump says so. The US National Security Strategy, NSS, a 'Trump Doctrine' enshrining 'America First', is a transparent testament to his contradictions, intentions and obsessions with business deals. Land, tariffs, war, peace, projection of US power are all opportunities for real estate, infrastructure and media projects. Ethics specialists cry 'conflicts of interest'. Trump is unfazed. The doctrine includes robust economic measures and crackdowns against migration and drug smuggling. The NSS rejects America's 'ill-fated global domination' but then contradicts itself, asserting the imperative for 'economic, financial, technological, energy and military dominance'. The US will enforce 'American preeminence in the western hemisphere'. The hegemon will convert the hemisphere into an 'attractive market for American commerce and investment', eject foreign competitors, and, if necessary, militarily access 'strategically important locations'. It is baffling how Trump fails to see his contradictions when they are projected globally, 24x7. He accepts FIFA's made-up peace prize when his attempts to achieve peace in Ukraine flops and when he unilaterally turns the Venezuelan coast into a battle-zone. Trump claims the US is attacking the tiny, Venezuelan 'narco' speedboats in 'self-defence'. The US armada, gathered off Venezuela's coast ready to attack, includes the world's biggest warship, the USS Gerald Ford, helicopter and aircraft carriers, attack vessels, fighter jets, drones, spy planes, nuclear submarines, guided-missile destroyers, and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops. But Trump releases narco-king and ex-president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernndez, from a 45-year US prison sentence. Venezuela is not even a drug conduit, experts say. Trump plots regime change in Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves. His doctrine flexes power over law, duress over diplomacy, hyperbole over dispassionate analysis. Trump never loses an opportunity to praise himself or insult Joe Biden and Europe. In the NSS, Trump boasts 'no administration in history has achieved so dramatic a turnaround in so short a time'. Turnaround to some, U-turn to others. The NSS rebukes Biden's 'deadly failures' and Europe's impending 'civilisational erasure because of uncontrolled migration'. The NSS disparages Europe's 'economic decline', 'regulatory suffocation', 'loss of national identities', 'lack of confidence', 'censorship' and 'suppression of political opposition'. In a shocking assertion of internal interference, the NSS threatens the US will 'cultivate resistance to Europe's current trajectory' (support far-right groups). The doctrine deepens European insecurity. Denmark, loyal US ally and NATO member, now publicly identifies the US as a 'potential security threat'. Coercion, conflicts of interest and contradictions underpin the Trump doctrine. It disregards morality, geopolitics, psychology, history. Says economist Jeffrey Sachs, 'A great power that frightens its allies, coerces its neighbours, and disregards international rules ultimately isolates itself.' It happened to Athens 2,500 years ago. More recently, it happened to the Soviet Union.

Today we celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote. Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that “the joyous message of Christmas is the hope of Eternal Life through Christ.”\n\nIn a video posted to X, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins claimed that “the very best of the American spirit … flows from the very first Christmas, when God gave us the greatest gift possible: the gift of his son and our savior, Jesus Christ.”\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon wished “you and your family a day filled with lasting memories as we celebrate the birth of our Savior.”\n\n“Let Earth Receive Her King,” the official account for the Department of Labor wrote.\n\nTheir messages and other posts across government accounts — sharply diverting from generalized greetings for religious holidays — swiftly drew criticism from First Amendment and religious freedom advocates who warned that the Trump administration is once again appearing to favor a religious state.\n\nThe First Amendment’s establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing a religion or favoring one over another, while the free exercise clause ensures the freedom to express one’s faith. Thomas Jefferson had stressed the importance of a “wall of separation between the church and state” to prevent religious dominance in governance.\n\nJustice Department civil rights division chief Harmeet Dhillon said the agency relies on the “principles of the First Amendment and religious freedom protections on “a daily basis to protect Christians,” pointing to legal actions defending conservative Christians and anti-abortion activists.\n\nThe Trump administration’s social media posts are “one more example of the Christian Nationalist rhetoric the Trump administration has disseminated since Day One in office,” according to Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n\n“Our Constitution’s promise of church-state separation has allowed religious diversity — including different denominations of Christianity — to flourish in America,” she said in a statement.\n\nFormer Homeland Security spokesperson Alex Howard called the messages an “inappropriate use of official government channels.”\n\n“Americans don’t share a religion,” added Alex Nowrasteh, senior vice president for policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank. “Our state is secular.”\n\nAdministration officials responded to criticism and requests for comment with “Merry Christmas.”\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans identify as Christian, according to the Pew Research Center’s most recent Religious Landscape Study. That reflects a roughly 16-point decline from 20 years ago, while the largest share of Americans who don’t identify themselves with any religion climbed up by more than 13 points to 29 percent this year.\n\nNearly one in four Americans identify as evangelical Christians, but they played a crucial role in Trump’s presidential elections, including roughly 80 percent of white evangelical voters in 2024.\n\nIn February, the president directed a task force at the Department of Justice to “fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society” and “move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide.”\n\nHe also established the Religious Liberty Commission in the Justice Department and appointed televangelist pastor Paula White-Cain as a senior adviser to the White House Faith Office.\n\nThe Trump administration’s alignment with an evangelical base also is parallel to a growing effort among religious right-wing special interest groups to move public funds into religious groups and education.\n\nThe president has also long promised his evangelical base that his administration would work to repeal tax code that prohibits tax-exempt charitable organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates, which would upend decades of federal law intended to prevent campaigns from using churches as political tools.\n\nEarlier this year, the IRS indicated that it would allow churches and houses of worship to endorse political candidates from the pulpit without losing their tax-exempt status.\n\nAmid several cases at the Supreme Court backed by Trump-aligned groups, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in 2022 that the conservative-majority court “continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the Framers fought to build.”\n\nShe has warned that the court is treating the separation of church and state as a “constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-admin-accused-blurring-line-013045089.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yi2g86w64uLdM6PZGzJPDg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0yNTU4O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/badcc3318f036a8968b84a4fa8b30bd4","video":"","publish_date":"2025-12-28 01:30:45","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.227},{"id":389527314,"title":"Putin's BIG 'Force' Ultimatum As Kyiv Endures 10-Hour Bombardment, World Scrambles For Response","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday issued a sharp warning to Ukraine, saying Moscow believes Kyiv is in no rush to end the conflict through peaceful means.

Casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nNigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Kimiebi Ebienfa said in a post soon after that “the precision strikes on terrorist targets in Nigeria were carried out in coordination with the Nigerian government.”\n\nHe added, “Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims, or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria’s values and to international peace and security.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump had ordered the Defense Department only one month ago to prepare to intervene in Nigeria to protect Christians.\n\nIn response, the Nigerian government scrambled a delegation, led by National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu, to Washington DC, where we have lacked ambassadorial representation for two years.\n\nAnd then, smelling “success” in warding off the political embarrassment of Trump’s threats, the Nigerian leader deployed Ribadu to lead the Nigerian side of a new US-Nigeria Joint Working Group, allegedly “to deepen collaboration in tackling security challenges” in Nigeria.\n\nIt was a band-aid, as Christmas would later prove, when surgery was required.\nAnd band-aids are why Nigeria has failed to launch since independence, with the political elite content with the glitter and glamour of office rather than service or governance.\nFor twelve and a half years, band-aids are what APC governments have offered Nigerians, no matter how much the people have lamented, bled and died, as a response to insecurity.\n\nIf elected, Tinubu promised in 2022, he would spare no assets to arrest the problem. But Nigerians fight with money. Then more money. Nigeria’s security budget in 2015 was N969bn; the figure in 2025 is N6.57tn!\n\nSecurity meetings. Speeches. More meetings.\n\nAnd when Nigerians are reported to have been killed or kidnapped in droves, that is the cue for more security meetings and statements.\n\nRemember the Nigerian military announcing last year the deployment of “special forces” across the country in a “renewed onslaught” on the insecurity?\n\nRemember the Chief of Air Staff Hassan Abubakar announcing that the Air Force had flown nearly 16,000 hours in 18 months?\n\nOne top security official affirmed that Nigerians should arm and defend themselves. He kept his job.\n\nAnother declared that the insecurity needed not the military or intelligence, but a spiritual response. He, too, kept his job.\n\nNSA Ribadu joined the mounting celebration of mediocrity, citing something he called Tinubu Gains: “Hundreds of bandits are killed today, every day,” he said.\n\n“Tinubu gains, you move everywhere in our own country today free of fear. Things are changing…Nobody has ever defeated Tinubu, and you are going to be defeated…”\n\nThat was one year before Trump’s threat. In that calendar year, Nigeria changed some military chiefs, but nothing significantly improved in Nigeria’s security response. Band aid.\n\nPresident Tinubu last month declared an emergency, but it lacked substance. To that, three weeks ago, I offered elements of a serious emergency.\n\nThat included suggestions of a potent intelligence schema, which Nigeria has not demonstrated in the 16 years we have contended with insecurity.\n\nStrangely, following the air strikes, Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister, Yussuf Tuggar, was quick to claim that Nigeria had provided the intelligence for the strikes.\n\nAnd then he immediately identified the pain points for his government: the statements to follow the air strikes would show clearly that “it was a strike against terrorism and [in the interest] of the ongoing joint operations and collaboration between Nigeria and the United States.”\n\nAnd he said it must be made clear that it was a joint operation and did not target any religion. “We are a multi-religious country, and we are working with partners like the US to fight terrorism and safeguard the lives and properties of Nigerians.”\n\nTuggar should have stayed in bed or resigned his appointment. His APC outfit, which assumed power ten years ago after two years of brutally attacking the Goodluck Jonathan government and falsely promising to secure Nigeria swiftly, has spent that period making the country far worse.\n\nWhen, then, did it obtain the compelling “intelligence” that persuaded Mr. Trump precisely where and when to strike? Why has the Tinubu government not used this intelligence in the past two and a half years as Nigerians cried and died, despite the massive and growing arsenal of the Nigerian Air Force?\n\nWas this really a strike against terrorism? If so, did the Nigerian government have an anti-terrorism strategy before Mr. Trump’s threat? Why did it not act on it?\n\n“We are a multi-religious country”? Who made this astounding discovery, and when? Why did acting on it require the permission or leadership of a foreign leader?\n\nMr. Trump had been categorical on November 1: if Tinubu’s government continued to “allow the killing of Christians, the USA will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’” he said.\n\nKeep that in mind: Nigeria, “disgraced.” And as if to underline that point, last Thursday—Christmas Day of all Holy Days—he introduced his guns in place of Christian solemnity.\n\nWhether you interpret this as a matter of religion or terrorism, the most important fact is that for over ten years, APC’s ramshackle governments have demonstrated shabbiness and gross incompetence in governance, particularly in the security sector. That failure has now embarrassingly opened the door to more external actors and intervention.\n\nBut the problem has always been the inaction of Nigeria’s leaders, who spend where they should save, speak when they should remain silent, lead when they should serve, stand when they should kneel, and deploy band-aids in place of surgery… all the while attempting to hide behind a leaf.\n\nThis is why, 25 years later, we still lack electricity.\n\nGovernment leaders have no problem buying new cars every year for hundreds of thousands of dollars despite the absence of motorable national highways.\n\nIn our budgets, we announce roads, hospitals, and schools we have no intention of completing.\n\nAnd this is why insecurity has grounded Nigeria while officials have no coherent strategy. This is why officials can sleep in foreign hospitals for weeks or months with no sense of shame. This is why we watch videos of our children learning under trees or in flooded classrooms.\n\nThink about it: it is eight months since I first called for a structured approach to combating insecurity in Nigeria; less than one month since I spoke about a roadmap; and just weeks since I provided that detailed template.\n\nInstead, Nigeria is still being treated to empty speeches.\n\nWhat happens now? “He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount,” says a Chinese proverb.\n\nNigeria has confessed that it possesses intelligence so powerful that the United States can rely on it. Will the Nigerian government use it from now on, or will it continue to wait for “partners like the US to fight terrorism and safeguard the lives and properties of Nigerians”?\n\nWill these “partners” confer respect, or inflict contempt?\n\nOr perhaps we’ll just turn Trump’s microphone off.","summary":"And so, Christmas Day 2025, under the watch of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the United States military hit “ISIS targets” in Northwestern Nigeria, changing various Nigerian narratives permanently.  Casualty figures were not immediately available.

Later Saturday, Russia also claimed fresh gains on the ground with the capture of two towns at different spots along the frontlines. Zelensky said the Russian onslaught showed Moscow had no intention of ending the invasion it launched in February 2022 and which has killed tens of thousands of people. Before scheduled talks with Trump in Florida on Sunday, Zelensky met in Halifax with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who said the latest Russian attack underscored the need to stand by Ukraine. \"We have the conditions... of a just and lasting peace, but that requires a willing Russia, and the barbarism that we saw overnight... shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine,\" said Carney. Russia has accused Ukraine and its European backers of trying to \"torpedo\" a previous US-brokered plan to stop the fighting. Adding to pressure on the battlefield, Russia announced on Saturday it had captured two more towns in eastern Ukraine, Myrnograd and Guliaipole. \"If the authorities in Kyiv don't want to settle this business peacefully, we'll resolve all the problems before us by military means,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday. - 'They do not want to end the war' - The overnight barrage of drones and missiles targeting Kyiv killed two people, wounded dozens and cut power and heating to more than a million of the region's residents during freezing temperatures, Ukraine authorities said. Some 2,600 residential buildings were hit in the attack, as well as more than 300 schools, pre-schools or social services buildings, said Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko. Zelensky said some 500 drones and 40 missiles had pounded the capital and its surrounding region. \"Russian representatives engage in lengthy talks, but in reality, Kinzhals (missiles) and Shaheds (drones) speak for them,\" he said. \"They do not want to end the war and seek to use every opportunity to cause Ukraine even greater suffering,\" he added. During the Russian onslaught, which lasted 10 hours, AFP reporters in Kyiv heard loud explosions, some accompanied by bright flashes that turned the sky orange. The Russian army said it used hypersonic missiles and drones to target infrastructure and energy facilities used by Ukraine's military, as well as military sites. Neighbouring Poland, a NATO member, scrambled jets and put air defences on alert during the attack, its military said on social media. Just as Zelensky flew out of the country, Ukraine's anti-corruption agency announced a new probe which it said implicated some MPs. - 'Security guarantees should be strong' - Sunday's meeting in Florida is to focus on a new, 20-point plan that would freeze the war on its current front line. It could require Ukraine to pull back troops from the east, allowing the creation of demilitarised buffer zones, according to details revealed by Zelensky this week. The new plan, formulated with Ukraine's input, is Kyiv's most explicit acknowledgement yet of possible territorial concessions. It is a marked departure from an initial 28-point proposal by Washington last month that adhered to many of Russia's core demands. Trump, speaking to news outlet Politico on Friday, said of Zelensky's plan that \"he doesn't have anything until I approve it\". He added: \"So we'll see what he's got.\" Part of the plan includes separate US-Ukraine bilateral agreements on security guarantees, reconstruction and the economy. Zelensky said those were changing daily. \"As for sensitive issues, we will discuss (the eastern region of) Donbas and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,\" he added. Zelensky was to brief EU allies after his meeting with Carney. Zelensky added Saturday that the aim of the Florida talks was to reduce unresolved issues to a minimum. \"Of course, today there are red lines for Ukraine and Ukrainian people. There are compromise proposals. All of these issues are very sensitive,\" he said on X. Meanwhile, Ukraine needed European and US support to acquire weapons and funds, both of which were insufficient, Zelensky said -- \"in particular for the production of weapons and, most importantly, drones\".

Glassman via RealClearEnergy,\n\nThere’s a lot of crowing in certain quarters about the 2% decline in U.S. electric vehicle sales in 2025 compared to the year before. Francis Menton, the lawyer who writes the Manhattan Contrarian blog, for instance, claims vindication for his prediction in February 2023 that electric vehicles would not “sweep the country and become the dominant form of transportation.”\n\nThe reasoning behind his forecast: “It is always wise to bet against central planning of the economy.” In this case, central planning amounted to state CO2 emissions goals, CAFE mileage requirements and federal and state tax subsidies. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases, and President Trump on Dec. 3 issued an order to roll back CAFE standards “to levels at which combustion vehicles can comply.”\n\nLike Menton, I don’t like central planning. Nor do I support mileage standards or subsidies. Americans have proven in the past that the best route to prosperity and health is free competition without government meddling. Unfortunately, that is not what we have anymore.\n\nOur own government is denying Americans the opportunity to buy the cars of their choice by imposing huge tariffs on low-priced electric vehicles, which are pouring into the rest of the world.\n\nEV sales in the U.S. are languishing for many reasons, including a lack of charging stations, but the biggest problem is cost. Our EVs are absurdly expensive. Competition from China, India and perhaps even Mexico and would help bring down prices – and make U.S. EV makers more efficient.\n\nIn the rest of the world EV sales are booming, up 21% through November compared to last year. In all, sales of cars and trucks powered by electricity will reach 20 million by year-end. In 2020, global sales were just 3 million.\n\nOne of the biggest changes is the advent of inexpensive Chinese-built EVs, which carry a special 100% U.S. tariff, initially imposed by Joe Biden in 2024 and extended under Donald Trump. These EVs are effectively barred from the U.S. market, the world’s second-largest (after China itself). Nevertheless, China sells 62% of the world’s EVs and 71% of global EV batteries.\n\nThe European Union also has high tariffs on Chinese EVs (43%), but the UK does not. As a result, the British are rushing to buy electrics like those offered by BYD in its more than 100 retail outlets across the country. BYD, now the world’s largest EV maker, is selling 10 times as many cars in the UK as it did last year. Total EV sales in the UK have jumped 25% this year, and 22.7% of vehicles registered in the country in 2025 are fully electric, compared with a little less than 10% in the U.S.\n\nBYD is building EVs 25% more cheaply than Western competitors. The company has a broad lineup, but what’s happening in the UK and around the world is that the EV is no longer a rich person’s novelty. The small BYD Dolphin Surf has list price of 18,650 British pounds, or $25,129. The company’s Seagull starts at under $8,000 in China. Meanwhile, Mexico is promising to build a line of economy EVs that will debut next year and cost $4,400 to $7,400 U.S. dollars.\n\nElectric cars and trucks have far fewer moving parts than vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, and they are cheaper to build and operate. “The battery, motor, and associated electronics require little to no regular maintenance,” says the U.S. Department of Energy. And EVs have instantaneous torque, that is, maximum power from the starting line, so even a large vehicles like GM’s Hummer EV can go from zero to 60 in just three seconds. They are fun to drive.\n\nNations concerned about climate change have been subsidizing EVs, but the economics of have changed, and subsidies are no longer necessary to get people to buy electric. We see the same phenomenon in electricity generation at utility plants. Because of technological innovation, solar and wind, with battery back-up, have become the cheapest and fastest way to add power to the grid – without subsidies. This is not about climate-change ideology.\n\nMy own conclusion is that, because of economics and the driving pleasure they provide, EVs are the future. But I could be wrong. To find out, let’s drop the subsidies and the tariffs and leave the choice of cars and trucks to consumers themselves.\n\nJames K.

If you had known what would be thrown at the world economy, especially Donald Trump’s tariff war, you would not have expected US equities to be ending the year around their all-time highs.\n\nCome to think of it, given the performance of Sir Keir Starmer’s government, you would not have envisaged the FTSE 100 index being right up there either.\n\nBut it hasn’t been a bad year for the US economy, and in any case markets are about emotions as much as numbers. \n\nNothing like a dazzling transformative technology and the prospect of a more compliant Federal Reserve to keep the bulls running, and we in Britain were pulled along too.\n\nBut can there really be another year of rising share prices, as nearly all the professional market-watchers predict?\n\nWell, things look very different here in sunny Florida than they do from grey London. Let’s call it the Mar-a-Lago financial outlook, after the pumped-up, glossy, wrinkle-free, flawless faces so favoured by Trump loyalists.\n\nWe know all bull markets eventually come to an end, so the question is whether that vibrant, optimistic perspective can be sustained for another year.\n\nOne key element, cheaper money, will certainly run on a while yet. The next head of the Federal Reserve Board will be a solid supporter of the President.\n\nWe knew that, but to avoid any doubt Trump declared last week: ‘Anybody that disagrees with me will never be Fed chairman.’\n\nIt’s true the chair is not all-powerful, and could be out-voted by the rest of the board. But the reality is that the most effective curb on an overly-compliant Fed will be the bond markets.\n\nFor now they seem content to cover the huge fiscal deficit of 6.5 per cent of GDP at a reasonable rate – ten-year Treasury notes are yielding 4.2 per cent against 4.5 per cent a year ago.\n\nIf inflation were to start nosing up maybe they might take fright, but right now there is little hint of concern. The bond market vigilantes are holding their fire.\n\nThere are all the arguments about Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a bubble – that the shares of the principal players are vastly over-valued. \n\nThere’s not much point in adding to this debate, except to note that US corporations as a whole are forecasting rising earnings through 2026, and that gives support to the market overall.\n\nSo it’s at least plausible that money could be shifted out of the more outlandishly-valued AI stocks into solid enterprises generating higher profits without a total market meltdown.\n\nBesides, there will be many winners from the AI revolution, in particular the corporations that use technology to hold down costs and bump up earnings.\n\nYet it is impossible not to feel uneasy. Mar-a-Lago’s cosmetic surgeons can make people appear more youthful, but they don’t make them healthier. That comes from something else.\n\nDon’t dismiss the importance of an optimistic outlook in generating and sustaining growth. \n\nYou can see the damage our own government has inflicted on our economy by the Chancellor’s relentless gloom. But dig down and there are all sorts of reasons for concern about the US. \n\nThese include the possibility of a recession, a surge in inflation, a run on the dollar and/or on the bond markets – the usual suspects. Beyond these is the unknown impact of AI on employment. \n\nIt is clearly killing a lot of entry-level jobs here and probably in the UK too, and that is alarming for social as well as economic reasons. \n\nAs yet AI doesn’t seem to be undermining employment more generally, but that may become more evident soon.\n\nFinally, there are the ‘unknown unknowns’, the phrase made famous by former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld to describe things you didn’t even realise you didn’t know about.\n\nFaced with all this, I fall back on the law coined by the economist Rudiger Dornbusch, who noted: ‘In economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, then happen faster than you thought they could.’\n\nSo the Mar-a-Lago glow could persist a while yet. It would be nice to believe this wave of optimism will subside gently, rather than chaotically.\n\nLet’s hope that’s right, but be aware that a nasty correction may come before 2026 is out.","summary":"We know all bull markets eventually come to an end, so the question is whether that vibrant, optimistic perspective can be sustained for another year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/comment/article-15415945/Cracks-starting-Mar-Lago-miracle-market-says-HAMISH-MCRAE.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/27/12/105044589-0-image-m-75_1766838453418.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 00:14:54","author":"Editor,Hamish McRae","authors":["Editor","Hamish McRae"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":389524154,"title":"Sinn Féin may boycott US St Patrick's Day trip again next year","text":"We need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

We need to get to that place very quickly,” she said.\n\nMcDonald said she continues to hope and pray for the appropriate international response and for Israel to be held to account so that a real process of dialogue and peacemaking can be built.\n\n“That’s what we need, and I can only pray that long before St Patrick’s Day is on the horizon, that we’re in that space. We’re not there yet, and it is not quite as dire as it has been for the last number of years, where we saw just unprecedented horror, but there is still some way to go, and Ireland needs to continue to be to the forefront,” she said.\n\nMcDonald encouraged activists in Ireland, including those in sports and culture, to continue to speak out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also urged the Government to pass the now long-stalled Occupied Territories Bill.\n\n“The world needs Ireland to be on the right side of this in the way that, in fairness, Spain and Slovenia and some others are also,” McDonald said.\n\nAsked if the trip is being kept under review, McDonald said: “Well, let’s see where we are.”\n\n“I hope we’re not faced again with that scenario. I mean, in a scenario like that, a trip is the least of your worries, the least of your concerns. I really hope that we’re not in that space again.”\n\nShe added however, that she is “very mindful of our relationship with the United States”.\n\nShe noted the flocks of people that returned from the US to Ireland over the Christmas period and said the relationship isn’t just political, it’s “a family relationship between our two countries”.\n\n“So let’s hope that we are not faced with the type of horror that we saw last year. Let’s hope that 2026, at last, will bring good news for the Middle East and for Palestinians in particular.” \n\nLast week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that 1.6 million people (77% of the population of Gaza) are still facing high levels of acute food insecurity since the ceasefire in October. \n\nThis includes over 100,000 children and 37,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women projected to suffer acute malnutrition through to April next year.\n\nWHO said that without sustained, large-scale expansion of food, livelihood, agriculture and health assistance, along with increased commercial inflows, hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza could rapidly slip back into famine.\n\nIt noted that while the ceasefire has improved some deliveries of food, animal feed, basic supplies and essential commercial imports into Gaza, most families are still grappling with severe shortages.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nJane Matthews\n\nView 9 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Sinn Féin may boycott US St Patrick's Day trip again next year”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Sinn Féin may boycott US St Patrick's Day trip again next year”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

Although the United States' role as the custodian of the international rules-based order was never as straightforward as its proponents believe, it at least represented an ideal against which to set expectations and measure successes and failures in global governance. But since Trump’s return, that ideal — like so many others — has been cast aside, lending new urgency to long-simmering questions.The United States may have done more than any other country to create the conditions for robust economic growth and relative peace after World War II, but nothing lasts forever. With the rise of new powers and the growing chorus of those demanding reforms to existing institutions, American unipolarity was always going to be challenged.

Johnson also questioned whether \"the numbers being spread by Republicans\" about the number of Christians killed in the country are accurate. \"BBC did a whole investigation as to whether or not the numbers being spread by Republicans are even true. Has it been 100,000 people? Has it been 6,000 people? Are they conflating different kinds of numbers?\" he asked. The professor added that the terrorist organizations operating out of Nigeria \"don’t care if you are a Christian or a Muslim or any other religion. They’re attacking everybody,\" suggesting Republicans are exaggerating the scope of attacks against Christians in the country. TRUMP ADMIN TARGETS ANTI-CHRISTIAN VIOLENCE WITH NEW VISA CRACKDOWN POLICY FOLLOWING NIGERIA ATTACKS Johnson said one \"vaguely bright spot\" was that the strikes were conducted jointly with the Nigerian government, rather than unilaterally, a distinction he argued had been lost in much of the coverage. The White House did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment. EXPERTS DISPUTE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT’S CLAIMS AMID CONGRESSIONAL PROBE OF ESCALATING ATTACKS ON CHRISTIANS On Thursday, Trump posted to Truth Social announcing that the U.S. military launched airstrikes in Northwest Nigeria on Christmas night targeting ISIS militants he accused of killing Christians, calling the operation decisive and warning further attacks would follow if the violence continues. \"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\" Trump wrote. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) confirmed the attacks in a post on X on Thursday night.

Last month, gunmen stormed the Christ Apostolic Church in Eruku, Kwara State, killing two people and kidnapping dozens. The 38 abducted worshipers were freed nearly a week later. Days later, armed attackers raided St. Mary’s School in Niger State, abducting more than 300 students and staff. School officials said 50 students aged 10 to 18 escaped in the following days, but 253 students and 12 teachers remain captive.

Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side.\n\nWithin hours of the signing, Thailand’s Foreign Ministry protested to Cambodia that a Thai soldier sustained a permanent disability when he stepped on an anti-personnel land mine it charged had been laid by Cambodian forces.\n\nDefense ministers met at the border to sign the agreement\n\nThe agreement was signed by the countries’ defense ministers, Cambodia’s Tea Seiha and Thailand’s Nattaphon Narkphanit, at a border checkpoint. It followed three-day lower-level talks by military officials.\n\nIt declares that the sides are committed to an earlier ceasefire that ended five days of fighting in July and follow-up agreements.\n\nThe original July ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. It was formalized in more detail in October at a regional meeting in Malaysia that Trump attended.\n\nDespite those deals, the countries carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued, escalating in early December to widespread heavy fighting.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the ceasefire announcement and urged Cambodia and Thailand to fully honor it and the terms of the peace accord reached earlier in Malaysia.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the ceasefire “a positive step towards alleviating the suffering of civilians, ending current hostilities, and creating an environment conducive to achieving lasting peace,” his spokesman said..\n\nThe U.N. chief expressed appreciation to Malaysia, China and the United States for their efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. “The United Nations stands ready to support efforts aimed at sustaining peace and stability in the region.”\n\nCivilians bore the brunt of the fighting\n\nThailand has lost 26 soldiers and one civilian as a direct result of the combat since Dec. 7, according to officials. Thailand has also reported 44 civilian deaths.\n\nCambodia hasn’t issued an official figure on military casualties, but says that 30 civilians have been killed and 90 injured. Hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.\n\n“Today’s ceasefire also paves the way for the displaced people who are living in the border areas to be able to return to their homes, work in the fields, and even allow their children to be able to return to schools and resume their studies,” Cambodia’s Defense Minister Tea Seiha told reporters after the signing.\n\nEach side blamed the other for initiating the fighting and claimed to be acting in self-defense.\n\nThe agreement also calls on both sides to adhere to international agreements against deploying land mines, a major concern of Thailand.\n\nThai soldiers along the border have been wounded in at least 10 incidents this year by what Thailand says were newly planted Cambodian mines. Cambodia says the mines were left over from decades of civil war that ended in the late 1990s.\n\nFollowing the latest injury on Saturday, Thailand’s Foreign Ministry noted that the new agreement “includes key provisions on joint humanitarian demining operations to ensure the safety of military personnel and civilians in the border areas as soon as possible.”\n\nAnother clause says the two sides “agree to refrain from disseminating false information or fake news.”\n\nThe agreement calls for a resumption of previous measures to demarcate the border. The sides also agreed to cooperate in suppressing transnational crimes. That’s primarily a reference to online scams perpetrated by organized crime that have bilked victims around the world of billions of dollars each year. Cambodia is a center for such criminal enterprises.\n\nMalaysia’s leader hails the agreement\n\nMalaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was instrumental in putting together the original ceasefire, said the new agreement “reflects a shared recognition that restraint is required, above all in the interest of civilians.”\n\nMany clauses similar to those in Saturday’s agreement were included in October’s ceasefire document, and were open to various interpretations and generally honored only in part. These included provisions concerning land mines and the Cambodian prisoners.\n\nThe fragility of the new agreement was underlined by Thailand’s Defense Ministry spokesperson Surasant Kongsiri in a news briefing after Saturday’s signing. He said that the safe return of civilians to their homes would indicate the situation had stabilized enough to allow the repatriation of the captured Cambodian soldiers.\n\n“However if the ceasefire does not materialize, this would indicate a lack of sincerity on the Cambodian side to create sure peace,” he said. “Therefore, the 72- hour ceasefire beginning today is not an act of trust nor unconditional acceptance but a time frame to tangibly prove whether Cambodia can truly cease the use of weapons, provocations and threats in the area.”\n\nSopheng Cheang reported from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.","summary":"The agreement took effect at noon (0500 GMT) and calls for a halt in military movements and airspace violation for military purposes.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/27/thailand-and-cambodia-sign-a-new-ceasefire-agreement-to-end-border-fighting/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Thailand_Cambodia_13317-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 00:01:05","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":389521756,"title":"Terrorists relocate after US air strikes","text":"There are indications that suspected terrorists in the North are relocating following the missile attacks carried out by the United States of America on Thursday night.\n\nCredible community leaders told Sunday PUNCH that they noticed movements as the hoodlums migrated in small numbers after the Christmas Day attacks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the US military carried out deadly strikes against Islamic State terrorists in northwestern Nigeria.\n\nConfirming the strike, the Federal Government said it gave the US support and that the strikes were carried out on targeted areas being used by the terrorists.\n\nHowever, no casualty was recorded in the two locations struck by the missiles.\n\nAt Jabo, Tambuwal Local Government Area of Sokoto State, a missile hit a farmland, while some buildings were affected in Offa, Kwara State.\n\nOfficials of Tangaza LGA in Sokoto State, however, said additional missile strikes were carried out on suspected hideouts of the Lakurawa armed group in parts of the Sokoto axis.\n\nAlthough there were no deaths, several residents sustained injuries, while properties worth millions of naira were destroyed.\n\nInflux of bandits in Benue\n\nThe Chairman of the Traditional Council in Gwer West LGA of Benue State, Daniel Abomtse, raised the alarm over the influx of armed herders into some communities following the US strike.\n\nSpeaking to one of our correspondents on Saturday, the traditional ruler said he noticed the presence of armed herders in his domain.\n\nHe said, “I felt their movement in my local government as well as in Agatu LGA. They have been running away from Sokoto to coastal areas in Gwer West and Agatu with sophisticated arms and grazing openly. They are in my domain.”\n\nWhile appreciating the US strike, Abomtse called on Trump to extend the operations to Benue, Kogi, Taraba, Niger and Plateau states.\n\n“What President Trump has done is the best thing to have happened to the government of Nigeria. I commend him for dealing with the menace in the country, which began about 16 years ago,” he added.\n\nEfforts to get confirmation of Abomtse’s claims from the spokesperson for the Benue State Police Command, Udeme Edet, were unsuccessful, as her phone rang out and messages sent were not replied to as of the time of filing this report.\n\nSokoto terrorists in disarray\n\nSecurity sources and residents said the Christmas attacks had disrupted the operations of bandits and forced them out of their hideouts.\n\nCommunity leaders in Tangaza, Gudu and parts of Illela in Sokoto told Sunday PUNCH that there had been signs of dislocation and movement among armed groups since the strike.\n\nAccording to some of them, who spoke on condition of anonymity, some bandits were seen moving in smaller numbers towards remote forest corridors, while others were believed to have attempted crossing into neighbouring border communities to evade aerial and ground surveillance.\n\nA community leader in Tangaza said the airstrike “sent a strong signal” and forced criminal elements to abandon familiar routes and camps.\n\n“People are cautious, but there is relief that their hideouts were hit,” he added.\n\nGovernment officials in Sokoto State said intelligence assessments were ongoing to determine the direction and scale of bandit movement after the strike.\n\nA senior official said security agencies had been placed on alert to prevent terrorists from infiltrating safer communities, stressing that border patrols and joint operations with federal forces were being intensified to block escape routes.\n\nA security expert, Bashar Umar, said the state government, in collaboration with the military and other security agencies, was strengthening surveillance across flashpoints, particularly in border local governments to curb the terrorists movement.\n\nUS scans Sambisa Forest \n\nA United States congressman, Riley Moore, said the strikes prevented “deadly Christmas attacks in Nigeria”.\n\nMoore, who stated this on Saturday on X, noted that Christians in Nigeria were killed in the last two Christmas seasons.\n\n“This year, thanks to @POTUS, radical Islamic terrorists were on the receiving end of 12 Tomahawk missiles as a present.\n\n“The successful strikes on ISIS, in coordination with the Nigerian government, are just the first step to secure the country and end the slaughter of our brothers and sisters in Christ,” Moore added.\n\nSunday PUNCH learnt that the US had resumed surveillance operations in the Sambisa Forest, Borno State.\n\nA Sahel-focused terrorism tracker, Brant Philip, disclosed this on X on Saturday, sharing flight-tracking data indicating that an aircraft was operating over Borno State.\n\nAccording to the post, the aircraft identified was a Gulfstream V, a long-range business jet commonly modified for ISR missions.\n\n“The United States resumed ISR operations today on ISWAP in the Sambisa forest, Borno State in North-East Nigeria, after a pause of one day following the strikes in Sokoto State,” he wrote.\n\nTerrorists dislocated, may seek international support – Experts\n\nA security analyst and Chief Executive Officer of Beacon Consulting, Kabiru Adamu, said fleeing terrorists might attempt to cohabit with law-abiding citizens.\n\nAdamu, a resident of Sokoto, said the terrorists might also seek support from international terror groups and governments sympathetic to their cause.\n\nHe called on security agencies to enhance surveillance capabilities to monitor terrorist movements and prevent infiltration of safe areas.\n\nAdamu said, “There is going to be dislocation after the US strike. The terrorists will leave known locations and most likely try to integrate with law-abiding communities.\n\n“They will also spin a narrative that a Christian country, the United States, is attacking Muslims in Nigeria. They will not say they are terrorists but will use this to gather support or sympathy.\n\n“They will seek support from other terror groups around the world, including membership, tactics and funding. Nigeria may become a theatre of terror conflict as a result.\n\n“Propaganda is another strategy they will adopt after the attacks, especially in cyberspace. They are likely to release fake news and propaganda materials to drive support and attract funding and membership.”\n\nAlso, a Professor of Political Science and Defence Studies at the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna, Tar Usman, said the US military onslaught would distract the terrorists from planning and executing attacks as they grapple with the reality that a powerful global nation had joined forces with Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the uncertainty surrounding possible future strikes will heighten fear among the terrorists and disrupt their operations.\n\n“We do not know when next they (US) will strike, so there will be panic in the camp of the terrorists, and that is a good one for us because it will distract them from carrying out their notorious activities,” he added.\n\nHe explained that insurgent groups often take advantage of periods of calm to plan attacks, but noted that the current situation could deny them that opportunity.\n\nUsman, however, cautioned that the intervention would not automatically bring an end to terrorism, warning that the groups could adopt new tactics.\n\nHe said, “I can also see a situation where they will try to disappear and mix with the public, but with vigilance, I hope our intelligence agencies would intercept them.\n\n“We should not be under any illusion that they will abandon their notorious activities instantly. Maybe in the fullness of time, we will see the full impact of the US intervention.”\n\nA top government source told Sunday PUNCH that the US and Nigeria were collaborating to end killings, banditry and kidnapping.\n\nThe source disclosed that some of the terrorists were escaping to Kogi and neighbouring states, adding that measures were being put in place to flush them out.","summary":"Following US air strikes in northern Nigeria, suspected terrorists are relocating, causing disarray and prompting heightened security surveillance.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/terrorists-relocate-after-us-air-strikes/","url":"https://punchng.com/terrorists-relocate-after-us-air-strikes/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/15004027/BANDITS.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 00:00:53","author":"Ismaeel Uthman,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Ismaeel Uthman","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":389527304,"title":"Peace Plan in Jeopardy?

Stay in shelters!\" ,Residents reported seeing a blue-and-white flash in the sky over parts of the city, raising concerns that an energy facility may have been struck. Explosions and the sound of air-defence fire continued through the night and into the morning. ,Zelenskyy said shortly before 11:00 that Russia had already launched around 40 missiles and nearly 500 drones, even as the assault was still under way. Further explosions were reported moments later. By the time the first all-clear was issued, Kyiv had been under attack for almost 10 hours. New air-raid warnings followed within an hour.,,Local authorities said two people were killed — one in Kyiv and another in a nearby suburb — and at least 28 others were injured. ,Officials reported fires at multiple locations, including residential high-rise buildings and a university dormitory. Thick plumes of grey smoke were seen rising over the city. ,At one damaged high-rise, firefighters worked from a crane to remove unstable debris from the exposed fourth and fifth floors of the 21-storey building, part of whose outer wall had been torn away. ,Despite the destruction, daily life gradually resumed in some areas, with traffic building on major roads as emergency crews continued their work.,,However, Mayor Klitschko said power outages were still affecting large parts of the city, and nearly one-third of Kyiv remained without heating as temperatures stayed below freezing. ,Zelenskyy is expected to meet Trump in Florida on Sunday to discuss the latest version of a 20-point draft peace plan developed with the United States. The proposal includes security guarantees sought by Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression. ,The Ukrainian president said Saturday's attacks underlined the urgency of those guarantees and the need for continued international support, particularly as Ukraine faces shortages in air-defence systems. ,While Zelenskyy said on Friday that the plan was \"90 percent ready\", Trump later told Politico that the proposal would require his approval. ,\"So we'll see what he's got,\" Trump said. ,Speaking to the New York Post, Trump said he believed there was a \"good shot\" that both sides were ready to broker a deal. ,\"I think they want to do it now, and I think that Russia wants to do it,\" he said. \"But every time one wants to do it, the other doesn't.\"","summary":"Zelenskyy is expected to meet Trump in Florida on Sunday to discuss the latest version of a 20-point draft peace plan developed with the United States","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-plan-kyiv-bombarded-zelenskyy-trump-florida-meet-article-153358632","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153358634,thumbsize-78224,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153358634.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 00:00:27","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":389526890,"title":"EU threatens action against US travel ban on five EU activists","text":"BRUSSELS, Belgium: The Trump administration's decision to impose travel bans on five Europeans has been met with the expected anger by France, Germany, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe U.S. accused the five of pressuring technology firms to censor or suppress American views.\n\nThe EU's executive branch, the European Commission, threatened action against any \"unjustified measures.\" It asked the U.S. State Department to clarify the reasons for the ban.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio characterized the five Europeans as \"radical\" activists and \"weaponized\" nongovernmental organizations.

At the start of the year, few expected Donald Trump's return to the White House to trigger such sharp shifts. Yet one of the biggest surprises has been Washington's change of course on Ukraine.\n\nThe US has moved from being Kiev's closest political patron to a calculating actor focused squarely on its own interests. The rhetoric of Russia's \"unconditional defeat\" has been discarded in favour of negotiations and compromise. If Ukraine has become a loss-making asset in America's geopolitical portfolio, Trump has signalled, then the loss must be recognised.\n\nThis has produced a series of gestures that shocked many Western observers: the public humiliation of the Ukrainian leader in Washington, demands that Kiev pay for military aid, a slowdown in sanctions policy, and the much-discussed summit in Alaska. The conflict has not been resolved, but the door to diplomacy has been left ajar. Moscow supports negotiations, but does not intend to retreat from its positions. The Russian army is advancing, and time, from Moscow's point of view, works in its favour.\n\nAnother dramatic break with past practice has been Trump's decision to launch a trade war against more than seventy countries. Only China responded with serious counter-measures. Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs and strengthened its negotiating hand by introducing export controls on rare-earth metals vital to the US economy, while at the same time seeking a negotiated de-escalation.\n\nIndia also refused to bend. US tariffs on its purchases of Russian oil barely affected Delhi's stance. The same is broadly true of Brazil. In several cases Washington applied tariffs for openly political reasons, even where the trade balance was to its advantage. Trade measures increasingly took on the character of sanctions; occasionally they were accompanied by military strikes, although the White House avoided sliding into a full-scale confrontation with Iran.\n\nPerhaps the most unexpected development has been the deepening estrangement between the US and its traditional allies. Trump's revived talk of buying Greenland, part of Denmark, was symbolic in that respect. So too was Vice-President JD Vance's criticism of European democracy, suggesting that \"Trumpism\" in foreign policy is no longer confined to Trump himself. The new US National Security Strategy urges Western Europe to return to its civilisational roots, warns of the risks of war with Russia, and casts Washington less as a belligerent and more as a mediator. Even the EU has found itself targeted by American tariffs.\n\nFor Brussels, this turn was disorienting. While Western Europe was still marching toward confrontation with Russia, its key ally abruptly stepped aside. In response, EU institutions clung to the old paradigm of \"war to the bitter end\" and unconditional support for Kiev. Brussels introduced three new sanctions packages against Moscow, but they had no discernible impact on Russia's strategic course.\n\nOf course, the contradictions inside the Western bloc should not be exaggerated. Binding military and political commitments remain in place, and previous eras have also seen friction. But the current rupture feels deeper than anything since the 1930s. The shifts underway clearly extend beyond Trump's personality and the short-term political cycle, and they may yet reshape the broader architecture of Euro-Atlantic relations.\n\nThis article was first published byKommersant, and was translated and edited by the RT team.","url":"https://www.beijingnews.net/news/278777905/the-foreign-policy-twist-of-2025-what-trumps-pivot-means-for-ukraine","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/691f55f/d79f8d13-f789-4f5c-866f-a1888abe57ff/0/Zjc3Yzg4MTYtMGV-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.058},{"id":389517688,"title":"EU wants US to clarify travel bans on five Europeans","text":"BRUSSELS, Belgium: The Trump administration's decision to impose travel bans on five Europeans has been met with the expected anger by France, Germany, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe U.S. accused the five of pressuring technology firms to censor or suppress American views.\n\nThe EU's executive branch, the European Commission, threatened action against any \"unjustified measures.\" It asked the U.S. State Department to clarify the reasons for the ban.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio characterized the five Europeans as \"radical\" activists and \"weaponized\" nongovernmental organizations.

Zelenskyy told reporters that he and Trump plan to discuss several matters including security guarantees and territorial issues in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\n“This attack is Russia’s answer on our peace efforts. It really shows that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin doesn’t want peace,” Zelenskyy said after stopping in Canada to meet with Prime Minister Mark Carney in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Carney announced $1.8 billion worth of economic assistance to Ukraine that helps unlock financing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for reconstruction and development.\n\n“The barbarism that we saw overnight, the attack of Kyiv, shows just how important that we stand with Ukraine during this difficult time,” Carney said.\n\nApartment buildings hit\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that it carried out a “massive strike” overnight, using “long-range precision-guided weapons from land, air and sea, including Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles” and drones. It said it targeted energy infrastructure facilities used by Ukraine’s forces and military-industrial enterprises.\n\nBut several residential buildings were struck.\n\nThe ministry said the strike was in response to Ukraine’s attacks on “civilian objects” in Russia.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the ministry said air defenses shot down seven Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Krasnodar and Adygeya overnight. On Saturday afternoon, the ministry said 147 more drones were shot down over a number of Russian regions.\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said air defenses intercepted more than 20 drones “flying towards” the Russian capital on Saturday. He didn’t report any damage or casualties. It wasn’t immediately clear whether those were included in the Defense Ministry’s count.\n\nRussia claims territorial gains\n\nIn what could be viewed as an effort to further ramp up pressure on Ukraine before the Zelenskyy-Trump talks, the Kremlin on Saturday night released a video of Putin in military fatigues receiving reports from top military officials in an unidentified military command post.\n\nRussia’s General Staff chief, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, reported to Putin that the Russian troops have taken full control of Myrnohrad in the Donetsk region — Russia uses the old Soviet name of the city, Dimitrov — the city of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, and a few other settlements.\n\nPutin said that ”if Kyiv authorities are not willing to end the matter peacefully, we will achieve all the goals we have in the special military operation by military means.”\n\nUkraine’s General Staff rejected these claims as “not supported by facts.” It said that the situation in Huliaipole is “difficult, but the defensive operation in the city is ongoing.” In Myrnohrad, the situation remains “challenging.”\n\n“The senior political leadership of the aggressor state has once again resorted to spreading false claims about significant ‘successes’ by the Russian army on the battlefield,” the General Staff said in an online statement.\n\nPoland on alert\n\nPoland scrambled fighter jets and closed airports in Lublin and Rzeszow near the border with Ukraine for several hours during the Russian attacks, the country’s armed forces command said on social media. There was no violation of Polish airspace, it said.\n\nCivil aviation authority Pansa later said the airports had resumed operations. It was unclear what caused the alert in Poland when the Russian attacks were focused on Kyiv, which is far from the border.\n\nRussia targeted Ukraine with 519 drones and 40 missiles, Ukraine’s air force said. The main target was energy and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said. In some districts of the region there is no electricity or heating because of the attacks, he said.\n\nMan burns to death\n\nMore than 10 residential buildings were damaged, Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on social media.\n\nOlena Karpenko, 52, said she heard a man as he burned to death. “His scream is still in my ears. I can’t believe it,” she said, weeping.\n\nKarpenko said they heard a explosion at the nearby thermal power plant, followed by a stronger blast that shook the windows of her home. Then came the strike on her building.\n\nTwo children were among those wounded in the attack, which hit seven locations across the capital, the head of the Kyiv Military Administration, Tymur Tkachenko, said on social media.\n\nA body was found under the rubble of one damaged building, he said. It wasn’t immediately clear if that person was the man who burned to death.\n\nA fire broke out in an 18-story residential building in the Dnipro district, and emergency crews rushed to contain the flames. A 24-story residential building in the Darnytsia district was also hit, Tkachenko said, and more fires broke out in the Obolonskyi and Holosiivsky districts.\n\nIn the wider Kyiv region, the strikes hit industrial and residential buildings, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. In the Vyshhorod area, emergency crews rescued one person found under the rubble of a destroyed house.\n\nUkraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, said on X on Saturday evening that the Russian attack caused “extensive power outages” in Kyiv, saying that hundreds of thousands of customers remained without power.\n\nSecurity guarantees prioritized\n\nZelenskyy told reporters he would aim to ensure there were “ as few unresolved issues as possible ” in talks with Trump, while respecting Ukraine’s red lines.\n\nSpeaking by audio note in a Whatsapp chat with journalists, Zelenskyy said he would prioritize discussing security guarantees for Ukraine. He has said that in the draft peace plan, the U.S. has committed to providing guarantees that mirror the NATO alliance’s Article 5, which means an attack on Ukraine would trigger a collective military response from the U.S. and its allies.\n\nBut key details must be worked out in a bilateral agreement.\n\nTerritorial concessions are the most sensitive of issues the two leaders will discuss.\n\nDasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, Rob Gillies in Toronto and Volodymyr Yurchuk in Kyiv contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine","summary":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepared to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/27/russia-strikes-ukraines-capital-and-kills-at-least-1-person-a-day-before-zelenskyy-trump-meeting/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Russia_Ukraine_War_16517-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 23:59:54","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":389522256,"title":"Walz slammed in wake of viral video that raises daycare funding questions: 'Needs to be held accountable'","text":"Politicians took to social media Saturday to criticize Minnesota Gov.

Grenell wrote that the decision was “very costly to a non-profit Arts institution” and said he would seek $1m in damages “for this political stunt”. Demonstrators protest at the John F.

He said the concert had become a regular holiday event and often included a student musician. Trump appointed Grenell to lead the Kennedy Center after removing the previous leadership.

However, recent trading suggests that some investors are booking profits. AMD stock is down 19% since hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29.\n\nThis pullback could be a buying opportunity for investors looking to add a fast-growing company that's benefiting from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, a recent announcement by President Donald Trump, which will allow companies like Nvidia (NVDA +1.02%), AMD, and Intel to sell their advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, is going to give AMD an additional boost in 2026.\n\nLet's take a closer look at AMD's catalysts for the new year and see why this stock has the potential to soar once again.\n\nThe Trump administration's announcement could give AMD a big shot in the arm\n\nAMD's business grew at a nice clip in 2025. It is on track to deliver $34 billion in revenue for the year, up 31% over 2024 revenue. It might have been even better, but AMD hasn't been able to sell its chips into the Chinese market since April, when the Trump administration imposed export controls on sales of advanced AI data center chips to that country.\n\nAs a result, AMD incurred an $800 million inventory charge in the second quarter. Moreover, the company lost a significant chunk of its revenue stream thanks to the Trump administration's move. That's because China accounted for nearly a quarter of AMD's 2024 revenue of $25.8 billion, or almost $6.2 billion.\n\nDespite the headwind, analysts expect a 20% increase in the company's earnings for 2025 to $3.97 per share. Consensus estimates suggest that AMD's earnings could jump 62% next year to $6.46 per share. I think it could end up doing much better than that.\n\nTake Nvidia, for example. The Trump administration now allows Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to Chinese customers. Nvidia was previously only selling its downsized H20 chips in China to comply with export regulations. Those chips were significantly cheaper and less powerful than Nvidia's flagship Hopper processor, the H200.\n\nWith the change, Nvidia will likely see a significant bump in its revenue next year, even after paying the 25% tax that the administration plans to charge on sales to China. President Trump pointed out in his Truth Social post that the \"same approach will apply to AMD,\" suggesting that the company may be able to sell its high-end chips to Chinese customers.\n\nIt was earlier selling the downgraded MI308 processor to Chinese customers. It may now be able to ship its more powerful chips into that market, just like Nvidia has been allowed to. So, there is a possibility of AMD regaining the lost Chinese revenue in 2026, even with the 25% export fee.\n\nThat's because a full-fledged AMD data center graphics processing unit (GPU) will carry a significant premium over the nerfed MI308. This is why AMD's sales next year could turn out to be much higher than expected.\n\nThe stock could skyrocket in 2026\n\nAnalysts anticipate AMD's revenue to jump by 31% in 2026 to $44.6 billion. Assuming its revenue from China next year lands at 2024 levels of $6.2 billion, its top line could be somewhere around $51 billion. What's worth noting is that analysts haven't adjusted their 2026 revenue expectations for AMD following the Trump administration's rule change, suggesting that the company's potential gains from China aren't baked in just yet.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nAssuming AMD does achieve $51 billion in revenue next year and maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could jump to $561 billion. That points toward a potential jump of 60% from its current market cap. So, now it would be a good time to buy this semiconductor stock following its recent pullback, as it has the potential to soar impressively in the new year.","summary":"A recent announcement by the Trump administration should help reopen a lucrative revenue stream for AMD.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/27/predict-amd-stock-jump-60-2026-donald-trump/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F848518%2Famd-headquarters-santa-clara-with-amd-logo-on-building_amd_advance.jpg&w=1200&op=resize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 23:30:00","author":"Harsh Chauhan","authors":["Harsh Chauhan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":389524528,"title":"Russia strikes Ukraine's capital, kills at least 1 person day before Zelenskyy-Trump meeting","text":"KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia attacked Ukraine's capital with ballistic missiles and drones on Saturday, killing at least one person and wounding 27, a day before talks between the leaders of Ukraine and the United States, authorities said.\n\nExplosions boomed across Kyiv as the attack began in early morning and continued for hours.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepared to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday for further talks on ending the nearly four-year war.
