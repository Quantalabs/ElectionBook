He wants that to change.\n\n“If there’s a supplemental bill that comes, I’m going to ask the congress to waive NEPA requirements,” Duffy said. \n\nAccording to Duffy, it is of national importance to build control towers and install fiber-optic cables. Without environmental reviews these projects would be completed faster.\n\nDuffy said it is hard for the FAA to plan, and that the agency — which is a part of the Department of Transportation — does not have the best contracts to get upgrades done on budget and on time.\n\nWhile Congress sometimes “spends money like drunken sailors,” Duffy said, his department wants to execute a single plan to modernize air traffic safety systems nationwide with the $12-plus billion in Trump’s bill.\n\n“This is why we’re asking for all the money up front, and if not all of it, as much as possible,” Duffy said.","summary":"The transportation secretary  vouched for Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" Thursday at the base of the air traffic control tower at San Diego's airport.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/06/19/duffy-stumps-for-trump-in-san-diego-calls-for-air-traffic-control-overhaul/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-19-at-5.49.57 PM.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 00:59:30","author":"James Miller","authors":["James Miller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":333247808,"title":"Israel-Iran conflict: ‘The war to end wars,’ says Israeli ambassador","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Politics June 19, 2025 06:34 \n\n Israel-Iran conflict: ‘The war to end wars,’ says Israeli ambassador \n Israeli Amb. to the U.S. Yechiel Leiter discusses President Donald Trump’s ‘measured’ approach to the Israel-Iran conflict and the existential threat posed by Iran on ‘The Bottom Line.’\n\nTags POLITICSWHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESV-VIDEOS","summary":"Israeli Amb. to the U.S. Yechiel Leiter discusses President Donald Trump’s ‘measured’ approach to the Israel-Iran conflict and the existential threat posed by Iran on ‘The Bottom Line.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6374596823112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/2a9fb74e-28c5-4945-bab3-e452374c3713/de3f98fb-f12d-4515-87d5-9ec0446d75d0/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 00:43:26","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":333246046,"title":"The bomb from hell... So will the US deploy it? Can it take out Iran's nuclear site? And what would happen next?: MARK ALMOND","text":"Donald Trump loves to back a winner. And with the military momentum now heavily on Israel's side, it would be no surprise if the 47th President eventually decides to join the party and attack Iran's key nuclear facilities.\n\nThe prospect of a quick win – of epoch-making regime change, even – must be tempting for a man who has already let it be known he wants a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nMuch has been made of America's 15-ton Massive Ordnance Penetrator, the GBU-57, the only bomb in the world thought capable of reaching Iran's heavily protected nuclear enrichment plants.\n\nDelivered by giant B2 stealth bombers, this 'bunker buster' has been specifically developed to destroy targets deep underground.\n\nThe theory is that a series of GPS-guided bombs can be dropped in perfect sequence, one on top of the other, each penetrating 200ft deeper until the target is reached.\n\nYet, however impressive the technology, the task remains formidable.\n\nAny attempt to knock out Iran's nuclear capability means destroying the Fordow enrichment facilities, which lie below as much as half a mile of rock and reinforced concrete. Even the main entrance is hidden, Bond-style, hundreds of feet below ground.\n\nTo have any hope of success, the futuristic B2 bombers have to travel, unscathed, deep into the heart of Iran.\n\nTrump's advisers will also know that the famed 'bunker busters' have never yet been tested on the battlefield.\n\nTrue, the Israelis used a similar approach to kill Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last autumn in Beirut.\n\nBut the precision bombs used then were much smaller and Nasrallah was only 60ft below the surface when he was blown up.\n\nIn short, it's not at all clear that any American attempt to destroy Fordow or its uranium enrichment facilities will succeed.\n\nMilitary failure is not the only danger facing Trump, should he decide to press ahead with a bombing raid. There is no sign that an attack, even if successful, would lead to an Iranian surrender or bring the fighting to a convenient close.\n\nI would put money on the opposite in fact. The mullahs are fighting for their lives.\n\nWith millions of Iranians enraged by years of oppression and incompetence, a humiliating surrender would mean certain death to the regime – and its leaders.\n\nFor the sake of their own survival, the mullahs must be seen to strike back at Israel and America – and continue lashing out – raising the stakes ever higher as they do so. That's why many fear, for example, that Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow seaway which carries a fifth of the world's oil and liquified gas.\n\nThere are already reports that Tehran is using electronic warfare to disrupt shipping in the Strait, leading to at least one major collision.\n\nDesperate, the ayatollahs have threatened to take the fight to the Great Satan itself, with attacks on American bases in neighbouring countries.\n\nOr they might unleash terrorist and sabotage groups against US citizens and their business interests around the Middle East and beyond. The Little Satan, the UK, will also be in the crosshairs, the more so if the ayatollahs think twice about daring to provoke Uncle Sam.\n\nThe Diego Garcia base on the Chagos Islands – still owned by Britain – is the likely launch pad for any B2 strikes and could suffer retaliation.\n\nBut the British military bases on Cyprus might make a better target. Firing missiles at British intelligence and electronic surveillance assets at Akrotiri on the south Cyprus coast – which are umbilically linked to the work of the US spy agencies – would send a stark message, not only to Whitehall but to Washington's allies: there is a steep price to be paid for backing America. Iran has no nuclear weapons, but it does have chemical weapons. Should these be used on Tel Aviv, there is no saying what level of destruction will be rained down on Tehran in response. Many in Israel see this as an existential struggle, after all.\n\nIt is all the more troubling that leadership in the region is so unstable.\n\nIran's Ayatollah Khamenei is not the only one under vast pressure.\n\nIt is unlikely that Benjamin Netanyahu's political career can survive anything short of a complete victory: the destruction of Iran's nuclear capacity and regime change.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister, remember, faces prosecution on corruption charges at home and is desperate to claim a major victory.\n\nHis critics have accused Netanyahu of wanting to keep his nation at war for as long possible, ensuring that he remains in post – and out of court.\n\nDonald Trump himself, is a long way from predictable, of course.\n\nNow 79, the president has been showing symptoms of a scatter-gun approach to problems ranging from world trade and migration to war in Ukraine.\n\nThe death of American servicemen could easily provoke a violent response from Washington, which has moved three US nuclear-powered aircraft carrier groups within striking distance of Iran in the last few days.\n\nOther nuclear-armed powers also have an interest in the region, of course.\n\nMoscow will be loath to lose such an important ally as Tehran, although for the moment President Putin seems powerless to intervene.\n\nBut China could, and very well might. Iran offers an essential transport link for China's vast exports to Europe and the Middle East now that the railway route through Russia has been blocked by sanctions (following Putin's invasion of Ukraine).\n\nChina also imports oil and liquefied natural gas from Iran and its neighbours by sea.\n\nAny further disruption would be bad for world energy prices – and Trump's chances at the polls – but would hit China's economy particularly hard.\n\nBeijing's navy has been designed to fight a US fleet in the western Pacific, but it is perfectly well-equipped to clash with American warships blockading Iran. Now there are reports of Chinese surveillance ships in the Gulf.\n\nSo, even if the fear of Iranian nukes is exorcised, other apocalyptic scenarios are fast developing.\n\nSparks from the Middle East could fly far – and ignite a vastly bigger war, perhaps even with a nuclear dimension.\n\nIran is no longer a problem from which Trump can walk away – although I'm in little doubt that he will try if the situation starts unravelling.\n\nWhile President Harry Truman, who authorised the nuclear bombing of Japan in 1945, had a sign on his desk reading 'the buck stops here', Trump has shown a very different cast of mind, preferring to blame others.\n\nBut conflict takes on a life of its own. As Trotsky once warned: 'You might not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.'\n\nAmerica – and the rest of us – must pray we don't have to learn his lesson the hard way.\n\nMark Almond is director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford.","summary":"Donald Trump loves to back a winner, says MARK ALMOND.

The protest was organized by the California Family Council, which announced the rally in a press release Thursday. Multiple female athletes will speak at a press conference at the event, including Taylor Starling, Kaitlyn Slavin and Celeste Duyst. Starling and Slavin are engaged in a lawsuit against their school district, the Riverside Unified School District, after a trans athlete took Starling's varsity cross-country spot last fall, and they allege school administrators compared their \"Save Girls Sports\" T-shirts to swastikas. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Duyst went viral for a speech she gave at a Lucia Mar Unified School District board meeting in April, where she cried while recounting having to share a locker room with a trans athlete before track practice. \"This is about justice,\" California Family Council Outreach Director Sophia Lorey said in the press release. \"Girls across California are being sidelined by policies that ignore biological reality. CIF must answer for that.\" The rally will come weeks after the state was rocked by the presence of a trans athlete at the CIF track and field championships, where Jurupa Valley High School's transgender student AB Hernandez took first place in the high jump and triple jump. FOOTAGE SHOWS LGBTQ PROTESTER ATTACKING CONSERVATIVE AT CALIFORNIA TRACK CHAMPIONSHIP AMID TRANS ATHLETE DRAMA President Donald Trump sent a message to the state in the week leading up to the event, warning of potential federal funding cuts if a trans athlete was allowed to compete in the girls championship. The CIF amended its rules to allow girls who finish behind a trans athlete to be elevated to the spot they would have finished otherwise, but Hernandez was still allowed to compete. Girls who finished behind Hernandez in the championships then had to share the same podium spot with the trans athlete during medal ceremonies. Trump then vowed to impose \"large-scale fines\" on the state of California for allowing a biological male trans athlete to win multiple girls state titles on June 3. \"A Biological Male competed in California Girls State Finals, WINNING BIG, despite the fact that they were warned by me not to do so. As Governor Gavin Newscum fully understands, large scale fines will be imposed!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. The Department of Justice announced a federal probe of California over potential Title IX violations regarding its policy allowing trans athletes in girls sports in late May. The state had already been under a Department of Education investigation over the issue since February. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the U.S. Department of Justice sending a letter warning of a June 9 deadline to amend its policies to bar trans athletes from girls sports. \"We’re very concerned with the Trump administration’s ongoing threats to California schools and remain committed to defending and upholding California laws and all additional laws which ensure the rights of students — including transgender students — to be free from discrimination and harassment. We are reviewing the letter and closely monitoring the Trump administration’s actions in this space,\" the statement said. A bipartisan survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found the majority of California residents oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women's sports. That figure included more than 70% of the state's school parents. \"Most Californians support requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the sex they were assigned at birth,\" the poll stated. \"Solid majorities of adults (65%) and likely voters (64%) support requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with. An overwhelming majority of public school parents (71%) support such a requirement.\" Newsom said trans athletes competing in girls sports was \"deeply unfair\" during an episode of his podcast in March.

Until now, Foxconn has focused on iPhone assemblies in India, harnessing its Sriperumbudur facility.121960402However, the company is rapidly expanding the scope of work through its upcoming plant in Devanahalli, near Bengaluru. In addition to iPhone assembly, Foxconn also has a new unit in Hyderabad that is assembling AirPods. Foxconn plans to start making enclosures in Tamil Nadu as they deepen their footprint in the country, one person cited above said. Construction has begun for their enclosures unit at the industrial park. This will be a separate unit close to their upcoming display module assembly plant which is in advanced stages in the same industrial park. 121960377Analysts said Foxconn’s entry into this space shows that Apple is looking to diversify its suppliers in India, much like in China where it has multiple vendors for different components. This aligns well with Apple’s broader strategy to derisk and diversify its supply chain, said Prabhu Ram, vice president, industry research group, CyberMedia Research. As India emerges as a lynchpin in Apple’s growth momentum — with early signs of an end-to-end manufacturing ecosystem taking shape — it is a natural progression for Foxconn to expand its capabilities and geographic presence by manufacturing enclosures. Queries sent to Foxconn and Apple remained unanswered as of press time Thursday.Sourcing depth Neil Shah, vice president, Counterpoint Research, also said Apple globally sources enclosures from multiple players and Foxconn is one of them. Hence, it was natural for Foxconn to diversify the production in India, Shah said. This gives Apple more leverage and also provides Foxconn with ease of integration and boosts value addition, he said. This improves supply chain effectiveness for Foxconn as well as Apple. He added that it was difficult to quantify value addition individually but for Apple specifically, Foxconn's value addition would be under 10%. Further, he said enclosures constitute a small percentage of Apple's Bill of Materials (BoM), roughly about 2–3%. So Foxconn's foray into enclosures will not significantly add to their value addition in percentage terms. It is, however, a significant move as Apple gradually increases its manufacturing presence in India. ET was the first to report on September 25 last year that Foxconn was looking to set up an assembly unit for smartphone display modules in Tamil Nadu, making it the first such facility catering to Apple. Later, on October 8, the Tamil Nadu cabinet cleared a Rs 13,180 crore investment by Yuzhan Technology (India), which is a unit of Foxconn.Sources had said at the time that Foxconn had picked up about 500,000 square feet at a plug and play facility at the ESR Oragadam Industrial & Logistics Park, which is right next to their smartphone assembly unit near Chennai.They added that the maker of the iconic iPhone is leaning in for a model wherein even other contract manufacturers — Pegatron or Tata Electronics, for instance — can use components from this unit rather than import modules that are assembled in China.On May 19, Foxconn said it was investing an additional $1.5 billion (about Rs 12,800 crore) in this unit via a London Stock Exchange filing.All of this expansion news comes on the back of Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent statements that India will become the primary manufacturing hub for iPhones sold in the US. For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin, Cook said during Apple's Q1 earnings call on May 1.Tariff tribulationsUS President Donald Trump, however, has not taken kindly to Apple expanding its presence in the country and even threatened to have the company pay a 25% tariff if phones sold in the US were not made in the US on May 23. This tariff threat came a week after he said he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India. I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.Foxconn plans for expansion, however, continue.The company has a huge factory coming up in Bengaluru and has a new unit in Hyderabad that is targeting AirPods — showing that the company is broadening its portfolio and venturing into other areas of production in India.ET had reported on March 30 that Foxconn is targeting producing 25-30 million iPhones out of their India facilities, which is more than double their production number from last year, as per sources.","summary":"Foxconn is planning to manufacture iPhone enclosures in India, establishing a new unit in Tamil Nadu.

As a physician, I believe yoga is as essential as breathing and taking medication. Yoga helps reduce anxiety, improve depression, and for children, it helps their attention span, concentration, ability to focus on a task, and ability to complete a task,\" she said. Acharya Madhuvartanand Avdhut from Ananda Marga Yoga and Meditation Centre also shared his thoughts, saying, \"The first yogi was Lord Shiva, who came to this earth 7000 years ago. Yoga has three different parts. Yog Asana, Yog Darshan and Yog Sadhana... Yoga is a multi-faceted approach to healthy living. Yoga can bring world peace and it can unite human society...\"\nThe event reflected the growing global embrace of Yoga not just as a physical discipline but as a holistic path to well-being, inner peace, and universal harmony. This year in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lead the national celebrations from Visakhapatnam, where he will participate in the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP) session at the city's beachfront. Nearly 5 lakh participants are expected to join him in the mass yoga demonstration.\nSimultaneously, Yoga Sangam events will be held at over 3.5 lakh locations across India, making this one of the largest coordinated Yoga celebrations. In addition, citizen engagement initiatives like 'Yoga with Family' and youth-focused campaigns under 'Yoga Unplugged' have been launched on digital platforms such as MyGov and MyBharat to promote participation and awareness. According to the release from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the 2025 theme -- \"Yoga for One Earth, One Health\" -- highlights the interconnectedness of human and planetary health and echoes the global vision of collective wellness, rooted in India's philosophy of \"Sarve Santu Niramaya\" (May all be free from disease). Since 2015, when the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted India's proposal to observe 21st June as IDY, the Prime Minister has led the celebrations from various locations, including New Delhi, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Mysuru, New York (UN Headquarters), and Srinagar. IDY has since evolved into a powerful global health movement.

CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement,\" a DHS statement said.The incident comes against a backdrop of heightened tensions in Los Angeles, which has become ground zero of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown across the United States.The city has seen scattered violence but mostly peaceful protests in recent weeks, ignited by an escalation in federal immigration sweeps that have targeted migrant workers in garment factories, car washes and other workplaces.Local media reported further raids across the city on Thursday targeting Home Depot stores, a home improvement retailer where day laborers often gather in parking lots seeking work.In addition to the mobilization of ICE agents, Trump has ordered the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines into the city in response to the protests -- a move opposed by city leaders and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is a Democrat.The incident at Dodger Stadium on Thursday comes as the reigning World Series champions have faced criticism for their response to the immigration crackdown.The team has a heavily Latino fan base, with some claiming a sense of betrayal over the franchise's failure to speak out against the ongoing raids.As of early Thursday, the Dodgers have made no formal statement in regard to the immigration raids across the city.The team's failure to condemn the immigration offensive came under scrutiny last weekend, when Latin American pop singer Nezza defied Dodgers officials and sang the US national anthem in Spanish before the team's home game.Speaking outside Dodger Stadium on Thursday after federal agents had left the venue, one 27-year-old fan among a small group of protesters told AFP she felt let down by the team.\"They've been very quiet since these ICE raids started, and I think it's very hypocritical of them not to say anything when the majority of their fan base is the Latino population here in Los Angeles,\" Paola, who asked only to be identified by her first name, told AFP.\"It 100 percent feels like betrayal. I was born and raised here, I've supported them my whole life -- for them not to come out and support us during these times is messed up.\"Los Angeles Times sports columnist Dylan Hernandez has slammed the team's response to the immigration crackdown.\"The Dodgers boast that more than 40 percent of their fan base is Latino, but they can't even be bothered to offer the shaken community any words of comfort,\" Hernandez wrote. \"How ungrateful. How disrespectful. How cowardly.\"While the Dodgers have remained silent, the team's popular outfielder Enrique Hernandez lashed out against the raids in a statement on Instagram.\"I am saddened and infuriated by what's happening in our country and our city,\" wrote Hernandez, who is from Puerto Rico.\"This is my second home. And I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart.

Addressing a briefing at the White House, Leavitt read out a statement from President Trump, who acknowledged the potential for diplomatic negotiations despite the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

Leavitt also reiterated the administration's stance on Iran's nuclear program. In response to a question about the contours of any possible deal with Iran, Leavitt said, \"No enrichment of Uranium and... Iran is absolutely not able to achieve a nuclear weapon. The President has been very clear about that.\" Also Read | Israel-Iran Conflict: Iranian Missiles Hit Soroka Hospital in Beersheba, Wound Over 200, Israel Threatens Iran's Top Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nThe remarks come amid heightened tensions following nearly a week of military strikes between Israel and Iran. President Trump, speaking on Wednesday, dismissed suggestions that he had already approved a military plan and reiterated his preference for a diplomatic resolution. \"I'm not looking to fight. But if it's a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do,\" Trump said. The conflict escalated on June 12, when Israel launched 'Operation Rising Lion', targeting Iran's nuclear and military facilities. Iran has since retaliated, resulting in intense exchanges across the region. On Thursday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called for direct action against Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, citing Iran's attack on Soroka Hospital in southern Israel a day earlier. \"Khamenei openly declares that he wants Israel destroyed - he personally gives the order to fire on hospitals. He considers the destruction of the state of Israel to be a goal; such a man can no longer be allowed to exist,\" Katz said. The White House continues to maintain that while military options remain on the table, diplomatic engagement with Iran is still possible. Trump is expected to make his final decision on the matter within the next two weeks.

'We will exact the full price from the tyrants in Tehran.'\n\nThe hospital hit threatened to tip the Middle East into all-out war as Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, said that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, 'can no longer be allowed to exist', branding him 'the modern Hitler'.\n\nMr Netanyahu also refused to rule out an assassination attempt. The US has previously vetoed two attempts on Khamenei's life.\n\nIsrael also intensified its aerial attacks on Iran, blowing a large hole in a heavy water nuclear facility in Arak, having warned locals to evacuate the area in advance. \n\nEarlier in the week an Israeli strike hit the building housing Iran's state broadcaster in Tehran. Mr Trump's surprise retreat appeared a victory for the UK-led diplomatic push as Sir Keir Starmer appealed for 'cool heads'.\n\nThe Prime Minister said: 'The principle is we need to de-escalate this. There is a real risk of escalation here that will impact the region, akin to Gaza, and will impact the economy.\n\n'Yes, the nuclear issue needs to be dealt with but it is better dealt with by way of negotiations rather than conflict. \n\n'I have been absolutely clear, we need to de-escalate this.'\n\nLast night, Foreign Secretary David Lammy held talks with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington. Mr Lammy's also reinforced the de-escalation message.\n\nIt is understood Mr Lammy will fly back from the US to attend the crunch discussions in Switzerland with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi.\n\nFrench and German foreign ministers are also due to attend. But the countries' positions on the conflict are opposed.\n\nFrance's president Emmanuel Macron has been critical of Israel and called for peace, while Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz has supported Israel's actions.\n\nPresident Trump's peace envoy Steve Witkoff is also understood to be speaking to the Iranian foreign minister, who has repeatedly insisted Iran is acting in self-defence.\n\nBritain and Europe were also said to have warned Mr Trump that bombing Iran would put Westerners at risk, fearing that it would trigger a wave of revenge attacks.\n\nThe two-week time limit is a tactic the President has used before, notably with Vladimir Putin over the future of Ukraine.\n\nBut, given that deadline has now twice passed without any concessions from the Russian president, questions were last night being asked of how serious all of Mr Trump's tough talk is.\n\nCalls for a pause in hostilities came hours after US sources confirmed that the President had signed off detailed plans for US operations against Iranian nuclear facilities, believing they needed to be wiped out to stop Tehran forging an atomic bomb.\n\nIsrael has attacked what it can but only 30,000lb US 'bunker buster' bombs have the capability to destroy plants such as at Fordow, deep in a mountain.\n\nSources told CBS News that Mr Trump was open to letting Iran shut down Fordow but had made up his mind that it could not continue to operate. 'He believes there's not much choice,' one source said. 'Finishing the job means destroying Fordow.'\n\nThe Israelis have also said that Operation Rising Lion, as the now seven-day bombing campaign has been called, would be a failure if Fordow remained.\n\nMs Leavitt said that regime change was not Mr Trump's priority and called for people to 'trust President Trump'. She stressed that there was no change in the US's position that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb.\n\nHowever, his apparent climbdown may owe more to how divisive military action was among President Trump's supporters, with the question of whether to bomb Iran causing infighting among his base.","summary":"'Israel hit Natanz, Isfahan, Khandab, and Arak but they were already evacuated',  Iranian commander Mohsen Rezaei said on Thursday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14830101/Defiant-Iran-boasts-nuclear-material-safe-place.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/20/00/99552793-0-image-a-30_1750376148662.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/19/4118108703063363385/1024x576_MP4_4118108703063363385.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-20 00:12:41","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol,Natalie Lisbona Jerusalem Correspondent,Olivia Allhusen","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol","Natalie Lisbona Jerusalem Correspondent","Olivia Allhusen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.045},{"id":333244786,"title":"World News | Operation Sindhu Underway: India to Evacuate Nationals from Israel","text":"New Delhi [India], June 20 (ANI): In view of the recent developments between Israel and Iran, the Indian government has decided to evacuate from Israel those Indian nationals who wish to leave, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement on Thursday.

She then delivered the iced coffee to the customer. \n\n“Working the drive-thru at Dunkin’ Donuts,” she wrote atop the clip on Tuesday. \n\nIn the caption, she teased another Dunkin’ Donuts-themed video. “If it’s on the Dunkin’ menu, I tried it,” she wrote, directing social media users to a YouTube link. \n\nIn the clip posted Thursday, Kai conducted a blind taste test of beverages on the donut-maker’s menu. \n\n“I’m gonna try whatever drinks are in front of me!” the social media personality told viewers before a pal wrapped a black blindfold around her eyes. \n\nDuring the minute-long video, Kai accurately identified a mango lemonade, a guava lemonade, and a water with a pump of berry. \n\nAn attempt to identify a strawberry drink fell flat, with Kai guessing “some fruit” before admitting, “yeah I don’t know.” She also failed to identify a mystery drink, ending the taste test with a score of three out of five. \n\nBut fans were particularly amused by Kai’s attempt to work the Dunkin’ window. \n\n“That’s hilarious. You’re even matching the logo,” observed a follower of Kai’s Dunkin’-themed fashion choice. \n\n“I would actually die if Kai Trump were to give me my Dunkin’ order,” confessed another. “Side hustle,” quipped a third alongside a laughing emoji. \n\nStill others weren’t fooled by Kai’s humble stint at the drive-thru. “Princess of America,” commented one TikTok user. \n\nKai is the oldest child of Donald Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. and his ex-wife Vanessa, whom he divorced in 2018.\n\nThe former couple also shares Donald Trump III, 16, Tristan, 13, Spencer, 12, and Chloe, 11. \n\nIn May, Kai took to TikTok to mark her “last day being 17” ahead of her 18th birthday. In the video, she danced in a black mini dress to Nelly Furtado’s “Promiscuous.”","summary":"The 18-year-old rocked the company's colors with a bright pink tank top, orange tennis skirt, and white sneakers while working the window at the iconic donut shop.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/06/19/celebrity-news/donald-trumps-granddaughter-kai-works-at-dunkin-donuts-drive-thru/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/106792851.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 00:10:21","author":"Audrey Rock,mliss1578","authors":["Audrey Rock","mliss1578"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.142},{"id":333244802,"title":"World News | PM Modi Thanks Croatian PM for Solidarity After Pahalgam Terror Attack, Calls for United Global Action Against Terrorism","text":"Zagreb [Croatia], June 20 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi has thanked Prime Minister of Croatia, Andrej Plenkovic, for the solidarity extended to India in the aftermath of the April 22 terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pajalgam, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement on Thursday.

While the focus is understandably on cutting taxes for the American people, what this bill accomplishes for students in education has largely been overlooked.\n\nCongress intends for the legislation to significantly overhaul student loans for postsecondary education. In May, members of the House Committee on Education and Workforce passed their part of the bill that would mandate colleges to pay “a portion of their students’ unpaid loans based on how much of a return on investment the degree provided.”\n\nThe House Committee explained institutions that continue to pile debt onto students will “risk loss of access to federal student aid.” In other words, the federal government will now hold colleges accountable for their actions.\n\nIf students amass significant debt earning a degree that did not help provide them with a career in the long run, colleges will now be responsible for that debt. This means that if universities continue to provide ideological degrees such as gender studies or ethnic studies, those same universities will bear the brunt of the costs for students who struggle to succeed in life. Universities that prioritize ideology over academia will now face the consequences and costs of their actions.\n\nIf Congress manages to pass the Big Beautiful Bill, caps will also be placed on how much debt students can take out for college. Undergraduate students will have a borrowing cap in place of $50,000 to ensure they do not sink into insurmountable debt. There will additionally be a $100,000 cap on loans for graduate students and a $150,000 cap for professional students.\n\nIn recent years, universities have increasingly raised the costs of their classes and created new programs that administrators know will not help their students in the real world. The bill introduces new safeguards for students while forcing universities to take responsibility for their predatory practices. Before the most recent presidential election, Joe Biden and his administration attempted to forgive billions of dollars in federal loans and succeeded to a certain extent. In 2022, the Biden administration attempted to forgive up to $20,000 in student loans for Americans. (RELATED: White House Pressures Congress To Pass ‘Beautiful’ Bill By July 4 Though Hurdles Remain)\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled a year later that the administration had overstepped its authority, but this did not stop Biden from carrying his plan forward. The Biden administration used already existing programs to cancel approximately $183 billion of federal student loans for more than 5 million people, essentially placing the burden on American taxpayers. Congress plans to ensure that a future administration can never do this again through the bill.\n\nThe bill will close and repeal regulations and programs that the Biden administration used to either forgive loans or pause them altogether, such as the “Saving on a Valuable Education” (SAVE) repayment plan that substantially lowered payments borrowers had to make depending on their income. After 20 to 25 years, the program would cancel the remaining debt. While a federal court has suspended the program for now, the bill would permanently eliminate it, ensuring that the federal government can never attempt to use the SAVE program to stall or forgive loans again. This eliminates the incentive for schools to continue increasing costs for students since loan debt will no longer simply disappear.\n\nIn another attempt to rein in the unchecked power of universities, the House’s version of the Big Beautiful Bill will raise the endowment tax up to 21 percent if an institution has a student adjusted endowment of $2 million or more. The Senate version raises the endowment tax to a lower 8 percent but still an increase. Universities that receive the largest endowments typically have wasted money promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, such as Harvard and Yale.\n\nUntil the current Trump administration, these universities have received federal funding as well as endowments without significant pushback. With a greater endowment tax in place, universities will now be forced to pay their fair share of taxes on their income.\n\nThe administration’s move to withhold federal funding from universities that promote DEI adds extra pressure for these schools to act in good faith now that endowments will likely be taxed. Overall, the Big Beautiful Bill is introducing much needed reforms that ensure students are protected from predatory universities that care more about expanding their profit margins than the crippling debt placed on their students. If the bill passes, students will have long overdue guardrails ensuring universities no longer have the power to take advantage of them.\n\nRather than keeping authority consolidated in the leadership of these universities, the Big Beautiful Bill finally gives the power to students to better control their own education.\n\nCasey Ryan is a writer and investigative reporter at Defending Education.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

She credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership for its international recognition and called it one of India's greatest cultural diplomacy achievements. Speaking to ANI, Singla said, \"I think Yoga has been the biggest success story in our cultural diplomacy so far.

Commenting on this year's theme -- 'Yoga for One Earth, One Health', Singla said that it reflects the true essence of Yoga, which goes beyond physical exercise to focus on inner peace and holistic health. Also Read | Israel-Iran Conflict: Iranian Missiles Hit Soroka Hospital in Beersheba, Wound Over 200, Israel Threatens Iran's Top Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\"Yoga for One Earth, One Health' is the theme for this year's International Day of Yoga. I think it's an excellent theme because Yoga is not just about 'asanas', making your body more flexible, it's about discovering the stillness within, connecting with your breath and finding inner peace. Today, all doctors and scientists in the world are saying that your health is very closely connected to how peaceful you are on the inside, and how calm your nervous system is. Because we are a whole, we are energy, we are 'prana', and we in India know this. But today, the whole world is discovering the mind-body connection,\" she said. She added that preparations for International Day of Yoga began months ago, with Indian missions and cultural centers around the world hosting events in the run-up to June 21. \"Preparations started six months ago because we do a 100-day countdown, 75-day countdown, 50-day countdown, 25-day countdown and finally the International Day of Yoga on 21st June. So, more than 200 Indian Embassies all over the world have already been doing Yoga events for more than 100 days. A number of events have already happened, and the biggest one will happen on 21st June. So, we have been very busy. All the funding for these events, monetary support, comes from ICCR. So, we draw up a budget plan and allocate funds to embassies, consulates, and cultural centres. So, that work began quite a few months ago,\" she said. This year, PM Modi will lead the national celebrations from Visakhapatnam, where he will participate in the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP) session at the city's beachfront. Nearly 5 lakh participants are expected to join him in the mass yoga demonstration.\nSimultaneously, Yoga Sangam events will be held at over 3.5 lakh locations across India, making this one of the largest coordinated Yoga celebrations. In addition, citizen engagement initiatives like 'Yoga with Family' and youth-focused campaigns under 'Yoga Unplugged' have been launched on digital platforms such as MyGov and MyBharat to promote participation and awareness. According to the release from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the 2025 theme -- \"Yoga for One Earth, One Health\" -- highlights the interconnectedness of human and planetary health and echoes the global vision of collective wellness, rooted in India's philosophy of \"Sarve Santu Niramaya\" (May all be free from disease). Since 2015, when the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted India's proposal to observe 21st June as IDY, the Prime Minister has led the celebrations from various locations, including New Delhi, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Mysuru, New York (UN Headquarters), and Srinagar. IDY has since evolved into a powerful global health movement.

He also wants to protect Americans’ data and privacy concerns on this app. And he believes we can do both at the same time.”\n\nIt is the third time Trump has extended the deadline. The first one was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — took effect. The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump’s tariff announcement.\n\nIt is not clear how many times Trump can — or will — keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges to fight them. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a “warm spot for TikTok.”\n\nTikTok praised Trump for signing an extension Thursday.\n\n“We are grateful for President Trump’s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance’s Office,” the company said in a statement.\n\nAs the extensions continue, it appears less and less likely that TikTok will be banned in the U.S. any time soon. The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court — unlike many of Trump’s other executive orders.\n\nJeremy Goldman, analyst at Emarketer, called TikTok’s U.S situation a “deadline purgatory.”\n\nThe whole thing “is starting to feel less like a ticking clock and more like a looped ringtone. This political Groundhog Day is starting to resemble the debt ceiling drama: a recurring threat with no real resolution.”\n\nThat’s not stopping TikTok from pushing forward with its platform, Forrester analyst Kelsey Chickering says.\n\n“TikTok’s behavior also indicates they’re confident in their future, as they rolled out new AI video tools at Cannes this week,” Chickering notes. “Smaller players, like Snap, will try to steal share during this ‘uncertain time,’ but they will not succeed because this next round for TikTok isn’t uncertain at all.”\n\nFor now, TikTok continues to function for its 170 million users in the U.S., and tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle were persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump’s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.\n\nAmericans are even more closely divided on what to do about TikTok than they were two years ago.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren’t sure.\n\nAmong those who said they supported banning the social media platform, about 8 in 10 cited concerns over users’ data security being at risk as a major factor in their decision, according to the report.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Trump administration is once again “flouting the law and ignoring its own national security findings about the risks” posed by a China-controlled TikTok.\n\n“An executive order can’t sidestep the law, but that’s exactly what the president is trying to do,” Warner added.","summary":"A recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/19/trump-extends-tiktok-ban/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Netherlands_Social_Media_Kids_07329_ae56e2.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 00:04:19","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":333243106,"title":"Photos: Oakland Museum of California draws hundreds to Hella Juneteenth Festival","text":"Hundreds of community members turned out for the sold-out Oakland Museum of California’s Hella Juneteenth Festival 2025 on Thursday.\nThe event, presented by Hella Creative, invited the community to gather in celebration of Black freedom, creativity and legacy.

Iran seeks to become a nuclear power, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu longs to be remembered as the Israeli leader who categorically thwarted Iran’s nuclear programme, which he views as an existential threat to Israel’s survival. Both dreams are as misguided as they are dangerous.Iran’s nuclear ambitions have always been driven primarily by the goal of securing the regime’s survival, not annihilating Israel, which is far more likely to be destroyed at the end of a long war of attrition than under a mushroom cloud.But Israel cannot afford to treat Iran’s threats of nuclear Armageddon as mere bloviating, particularly after Hamas’s Oct 7, 2023 terrorist attack, which triggered Israel’s long, brutal, and ongoing offensive against the Iranian proxy in Gaza. It is not wrong to fear a nuclear Iran.But Netanyahu is a key reason why Iran’s nuclear programme is as far along as it is. It was over his objections that the so-called P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the US), together with the European Union, negotiated the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, freezing the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme.And it was under pressure from Netanyahu that Donald Trump withdrew the US from the JCPOA three years later, spurring Iran to renew its race for the bomb.Israel’s audacious attacks on Iran surely will cause further tension between Trump and Netanyahu. Since his return to the White House, Trump has sought a new nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic. But this was never going to be an easy process – and not only because Iran has little reason to trust the US.While Trump has no qualms about touting unimpressive (or worse) deals as historic breakthroughs, he surely feels pressure to strike an agreement that is somehow better than the JCPOA that then-US president Barack Obama negotiated a decade ago.Given this, Trump probably views Israel’s strikes as useful in limited doses – just enough to increase his leverage in the nuclear negotiations that were already under way. But Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival – and in that battle, no bridge is too far.While Israel initially focussed its attacks on nuclear facilities and ballistic missile bases, the conflict has escalated to include targets that could draw the US into the war (such as energy facilities and residential buildings), and it is just getting started.In line with his grand Churchillian ambition – and mirroring the perspective he has brought to his war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – Netanyahu is seeking “total victory” over Iran. This would render a nuclear deal unnecessary.There is just one problem: Israel is incapable of eradicating Iran’s nuclear programme. Israel has struck nuclear sites in Natanz and Isfahan, but the damage to the facilities was limited, partly because Israel recognised the need to avoid unleashing radiation across the region. And Israel does not have bombs that can penetrate Iran’s Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, which is built inside a mountain.Of course, physical infrastructure is only part of the equation. That is why Israel also targeted scientists, as well as top Revolutionary Guard leaders. But Iran’s nuclear programme is an expansive and deeply embedded state project. Killing a few – or even a few dozen – individuals will not paralyse it, let alone eliminate it.In any case, Israel still needs the US. And Trump has no interest in letting Israel drive up oil prices or create a rift between him and America’s Gulf allies, which just agreed to funnel trillions of dollars in investment towards the US.Nor can Israel hope for the tacit complicity that the Arab states demonstrated in its war against Hamas and Hezbollah. While these countries have no love for Iran, they have a vested interest in regional stability, especially as they work to diversify their economies.A cornered Iran might even attack the Gulf states directly, hitting their oil installations or disrupting transport lanes in the Persian Gulf. These countries want a nuclear deal, not a regional conflagration.Iran probably wants roughly the same. Though it withdrew from scheduled nuclear talks in Oman, its military response has been confined to Israeli targets.Notably, despite having poured billions of dollars into its regional proxies in recent years, it has refrained from activating them – however diminished they may have been rendered by Israel – against American or Arab targets.But if Iran finds itself with its back against the wall, it can force a reluctant Hezbollah and its Iraqi militias into the fight. If not now, when? It is for occasions like this that the alliances were created in the first place.Iran can also incite attacks against Israel elsewhere, such as the West Bank. Moreover, it will probably withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, opening the way for it to achieve nuclear breakout – a process that would take mere months.Iran now risks falling into the same strategic trap that drained the energies of the Sunni pan-Arabism it revolted against in 1979. By pouring its energy and resources into a war of annihilation against Israel, it would jeopardise its primary objective: regime survival.But Iran is not alone in letting illusory ambitions cloud its judgment. If Israel cannot destroy Iran’s nuclear programme, it certainly cannot achieve total victory over Iran’s regime. And it is not just Iran: none of Israel’s security challenges can be overcome through total victory.No matter how many bombs Netanyahu drops, diplomacy will remain the only answer. Meanwhile, Israel’s military hubris is becoming inadmissible to its moderate Arab allies. They wanted Israel as an equal partner in a regional peace, not as a new hegemon.

Two smart people, two very smart people, decided not to keep going with the war. Those are two big nuclear powers.”Trump-Munir MeetingDuring a phone conversation with Trump on Tuesday, Modi made it clear that India has not accepted and will not accept any mediation in its dispute with Pakistan.Since May 10, when India and Pakistan agreed to stop the military conflict following India’s Operation Sindoor strike, Trump has on multiple occasions claimed personal credit for brokering peace between the two nuclear power neighbours. India has maintained that the director generals of military operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan had reached an understanding to cease hostilities after Pakistan DGMO approached his Indian counterpart on May 10 and that no third party was involved.Wednesday marked the first meeting between a US president and the head of Pakistan’s military in decades. It was held without accompanying senior civilian officials.Trump said he was “honoured” to meet Munir.“Prime minister Modi just left a little while ago, and we are working a trade deal with India,” he said. “We are working a trade deal with Pakistan.”The Trump-Munir meeting has caused unease in India as it signals expansion of the US-Pakistan ties, with Washington overlooking New Delhi’s contention that Islamabad sponsors cross-border terrorism.Trump, Munir Discuss IranOn discussing Iran with Munir, Trump said, “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well…better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. They see what’s going on. And he agreed with me.”He did not elaborate. There have been reports that Pakistan may provide air space to the US military to strike Iran while many expected Munir to try to convince Trump not to enter Israel’s war with Iran.On Monday, Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar had told parliament that Iran was willing to return to the negotiating table if Israel stopped further strikes. “Our intention was always to see successful negotiations between the United States and Iran,” Dar had said, citing direct communication with his Iranian counterpart.","summary":"President Trump acknowledged Prime Minister Modi and Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir for de-escalating the India-Pakistan conflict, moving away from his previous claims of personal intervention. Discussions with Munir also included the Iran situation, hinting at potential US-Pakistan collaboration in the Persian Gulf region.

AlixPartners, as part of its annual global automotive outlook, also cautioned that the administration’s anti-electric vehicle policies risk relegating American automakers to bit players in the global EV market.\n\n“These tariffs bring a big wall of cost,” Mark Wakefield, global auto market lead for AlixPartners, told reporters in an online briefing. We see “consumers taking the majority of the hit.”\n\nGeneral Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. have already said they expect a $5 billion and $2.5 billion tariff impact this year, respectively, though they say they will find offsets in part through price adjustments.\n\nThose higher prices will result in about 1 million fewer vehicles sold in the US over the next three years, Wakefield said. But the consultant expects US auto sales to reach 17 million in 2030, 1 million more than last year, as the impact of tariffs abates.\n\nAlixPartners’ predicted sales hit is more muted than some other projections because the firm sees tariff rates falling as the US negotiates trade deals with other countries. It forecasts the 25% auto tariff will ultimately fall to 7.5% on assembled autos, 5% on parts and even lower on cars and parts that are compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.\n\n“This tariff wall is not likely to last forever,” Wakefield said.\n\nWhat’s likely to have a longer-lasting impact is the Trump administration’s move to reduce and eliminate incentives to spur the sale of electric vehicles, such as the $7,500 consumer tax credit for purchasing a battery powered model, he said.\n\nThat will steer car buyers away from EVs as they “follow their pocketbook” and buy traditional gasoline-fueled vehicles, Wakefield said.\n\nAlixPartners slashed its forecast for EV sales in the US by nearly half. It now sees battery electric vehicles making up just 17% of US auto sales in 2030, down from a previous prediction that EVs would make up 31% of sales by then.\n\nTraditional internal combustion engine vehicles will account for half of US sales in 2030, up from AlixPartners’ previous prediction that they would only make up about one-third of sales.\n\nThe consultant sees traditional hybrids accounting for 27% of the US market in 2030, up from its prior forecast of 24%, while plug-in hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles will account for just 6% of US auto sales by then, down from a previous prediction of 10%.\n\nThat will hurt US automakers’ competitiveness and perhaps even leave them dependent on global EV leader China, Wakefield said.\n\n“It makes it much more likely that they end up licensing or joint venturing or otherwise using platforms and EV technologies from China,” he said in an interview.\n\nThe “aggressive take-down of support” for EVs, will leave American automakers with the dubious distinction of being the world leader in big, gas-guzzling engines, a century-old technology that’s in decline, Wakefield said.\n\n“They’ll have the world’s best V8 engines by 2028,” Wakefield said of American automakers. “They’ll probably also have the world’s only V8 engines by 2028.”\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","summary":"Those higher prices will result in about 1 million fewer vehicles sold in the US over the next three years,","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/19/auto-tariffs-seen-hiking-car-prices-by-nearly-2000-per-vehicle/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1461182868.jpg?w=1024&h=673","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:55:03","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.469},{"id":333244482,"title":"LA Dodgers say they denied immigration agents access to Dodger Stadium parking lot","text":"LOS ANGELES :The Los Angeles Dodgers said they had denied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents access to the parking lot at Dodger Stadium on Thursday, in the team's first sign of opposition to immigration raids that have rattled California's largest city.\n\nThe Dodgers, whose baseball fan base includes a significant Latino contingent, have come under criticism from fans and local media commentators in recent days for not speaking out publicly against raids by immigration agents across Los Angeles.\n\nThe raids sparked street protests, which in turn prompted President Donald Trump to send in the National Guard and U.S. Marines to protect federal personnel and property, fueling more protests and tension.\n\n\"This morning, ICE agents came to Dodger Stadium and requested permission to access the parking lots,\" the team said in a post on X. \"They were denied entry to the grounds by the organization.

CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nMSNBC showed video of a small number of protesters objecting to the presence of at least four uniformed agents and three vehicles and asking them to remove their facemasks. Los Angeles Times video showed protesters chanting, \"Where are the Dodgers?\"\n\nThe Dodgers, coming off a World Series championship in 2024, are a cultural touchstone in Los Angeles. Their Latino fan base has been a large part of the team's identity at least since the \"Fernandomania\" craze surrounding Mexican-born pitcher Fernando Valenzuela in the early 1980s.\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of silence over the raids, the Dodgers were due on Thursday to announce plans to assist immigrant communities, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a team spokesman.\n\nThe Dodgers did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n\"It's kind of upsetting that they haven't spoken up,\" Kimberly, a fan who did not want to give her full name, told Reuters at Dodger Stadium before Wednesday night's game.\n\nShe praised Enrique \"Kike\" Hernandez, the popular utility player and Puerto Rican native, who recently posted that he could not stand to see the Los Angeles community being \"violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart.\" \n\nHernandez received a huge ovation from the crowd when he came to bat on Wednesday.\n\nLifelong Dodgers fan Dmitri Turner said that while he would like to see the team use its platform to address the \"bad things going on\" with ICE detentions, he understood that the organization might want to keep its focus on the field. \n\n\"Maybe they'd rather leave that to the politicians and give the fans what they want, which is good baseball,\" he said in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium. \n\nWhile the immigration raids may appeal to Trump's base of supporters over concerns about border security, many community leaders in heavily Democratic Los Angeles have publicly opposed the operations. Mayor Karen Bass has denounced them as provoking more tension and as harmful to the local economy.\n\nSinger Nezza sang the U.S. national anthem in Spanish at Dodger Stadium on Saturday, injecting a form of protest into the patriotic tradition before the baseball game.\n\nThe professional soccer clubs LAFC and Angel City FC have issued statements of support for immigrants but otherwise the city's sports franchises have refrained from commenting.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/la-dodgers-say-they-denied-immigration-agents-access-dodger-stadium-parking-lot-5193081","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--JTkx4Ltn--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-06-19t235415z_2_lynxmpel5i0sd_rtroptp_3_usa-migration-los-angeles.j","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:54:15","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":333245764,"title":"Iran talks with Europeans set for Friday; White House sees ‘substantial chance’ for renewed negotiations","text":"After a week of intense speculation about whether President Donald Trump will launch a strike on Iran in support of Israel’s efforts to eliminate the country’s nuclear weapons program, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced there is a \"substantial chance\" for renewed negotiations. This comes as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is reportedly scheduled to meet with European leaders in Geneva Friday. Speaking with reporters in the White House press briefing room Thursday, Leavitt confirmed U.S. and Iranian officials have engaged in six rounds of direct and indirect negotiations during the conflict with Israel, which broke out June 13. TRUMP REAFFIRMS HARD-LINE ON IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: 'WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM' Leavitt, however, did not say whether U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been leading the president’s negotiations with Iran, would be present for the meetings in Geneva. Asked by Fox News Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich whether the fact that Iranian officials had found a way to get to Geneva meant they could also get to the White House to engage in negotiations, Leavitt responded: \"I am not going to get into hypotheticals, but as you heard from the president yesterday, they have expressed interest in doing so.\" Addressing the possibility of the U.S. becoming directly involved in the conflict, Leavitt read a message from the president saying, \"Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.\" While she said Trump is hoping to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict, she said he has simultaneously been very \"direct and clear\" that the terms of any deal with the country must include no enrichment of uranium, which would contribute to the Iranian nuclear program the president has long opposed. She stressed the U.S. faces a serious threat due to Iran's nuclear program, saying, \"Iran has never been closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon.\" \"Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon.

The president has been very clear about that. And, by the way, the deal that Special Envoy Witkoff proposed to the Iranians was both realistic and acceptable within its terms, and that's why the president sent that deal to them.\" Leavitt emphasized Trump’s stance that Iran \"can and should make a deal\" to end the conflict or \"they will face grave consequences.\" \"Iran is in a very weak and vulnerable position because of the strikes and the attacks from Israel,\" she said. \"We sent a deal to them that was practical, that was realistic.\" According to French outlet RFI, the talks Friday with the Iranians will include French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. ‘THE FIVE’ CONSIDERS ‘ALL OPTIONS’ ON TRUMP’S TABLE FOR ISRAEL-IRAN CONFLICT The outlet reported Barrot saying, \"France, Britain and Germany stand ready to bring our competence and experience on this matter\" and \"we are ready to take part in negotiations aimed at obtaining from Iran a lasting rollback of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Lammy Thursday.

It was pretty awesome,' Lesnar told the school's athletics website, CSURams.com, after her victory.\n\n'Obviously throws like that don't happen often, and to do it on my first one was pretty cool. I just went calm, hit my cues. [Rams coach Brian] Bedard and I have tons of trust, and that's exactly what we did.\n\n'I think it had more of an effect for me. It meant more for me to do it on the first one, to start off the competition strong. A lot of the other ladies responded. It was awesome.'\n\nWhile her 19.01m effort remained the best throw of the day, Mya would nearly top it with an 18.8m effort for the top two results of the day.\n\nRemarkably, Rams coach Brian Bedard thinks Mya is actually capable of much more.\n\n'I still think she missed the big one today because in training we've been seeing throws in the 19.30-meter range, so she didn't quite put it together,' Bedard said.\n\n'She probably had a B-plus day for her, but when a training is going so well to have a big margin that she can maybe not hit her best and win it is awesome.\n\n'It was a great start for her. We've been working on the mental game and trying to have some joy when she competes and really simplify some technical cues and managing excitement levels and all that, and I thought she did that today. When she came up and talked to me between throws, she had a really good awareness of what she was doing in the throw and what she was feeling. I just loved her mindset today. It was mature.'\n\nBrock Lesnar has enjoyed success in the octagon and the wrestling ring since his NCAA title\n\nTo put Mya's top throw into perspective, China's Lijiao Gong won the shot put at the Tokyo Games in 2023 with a toss of 20.58. Mya's toss Thursday would have been sixth in Tokyo\n\nTo put Mya's top throw into perspective, China's Lijiao Gong won the women's shot put at the Tokyo Games in 2023 with a toss of 20.58. Mya's toss would have been good enough for sixth place in that tournament.\n\nMya has gone viral in recent years both for her sensational athletic ability and her striking resemblance to famous father Brock.\n\nBack in 2023 the track and field athlete grabbed headlines after breaking the shot put record at Colorado State with a superb 18.50 attempt, while she also claimed three straight Mountain West Conference titles.\n\nBrock, who has not featured in WWE since losing to Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam in 2023, is one of the wrestling's most celebrated stars and a highly-successful combat-sport athlete.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump sends message to wrestling legend Brock Lesnar's daughter after major sporting success\n\nAdd comment","summary":"She won the NCAA shot put title with a first-round toss of 19.01 meters earlier this month to become the first Rams athlete to win an outdoor event title since Loree Smith did so in 2005.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14830337/Donald-Trump-Brock-Lesnar-daughter.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/20/00/99552861-0-image-m-14_1750376944878.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:53:51","author":"Editor,Max Winters","authors":["Editor","Max Winters"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.074},{"id":333239676,"title":"B.C. rebrands its provincial tourism strategy (BC)","text":"British Columbia has proven itself to be a magnet for tourists, but one problem for the industry is that visitors tend to arrive during peak seasons.\n\nThey also cluster in the province’s tourism hot spots: Metro Vancouver, Victoria, Whistler and the Okanagan.\n\nThe province’s destination tourism marketer, Destination British Columbia, is attempting to change this by creating and using niche sub-brands that operate under the province’s well-known slogan, Super Natural British Columbia.\n\nTwo of these new sub-brands were released last year: Rainforest to Rockies and The Great Wilderness.\n\nOn June 4, the tourism marketer that operates on a $59 million annual budget launched four additional sub-brands: The Infinite Coast, Nature’s Heartland, Birthplace of Adventure, and Valleys and Vineyards.\n\nThe idea is not so much that international travellers will hear these sub-brands’ wording and be immediately inspired to visit the province. Instead, the six sub-brands’ marketing materials are set to target, at least initially, travel agents and group-tour operators, and help them distinguish between different geographic areas in B.C. and understand the kinds of attractions that exist within each one.\n\nDestination BC staff help agents and guides create and sell potential itineraries for their clients, Destination BC director of global brand strategy Leah Poulton explained to BIV.\n\n“We help them with product knowledge, training and education,” she said. “We’ll be building toolkits for the travel trade, and have other supports like that to make sure that they have the information.”\n\nDestination BC’s sub-brands target areas outside of Metro Vancouver, although the Rainforest to Rockies sub-brand follows highways from the Pacific Ocean through to the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe tourism marketer categorizes attractions under each siloed sub-brand so each one has specific potential itineraries.\n\nThe Britannia Mine Museum, just off the coast on the Sea-To-Sky Highway, is in the Rainforest to Rockies silo, said Tamsyn Jenkins, the museum’s sales and marketing manager.\n\nShe likes the idea of the new sub-brands because, she said, it helps visitors plan activities.\n\n“We are able to associate with the Rainforest to Rockies brand, and as that gets more well-known, we will be popping up when people are researching and looking for that,” she said.\n\n“We can leverage that within our website and on our brochures, so we become known for being on that route.”\n\nThe museum has already been using the Rainforest to Rockies tagline in its social media and on pamphlets that it had printed last year, she added.\n\n“It’s a great way of geographically marketing the province, with the different landscapes, the nature and features of each region,” said Jenkins.\n\n“When you’re looking at promoting B.C. to the global market, it gives a better visual for people to understand our regions.”\n\nDaniel Schildknecht, who co-owns Northern Rockies Adventures, based near Muncho Lake on the Alaska Highway, similarly likes the new brand concepts.\n\nHe told BIV that his venture includes four planes, a lodge, nearby cabins and a recreational vehicle park.\n\nAbout 14,000 people stayed at his facilities last year. He also had about 140 guests use his flight services, which includes a 135-minute flight from the Pitt Meadows Regional Airport.\n\nHe launched those flights in 2022 and has seen passenger growth jump by about 20 per cent each year, he said.\n\nNewer tours that take visitors into the sky during northern lights displays are also popular, he added.\n\n“In the past, most travellers, and even travel agents, focused on Vancouver, Vancouver Island and Whistler products as well as some in the Okanagan. That left the majority of B.C. unexplored, which is a real shame as B.C. has so much to offer,” he said.\n\n“The branding of the Great Wilderness really sets the tone for us. This is a huge untouched land. It’s not like the Valleys and Vineyards of the Okanagan, which is a brand they just launched. Or even the Infinite Coast, which is Vancouver Island. We are the Great Wilderness and saying that is very beneficial for visitors if they want to see massive wilderness.”\n\nWhile Schildknecht has heard industry insiders use the Great Wilderness tagline at conferences, he said he has yet to hear that term from visitors.\n\nHe thinks that may change if the sub-brands gain traction.\n\nB.C. marketing campaigns increasingly focus on international markets\n\nWhile the U.S. is by far the biggest source of international visitors to B.C., tourism marketers spend more dollars and time marketing B.C. to other international markets.\n\nDestination BC’s director of partner and market development Meredith Moll estimated to BIV that less than one quarter of Destination BC’s marketing dollars aimed at international visitors are spent in the U.S. “because it’s only one of our six key global markets.”\n\nWhen spending is funnelled into the U.S. it is done primarily in California, she added.\n\nMost Destination BC mostly spends its marketing dollars on digital channels, such as on social media, as opposed to physical billboards.\n\n“Specifically, the U.K., Germany, Australia, China and Mexico, as well as the U.S., are our key global markets where we really focus our efforts and our marketing spend,” she said.\n\nThis has been the case for a while, she said, so it is not a response to geopolitics, or an attempt to capitalize on anti-American sentiment in parts of Europe due to animosity with U.S. President Donald Trump and his tariff policies.\n\nNo matter how much money the tourism marketer spends in far-flung international markets, the reality is that the U.S. will continue to be the biggest single market for B.C.’s tourism sector.\n\nTravellers visit nearby places because it is cheaper and faster.\n\nOf the nearly 5.38 million international visitors who entered Canada through B.C. last year and stayed at least one night, close to 3.59 million — or 66.7 per cent — were Americans.\n\nAnd Americans’ share of international visitors is increasing.\n\nThe number of U.S. visitors to Canada who entered through B.C. ports and stayed overnight in 2024 was up 7.6 per cent from 2023. That was higher than the 7.3-per-cent overall growth rate for international visitors.\n\nThe trend of U.S. visitor growth outpacing overall visitor growth continued in the first quarter of this year, with American overnight visits to Canada through B.C. rising 2.4 per cent year-over-year to nearly 615,000. That compared with an overall 1.1-per-cent decline, to nearly 887,000 international overnight visitors who entered Canada through B.C. year-over-year in that same time period.\n\nEuropeans plan trips much further in advance than do Americans, according to Moll and other industry advocates, such as British Columbia Tourism Industry Association CEO Walt Judas.\n\nThat means that the effect of European visitors deciding to pivot trips to be in Canada instead of the U.S. could be in its early stages.\n\n“People are looking at Canada as an alternative,” Judas told BIV.\n\nHe said he has heard from industry partners that this is the case for Europeans as it is for Mexicans.\n\nIf the number of Mexicans visiting B.C. does rise it will buck a steep downward trend in visits that started in March 2024, after the Canadian government suddenly announced in late February of that year that most Mexicans would immediately need visas to enter Canada.\n\nVisits by Mexicans to Canada via B.C. fell 20.3 per cent in 2024 year-over-year, to nearly 165,000. That trend continued in the first quarter of this year, with just over 36,000 Mexican travellers visiting Canada through B.C. That is 28.1 per cent fewer visitors than in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAir Canada and Flair Airlines have announced new routes to Mexico out of Vancouver International Airport (YVR), and they plan to increase flight frequency this winter.\n\nAustralia may be the region with the most promise for tourist growth.\n\nCanada and Australia last year signed an Open Skies agreement that allows those countries’ airlines starting on January 1 the ability to fly an unlimited number of non-stop flights to any points within the other country.\n\nQantas Airways Ltd. earlier this month announced its plan to increase non-stop service between YVR and Sydney, Australia in January to daily, up from three times per week. It then plans to fly that route four times per week in February and March.","summary":"British Columbia has proven itself to be a magnet for tourists, but one problem for the industry is that visitors tend to arrive during peak seasons.

They may have been from the same group that helped Altadena residents clear their homes of burned out debris from the Eaton fire in January, said the group.\n\nThe number of arrests could not be confirmed. ICE did not respond to inquiries. Members of Congress who visited the federal building in downtown LA Wednesday to learn their identities and observe their treatment were turned away. \n\nPasadena Mayor Victor Gordo said the city, and its police chief, have been trying for two days to get a response from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which have been conducting immigration-related raids in Los Angeles, Downey, Pico Rivera, La Mirada and Pasadena for the last week.\n\n“We will continue our attempts to open the lines of communication with the federal government. And hopefully, they pick up the phone,” Gordo said.\n\nWhile Derderian said the city is not attempting to interfere with federal agents, city officials are asking for information on the man who drove erratically through a busy city intersection and pointed a gun at residents protesting next to Dena Burgers, a crowded restaurant located in a busy shopping center. They were shouting “ICE out of our city” and at least one person was taking videos of the car and driver.\n\nIf it was a federal agent, his response was inappropriate, Gordo said. People protesting, even using phone cameras to take videos are not committing a crime nor interfering in federal enforcement activity.\n\nGordo lives three blocks from the intersection, he said, and drives through it every day.\n\n“I am angry that an irresponsible agent would escalate the situation that put the public in danger where my family or I would go and drive. It was reckless. It was irresponsible and it was dangerous,” he said.\n\nLuckily, the car missed incoming traffic, he said, “or a terrible accident might have occurred.” Also the gun was not fired. “Imagine if this agent accidentally pulled the trigger and shot into Dena Burger, or hit an innocent person there or on the sidewalk. That could’ve easily happened,” Gordo said.\n\nPasadena is certain ICE agents were involved in the arrest at the bus stop and were roaming the city. A video obtained by police shows agents in camouflage and police-like vests approaching cars on Colorado Boulevard near the Urth Caffe, at least a mile from the site of the arrests.\n\nThe city was able to slow the video down and identify an ICE patch on the uniform of an agent outside the very popular cafe on famous Colorado Boulevard, where the world renowned Rose Parade goes down every Jan. 1, Derderian said. Pasadena PD are searching through all videos and other social media posts for any clues to help identify the law enforcement agency that descended on the Crown City Wednesday morning.\n\n“That is where we have concerns,” she said. “If they are not identifying who they are in their official capacity.”\n\nOfficials say anyone with a block on a vehicle registration, and a car with blue flashing lights, most likely is working for a law enforcement agency. But that has not yet been verified.\n\n“I am told there may be individuals who are contracted by the federal government who are not law enforcement and may be arresting people under a citizen arrest,” Gordo said. “So it might be a federal agent or someone deputized and not trained as a law enforcement agent — someone cloaked by the federal government to act as a law enforcement agent who may not be trained to de-escalate.”\n\nThe man’s clothing was unmarked and appeared like police attire one can buy off the shelf or from e-bay, said Derderian. Also, Gordo said the man’s behavior would not be acceptable as a city police officer.\n\n“If that had been a Pasadena police officer, I can assure you there would have been a robust investigation,” Gordo said.\n\nThe raids themselves are part of a massive federal immigration sweep across the nation, fueled by the Trump administration’s reported goal of 3,000 arrests a day. Trump officials say their sweeps are intended to make the nation safer from violent criminals. But local leaders and families say many of the hundreds of people being swept up in the raids are not the violent criminals that President Donald Trump pledged to deport.\n\nNot knowing who pointed a gun at Pasadena residents, and what agency was on the streets of the city, is an issue that has not happened in the past. Usually, federal agencies inform the city and its police department of their presence, to be safe and avoid any friendly fire, Gordo said.\n\n“It is very frustrating. As mayor, I am entrusted with the safety and welfare of residents in the city of Pasadena. It is both scary and unacceptable that our police department and city leadership do not know — and may never know — who this individual is and who they are working for,” Gordo said.","summary":"Who was the man in a mask, wearing dark clothing, that got out of a car in Pasadena and drew a gun on ICE protesters?

He is survived by his children, grandchildren, and his partner. \n\nThe Health and Safety Authority is still investigating the circumstances of his death. \n\nIt’s understood that Dessie was in the depot after 10pm at night to load a large rubbish container onto a vehicle, for it to be transported to a sorting and recycling centre. \n\nColleagues of Dessie, who have spoken to The Journal, have said that safety concerns about the size of the depot, and about it regularly being congested with other vehicles, making access difficult, were raised with council management well in advance of the fatal incident. \n\nThey also noted that the depot regularly closes at 10pm, and that in their view, it would not be safe for someone to be doing that kind of work on a November night. \n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It was dully lit, and often cramped for space, and that was a well known issue that had been flagged,” one worker said. \n\nThey added that it was also difficult to reverse the large trucks used for the transportation of rubbish containers down a one way public lane. \n\nThe HSA investigation and an inquest into Dessie’s death will determine if these factors contributed to his death, and to what extent. \n\nA date for the inquest has not yet been set. \n\nThe depot has largely not been used in the same capacity since the incident in question. \n\nIt’s understood that further training has been made available to Waste Management workers by the council since the incident. \n\nDublin City Council has said that it will not comment on an ongoing investigation, and it would not say whether the depot is now being used in the same capacity or not. \n\nA garda spokesperson said that gardaí assisted emergency services at the scene of a workplace accident on Bow Lane East at approximately 10:45pm on Friday, the 29th November. \n\n“A male in his 50s was transferred to St James’ Hospital for treatment of injuries sustained. He later passed away as a result of his injuries.\n\n“The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) was notified and a file is being prepared for the Coroner’s office,” the spokesperson added. \n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nEimer McAuley\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Safety concerns were raised about Dublin City Council depot where worker was fatally injured”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Safety concerns were raised about Dublin City Council depot where worker was fatally injured”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nHSA Investigation\nThe Morning Lead\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\nDonald Trump delays decision on Iran strikes as Keir Starmer calls for restraint\n\nNew US ambassador to Ireland officially sworn in at White House ceremony \n\nfairview park\n'I'm a free man': Kneecap's Mo Chara defiant in first gig since yesterday's UK court appearance\n\nHere's What Happened Today: Thursday\n\nthreat to peace\nTen weeks to save Irish peacekeeping in Lebanon as US weighs up whether to end its support\n\nNiall O'Connor\n\nDeportations\nMinister criticised after recent deportation flight took off without human rights monitor on board\n\nTravel Advisory\nBriefings on assisting Irish citizens wishing to leave Israel and Iran continuing this evening\n\nMan killed after explosion and fire at house in Co Roscommon named locally as Des Deegan (72)\n\nrich rebels\nWinner of EuroMillions jackpot comes forward as ticket revealed to have been bought in Cork city\n\nMan awarded €10k in damages after being pursued for €20 petrol bill after he forgot his wallet\n\nmore from us\n\nInvestigates\n\nDaft.ie Property Magazine\n\nAllianz Home Magazine\n\nThe 42 Sports Magazine\n\nMoney Diaries\n\nThe Journal TV\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nAbout FactCheck\n\nOur Network\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nmore from us\n\nTV Listings\n\nGAA Fixtures\n\nThe Video Review\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nOur Network\n\nThe Journal\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\n© 2025 Journal Media Ltd\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nSwitch to Desktop\nSwitch to Mobile\n\nThe Journal supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

Iran quickly retaliated, most recently hitting a major Israeli hospital in a strike the Israeli government said crossed a \"red line.\"What To KnowIn a post on X on Thursday, responding to commentator Matt Walsh's commentary about the interview, Cruz wrote, \"I agree that it was interesting.

[high-pitched laughter],\" Cruz wrote, mocking the former Fox News host.The Texas senator then brought up a Department of Justice indictment, writing that \"it's an objective fact.\" The indictment charges Farhad Shakeri, an Iranian operative, with plotting to assassinate Trump.During the interview, Carlson pressed Cruz on fundamental knowledge of Iran, beginning with a question about the country's population. When Cruz said he didn't know, Carlson replied, \"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\"The former Fox News host posted the clip online and it quickly went viral, drawing tens of millions of views and sparking widespread debate among those on both sides of the political aisle.Cruz defended his record and turned the conversation toward the threat posed by Iran, citing the DOJ's indictment of Farhad Shakeri. \"You're the one who claims they're not trying to murder Donald Trump,\" Cruz told Carlson, referencing the alleged plot.\"You're the one who can't figure out if it was a good idea to kill General Soleimani and you said it was bad,\" Cruz added.Carlson countered that Cruz was downplaying the implications of advocating for military action without understanding the country in question.\"You're a senator who's calling for an overthrow of the government and you don't know anything about the country,\" Carlson said.In a follow-up exchange, Cruz said the U.S. is currently helping Israel conduct strikes on Iranian targets. \"We are carrying out military strikes today,\" he said.Carlson interrupted to point out that Israel was leading the campaign, to which Cruz replied, \"With our help. I said 'we'—Israel is leading but we're supporting them.\"When Carlson asked if Cruz knew Iran's population, the senator replied that he didn't \"sit around memorizing population tables,\" prompting Carlson to say: \"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\"Carlson's rhetoric toward Trump has been increasingly critical, with the longtime supporter—who headlined large rallies with the Republican during the 2024 campaign—this week suggesting that the president was breaking his pledge to keep the United States out of foreign entanglements.Trump clapped back at Carlson on social media, calling him \"kooky.\"During an event at the White House later Wednesday, Trump said that Carlson had \"called and apologized\" for criticizing him, saying Carlson \"is a nice guy.\"What People Are SayingTrump posted on Truth Social on Monday night: \"Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that, 'IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!'\"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Donald Trump, said on his show, \"The War Room\": \"Come on, man. We have to have an adult conversation. We're not going to let the shills at Fox—the same exact crowd that said the same thing about the Iraq War—force the President of the United States into a corner. He needs a range of options.\"Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show, commented on his weekly podcast: \"You've got Tucker Carlson going, 'Why are we going to war with Iran again?' And I'm like, 'Yeah, you tell him, brother!' That's how f---ing upside down we are right now.\"What Happens NextWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump will make a decision on whether or not to have the United States join Israel's war with Iran \"within the next two weeks.\"","summary":"After his combative interview with Tucker Carlson went viral, Senator Ted Cruz fired back at the conservative commentator.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ted-cruz-reacts-tucker-carlson-interview-x-thread-2088171","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2667333/ted-cruz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:47:08","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":333241114,"title":"Infantino’s grubby cash grab bodes ill for real World Cup","text":"Unwanted, untimely and underwhelming.First impressions of the Club World Cup (CWC), the grubby cash grab that is being shown on mercifully few of our screens.Or is that being kind?How about “a contrived vanity project?” Or a “harbinger of doom?”It’s early days in FIFA’s blatant attempt to wrest control of club football and milk the proceeds.But we’ve seen enough already for both descriptions to be used in respected journals.Sparse crowds, players wilting in the heat and widespread ignorance that it’s even taking place.There’s a huge gulf in class between the regions with Oceania’s Auckland FC part-timers getting hammered 10-0 by Bayern Munich.The result made a mockery of FIFA’s claim to have “the best 32 teams in the world.”Several Kiwis told of having trouble getting time off work to play!Another bone of contention was the brazen manoeuvring to ensure that Lionel Messi is there even though his team, Inter Miami, didn’t qualify by the normal rules.He squeezed in as Inter won a popularity contest called “The Supporters’ Shield.”But FIFA couldn’t swing it for Cristiano Ronaldo whose contract with Al Nassr expires at the end of this month.FIFA president Gianni Infantino openly pleaded: “If any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup…”Al Nassr had failed to qualify, but fierce cross-town rivals Al Hillal had.However, a switch was beyond the pale for the Saudis, even though both clubs are owned by the Public Investment Fund.“It would have been completely counter-intuitive,” said Saudi Pro League CEO Esteve Calzada. But it was acceptable to Infantino.Then there’s the “dynamic pricing” – another name for ripping off fans – that have seen tickets tumble from hundreds of dollars to single-digit giveaways.Kick-off times favouring European TV audiences over locals are also worth a mention, as is the craven acceptance of discarding anti-discriminatory material, at the behest of the US hosts.We all know FIFA’s anti-racism pronouncements are a sham, but at least they should have the decency to pretend.And making a big deal about ending it almost invites a resurgence.One scribe even compared CWC to LIV Golf, another unnecessary event that has made a few people very rich but split a sport asunder.That was based on a grudge by Greg Norman, who got the backing of Saudi Arabia to take on the USPGA.The CWC is the baby of another narcissist who makes his predecessor Sepp Blatter look like a paragon of virtue.Infantino, who is known as ‘Johnny’ by US President Donald Trump, already has his proper name laser-inscribed on the hideous-looking trophy not once but twice.Not content with being boss of world football, he wants a slice of the most lucrative part of the game – the club game.This creation is designed to become the premier club tournament in the world and overshadow the Champions League.It may be a quadrennial event like its international counterpart, but every four years, it will kick off days after the Champions League has finished.It will cast far more than a shadow. It will sap the players’ energy, make them more susceptible to injuries, and even have a knock-on effect on the club season that follows.It will also spill into a market that is already saturated.No one asked for this. There already was a CWC that lasted a little over a week and could be won by a seeded champion in just two games.It was a bit of a joke, but it added a layer of prestige and was slotted into the European calendar at the end of the year.From the EPL, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City, the “holders”, all won it in recent years without much inconvenience.There has also been a clash with the South American champions which occurred on an irregular basis.It was taken more seriously by the Libertadores winners, but the world knew where the real quality was, as most of the best players from South America play in Europe.Although this tournament is “only” in the United States, it’s inevitably seen as something of a trial run for next year’s World Cup.Expanded to 48 nations, it will also be held in Canada and Mexico.The prospect of criss-crossing the vast acreage of North America in the searing heat of mid-summer may well deter fans as much as the threat of arrest and deportation is keeping them away this time.Only part of that is FIFA’s fault, of course, but transportation is sure to add up to a carbon footprint made by giants.For some small nations, it will be magical just being there, a feat many never dreamed of.But if the CWC is anything to go by, a lot of work needs to be done to ensure the biggest World Cup in history will be the best.The debut edition of this format is papering over the cracks and the crackpot with its obscene prize money of US$1 billion – another way it can distort the club seasons that follow.If Auckland City, for example, walks away with enough to begin paying their players, they might turn pro, and where does that leave the rest of the league’s teams?Meanwhile, the rich get richer at the business end.If the CWC is an appetiser, it’s in serious danger of turning football fans and players off the main course.

In return, some of the UN-backed sanctions against Iran were lifted or suspended.\n\nIn 2018, however, bowing to intense pressure from Benjamin Netanyahu, then-president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the JCPOA. Netanyahu had always been the most vocal critic of the agreement, advocating for military action even as US officials acknowledged that Iran's compliance, as well as a limit to uranium enrichment of just 3%, made the delivery of a nuclear weapon virtually impossible for decades.\n\n Notably, Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence testified in March 2025 that the intelligence community found no evidence of Iran building a nuclear weapon. More definitively, the director general of the IAEA on 18 June 18, 2025, clearly stated \"we did not have any proof of a systematic effort [on Iran’s part] to move into a nuclear weapon\". \n\nThus the \"threat\" seems, in large part, to be a manufactured crisis.\n\nRegime change\n\n Israel's surprise attack on Iran occurred just two days before scheduled Iran-US talks that Iran viewed positively and were progressing smoothly (according to officials on both sides). This strongly suggests that these talks were a mere smokescreen, a deceptive cover for an attack that, according to Trump, the US had been aware of for months.\n\n While Iran’s nuclear programme serves as Israel's public justification for pursuing the war, the true objective appears to be the destabilization of Iran, a clear intention to topple the government and turn the country into a failed state, akin to the tragedies witnessed in Libya and Syria, where central governments can no longer maintain territorial integrity. \n\n The echoes of 2003 when the United States and its allies attacked Iraq are eerie: the insistence that Iran is developing alleged ‘weapons of mass destruction’, disguising the real goal of the operation which is regime change in Tehran.\n\n The campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein created utter chaos in Iraq and resulted in the deaths of probably a million Iraqis, the displacement of millions, and 4,800 American and coalition deaths,\n\n As was the case in Iraq, it seems abundantly clear that Netanyahu and Trump have no plan for what happens if/after the Iranian regime is defenestrated. \n\n This intervention, if successful in toppling the Iranian government, carries the terrifying prospect of a prolonged civil war. Iran's diverse regional groups, including militias from Azerbaijan, Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, could exploit the power vacuum, leading to a scramble for territory and an even wider regional conflagration. \n\nConsequences\n\nFurthermore, two other dangerous consequences are likely to emerge.\n\n Firstly, Iran may conclude that a nuclear weapon is its only true deterrent against such aggression, leading it to abandon all diplomatic efforts to restrict its nuclear program. \n\nSecondly, Iran will almost certainly target US allies and interests in the region. This could involve strikes on oil production and refinery infrastructure in the Persian Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia and could block the Strait of Hormuz. \n\nGiven that roughly 20-25% of global oil exports pass through the strait daily, this will have significant implications for global energy security.\n\n The erratic behaviour of the US president is evident in Trump’s fluctuating positions throughout this war — from urgent calls for peace, to presenting a final offer to Iran that never materialized, to urging Tehran residents to evacuate, denying involvement in attacks, threatening to assassinate Iran's supreme leader, and finally demanding “unconditional surrender”. \n\nRogue state\n\nForget these lurching statements about Iran: there is a good case for arguing that they are performative and that Trump is all in as Netanyahu’s partner in crime. Trump’s American version of authoritarianism neatly dovetails with Benjamin Netanyahu’s model: lawlessness and loutishness define them. \n\nViolence is their operational creed. Israel is a rogue state now completely out of control. \n\nThe assault on Iran is just the latest episode in an alarming pattern of escalating criminal behaviour on the part of Tel Aviv, from the repeated and decades-long flouting of UN resolutions, to the ramped up building of illegal settlements and outrageous settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, the murder of large numbers of UN officials and journalists, and cross-border attacks on Lebanon and Syria. \n\nAlready it is evident that, far from protecting civilians via “precision strikes” against Iranian regime figures, the casualty list includes at least 250 civilians, including more than 20 children, echoing the approach the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has taken in Gaza.\n\n Gaza has become not just an Israeli concentration camp but a death camp, where Palestinians are corralled, starved and murdered by Israeli forces every day of the week. Leaders of the collective ‘West’ who piously pontificate about “never again” stand by and do nothing; many such governments give the impression that they implicitly approve of what Israel is doing.\n\n The collective West thus bears enormous responsibility for its complicity in Israel’s genocidal violence, and Tel Aviv’s repeated infringements of international law. The Trump-Netanyahu escalation points to a disturbing calcification of the international system of states and institutions, and a complete unwillingness on the part of those who designed it, to defend the rules-based international order which emerged after the catastrophes of two world wars in the 20th century.\n\nAn outstanding example of this phenomenon can be seen in the protracted silence of the European Union, as Israel carried out the mass slaughter of more than 50,000 Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This provided Tel Aviv with confidence that there would be minimal pushback if it went ahead with its large-scale attack on Iran.\n\n The attack on Iran is a dangerous manifestation of Netanyahu's expansive regional ambitions, supported by a US administration seemingly devoid of a cohesive strategy. The consequences, both for Iran and the wider world, could be devastating, far outweighing any purported security gains for Israel and the United States. \n\n Shamsoddin Shariati is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Sociology at Maynooth University.\n John O’Brennan is a professor in the Department of Sociology at Maynooth University and Director of the Maynooth Centre for European and Eurasian Studies.","summary":"The West has been complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza and its overturning of the rules-based international order","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-41654210.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9339/4669631_13_seoimage1x1_GettyImages-2208496329_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:42:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Shamsoddin Shariati And John O’brennan","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Shamsoddin Shariati And John O’brennan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":333244996,"title":"A Familiar Deadline: Trump to Make Iran Decision ‘Within Two Weeks’, White House Says","text":"US President Donald Trump said Thursday he would make a decision on whether his country should get involved in Israel’s conflict with Iran “within the next two weeks.”\n\n White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read out a message from Trump at a daily briefing, citing “a lot of speculations” about whether the US would be “directly involved.”\n\n “Based on the fact that there’s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” Trump noted in the statement.\n\n Leavitt would not offer further details of what had led the US President to believe that negotiations with Iran were possible.\n\n She did however hint that “correspondence has continued” between the US and Iran when asked about reports that Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff had been in touch with Tehran’s foreign minister. In the meantime, the press secretary said she was “not tracking” if Witkoff would go to Geneva for next talks with Iran.\n\n Trump himself said on Wednesday that Iran had reached out asking to send officials to the White House to negotiate a deal on its nuclear program - something that Tehran officials later denied they would do.\n\n Trump has repeatedly fallen back on a two-week timeline to decide on policy decisions, including in lately when he said multiple times he would know in “roughly two weeks” whether Russian President Vladimir Putin was interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\n Asked some two months ago if he could trust Putin, Trump replied, “I’ll let you know in about two weeks.”\n\n When pressed by reporters on Thursday about the reliability of Trump’s timelines, given previous delays on other global matters such as Ukraine, Leavitt replied by suggesting that the conflicts were different and can’t be compared with another.\n\n She then emphasized that Trump’s tendency to push his own self-assigned deadlines comes from his desire to broker peace.\n\n“The last time the president said ‘two weeks’, you saw [Russia and Ukraine] have direct negotiations for the first time in years,” Leavitt highlighted. “The president is always interested in a diplomatic solution to the problems and the global conflicts in this world,” she added. \n\n “He is a peacemaker-in-chief, he is the peace-through-strength president. If there is a chance for diplomacy, the president will grab it,” the press secretary said.\n\n Trump’s Iran deadline also comes as his political supporters are split over whether the US should join Israel’s assault on Iran by bombing nuclear facilities buried deep underground.\n\n On Thursday, Trump held his third Situation Room meeting in four days. Earlier he had said that “I may do it, I may not do it” when asked if he would take military action against Iran.\n\n For Iran watchers in Washington, such as Jason Brodsky, policy director at the United Against Nuclear Iran, a nonprofit that focuses on countering threats posed by the Islamic regime, Trump might be deliberately using suspense and strategic ambiguity in his decision-making process regarding a military strike on Iran, possibly to encourage negotiations.\n\n Speaking to Kyiv Post, the expert highlighted Trump’s unique approach to the Iran conflict, suggesting that the White House might be hoping for a coercive diplomatic outcome after a military strike, which would be unprecedented for the Islamic Republic. \n\n “I think that the President is still holding out for the very slight possibility that the Iranians will agree to his terms as a part of a coercive diplomatic play after they’ve been directly hit militarily in an unprecedented way,” Brodsky said.\n\n “I think that the scenes that we’re seeing in Tehran, it’s historic. This is nothing that the Islamic Republic has ever faced before,” he emphasized.\n\n The analyst also implied that Trump might be using misdirection to confuse Iran, steering the conversation to throw them off. \n\n “There also might be some misdirection at play. You know, with the president, sometimes he’ll want to try to steer the conversation in a certain direction, to throw off the Iranians,” he concluded.","summary":"Trump’s ‘magic number’ sparks questions about his decision-making on global matters.

It looks that way. \n\nDEI, by “belonging” or any other name, is still divisive, discriminatory and often outright illegal. \n\nCorporate America needs to stop trying to deceive its customers, and start focusing on expunging radical political ideologies from businesses that serve Americans of all ideological persuasions. \n\nConsumers also have a role to play.\n\nWe must let companies know we won’t stand for these deceptive antics by withholding patronage from businesses that use our hard-earned dollars to advance DEI and other manifestations of extreme wokeness.\n\nOnly after they make real and substantive changes should we let them off the hook. \n\nFinally, any CEO who knowingly continues to oversee the deliberate violation of federal civil-rights laws should be on notice: Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, the relentless culture warrior who now heads the Civil Rights Division of the US Department of Justice, is an excellent lawyer. \n\nShe may be reaching out soon. \n\nWill Hild is executive director of Consumers’ Research.","summary":"For committed woke activists burrowed into countless corporations, the power to push identity politics on everyone around them with DEI policies is proving hard to give up.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/19/opinion/beware-belonging-the-sneaky-way-companies-hold-on-to-dei/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/kglddfd.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:38:38","author":"Will Hild","authors":["Will Hild"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":333249322,"title":"Edan Alexander returns to his home in the US: 'The nightmare is over'","text":"Edan Alexander, a Golani Brigade soldier who was freed from Hamas captivity just over a month ago, returned home Thursday night to Tenafly, New Jersey. Hundreds of residents lined the streets waving Israeli flags and yellow ribbons, cheering as he arrived home. Alexander, who grew up in the United States, immigrated to Israel at age 18 to volunteer for military service in the Golani Brigade. In Israel, he lived with his grandparents in Tel Aviv and later at Kibbutz Hazor, which hosted the group of lone soldiers he joined. He was kidnapped during the Hamas massacre on October 7, during a weekend that he wasn’t required to stay on base. That morning, Alexander was granted leave because his mother, Yael, was visiting from the U.S., and as a lone soldier, he was eligible for special time off. However, he chose to stay on base to avoid leaving the burden of guard duty on his fellow soldiers. When the Hamas attack began, he managed to speak with his mother, telling her a piece of shrapnel had hit his helmet but that he was okay. Alexander and his mother returned to the U.S. on a special diplomatic rescue flight from Israel. Major American news networks broadcast his homecoming preparations and arrival live. Police and FBI agents secured the street leading to the family’s home. Rabbi Yitzchak Gershovitz, the Chabad emissary in Tenafly and the family’s rabbi, told Ynet: “For our community, for American Jews, this is a moment we’ll never forget. From October 7 until today—it’s been a journey that never stopped. For the Alexander family, it’s been one long day that finally ended. Thank God—the nightmare ended in this moment.” During his captivity, Alexander survived an airstrike on the site over the tunnel where he was held. Part of the tunnel shaft collapsed, and he suffered injuries to his shoulder and arms as he tried to dig himself out. “I thought that was it, that I was going to die,” he recalled. “I had somehow survived a year and a half, but now I thought I was going to suffocate in the tunnel.” In one of many transfers between locations—homes, mosques, tents and tunnels—his captors disguised him to avoid detection. On one occasion, one of them dressed as a woman and led him out of a tunnel. Alexander, unshaven and dressed in local clothing, was given a cap to hide his identity. They emerged to find a cart hitched to a donkey. To avoid suspicion, Alexander was handed the reins to appear as if he, not the \"woman,\" was in charge. Hamas reportedly released Alexander as a “gesture” to President Donald Trump, hoping to revive negotiations and end the war. For now, however, talks between Israel and Hamas remain stalled as the broader conflict with Iran unfolds.","summary":"The American-Israeli soldier  who was released by Hamas as a tribute to Trump returned to the US with his mother on a rescue flight intended for diplomats; Hundreds of residents in Tenafly, New Jersey, awaited him with Israeli flags and yellow ribbons","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hyj3jmfele","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/20/BkOHTlGNxe/BkOHTlGNxe_0_0_1280_720_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:37:22","author":"Daniel Edelson, New York","authors":["Daniel Edelson, New York"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":333237078,"title":"Is This Why Trump Refuses to Meet Albanese?

The prime minister refused to meet JD Vance last month during his visit to Rome for the Pope’s inauguration.\n\nWhen asked at the time if he had spoken to Vance or reached out for a meeting, Albanese replied simply, ‘No’.\n\n‘He arrived quite late in terms of just prior to the mass taking place, as you will have seen,’ he added in explanation.\n\nWhen pressed on why he didn’t ask for a meeting with the US, he replied: ‘Well, I’m the Prime Minister.

This country offers us magnificent ideals to live up to, yet has a past that teaches hard lessons about doing what is right by all people who live in this great nation.\n\nThe Trump administration needs to look in the history books to review those lessons and learn about decency, honesty, goodwill, accountability and most of all, integrity. Having integrity is what makes America great, and being honest and decent to our neighbors makes America great. Military parades don’t make America great. Masked men kidnapping parents away from children doesn’t make America great. Tackling and handcuffing a U.S. senator doesn’t make America great.\n\nWhere does this insanity end?

Now this bill is working its way through the Senate, and we have an opportunity to get those clean energy tax credits added back.

Their purpose was to warn the public of the dangers of nuclear war. They created the symbol of the Doomsday Clock that they reset every January to show how close to nuclear oblivion we had come. This last January, they reset the clock the closest to midnight since 1945, the highest danger we have ever faced. Gabbard’s concern is well-founded. Pray Donald Trump takes her more seriously than Champion.\n\nWith all-out war breaking out in the Middle East and the peace negotiations to end the Ukraine war collapsing in the wake of attacks on Russia’s nuclear-capable bombers, we are even closer to nuclear war now than last January.

Instead, the six sub-brands’ marketing materials are set to target, at least initially, travel agents and group-tour operators, and help them distinguish between different geographic areas in B.C. and understand the kinds of attractions that exist within each one.\n\nDestination BC staff help agents and guides create and sell potential itineraries for their clients, Destination BC director of global brand strategy Leah Poulton explained to BIV.\n\n“We help them with product knowledge, training and education,” she said. “We’ll be building toolkits for the travel trade, and have other supports like that to make sure that they have the information.”\n\nDestination BC’s sub-brands target areas outside of Metro Vancouver, although the Rainforest to Rockies sub-brand follows highways from the Pacific Ocean through to the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe tourism marketer categorizes attractions under each siloed sub-brand so each one has specific potential itineraries.\n\nThe Britannia Mine Museum, just off the coast on the Sea-To-Sky Highway, is in the Rainforest to Rockies silo, said Tamsyn Jenkins, the museum’s sales and marketing manager.\n\nShe likes the idea of the new sub-brands because, she said, it helps visitors plan activities.\n\n“We are able to associate with the Rainforest to Rockies brand, and as that gets more well-known, we will be popping up when people are researching and looking for that,” she said.\n\n“We can leverage that within our website and on our brochures, so we become known for being on that route.”\n\nThe museum has already been using the Rainforest to Rockies tagline in its social media and on pamphlets that it had printed last year, she added.\n\n“It’s a great way of geographically marketing the province, with the different landscapes, the nature and features of each region,” said Jenkins.\n\n“When you’re looking at promoting B.C. to the global market, it gives a better visual for people to understand our regions.”\n\nDaniel Schildknecht, who co-owns Northern Rockies Adventures, based near Muncho Lake on the Alaska Highway, similarly likes the new brand concepts.\n\nHe told BIV that his venture includes four planes, a lodge, nearby cabins and a recreational vehicle park.\n\nAbout 14,000 people stayed at his facilities last year. He also had about 140 guests use his flight services, which includes a 135-minute flight from the Pitt Meadows Regional Airport.\n\nHe launched those flights in 2022 and has seen passenger growth jump by about 20 per cent each year, he said.\n\nNewer tours that take visitors into the sky during northern lights displays are also popular, he added.\n\n“In the past, most travellers, and even travel agents, focused on Vancouver, Vancouver Island and Whistler products as well as some in the Okanagan. That left the majority of B.C. unexplored, which is a real shame as B.C. has so much to offer,” he said.\n\n“The branding of the Great Wilderness really sets the tone for us. This is a huge untouched land. It’s not like the Valleys and Vineyards of the Okanagan, which is a brand they just launched. Or even the Infinite Coast, which is Vancouver Island. We are the Great Wilderness and saying that is very beneficial for visitors if they want to see massive wilderness.”\n\nWhile Schildknecht has heard industry insiders use the Great Wilderness tagline at conferences, he said he has yet to hear that term from visitors.\n\nHe thinks that may change if the sub-brands gain traction.\n\nB.C. marketing campaigns increasingly focus on international markets\n\nWhile the U.S. is by far the biggest source of international visitors to B.C., tourism marketers spend more dollars and time marketing B.C. to other international markets.\n\nDestination BC’s director of partner and market development Meredith Moll estimated to BIV that less than one quarter of Destination BC’s marketing dollars aimed at international visitors are spent in the U.S. “because it’s only one of our six key global markets.”\n\nWhen spending is funnelled into the U.S. it is done primarily in California, she added.\n\nMost Destination BC mostly spends its marketing dollars on digital channels, such as on social media, as opposed to physical billboards.\n\n“Specifically, the U.K., Germany, Australia, China and Mexico, as well as the U.S., are our key global markets where we really focus our efforts and our marketing spend,” she said.\n\nThis has been the case for a while, she said, so it is not a response to geopolitics, or an attempt to capitalize on anti-American sentiment in parts of Europe due to animosity with U.S. President Donald Trump and his tariff policies.\n\nNo matter how much money the tourism marketer spends in far-flung international markets, the reality is that the U.S. will continue to be the biggest single market for B.C.’s tourism sector.\n\nTravellers visit nearby places because it is cheaper and faster.\n\nOf the nearly 5.38 million international visitors who entered Canada through B.C. last year and stayed at least one night, close to 3.59 million — or 66.7 per cent — were Americans.\n\nAnd Americans’ share of international visitors is increasing.\n\nThe number of U.S. visitors to Canada who entered through B.C. ports and stayed overnight in 2024 was up 7.6 per cent from 2023. That was higher than the 7.3-per-cent overall growth rate for international visitors.\n\nThe trend of U.S. visitor growth outpacing overall visitor growth continued in the first quarter of this year, with American overnight visits to Canada through B.C. rising 2.4 per cent year-over-year to nearly 615,000. That compared with an overall 1.1-per-cent decline, to nearly 887,000 international overnight visitors who entered Canada through B.C. year-over-year in that same time period.\n\nEuropeans plan trips much further in advance than do Americans, according to Moll and other industry advocates, such as British Columbia Tourism Industry Association CEO Walt Judas.\n\nThat means that the effect of European visitors deciding to pivot trips to be in Canada instead of the U.S. could be in its early stages.\n\n“People are looking at Canada as an alternative,” Judas told BIV.\n\nHe said he has heard from industry partners that this is the case for Europeans as it is for Mexicans.\n\nIf the number of Mexicans visiting B.C. does rise it will buck a steep downward trend in visits that started in March 2024, after the Canadian government suddenly announced in late February of that year that most Mexicans would immediately need visas to enter Canada.\n\nVisits by Mexicans to Canada via B.C. fell 20.3 per cent in 2024 year-over-year, to nearly 165,000. That trend continued in the first quarter of this year, with just over 36,000 Mexican travellers visiting Canada through B.C. That is 28.1 per cent fewer visitors than in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAir Canada and Flair Airlines have announced new routes to Mexico out of Vancouver International Airport (YVR), and they plan to increase flight frequency this winter.\n\nAustralia may be the region with the most promise for tourist growth.\n\nCanada and Australia last year signed an Open Skies agreement that allows those countries’ airlines starting on January 1 the ability to fly an unlimited number of non-stop flights to any points within the other country.\n\nQantas Airways Ltd. earlier this month announced its plan to increase non-stop service between YVR and Sydney, Australia in January to daily, up from three times per week. It then plans to fly that route four times per week in February and March.","summary":"Six distinct sub-brands are being used under the Super Natural British Columbia slogan","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/hospitality-marketing-tourism/bc-rebrands-its-provincial-tourism-strategy-10830918","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/daniel-schildknecht.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:30:00","author":"Glen Korstrom","authors":["Glen Korstrom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.393},{"id":333238530,"title":"Yes, more and more celebrities are entering the phone business. Here’s why","text":"By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — More and more celebrities are looking to attach their names to your phone. Or rather, wireless services that could power it.\n\nFrom cosmetics to snacks and signature spirits, brands launched or co-owned by high-profile figures are just about everywhere you look today. But several big names are also venturing into the market for mobile virtual network operators — or MVNOs, an industry term for businesses that provide cell coverage by leasing infrastructure from bigger, more established carriers.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s family was the most recent to join the list with the launch of Trump Mobile this week. Here’s what to know.\n\nWhich big names have entered the phone business?\n\nOn Monday, The Trump Organization (currently run by the president’s sons Eric and Donald Jr.) unveiled Trump Mobile. The company says this new business will offer cell service, through an apparent licensing deal with “all three major cellular carriers” in the U.S., and sell gold phones by August.\n\nTrump Mobile marks the latest in a string of new Trump-branded offerings — which already span from golden sneakers to “God Bless the USA” bibles — despite mounting ethical concerns that the president is profiting off his position and could distort public policy for personal gain.\n\n“This raises a real question about a conflict of interest,” said Ben Bentzin, an associate professor of instruction at The University of Texas at Austin’s McCombs School of Business. As the sitting president, Trump appoints leadership for the Federal Communications Commission — and the family’s new phone venture exists under this regulatory authority.\n\nAll of this sets Trump Mobile apart from other big names that have recently ventured into the wireless business. Still, its launch arrives as a growing number of celebrities tap into this space.\n\nJust last week, actors Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett launched SmartLess Mobile, a name that mirrors the trio’s “SmartLess” podcast. Now live across the contiguous U.S. and Puerto Rico, SmartLess Mobile runs on T-Mobile’s 5G Network.\n\nAnother wireless provider with ties to fame is Mint Mobile. While not launched by celebrities, Ryan Reynolds purchased an ownership stake in Mint in 2019. Mint’s parent, the Ka’ena Corporation, was later acquired by T-Mobile in a deal worth up to $1.35 billion.\n\nBeyond names of famous people, well-known brands that weren’t traditionally in the phone business have also got in on the action over the years — particuarly outside of the U.S., Forrester Research senior analyst Octavio Garcia Granados notes. He points to Walmart’s “Bait” mobile plan in Mexico, for example, as well as Italian soccer club AC Milan launching its own mobile SIM cards for fans.\n\n“The MVNO market is not new,” said Garcia Granados. “What’s new is the development on how it’s consumed and the (ease) for brands to launch such plans.”\n\nMVNOs have also emerged outside of high-profile brands or launch teams. Bentzin points to Straight Talk and Cricket — which are now owned by Verizon and AT&T, respectively. Still, traditional celebrity endorsements are common across the board. And in recent years, “influencer marketing” has been “the fastest growing area of advertising and promotion,” he notes.\n\nWhat are these cell services offering? Why were they launched?\n\nFor Trump Mobile, the pitch seems to be all about having an “all-American service” while also tapping into the fan base of the president.\n\nThe company noted Monday that it chose to unveil Trump Mobile on the 10th anniversary of Trump launching “his historic presidential campaign.” The name given to its flagship offer, The 47 Plan, and the $47.45 monthly fee make reference to the president’s two terms. And a mock-up of the planned gold phone on the company’s website shows Trump’s “Make America Great” slogan on the front screen.\n\nAccording to the company, Trump Mobile’s 47 Plan will include unlimited calls, texts and data through partner carriers, as well as free roadside assistance and telehealth services. It also says the new phone, called the “T1 Phone,” will be available for $499 in August — but notes that this device won’t be designed or made by Trump Mobile. Still, the company emphasized that these phones will be built in the U.S.\n\nExperts have since shared skepticism about that being possible in two months. And beyond the future T1 Phone, others stress that a monthly cell service fee of just under $50 is pricey compared to other MVNO options today.\n\n“It’s not actual lower pricing. It’s really trading on the fan base, if you will, of Trump,” said Bentzin.\n\nSmartLess Mobile and Mint Mobile, of course, don’t carry these same political ties. And the wireless plans offered by both boast less expensive offerings.\n\nT-Mobile-owned Mint advertises “flexible, buy-in-bulk” plans that range from $15 to $30 a month. Each option includes unlimited talk and text nationwide, but vary depending on plan length and data amount. Mint, founded in 2016, says it started “because we’d had enough of the wireless industry’s games” — and promises to help consumers avoid hidden fees.\n\nSmartLess Mobile’s plans also start at $15 a month. Depending on the data amount purchased, that base fee can rise to $30 — but all of its plans similarly offer unlimited talk and text using T-Mobile’s network. When launching last week, SmartLess underlined that its goal is to help people stop paying for the data they don’t use, noting that the majority of data used by consumers today happens over Wi-Fi.\n\n“Seriously, if your phone bill knew how often you’re on Wi-Fi, it would be embarrassed,” Hayes said in a statement for SmartLess Mobile’s June 10 launch.\n\nWhat’s the demand?\n\nMVNOs have proven to be attractive acquisitions to big wireless carriers over the years. But whether or not the star factor promises significant demand has yet to be seen for the market’s most recent entrants.\n\nFor the more established Mint Mobile, Reynolds’ investment is a success story. The 25% stake that the actor reportedly owned in 2023, when the company announced that it would be acquired by T-Mobile, was estimated to give him a personal windfall of over $300 million in cash and stock. And since that deal closed, Reynolds has remained in his creative role for Mint and as the face of many campaigns — helping the brand continue to attract new customers.\n\nIt’s no surprise that the potential of such business returns might attract other celebrities to make similar investments, Bentzin notes. Still, newer ventures are untested. And “as the market becomes more crowded, it could be harder and harder to pick off individual consumers,” he added.\n\nBeyond a high-profile name, quality of service and what consumers can afford is also critical.\n\n“The competition battleground here is brand and price,” Bentzin said.\n\nStill, if the marketing is right and product meets consumer needs, experts like Garcia Granados note that MVNOs can be a profitable business, for both the brands that start them and the telecommunications giants — like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T — offering this “wholesale” access to their infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, he said, such high-profile ventures become “a catalyst for others to follow.”\n\nAP Business Writer Bernard Condon contributed to this report from New York.","summary":"Several big names are venturing into the market for mobile virtual network operators — or MVNOs.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/19/celeb-phone-businesses/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump_88140_eb35d7-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:29:49","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.321},{"id":333243344,"title":"Yes, more and more celebrities are entering the phone business.

We now advise “exercise a high degree of caution” due to ongoing hostilities in the region,’ the alert read.\n\n‘Conflicts in the Middle East could lead to an increase in tensions elsewhere in the region and may result in airspace closures, flight cancellations and other travel disruptions.\n\n‘Demonstrations and protest activity may also occur, and local security situations could deteriorate with little notice. Avoid all demonstrations and protests.’ \n\nThe alert has been raised from Level 1 to Level 2, advising travellers to exercise a high degree of caution. \n\n‘We’re not saying “don’t go” to this location. But you should do your research and take extra precautions. At level 2, there are more or higher risks than what you would typically find in a large Australian city,’ the advice said.\n\nLevel 3, one step above Qatar’s current travel advisory, urges travellers to ‘reconsider’ their need to travel. Level 4, the highest alert, advises against all travel and recommends those already there leave immediately due to ‘extreme health and safety risks.’ \n\nTravellers should monitor the media for new and existing risks, Smart Traveller said. \n\nIt comes as Australia closes its embassy in Tehran, as Iran and Israel continue to bomb each other and after President Donald Trump signalled the US could enter the conflict.\n\nAll foreign affairs staff and their dependents in the Iranian capital have been told to leave ‘based on advice about the deteriorating security environment’.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is deploying consular staff to Azerbaijan, including its border crossings, to support Australians departing Iran.\n\n‘We urge Australians who are able to leave Iran to do so now, if it is safe,’ Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Friday.\n\n‘Those who are unable to, or do not wish to leave, are advised to shelter in place.\n\n‘We are continuing planning to support Australians seeking to depart Iran, and we remain in close contact with other partner countries.’\n\nMeanwhile, there are still more than 1,200 Australians registered for assistance to depart Israel, where the airspace is also closed. \n\nTrump, who has kept the world guessing about whether the US might join the war on Israel’s side, said he would make a decision within the next two weeks.\n\n‘Based on the fact that there’s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,’ press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in Washington, quoting a message from the president.\n\nThe conflict between Israel and Iran erupted a week ago, when the former launched an attack against the Islamic republic’s missile capabilities, claiming it was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 639 people and wounded 1,300 others, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group.\n\nIsrael says Iran’s retaliatory strikes have killed at least 24 and wounded hundreds.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAn urgent travel warning has been issued for Australians travelling to or&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Important Alert for Australians Traveling Internationally Amid Middle East Conflict first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/asia/important-alert-for-australians-traveling-internationally-amid-middle-east-conflict/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Urgent-warning-to-Australians-taking-international-flights.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 23:28:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":333240376,"title":"'Just make something up': Analyst exposes Republicans' lies about details of Trump's bill","text":"Despite Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, their signature domestic policy legislation is overwhelmingly unpopular.
