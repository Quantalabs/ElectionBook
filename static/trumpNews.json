Amid escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, Indian students in Tehran were moved out of the city, 110 of them crossing the border into Armenia, through arrangements made by the Indian Embassy on Tuesday (June 17, 2025) under ‘Operation Sindhu’.\n\nU.S. President Trump hosts Pak Army Chief Munir\n\nIn a rare gesture, U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday (Jun 18, 2025) hosted Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir at the White House, weeks after India and Pakistan were locked in a four-day military conflict. The closed-door luncheon meeting came amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with Mr. Trump exploring Washington’s possible involvement.\n\nPutin says NATO rearmament not a ‘threat’ to Russia\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday (June 19, 2025) that NATO’s push to ramp up defence spending was not a “threat” to Russia, days before the alliance was set to sign off on a plan to boost its military capacity across Europe. In a late-night press conference, the Russian leader also said his troops would not stop pushing forward in Ukraine and sought to undermine his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nTata Group chairman Chandrasekaran ‘apologises’ for Ahmedabad AI plane crash\n\nTata Sons and Air India Chairman N. Chandrasekaran on Wednesday (June 18, 2025) “apologised” for the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad last week that claimed more than 270 lives. In an interview with a news channel, Mr. Chandrasekaran said, “It is an extremely difficult situation where I have no words to express to console any of the families of those who died.”\n\nFed leaves key rate unchanged as it awaits the impact of tariffs and Trump again scolds Powell\n\nFederal Reserve officials expect inflation to worsen in the coming months, but they still foresee two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, the same as they projected in March. The Fed kept its key rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting on Wednesday (June 18, 2025), and said the economy is expanding at “a solid pace.” Changes to the Fed’s rate typically – though not always – influence borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans. \n\nU.S. top court upholds ban on gender-affirming care for minors\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday (June 18, 2025) upheld a state law banning gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender minors – an issue at the heart of the American culture wars. The court voted 6-3 to uphold a Tennessee law barring hormone therapy, puberty blockers and gender transition surgery for those under the age of 18. \n\nAir India to cut 15% of widebody operated international flights\n\nAir India will be cutting down international flights on widebody aircraft that mostly connect long haul and ultra long haul destinations by 15%, the airline said late on Wednesday (June 18, 2025) evening. The decision was taken to mitigate the impact of the compounding circumstances resulting from DGCA-ordered enhanced surveillance for Boeing 787 aircraft, geopolitical tensions in West Asia, night curfew in the airspaces of many countries in Europe and East Asia, and “the necessary cautious approach being taken by the engineering staff and Air India pilots”.\n\nFounders can now hold employee stock options post listing, says SEBI\n\nIn a bid to increase ease of doing business for market participants, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has approved proposals to allow founders to hold employee stock options even after listing, relax regulations for alternative investment funds (AIF), and allow public sector undertakings (PSUs) with minimal public shareholding to delist, among other actions.\n\nGoyal optimistic about signing first tranche of U.S. trade deal before July 9\n\nAs the clock ticks towards U.S. President Donald Trump’s ‘reciprocal tariffs’ to kick in on July 9, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has expressed optimism that India and the U.S. could sign a preliminary or early tranche of a larger trade deal before that date, though he stopped short of confirming a deal would be signed. “We are in continuous dialogue. I have always been an optimist,” Mr. Goyal said in an interview with The Hindu on the fringes of a conference organised by the India Global Forum 2025 in London.","summary":"Here is a select list of stories to start the day","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/morning-digest-june-19-2025/article69711629.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/grajbs/article69711617.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20250618224L.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 01:14:09","author":"The Hindu Bureau","authors":["The Hindu Bureau"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":332880036,"title":"Israel-Iran conflict LIVE: Khamenei vows Iran will never surrender; warns against U.S. intervention","text":"Iran’s supreme leader on Wednesday rejected U.S. calls for surrender in the face of more Israeli strikes and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage to them.” European diplomats prepared to hold talks with Iran on Friday.\n\nThe second public appearance by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since the Israeli strikes began six days ago came as Israel lifted some restrictions on daily life, suggesting that the missile threat from Iran was easing.\n\nKhamenei spoke a day after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded in a social media post that Iran surrender without conditions and warned Khamenei that the U.S. knows where he is but has no plans to kill him, “at least not for now.”\n\nTrump initially distanced himself from Israel’s surprise attack aimed at Iran’s nuclear program, but in recent days he has hinted at greater American involvement, saying he wants something “much bigger” than a ceasefire.

In May, the New York Times published a report citing \"private messages\" sent to them and \"interviews with more than a dozen people who have known or worked with him\" that alleged Musk’s drug use was \"more intense\" than publicly known as he campaigned with then-candidate Donald Trump in 2024. \"Mr. Musk’s drug consumption went well beyond occasional use,\" the NYT reported. \"He told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use. He took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. And he traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it.\" NY TIMES COLUMNIST COMPARES ELON MUSK TO HISTORY’S WORST MURDERERS OVER USAID CUTS Musk repeatedly denounced the article and called out the Times by posting the results of a recent drug test on his X account Tuesday. The paper's communications team responded to the results, saying that Musk was \"continuing to lash out\" against them and stood by the story. \"Elon Musk is continuing to lash out because he doesn't like our reporting. Nothing that he's said or presented since our article about his drug use during the presidential campaign was published contradicts what we uncovered. We stand by our journalism,\" the NY Times Communications account wrote. The NYT gave the same response after Musk challenged the New York Times and Wall Street Journal to release the results of their own drug tests. \"Great idea. I hereby challenge the NYT and WSJ to take drug tests and publish the results! They won’t, because those hypocrites are guilty as sin,\" Musk wrote. The back-and-forth between the New York Times and Musk has been ongoing since the article was published on May 30. One day after the story was published, Musk wrote on X that the NYT was \"lying their a-- off\" and insisted that he had not taken ketamine in years. The NY Times Communications account pushed back on Musk at the time, similarly accusing Musk of \"lashing out\" but with \"no evidence.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"Kirsten Grind and Megan Twohey's thoroughly sourced report provides an important and fair look into Musk's drug use and family conflicts.

'It's not the immigrants, it's the billionaires.'\n\nRuffalo, whom Finance Monthly estimates has a net worth of $90 million, then went on to claim Trump and conservatives are wrongfully scapegoating migrants for the problems created by white Americans and billionaires.\n\n'We're seeing what's happening,' he said.\n\n'First of all, we're understanding that the immigrants aren't the criminals. If you look at the statistics, most of the crimes committed in this country are by white people - non immigrants,' the actor claimed, adding that immigrants 'add to our economy by the billions.'\n\nThe Spotlight star concluded his remarks by saying: 'It's time to take our country back from that extreme wealth that has its hands all over the power of the nation, and become a beautiful, burgeoning democracy that works for the people, not just the very wealthy.' \n\nRuffalo repeated those sentiments in prepared remarks at the massive protest.\n\n'Sadly, today Donald Trump and the administration of billionaires, crackpots and ICE brigades have taken over,' he lamented.\n\n'We have a king and his court and his beige henchmen - and they're trampling on our rights and our laws and our freedoms, making themselves richer with taxpayer dollars and making us less safe with their love of other kings and dictators and the likes of Putin and Netanyahu and Kim Jong Un of the world.' \n\nHe then concluded by declaring that the protesters who took to the streets 'are the Avengers' as they are not afraid to fight.\n\nThe protest on Saturday drew boisterous crowds marching, dancing, drumming and chanting shoulder-to-shoulder in New York, as well as cities like Denver, Chicago, Austin and Los Angeles. \n\nIn some places, organizers handed out little American flags while others flew their flags upside down, a sign of distress. \n\nMexican flags which have become a fixture of the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids, also made an appearance at some of the demonstrations.\n\nBut the Trump administration has claimed the migrants it is rounding up are convicted criminals. \n\n'The Trump Administration will fulfill the President’s promise to deport illegal aliens and no one – not even violent left-wing rioters – will get in the way of our mission,' White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Daily Mail last week. \n\n'ICE is arresting illegal aliens and will continue to do so all around the country no matter what radical liberals do, the safety of the American people depends on it,' she said.","summary":"An A-list Marvel actor has claimed

It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.\n\n“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me.

TRUMP’S REVAMPED COAST GUARD SURGES WITH ‘SKYROCKETING’ RECRUITING TO SECURE MARITIME BORDERS: DHS MEMO To raise its recruitment numbers, the Navy Recruiting Command established a Recruiting Operations Center to monitor data in real time. The maritime service branch also streamlined medical waiver reviews and improved the productivity of recruiters by identifying and removing barriers, among other efforts, according to the Navy. While the military branch has already surpassed its recruitment goal, the Navy continues to process applicants. \"Reaching our annual goal this early is a testament to the dedication and innovation of our recruiting force,\" Rear Adm. Jim Waters, commander of Navy Recruiting Command, said in a statement. \"It shows that when we remove barriers, accelerate processes, and meet people where they are, the right individuals answer the call.\" NAVY TORPEDOES BIDEN-ERA CLIMATE AGENDA TO FOCUS ON LETHALITY In 2024, the Navy surpassed its recruiting goal of 40,600 by 378 recruits, marking its largest recruiting class in more than two decades, according to the U.S. Navy. The Navy’s recruiting success this year follows a similar announcement earlier this month from the U.S. Army, in which the branch announced it had surpassed its fiscal year 2025 recruiting goals four months ahead of schedule. The Army signed contracts with more than 61,000 future soldiers, a more than 10% increase from the 55,000 recruits targeted in fiscal year 2024.

Then a sudden gust of that fragrant Alberta air lifted the papers from Trump’s grasp and sent them in a flapping cascade to the ground.\n\nThe Prime Minister scampered about, picking them up from around the presidential shoes while Trump grinned down at him. So much for an equal partnership.\n\nIt was unfortunate, to say the least. As the younger man, Starmer was doing the right thing. But, apart from the appearance of subservience, the dropping of those pages was a neat representation of the way Britain must constantly pick up after an inconstant and volatile administration.\n\nThe arrangement set out in those loose sheets is useful enough as far as it goes. But it is narrow and limited.\n\nBritish car exports will now face a tariff of 10 per cent in the US, as opposed to the 25 per cent tariff faced by cars made in the EU.\n\nOur steel will face a tariff of 25 per cent, as against 50 per cent had we stayed in the EU. The component parts we make for aircraft can be sold in the US tariff-free.\n\nThese numbers represent a net deterioration in the position we enjoyed at the start of the year, before Trump announced his deranged global tariffs, and many will ask what there is to celebrate.\n\nThis is especially true with regard to steel. Because Tata Steel has closed its blast furnace at Port Talbot while it builds a greener version, it is importing semi-finished steel from its sister companies in India and the Netherlands and finishing it in Wales.\n\nIt is far from clear that the tariff exemption will apply to such steel – a reminder, incidentally, of how absurd tariffs of any sort are in a world of extended supply-lines, where component parts come from many different places.\n\nBeing more favourably treated than the EU is obviously preferable to the alternative. It is hardly a win, though.\n\nQuite apart from anything else, we want our European neighbours to be wealthy. Even if they were not our friends and allies, we would still want them to be rich so as to be good customers.\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough that the deal between the two English-speaking allies was only ever intended to be a stop-gap, a temporary suspension of what would have otherwise been ruinous tariffs on British luxury car exports while a more thorough deal was hammered out.\n\nPart of the fuller deal, as Starmer’s spokesman optimistically reminded us, is meant to be zero-for-zero tariffs – or, at least, something much closer to zero-for-zero than we have now. But that is not the most important part of it.\n\nBoth our countries have services-based economies. In Britain, manufacturing acc-ounts for around 20 per cent of GDP, and agriculture for less than 1 per cent. This means about 80 per cent is services. The American proportions are similar.\n\nWhile lifting tariffs matters for the industrial 20 per cent, there are greater gains in removing non-tariff barriers on the invisible 80 per cent. These barriers take all sorts of forms, from divergent rules on data storage to restrictions on professional qualifications.\n\nThe chief gains would be in the lifting of obstacles to trade in the main service industries – banking, insurance, investment, shipping, law, education and healthcare. Reducing or removing barriers would substantially boost both economies at a time when, Heaven knows, they need it.\n\nFree trade is about lowering prices and increasing choice. Suppose, for example, that British airlines could fly domestic US routes. Imagine how that would raise the game of the complacent and uncomfortable American carriers.\n\nSuppose that pharmaceutical products approved in one country could automatically be sold in the other. Or that lawyers or doctors qualified in one jurisdiction could work without taking any additional exams in the other.\n\nBecause Britain has a relatively open services sector, it is, as diplomats say, the main demandeur here – the country with the bigger ask. American banks and funds can already operate in London more easily than British companies in New York.\n\nWhat might the US want in return? Its negotiators want us to follow global rules on trade instead of clinging to various protectionist measures that we inherited from the EU and have never got around to repealing.\n\nRules such as the unscientific ban on one particular growth hormone in beef (British and EU beef uses many other hormones, all equally harmless).\n\nThese standards mainly apply to physical goods, and especially to food. Which brings us to Starmer’s dilemma. He has just invited Brussels to set our food and veterinary standards in perpetuity, making us a much less attractive trade partner to the US; or, indeed,anyone else.\n\nThis, I think, was Labour’s objective throughout. From the moment he arrived in Washington as our ambassador, Peter Mandelson was talking about doing a trade deal with the US that focused on tech and AI.\n\nThis would allow Britain to remain, to all intents and purposes, under EU rule for goods, while joining the rest of the world for services.\n\nThe trouble is that, in agreeing to ‘dynamic alignment’ with the EU (in reality, few places are less dynamic) Britain has handed away its most valuable negotiating chips. There is now a real danger that we will never get to the full trade deal promised by Washington last month, and will instead be left with what was intended as the holding position – which, to repeat, leaves us worse off than where we were in March.\n\nI have until now been hopeful about the prospects of a US deal. Partly because of Trump’s fondness for this country (‘The UK is very well protected,’ he declared in Alberta, ‘you know why? Because I like them.’) Partly because we are one of the few nations with which the US runs a surplus – or something very close to a surplus. Partly because our economies are naturally complementary. But mainly because a lot of the work had already been done during Trump’s first term.\n\nThe EU, though, has never liked the idea of a UK-US trade agreement. It especially hates the idea of no longer having Britain as a captive market for its agricultural exporters. The conditions it insisted on in the ‘reset’ deal appear to have been drawn up, at least in part, with an eye on foiling any transatlantic deal.\n\nMy guess is that EU diplomats and negotiators spotted early on that Starmer was emotionally committed to their project, that he was mortified by Brexit, and that he was ready to sign anything that he saw as ‘bringing us closer to Europe’.\n\nWhat a tragedy if, in doing so, he has made less likely a trade deal with the world’s largest economy, and Britain’s chief trading partner.\n\nHow heartbreaking if, in cosying up to a market that has been in decline for decades, he is ignoring the parts of the world that are growing fastest.\n\nDropping the deal? Let’s hope it was not a metaphor for what happens next.","summary":"As symbolism goes, the physical dropping of the US trade deal was hard to beat.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14826529/picture-tells-Starmers-relationship-Trump-obsession-Europe-wreck-genuine-US-trade-deal.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/18/22/99510565-0-image-m-21_1750281469367.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 00:47:09","author":"Daniel Hannan,Editor","authors":["Daniel Hannan","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":332876420,"title":"European diplomats to meet with Iran's foreign minister","text":"Senior diplomats from Germany, France and the UK are reportedly planning to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva, as the conflict between Iran and Israel escalates.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul adjusted his originally planned Middle East trip to Lebanon, Syria and Israel immediately after the start of Israel's attack on Iran on Friday.\n\nInstead, he travelled to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman for crisis talks. The government in Oman, in particular, has very strong contacts with Tehran.\n\nWadephul is aiming to coordinate an initiative involving the so-called E3 states - Germany, France and the United Kingdom - which have been negotiating with Tehran over its nuclear programme for years, as well as with neighbouring Arab states, to achieve a diplomatic solution to the war.\n\nThe US and Iran had been negotiating under the mediation of Oman for nearly two months, before Israel launched a major attack on Iran on Friday, targeting nuclear facilities, military installations and sites in major cities.

This phase introduces a new series of movies and TV shows, all inspired by Marvel Comics’ characters. Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach will play the roles of the superheroes Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing, respectively. Together, they must battle Galactus, a cosmic entity that devours planets, portrayed by Ralph Ineson.\n\nIf cosmic battles don’t pique your interest, you’re not alone, but millions of fans globally have been captivated since the first MCU film, Iron Man, debuted in 2008. Since then, the MCU has generated over $30 billion at the box office, solidifying its status as the top-grossing movie franchise ever.\n\nWhether or not these films appeal to you, they command attention. That’s why, before the release of the 37th film in the series, I’ve decided to rank the previous 36 from best to worst. The last time I ranked movies, specifically the Bond series, it sparked debate. This time, I’m ready for your feedback! Let me know what you think.\n\n 1. Black Panther (2018)\n\nA $1.3billion box-office smash and the best Marvel movie by an African country mile … the country in question being Wakanda, which only masquerades as a struggling Third World nation. In fact it is hugely rich and sophisticated, thanks to its extensive reserves of the mysterious metal vibranium. \n\nRyan Coogler’s film is huge, compelling fun, with tremendously charismatic leads in Michael B Jordan and especially Chadwick Boseman, as the title character, otherwise known as King T’Challa. \n\nIt’s a terrific, old-fashioned action-adventure about two cousins wrestling for Wakanda’s throne (among other things) but, without ever getting preachy, it does not swerve issues of race and white colonialism. \n\nThat might be why it was the first superhero movie to receive a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards (losing to a lesser film about race, the unexceptional Green Book). Incidentally, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis led the non-black cast and, having both featured in The Hobbit trilogy, were cheekily known on set as ‘the Tolkien white guys’. I like that.\n\n2. Avengers: Endgame (2019)\n\nThe Russo brothers went to town with this sequel to the previous year’s Infinity War. Billed as a last hurrah for the mighty Avengers, at just over three hours it remains the longest Marvel movie ever made. Certainly, you need a super-bladder to make it to the end without a loo break. \n\nYet it does a remarkably good job of holding the attention, with plenty of sparky wit and several spectacular battle sequences as our subdued gang of superheroes bounce back after being vanquished in Infinity War by Thanos (Josh Brolin), the genocidal maniac with the vast slab of corrugated jaw who has rudely erased half of all life in the universe. \n\nEndgame stands second, behind Avatar (2009), in the list of highest-grossing films of all time. It also remains notable for featuring the last appearance by Stan Lee, the dynamic force behind Marvel Comics, who died aged 95 just a few months before Endgame was released, but had already filmed his cameo.\n\n3. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) \n\n The Marvel Cinematic Universe, as befits its grandiose name, can sometimes take itself a little too seriously. Nobody ever accused the so-called ‘franchise-starter’ Guardians of the Galaxy of that. \n\nAs Star-Lord Peter Quill, leader of a bizarrely but winningly motley crew of inter-galactic rogues and adventurers (including a tree and a racoon), Chris Pratt is a splendidly irreverent lead and the film rightly made him a star. It did wonders for Dave Bautista’s acting career too. \n\nThe former world wrestling champion had appeared in a few films – and even on Neighbours! – but Drax the Destroyer was his breakthrough role. It took three hours every day to apply his full body make-up and he could only remove it by sweating it off in a sauna, but his effort, and everyone else’s, paid off. \n\nThe film was a huge hit and the retro soundtrack alone set a record. Featuring David Bowie, Marvin Gaye, the Jackson 5 and even 10cc’s I’m Not in Love it became the first soundtrack album with no new songs to reach number one in the US charts.\n\n4. Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)\n\nChris Evans reportedly declined the title role of Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, three times before finally saying yes. He later admitted that he was scared, not only of it being a flop but also of it being a hit. Either way he feared the impact on his career. \n\n‘I can’t believe I was almost too chicken to play Captain America,’ he later mused. Happily, this lively origin story, whisking us back to 1941 when Rogers was a sickly boy desperate to enlist in the US Army, turned out to be terrific. \n\nEvans gets excellent support from Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell, but it’s his movie and he nails it.\n\n5. Thunderbolts* (2025)\n\nFlorence Pugh is fantastic as world-weary Russian hitwoman Yelena Belova, rightly taking centre-stage four years after making her MCU debut in Black Widow as younger sister (and comic foil) to Scarlett Johansson’s Natasha Romanoff. \n\nThunderbolts* hasn’t done great box-office business but it is still one of my favourite Marvel movies of recent years. It’s really smartly written, wonderfully acted, and Julie Louis-Dreyfus, as an evil CIA director, makes a first-class villain. \n\nBut it is Pugh’s double-act with David Harbour that steals the show. He plays her semi-estranged proxy father Alexei Shostakov, the retired Russian super-soldier with the mouthful of gold teeth. \n\nSeeing the depressive Yelena for the first time in a year, he grunts: ‘The light inside you is dim … even by Eastern European standards.’ I laughed out loud.\n\n6. Captain America: The Winter Soldier \n\nA slick sequel to 2011’s The First Avenger, this Russo brothers film bowls along exuberantly and doesn’t suffer at all from the restrained use of computer-generated effects. If anything the relative lack of CGI is an asset, making Winter Soldier look in some ways like an old-school espionage thriller. \n\nJenny Agutter and Toby Jones lead the Brit contingent, indeed the former gets to beat up Robert Redford, no less, playing villainous Alexander Pierce of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. \n\nIn an interview two years ago with Good Housekeeping magazine, Agutter, then 70, revealed how thrilled she was to step away from the role of Sister Julienne in TV’s Call the Midwife, in order to rough up Robert Redford. Which, it has to be said, is entirely understandable.\n\n7. Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)\n\nThis film has one of the very best Marvel villains – Michael Keaton’s magnificently mean and menacing Vulture. But the film will always be remembered first and foremost for Tom Holland’s full-scale debut as Spider-Man. \n\nDespite the best efforts of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire before him, he suits the famous skin-tight blue-and-red onesie better than anyone, convincing not only as the web-slinging superhero but, just as importantly, also as his geeky schoolboy alter ego, Peter Parker. \n\nHolland prepared for that side of his role, incidentally, by attending a Bronx high school for a few days. Only one other student was in on the secret, with Holland posing as his cousin. On his last day he did tell a girl that he was really there because he was preparing to play Spider-Man, ‘but she just thought I was a nutter’.\n\n8. The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)\n\nThe much-hyped follow-up to The Avengers is actually a notch or two better than the original. Its extravagance is not always matched by coherence, but that’s nothing new in the MCU. \n\nLoosely, it adheres to the age-old theme of the good monster turned bad, in this case, a rogue robot, the fiendishly powerful Ultron (James Spader), conceived as a global peace-keeping programme only to use all its artificial intelligence to reach the conclusion that humans in general, and superheroes in particular, need wiping out. \n\nThe writer and director, as on the first film, is Joss Whedon, who was also one of the lead writers 20 years earlier on Pixar’s glorious Toy Story. So not unexpectedly there are some very funny lines, although he delivers on visuals too. The closing battle scene is outrageously spectacular. \n\nIncidentally, Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) was pregnant when filming began, so Whedon had to shoot her scenes first, before the bump began to show.\n\n9. The Avengers (2012)\n\nFor a while The Avengers was the third-highest grossing picture of all time. In the US it made more than $200million on its opening weekend in May 2012 and went on to become one of the greatest-ever summer blockbusters. \n\nIt’s a wildly enjoyable film in which Tom Hiddleston has a ball as Loki, the dastardly brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), whose plans to conquer Earth are (spoiler alert) nobbled by our resourceful band of superheroes. \n\nIn a nice example of art colliding with life, the film was shown in space, at a ‘movie night’ on the International Space Station, at the request of American astronaut Joe Acaba. Despite the obvious review, that it was ‘out of this world’, he rather disappointingly reported back only that it was ‘great’.\n\n10. Iron Man 3 (2013) \n\nJessica Chastain was due to play Tony Stark’s ex-girlfriend, genetic biologist Maya Hansen, in the third Iron Man movie but then pulled out to be replaced by Rebecca Hall. \n\nChastain has been lined up for other Marvel movies down the years yet has always stepped back, once explaining: ‘I don’t want to be the girlfriend. I don’t want to be the daughter. I want to wear a ****ing cool costume with a scar on my face, with fight scenes.’ \n\nHappily, Hall issued no such demands and makes the best of limited screen time. This is actually the best of the Iron Man series, in which Stark (Robert Downey Jnr), rather like Daniel Craig’s James Bond in the previous year’s Skyfall, shows us a vulnerable side up to and including panic attacks. \n\nThat’s not what everyone wants even from the mortal alter egos of superheroes, but Downey pulls it off superbly, while director and co-writer Shane Black (who made his debut as a writer on 1987’s Lethal Weapon, and as a director with 2005’s acclaimed neo-noir satire Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) ensures that the film fizzes with energy throughout.\n\n11. Thor: Ragnarok (2017) \n\nWith Taika Waititi (director of the uproarious vampire spoof What We Do In The Shadows) at the helm, this third Thor film was always likely to be about as flippant as superhero movies get, but Waititi still pulled out all the stops: it’s a livewire comedy and genuinely funny. \n\nChris Hemsworth didn’t get much of a chance in the first two films to show off his comic timing, but here he gives it full vent as Thor returns home to Asgard to tackle his conniving brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and terrifying sister Hela (Cate Blanchett). \n\nWaititi gets in on the act, too, hilariously playing a dim alien based, so the Kiwi director once revealed, on Auckland nightclub bouncers he had encountered.\n\n12. Iron Man (2008)\n\nThe first Marvel picture was a tremendous success, setting the foundations for the monolith that the MCU was to become. ‘It showed the world how great superhero films could be,’ says my son’s friend Ed, the biggest Marvel fan I know. \n\nBut it had a fraught back story, not least in the matter of its leading man. Director Jon Favreau was a big fan of Robert Downey Jnr, but the actor’s battle with substance abuse had been waged in the full glare of publicity – and infamously he had also served 15 months in jail. \n\nCasting him was a huge commercial risk, but Favreau stuck to his guns, and Downey rewarded him with a brilliant screen test. The studio suits duly gave their approval, all the casting fell into place, and production got underway. \n\nIt’s still an impressive film, a proper blockbuster driven by Downey’s charisma as Tony Stark, the billionaire inventor (apparently inspired by Howard Hughes) who discovers amazing superpowers. And Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow bring their A-games too, never a bad thing.\n\n13. Black Widow (2021) \n\nScarlett Johansson’s formidable Natasha Romanoff at last gets her own adventure, and certainly makes the most of it, raising a valid question: why did Captain America, Iron Man and Thor each get three standalone movies before she got one? \n\nWhether or not old-fashioned misogyny is the answer, it certainly raises its ugly head in the narrative. Ray Winstone of all people plays a sinister Russian general (with a slightly dodgy accent, the Eastern Bloc by way of the East End) who believes that women – ‘the only natural resource the world has too much of’ – are only valuable if they can be brainwashed into becoming assassins. \n\nNaturally, he then gets more than he has bargained for from one of them: narky Natasha herself. Aptly, the director is female too: the Australian Cate Shortland was the first woman to direct an MCU film solo.\n\n14. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)\n\nIt doesn’t sound like a Marvel movie and doesn’t really feel like one, either. Rather, this story of a son trying to break free from a tyrannical father belongs more to the Chinese martial arts tradition. \n\nNevertheless, it is very much a part of the MCU and a blast pretty much from start to finish, with some superb fight sequences choreographed by Jackie Chan’s Australian protégé Brad Allan – who died suddenly, aged 48, only a month before the film’s release. It is dedicated to him and quite right too, because he oversaw some breathtaking stunt work.\n\n 15. Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)\n\nTom Holland’s second headline outing as Spider-Man is not quite up there with the first, but with director Jon Watts again at the helm, it’s still a sizzling adventure. \n\nPeter Parker, during a school trip to Europe on which most of his attention is directed towards his sexy classmate MJ (Zendaya, later to become Holland’s real-life squeeze), is persuaded by Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) to pull on his special onesie and team up with Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal in his MCU debut) to take on the scary Elementals. As one critic wrote, ‘it feels like a charming teen road-trip comedy that occasionally turns into a superhero movie’. That’s about right.\n\n16. Thor (2011) \n\nKenneth Branagh has only directed one Marvel film to date but what a good one, as Chris Hemsworth breathed thunderous life into the mighty, hammer-wielding crown prince of Asgard. \n\nBranagh’s involvement was pivotal in the recruitment of several key players. It tempted Natalie Portman into playing Thor’s love interest Jane Foster – ‘Kenneth Branagh doing Thor is super-weird … I gotta do it’ – and Idris Elba into taking on the fairly minor role of Heimdall, the watchman of the gods. \n\nMoreover, Branagh helped Tom Hiddleston find the damaged character of Loki by telling him to watch Peter O’Toole as King Henry II in the 1968 Oscar-winning classic The Lion in Winter (which also happened to star Thor’s father Odin, otherwise known as Anthony Hopkins, as Richard the Lionheart).\n\n17. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 (2023) \n\nWe could all have been forgiven, when we started watching Marvel films, for not anticipating one in which the tumultuous back-story of a raccoon would play a part. \n\nBut then Rocket Raccoon became a Marvel Comics character as far back as 1976, inspired by the 1968 Beatles track Rocky Raccoon. Moreover, Guardians 3 is actually a heap of fun, and it’s hard not to love the moving tale of Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) who turns out to have been torn away from his childhood sweetheart (an otter) while escaping the clutches of a mad vivisectionist known as the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). \n\nThere are some who might say that this isn’t what the MCU should be about but nuts to them, and besides, Will Poulter hams it up delightfully as the underling sent to recapture the recalcitrant raccoon.\n\n18. Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)\n\nThis bright and breezy sequel to 2015’s Ant-Man is bags of fun, with fabulous special effects. I liked it a fair bit more than the original. It begins with former cat burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) languishing under house arrest, though soon enough he is commandeering ant armies and cracking endless ant jokes, with a reference to ‘Ant-onio Banderas’ being merely the clunkiest of them. \n\nThe Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) is his new sidekick, and prior to the film’s release there was much excitement about her being the first female character to share title billing in a Marvel movie, though in truth she is very much second banana as Lang/Ant-Man sets about trying to outsmart a black market arms dealer, played by king of the screen sneer, Walton Goggins.\n\n19. Avengers: Infinity War (2018)\n\nThe first superhero movie to top $2billion in global box-office takings was big in every way, with a huge cast uniting the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy in the colossal challenge to stop Josh Brolin’s genocidal Thanos gathering the six Infinity Stones he needs to eliminate half the universe. \n\nIn a way the film is too big: too many characters, too much plot, too reliant on special effects. Still, it also offers plenty of pleasures, not least the unlikely spectacle of Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) deploying their superpowers at Edinburgh’s Waverley Station. \n\nMind you, that’s where I once vaulted the barriers in successful pursuit of a late-night train to Dundee. Miracles can happen anywhere.\n\n20. Captain America: Civil War (2016)\n\nThe third Captain America film directed by the Russo brothers follows on from the events in Winter Soldier, but this time the Avengers face an unusual political threat: should they sign away their independence and become a tool of the United Nations, as embodied by boring men in suits (played by William Hurt and Martin Freeman)?\n\nSome of them including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jnr) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) think they should, others led by Captain America (Chris Evans) and Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) are determined to resist. \n\nAlways happy to cite their cinematic influences, the Russos said they borrowed from The Godfather in depicting these ‘family’ differences. Yet like all the best Marvel films, Civil War never takes itself too seriously. It’s high-spirited fun which also gives us our first glimpse of Tom Holland’s Spider-Man.\n\n21. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)\n\nThis sequel to Doctor Strange is stuffed with so many references to other Marvel films that it takes a true MCU anorak to follow every twist and turn. \n\nThere’s a fair amount for even fair-weather fans to enjoy, including another fine, committed lead performance by Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular Master of the Mystic Arts.\n\nBut it’s really a film for the Marvel faithful, many of whom rate it among their all-time favourites, and are entirely on board with the murderous one-eyed octopus chasing a teenage girl called America (the excellent Xochitl Gomez) through the multiverse. \n\nFor me, it’s both too convoluted and too much in thrall to the Marvel back catalogue, but director Sam Raimi, who made his name with the Evil Dead movies, manages to weave in some original horror elements in a film said by many enthusiasts to be the first genuinely scary MCU picture.\n\n22. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 (2017)\n\nA decent sequel, which introduces a scene-stealing Elizabeth Debicki – Princess Diana in The Crown – as a haughty high priestess, the hilariously po-faced and indeed gold-faced Ayesha, leader of an alien race called the Sovereign who first hire Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and his wise-cracking mercenaries, then turn on them. \n\nJames Gunn’s film sometimes strains a bit too hard to be as wacky as the first one, but it bowls along and like the original is full of fabulous retro music. This time the galaxy is guarded to the strains of Fleetwood Mac’s The Chain and Sweet’s Fox on the Run, among other golden oldies, which more than makes up for the try-hard lavatorial gags.\n\n23. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)\n\nDespite the terribly sad death in 2020 of Chadwick Boseman, who played the title character first time around, a sequel was as inevitable as the African sunrise. \n\nFor cynics the key word in the title is ‘Forever’ – at two hours 41 minutes the film definitely outstays its welcome. \n\nAt the premiere I sat just behind the footballer Mason Mount, who grew increasingly restless as it wore on towards the equivalent of a third period of extra-time. If he could have decided the plot on penalties, I’m sure he would have done. \n\nBut Ryan Coogler’s movie certainly has its merits, and a fair amount of spirited fun. Angela Bassett is marvellous as the Wakandan queen who rejects international pressure to share the country’s coveted metal vibranium, sternly telling the UN ‘I am not a woman who enjoys repeating myself.’ Which is merciful news, frankly, given the running-time.\n\n24. Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\n\nAs if our spandexed superhero didn’t have villains enough to battle, in this movie he also has to deal with the fake news media, as Donald Trump might say, in the form of JK Simmons as the vindictive editor of The Daily Bugle, who keeps trying to cast Peter Parker as public enemy number one. So Peter appeals to Dr Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to use his wizardry to make the world forget that he is Spider-Man.\n\nWriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were reportedly influenced by the 1946 masterpiece It’s A Wonderful Life in developing this parallel universe idea. But tampering with cosmic reality can be dangerous. \n\nSoon, familiar villains from all over the multiverse start descending, each with an axe to grind, and sometimes worse. It’s a greatest-hits album of a film, really (with turns from both previous Spider-Mans, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield), but it’s too contrived, even by Marvel standards, to be a classic.\n\n25. Captain Marvel (2019)\n\nAgainst the odds, Brie Larson pipped Scarlett Johansson to the honour of becoming the first woman to lead a Marvel movie, and she gets solid female support from Annette Bening and Lashana Lynch. \n\nLarson does a fine job as Carol Danvers, a former US Air Force officer whose memory was wiped out in an explosion and therefore doesn’t know how she came to be living on the distant planet of Hala involved in a scrap between warring alien races the Skulls and the Kree, being mentored by Kree warrior Ron-Yogg (Jude Law). That’s what amnesia can do to you, I suppose. \n\nAnyway, the story is set mostly in the mid-1990s and there’s lots of enjoyable Blockbuster Video-style period detail in the earth sequences, but on the whole it feels muddled, and oddly for the MCU, even a little bland.\n\n26. Iron Man 2 (2010)\n\nThere’s a tremendous scene at the Monaco Grand Prix, where weirdo villain Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) launches an attack on his nemesis, Robert Downey Jnr’s Tony Stark. And Sam Rockwell plainly has a hoot as a shady arms dealer, while there’s even a cameo by a certain Elon Musk, pitching an idea for an electric jet. \n\nBut there’s too often a nagging feeling in this sequel that the cast are having more fun than the audience. Still, the US PG-13 certificate comes with a warning that iron Man 2 contains ‘swearing, mayhem, bloodshed and sexual innuendo’ and if they aren’t the ingredients for a modestly enjoyable bit of escapism then I don’t know what are. \n\nThe screenplay is by Justin Theroux, presenter Louis Theroux’s cousin as well as Jennifer Aniston’s ex-husband. More significantly, he’s a prolific actor, writer and director, though best-known in the wider Theroux family for eating a Styrofoam cup as a child. He’s crammed a lot into his 53 years.\n\n27. Ant-Man (2015)\n\nEdgar Wright, the British writer-director of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, quit the production shortly before filming began citing ‘creative differences’ – that Hollywood euphemism for an enormous barney. \n\nSo Marvel hired Peyton Reed (Yes Man), who does an OK job, while Adam McKay (Anchorman) was brought in to gussie up the script. But it might have been better had Wright stayed in the chair, with fellow Brit Joe Cornish as lead writer. \n\nSome of their work remains, but somehow it feels like a film with a troubled history. Paul Rudd is as likeable as ever as the titular diddy-man, a latter-day Robin Hood shrunken by chemicals. But he tries to squeeze just a bit too much juice from his wise-cracking screen persona. By contrast, Michael Douglas as a mad scientist is strangely under-juiced.\n\n28. Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)\n\nA film can be too glibly self-aware by half, and that’s the mistake this one makes, basically smirking its way through its two hours-plus running-time as Ryan Reynolds’s Deadpool and Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine drop Hollywood in-jokes by the limo-load. \n\nThe many references to Disney’s 2019 acquisition of 20th Century Fox (which meant that characters from the Disney-owned MCU could henceforward hook up with those from Fox’s X-Men series, as here) very quickly become tiresome, and Reynolds breaks the fourth wall so often that by the end it’s a wonder there’s any of it left. \n\nIndeed it’s almost a surprise that the famous co-owner of Wrexham FC at no point wears a club scarf, like Eric Morecambe waving a Luton Town placard during his Roman Empire playlet with Glenda Jackson all those years ago. Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some funny moments, and Emma Corrin’s Cassandra Nova is a wonderfully enigmatic baddie, as bald as an egg but much harder to crack.\n\n29. Thor: The Dark World (2013)\n\nKenneth Branagh’s Thor took some beating, which Alan Taylor’s film fails to do. But it has its moments, including an enjoyable cameo from Chris O’Dowd, whose character goes on a blind date with scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) blissfully unaware that her former squeeze was the God of Thunder. \n\nThere’s also an amusing scene on the London Underground. But even in menacing facial prosthetics Christopher Eccleston as Malekith is a curiously bland baddie. It’s not his fault, he’s just poorly served by the script, which bizarrely locks up a much better baddie, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), for most of the movie. \n\nEccleston has since admitted that he regrets taking the role – ‘a miserable experience’ – and has accused Marvel of making a nonsense of the character by leaving much of his back story on the cutting-room floor.\n\n30. Doctor Strange (2016)\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch plays a levitating, time-bending surgeon trying to thwart the world-domination plans of another bald baddie, a Buddhist known as the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), who runs a Himalayan monastery that is basically Hogwarts for grown-ups. Zenwarts, if you like. \n\nSo the clue is in the title: Doctor Strange is jolly weird, a kind of a cinematic LSD trip, yet it’s also disappointingly derivative. Instead of invisibility cloaks, we find ‘cloaks of levitation’. Surely they could have tried a bit harder to put more distance between Marvel and Harry Potter? \n\nBut I did laugh a lot when, on Dr Strange’s arrival, the Ancient One’s acolyte, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, offers him a scrap of parchment bearing a single word: ‘Shamballa’. The doctor asks if it’s his mantra? ‘No it’s the wifi password,’ comes the reply. ‘We’re not savages.’\n\n31. The Marvels (2023)\n\nThe only real marvel about this movie is its running-time of well under two hours. That’s because its theme of girl power combined with its manageable length make it practically precision-tooled to appeal to teenyboppers. All those kids who rushed to see Barbie without knowing it was grown-up satire got a much bigger kick a few months later from The Marvels. \n\nBut this notional sequel to Captain Marvel has a decidedly perfunctory plot in which New Jersey schoolgirl Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), as the super-powered Ms Marvel, is whisked off to outer space to fight militant Kree warriors. \n\nEven Samuel L Jackson’s Nick Fury seems bored by all this, understandably finding little enthusiasm for lines such as ‘It seems the surge has had some residual effect on the jump point.’ I’m pretty sure the AA man said exactly that last time my car broke down, but in a Marvel context it hardly even pretends not to be nonsense.\n\n32. Eternals (2021) \n\nWas there ever a writer-director who made two such different successive films as Chloe Zhao, first with 2020’s heart-rending and awards-festooned Nomadland, a study in socio-realism starring Frances McDormand as a middle-aged woman on her uppers, who roams the United States in her van while looking for work …and then with Eternals, about a band of immortal humanoids stationed on Earth with the task of protecting humanity from a bunch of angry lizard-like monsters called Deviants? I can’t think of one.\n\nAnyway, all credit to Zhao for her versatility (and I’m very much looking forward to seeing her next film, the period drama Hamnet) but unfortunately Eternals, starring Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden, is a bit of a dud.\n\n33. Captain America: Brave New World (2025)\n\nHarrison Ford plays US President Thaddeus Ross, a wildly unpredictable occupant of the Oval Office (where they got that idea from I cannot imagine) whose mind is being controlled by a dangerous megalomaniac as he plots to establish American dominion over a newly-discovered treasure called Adamantium – not essence of Adam Ant, alas, but the world’s most versatile element. \n\nThe only person who can navigate a way out of this brewing disaster is Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), the new Captain America now that Steve Rogers has retired. Regrettably, it’s dispiritingly formulaic fare, full of the kind of crashingly expository dialogue that quickly stops you caring whether the President’s inner circle is compromised, or not.\n\n34. Thor: Love and Thunder (2022)\n\nHeaven (and Valhalla) knows I’ve sat through enough superhero films down the years that take themselves at least as earnestly as Newsnight. So I’m generally inclined to applaud those that don’t. But sometimes they over-reach. \n\nDirector and co-writer Taika Waititi got the zaniness levels about right in Thor: Ragnarok but this film positively gurns in pursuit of laughs, although I will always retain some affection for Russell Crowe’s performance as Zeus, playing the King of the Gods as a kind of prissy, slightly camp Greek-Cypriot hairdresser. \n\nChristian Bale plays a Voldemort-style villain, who, Pied Piper-like, kidnaps all Asgard’s children. But the fact that the abducted offspring include Bale’s own actual kids, as well as those of Waititi, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, tells you all you need to know about a movie that too often feels like one huge in-joke.\n\n35. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)\n\nMarvel Fatigue is one of the great niggling oxymorons of our time. The blockbusters churned out by the MCU are meant to propel us to the edge of those seats, exhilarated; not make us slump in them, defeated. \n\nAlas, defeated is how I felt watching this one, even though at just a whisker over two hours it is one of the shorter movies in the canon. The comedic one-liners are dreadfully laboured, although the film does contain one wonderfully perceptive line from super-villain, Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who observes that he can never tell one Avenger from another, that they ‘all blur the senses after a while’. \n\nIn this film I know just where he’s coming from. The action is pretty much all set in the microscopic universe known as the Quantum Realm, and gets very silly – but, sadly, silly in a boring way, not in an engaging way.\n\n36. The Incredible Hulk (2008)\n\nThere are Marvel fans out there who routinely stick up for The Incredible Hulk, and are prepared to argue until they’re green in the face that Edward Norton was a better Bruce Banner (the reserved physicist who turns into the Hulk) than his later replacement Mark Ruffalo. But they’re wrong! \n\nThe second MCU movie is a misfire in so many ways, and never came close either artistically or commercially to matching the year’s earlier release, Iron Man (which made more than twice as much at the box-office). Executives had assumed before production began that The Incredible Hulk (already made famous by the 1970s TV show) would be the springboard for Marvel’s future success, not Iron Man, but they couldn’t have been more wrong. \n\nOff-screen, Norton was difficult. On-screen, the script was feeble, the narrative ponderous and the CGI lousy. Where it should be muscular, it’s all flab, making it the worst MCU film by miles.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThis summer, &#8220;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&#8221; will mark the beginning of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Ultimate List: Ranking All 36 Marvel Superhero Movies first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/the-ultimate-list-ranking-all-36-marvel-superhero-movies/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-definitive-ranking-of-all-36-Marvel-superhero-films.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 00:41:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.415},{"id":332874860,"title":"Trump faces uproar from MAGA base over possible Iran strike","text":"WASHINGTON - The prospect of a U.S. strike against Iran has exposed divisions in the coalition of supporters that brought President Donald Trump to power, with some of his base urging him not to get the country involved in a new Middle East war.Some of Trump's most prominent Republican allies, including top lieutenant Steve Bannon, have found themselves in the unusual position of being at odds with a president who largely shares their isolationist tendencies.Bannon, one of many influential voices from Trump's 'America First' coalition, on Wednesday urged caution about the U.S. military joining Israel in trying to destroy Iran's nuclear program in the absence of a diplomatic deal.","summary":"Some of Trump's biggest Republican allies are in the unusual position of being at odds with a president who largely shares their isolationist tendencies.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/06/19/world/politics/trump-maga-base-iran-strike/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/06/19/476181.JPG?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 00:40:00","author":"Jeff Mason,Steve Holland,Web Master","authors":["Jeff Mason","Steve Holland","Web Master"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":332876424,"title":"THE ECONOMIST: Inside the spy dossier that led Israel to war","text":"When Israel launched its war on Iran on June 13 it did so on the basis of intelligence that it claimed showed Iran had reached a “point of no return” in its quest for a nuclear weapon.\n\nThat evidence galvanised Israel’s own security establishment to support an attack now. It has been shown to America and other Western partners, presumably playing an important role in their ongoing decision-making over whether to support or even join the war.\n\nThe Economist has not seen the material directly, but has gained exclusive insights from an authoritative source, giving a view of Israel’s dossiers, as shared with its allies, and the claims they make over enriched uranium and the speeding-up of Iran’s programme. Some of the details are already known; some are new.\n\nThese claims are proving contentious, with the intelligence services of some Western countries cautious about the imminence of the Iranian threat, and signs of divisions within President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nOur report provides context on these disputes.\n\nWe understand that the information presented by Israel includes a detailed account of a recent, more urgent, push by Iranian scientists towards “weaponisation”, or the creation of an explosive nuclear device.\n\nThe dossier provides two key pieces of reported evidence for this claim. The first is that an Iranian scientific team has squirrelled away a quantity of nuclear material, of unclear enrichment status, that is unknown to the monitors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN watchdog (on June 9th the IAEA assessed Iran had official stockpiles of over 400kg of highly enriched uranium).\n\nThe second piece of reported evidence is that the scientists have accelerated their work and were about to meet commanders of Iran’s missile corps, apparently to prepare for the future “mating” of a nuclear warhead with a missile.\n\nMuch of Iran’s previous dabbling with research and activity related to nuclear weapons was in the public domain already. The IAEA has published several reports documenting this, drawn in part from intelligence supplied by Israel and other countries.\n\nIn 2018 a team at Harvard University also published their own analysis of Iranian documents purloined by Israel.\n\nTaken together, these sources described a broad and sustained Iranian effort towards making a uranium core for a bomb, the explosives required to implode that core in order to cause a chain reaction and a programme to place a spherical payload onto Iran’s Shahab-3 ballistic missile.\n\nIn a report published on May 31st, the IAEA noted that in 2003 Iran had planned to conduct what the Institute for Science and International Security, a think-tank, calls a “cold test”—a simulated nuclear weapon which uses natural or depleted uranium rather than weapons-grade uranium.\n\nIsrael’s intelligence assessments repeat some of this information. They allege that a cohort of Iranian scientists have been working on overt and covert weapons-related research for years. This effort was originally part of Iran’s formal nuclear-weapons research programme, known as AMAD, that it shut down in 2003, probably because it feared an American attack.\n\nThe scientists’ ongoing work is thought to be carried out under Iran’s Organisation of Defensive Innovation and Research (also known by its Farsi acronym, SPND), under the cover of activity in fields like covid-19 vaccines and laser technology.\n\nOne of a small number of non-scientists who were aware of the work was Major-General Mohammad Bagheri, who as chief of staff of Iran’s military had oversight of both the regular armed forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).\n\nBut the Israeli intelligence dossiers also contain information that, if correct, is genuinely new. They suggest that roughly six years ago the scientists formed a secret “Special Progress Group”, under the auspices of the former AMAD director, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.\n\nThis group’s aim was to prepare the way for a much quicker weaponisation process, if and when a decision was made by Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, to rush for a bomb. Mr Fakhrizadeh was assassinated by Israel in November 2020.\n\nOn June 13th in the first hours of the war, the Israeli government published slides describing this backstory. But we have been told that it also shared further assessments with allies that suggest the Special Progress Group stepped up its research at the end of last year. Iran had a new incentive to advance to a bomb.\n\nIt was reeling from the limited impact of its missile attacks on Israel, and the depletion of its air defences by Israeli strikes in October 2024. And it was facing the collapse of its proxies, Hamas and Hizbullah, in Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nLastly, Israel’s intelligence states that a meeting had been scheduled between the scientists and commanders of the IRGC’s air force, who are in charge of ballistic missiles.\n\nThe information shared by Israel with its allies argues this proposed meeting was a Rubicon, with the missile chiefs being let in on the secret for the first time, suggesting in turn that planning for the “mating” process of a nuclear device to a missile warhead was about to begin.\n\nIran had done some of this work in the past—in 2011 the IAEA cited claims that Iran had done computer modelling studies to see how a “spherical payload”, such as a warhead, would stand up to the stresses of being launched on a ballistic missile.\n\nMiniaturising and mating a warhead to a missile are highly complex tasks that could still take Iran a substantial time to master.\n\nIsrael’s new claims are feeding into an American intelligence community that already has a range of views on the Iranian threat. In March Tulsi Gabbard, America’s director of national intelligence—and a longstanding opponent of war with Iran—repeated the view that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn recent days the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and CNN have reported that American intelligence agencies are sceptical of the new Israeli claims.\n\nOn June 17th Rafael Grossi, the director-general of the IAEA, said that his agency had not been presented with “proof of a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon”, although a week before the IAEA confirmed that Iran “did not declare nuclear material and nuclear-related activities” at three undeclared locations in Iran.\n\nMr Trump may nonetheless have been influenced by the Israeli view. On June 17th he declared, “I don’t care what she said,” referring to Ms Gabbard. “I think they were very close to having one (a bomb).”\n\nDavid Albright, an American nuclear physicist and weapons expert who is consulted by intelligence agencies, says that most of the claims contained in the recent Israeli dossiers are “generally accepted among (Western) intelligence communities”.\n\nHowever he accepts that there are claims that are new to him, over the diversion of nuclear material and the suggestion of an imminent meeting with missile forces.\n\nAnd he says that American intelligence analysts also agree that Iran has accelerated preparations for weaponisation—in July last year the director of national intelligence omitted the traditional wording that Iran “isn’t currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons development activities necessary to produce a testable nuclear device” in a report to Congress, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAssuming Israel’s dossiers are factually accurate, there is still room for what Mr Albright calls the “the interpretation of the facts”. Even if American analysts accept that Iran has the intent to pursue a bomb and has accelerated its push, they may disagree that it has crossed a threshold or that the threat is truly imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israelis, he says, “may think it’s a bit faster and worry about their own ability to detect and act in time”. Israeli officials used to present their assessments of Iran’s nuclear push using timelines measured in months and years.\n\nSince the war began, they have talked of the “point of no return”—a moment at which Israel would no longer be capable of halting an Iranian dash to a bomb. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s Prime Minister, has spent decades warning of the threat from Iran.\n\nThat means confirmation bias is a risk. But the stance of Israel’s intelligence community is unified and consistent with the government’s view.\n\nPerhaps it has been put under political pressure, but it has clashed with Mr Netanyahu and other prime ministers on the nuclear file in the past. Now it backs the war.\n\nNuclear physics is a science. Intelligence assessment is not, but has enormous real-world consequences. In 2003 America and its allies went to war in Iraq based on faulty assessments of its alleged weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn the opening strike of the war on June 13th, Israel assassinated key scientists and officials. Nuclear facilities have been bombed. The Israelis claim they have removed the imminent danger of Iran dashing towards weaponisation.\n\nStill, setting Iran’s nuclear programme back by years also depends on destroying, or at least inflicting significant damage, on Iran’s main underground uranium-enrichment plants in Natanz, and in Fordow, which has not yet been hit.\n\nMr Trump may decide this is a job for America, whatever his spooks say.","summary":"THE ECONOMIST: When Israel launched its war on Iran, it did so on the basis of intelligence that it claimed showed Iran had reached a ‘point of no return’ in its quest for a nuclear weapon.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/the-economist-inside-the-spy-dossier-that-led-israel-to-war-c-19082973","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19082973/4612865a99ae62d64e91e3c4b72a28834615b0d8-16x9-x0y125w2628h1478.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 00:36:40","author":"The Economistth","authors":["The Economistth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":332873902,"title":"World News | PM Modi Emplanes for India After Concluding His Three-nation Tour","text":"Zagreb [Croatia], June 19 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday concluded his visit to Croatia, marking a significant milestone in the bilateral relations between the two countries.

They’re here in Pontezuela,” he said in Spanish, mentioning ICE working on the Avenida Pontezuela in Carolina, a city east of Puerto Rico’s capital, San Juan.\n\n“Sons of b——, instead of leaving the people alone and working there,” he added.\n\nICE has ramped up operations in the U.S. territory since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. \n\nSpanish newspaper El País reported on June 1 that 445 people have been detained on the island since Jan. 26.\n\n“The vast majority are men, and nearly 72% of those detained are Dominican citizens, followed by Haitians, Venezuelans and Mexicans,” the outlet stated. \n\nThe report described the city as being “under siege” thanks to the federal government’s raids.\n\nPuerto Rico’s governor, Jenniffer González-Colón – a Republican who supported Trump in the 2024 election – has stated that she will not get in the way of ICE operations, even those done in churches and hospitals. \n\nGonzález-Colón stated that she “cannot afford” to risk losing federal funds by interrupting deportations operations. \n\nThe subject of illegal immigration enforcement has reached a fever pitch in the United States in recent weeks. Protests against Trump’s immigration crackdown turned violent in Los Angeles last week, with the president calling in the National Guard and several hundred U.S. Marines to quell the chaos.\n\nThe artist, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is the latest to join the growing chorus of celebrities decrying Trump’s immigration agenda. \n\nKim Kardashian, whose sister Kendall Jenner dated Bad Bunny in 2023, made waves on social media earlier this month by denouncing the Los Angeles ICE raids as “inhumane.”\n\n“When we’re told that ICE exists to keep our country safe and remove violent criminals — great. But when we witness innocent, hardworking people being ripped from their families in inhumane ways, we have to speak up. We have to do what’s right,” she wrote in an Instagram story. \n\n“Scream” actress Jenna Ortega similarly encouraged her 37.2 million Instagram followers to “be angry” over ICE operations in an Instagram story last weekend. \n\n“The world is crying all over. People in Los Angeles are being torn away from their everyday lives & love… The ones they’ve built so tirelessly over the years, just like you… Innocent civilians in Iran are caught in the middle of warfare. Palestinian cries are still being buried in every day [sic] media. My thoughts are heavy, my heart follows.”\n\nShe added, “Listen to one another & love, but be angry too. Educate yourself as best you can. To say this doesn’t concern you, or that it isn’t your problem, is a privilege under abuse.”","summary":"Latin music mega-star Bad Bunny expressed outrage while witnessing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Puerto Rico on Tuesday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/media/bad-bunny-rips-ice-agents-as-sons-of-bitches-after-filming-operations-in-puerto-rico/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/106739069.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LEdX4kLZ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-19 00:34:56","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":332874850,"title":"Anthony Albanese photo gets the world talking","text":"Anthony Albanese photo gets the world talking\n\nREAD MORE: How Donald Trump has ghosted Anthony Albanese AGAIN\n\nBy MAX AITCHISON, POLITICAL REPORTER FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 01:33 BST, 19 June 2025 | Updated: 01:40 BST, 19 June 2025\n\nDespite being ghosted by Donald Trump twice in as many days, Anthony Albanese stood shoulder to shoulder with other world leaders at this week's G7 summit in Canada.\n\nOr, rather, he stood a good head and shoulders above some of them if this incredible photograph is anything to go by. \n\nDuring a group picture of the gathered leaders in the mountaintop town of Kananaskis on Wednesday, Albanese towered over his peers.\n\nHe appeared to literally look down upon Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nThe remarkable image immediately sparked conversation online, with some Aussies left suitably impressed with their Prime Minister's stature. \n\n'I hadn't noticed how tall Albo is,' one marvelled.\n\nAnother added: 'Same!'\n\n'I think I’ve always assumed (also as an Australian) he was around average height, but he looks tall as in that photo,' they added.\n\nDuring a group photograph of the gathered leaders in the mountaintop Canadian town of Kananaskis on Wednesday, Anthony Albanese towered over his peers (pictured)\n\nHowever, the Labor leader stands at a relatively modest 5ft 10in (177.8cm) - an inch above the average height for an Australian man (pictured: Albanese standing beside his vanquished rival who is three inches taller)\n\nDonald Trump infamously likes to be at the centre of any photo opportunity and would have no doubt relished his ability to stand over all of his peers\n\nOne suggested that 'we breed big things Down Under', while another cracked a gag about the often dog-eat-dog world of global politics. \n\n'Why doesn't Anthony Albanese, the largest prime minister, simply eat the other prime ministers?', they said.\n\nHowever, the Labor leader stands at a relatively modest 5ft 10in (177.8cm) - an inch above the average height for an Australian man. \n\nHis former rival for the country's top job, Peter Dutton, towered over Albanese at 6ft 1in (185cm).\n\nMacron, who has a penchant for cuban-heeled boots, is slightly shorter at 5ft 8in (173cm), while Zelensky is 5ft 7in (170cm) and Meloni is a pint-sized 5ft 3in (163cm) tall.\n\nLast year, a journalist was ordered to pay €5,000 ($8,820) in damages to the Italian Prime Minister for mocking her height, which a court deemed to be 'body shaming'.\n\nIt is perhaps just as well that Trump flew back to Washington early to deal with the Iran-Israel crisis - therefore scuppering Albanese's chance to secure a face-to-face meeting with him - because the US President stands at a colossal 6ft 3in (190cm).\n\nThe US Commander-in-Chief infamously likes to be at the centre of any photo opportunity and would have no doubt relished his ability to stand over all of his peers.\n\nWhether standing or sitting, Trump is no stranger to a good photo opportunity, as this iconic image from the 2018 G7 illustrates\n\nHowever, he would be put in his place by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz who stands at a towering 6ft 6in (198cm). \n\nAnd, of course, Trump is not even the tallest person in his own family.\n\nHis son Barron, who is currently studying at New York University's Stern School of Business, is a giant 6ft 7in (201cm). \n\nAlbanese's plan to meet Trump on the last day of the G7 summit was scotched when the US Commander-in-Chief left the event early due to the escalating situation in the Middle East.\n\nAlbanese was asked if Trump had rang him since the cancellation - a gesture he has afforded other world leaders - at a press conference on Wednesday morning. \n\n'No, he hasn't. But I spoke with key advisors to the President,' Albanese responded.\n\n'The President has been engaged... with the circumstances around Iran and Israel. It's perfectly understandable the decision that he made. \n\n'That meant that the meetings that were scheduled - not just with myself, but with India, Ukraine, including President Zelensky, Mexico and other countries, didn't go ahead today. \n\n'But we're all mature about that. We understand the circumstances.'\n\nHowever, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had a 'very good' phone call with Trump after their meeting was also cancelled. \n\nAnthony AlbaneseAustralia PoliticsG7\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAnthony Albanese photo gets the world talking\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The remarkable image immediately sparked conversation online, with some Aussies left suitably impressed with their Prime Minister.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14826789/Anthony-Albanese-phot-world-leaders-G7.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/19/00/99513921-0-image-a-8_1750289526312.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/17/4680174936238475064/1024x576_MP4_4680174936238475064.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-19 00:33:52","author":"Editor,Max Aitchison","authors":["Editor","Max Aitchison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.215},{"id":332873874,"title":"India News | Resident Commissioner to Support Keralites Returning in Wake of Israel-Iran War: CM Pinarayi Vijayan","text":"Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala) [India], June 19 (ANI): Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday instructed the Resident Commissioner in Delhi to provide necessary facilities to Keralites returning from Iran and Israel amid the escalating conflict between the two countries.\n\"The Kerala government has arranged for accommodation at Kerala House in Delhi for those arriving from the conflict zone and will facilitate their return to Kerala as soon as flights become available,\" said Vijayan.\nAlso Read | 'PM Narendra Modi Fantastic Man, Trade Deal Coming' Says US President Donald Trump After Phone Call With Indian Prime Minister Modi.\nHe added that the situation in Iran and Israel continues to be worrisome.

Born in a small village in Ramechhap, Udit has been living with hearing and speech impairments, yet he has never let his disability hold him back.\nIt's been about three years since Udit has been working as the trainer in this local gym in Kathmandu, some 150 kilometres away from the capital Kathmandu. Udit's journey shows that disabilities do not have to be obstacles to professional achievement or personal fulfillment.\nAlso Read | 'PM Narendra Modi Fantastic Man, Trade Deal Coming' Says US President Donald Trump After Phone Call With Indian Prime Minister Modi.\n\"Hello. My name is Udit Shrestha. I am 31. I have been working as a gym instructor here at Sankhamul Health Club for three years. It's been 8 years since I have been engaged in the gym,\" he communicated using sign language.\nUdit faced significant hurdles growing up in a society where people with disabilities are often misunderstood and discriminated against. Despite these challenges, he found solace in sports, particularly volleyball, which helped him prove his abilities.\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Expresses Gratitude to Croatia for Backing India's Fight Against Terrorism After Talks With Counterpart Andrej Plenkovic in Zagreb.\nAs the eldest male member of the family, Udit made his way to Kathmandu four years after the political change following the People's Movement II. Udit worked as a cook in Kathmandu before discovering his passion for fitness. He joined a local gym, Sankhamul Health Club, where he was eventually spotted by the coach, Sanam Duwal.\nWith Duwal's guidance, Udit honed his skills and developed a unique approach to training, focusing on non-verbal cues and sign language.\n\"He had joined this gym as a member about 6 years back. During that time, while he was here as a member, he actively assisted others in their training and exercises. I constantly observed him, the way he taught others, how easily he explained things to others, and that too in sign language. I really got intrigued with his efforts to teach others and help others. After observing for a long time, I then had a talk with him in my office, inquiring about the work he is doing. I asked him about his interest to teach others, then he signaled up righting both his thumbs, and cheerfulness in his face. While saying so, I was having second thought on my mind whether he will be able to cope up or not as it requires verbal communication. It was somewhat hard for me as well in the beginning phase,\" Sanam Duwal, the coach of Udit as well as the owner of the Sankhamul Health Club where he currently works told ANI.\nWhile most of the members of the gym work out to reduce weight, gain muscles and maintain fitness, Udit has explored it as a means to express and raise the benchmark. From using bamboo, stones and ropes as moveable gym equipment back in home he brewed creative ideas of making pull-up bars from tree branches, lifted rocks and dumbbells and used sacks filled with sand and other items as weights. The precise care for each movement made it all possible for him to work in the modern gym setup where he spends most of his daily hours.\nHis work in the gym includes to ensure everyone does the exercise with precision and correct manner. In order to teach the newly members of the gym, he demonstrate them first and then observe their way of doing and explain them through sign language about filed of improvement.\nAs per the experience of his coach Sanam Duwal, the beginning days were somewhat hard in comparison to the present. Alike gym, Udit worked alongside in his communication skills which now fascinates everyone.\n\"We worked on our communication skills, using both the sign language, exchanging notes about what we are trying to communicate. It took quite diaries to filled up to come to a common ground where we could understand each other and it has been about three years that he has joined here as the trainer,\" Sanam shared.\nUnlike traditional trainers, relying only on verbal cues, Udit have a distinct approach- \"fully engage, pay close attention to movements and gestures.\" Members of the gym also pay follow his approach which has made it easier for him as well.\ndit's clients praise his ability to communicate effectively through sign language and lip-reading. Avinash Chaudhary, a gym member, says he has no issues communicating with Udit.\n\"I don't have any problem while communicating with him in due course of my training. His sign language is easily understandable and if there are any such situations then we exchange messages in between which resolves the queries. I haven't experienced any such problems while communicating,\" Avinash Chaudhary, one of the member of the gym under instructions of Udit told ANI.\nThe experience of discrimination and disdain due to his impairments serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by individuals who are often misunderstood by society. Udit's success serves as a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity. His determination and resilience have enabled him to achieve his goals and inspire others.\nBeing able to establish the purpose in his life, Udit said that current professional engagement proves the meaning of his life and break the barrier.\n\"Before, I used to work in a restaurant, making Momo and Chowmein. I didn't earn much. I joined the gym since 8 years and the coach saw me and gave me the training and made me the trainer after seeing me work here. He assured me the future and I started working here. In comparison to my previous work, I find this better. I used to do gym before but now am able to instruct to the people. He invited me to become the trainer and I am working here and am really thankful to him. I enjoy this work more than any previous profession. The earning is also better than that of before,\" Udit said.\nUdit's story highlights the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in sports and fitness. His approach demonstrates that with the right support and accommodations, people with disabilities can excel in various fields.\nUdit's story is a powerful testament to the indomitable human spirit, demonstrating that obstacles, no matter how daunting, do not define a person's potential. His journey is one of relentless perseverance, where every challenge he faced only fueled his determination to overcome it. His transformation from a struggling child in a remote village to a respected gym trainer is nothing short of inspirational. Growing up in an environment where opportunities were limited, Udit faced significant hurdles from an early age. His journey was not paved with privilege, but rather with hardship, struggle, and determination.

The Miami-based center warned Erick has maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 kph) after hours of rapid intensification, strengthening from a Category 1 storm earlier in the day. Also Read | 'PM Narendra Modi Fantastic Man, Trade Deal Coming' Says US President Donald Trump After Phone Call With Indian Prime Minister Modi. The cyclone is in the eastern Pacific about 55 miles (90 kilometers) south-southwest of Puerto Angel in Mexico. It's also about 160 miles (260 kilometers) southeast of Punta Maldonado and moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph), the latest hurricane center advisory said. Also Read | PM Narendra Expresses Gratitude to Croatia for Backing India's Fight Against Terrorism After Talks With Counterpart Andrej Plenkovic in Zagreb. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. Hurricane Erick rapidly strengthened Wednesday afternoon into a potent Category 2 storm as it churned toward Mexico's southern coast amid warnings it was likely to become a dangerous major hurricane that would threaten the region with damaging winds, life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. The hurricane's maximum sustained winds had risen by early afternoon to 110 mph (175 kph) as the intensifying storm headed toward an expected landfall sometime Thursday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Erick was centered about 85 miles (135 kilometers) south of Puerto Ángel, the latest advisory said. The storm's projected path would take its center near the resort of Acapulco, which was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and 32 were missing, after the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort's hotels. In Acapulco Wednesday, there was a strong presence of National Guard and police in the streets, but most visible were trucks from the national power company. Crews worked to clear drainage canals and brush. Some beaches were already closed, but tourists continued to sunbathe on others. On a beach in Acapulco, a line of people waited for the help of a backhoe to pull their boats out of the water. Adrián Acevedo Durantes, 52, hauls tourists around Acapulco's picturesque coastline in boats. Two of his boats sank in Hurricane Otis and a third was badly damaged. “We're taking precautions because with Otis we never expected one of that magnitude to come and now with climate change the water is warmer and the hurricanes are more powerful,” Acevedo said. This time the port administration ordered that no one ride out the storm aboard their boats. During Otis many lost their lives by staying on boats in the harbor, which had traditionally been how they ensured their safety during previous storms. He said knew some of those lost at sea. He acknowledged that it was sunny and the water calm Wednesday afternoon, making it hard to imagine a major storm was on the way, but said “with Otis it was calm all day, sunny, then at midnight there were two hours of strong winds and we saw what had happened the next day.” Francisco Casarubio, a 46-year-old choreographer, carried a carton of eggs as he did some last-minute shopping ahead of the storm. He planned to pick up rice, beans and some canned food as well. His home flooded and lost power in Otis and said he was taking Erick more seriously, but hadn't had time to shop until Wednesday. Forecasters said Erick was expected to lash Mexico's Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rains of up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the center's advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain. Erick was forecast to reach major hurricane strength late Wednesday near the coast and is then expected to move inland. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of at least 111 mph (180 kph).

I already knew in my heart that what I did was right but this triple confirms it for me. \n\n'The death threats are one things but that's just the internet. I'm taking that as that is going to come from something like this. Anything that involves politics is going to involve a death threat.\n\n'The main thing I have been seeing is that it was \"disrespectful\". I don't think it was because the lyrics are the exact same as the English version. \n\n'I am a proud American. I was born here, raised her, my dreams came true here in LA and I think being a proud American and still wanting better for your country can be the same truth and I think people are forgetting that.'\n\nAfter Nezza posted a clip on TikTok which showed a Dodgers official telling her to sing the anthem in English, before she stunningly defied that request, a large portion of the team's fans heaped praise on her.\n\nOne replied to her latest TikTok video by saying: '50 year dodgers fan & proud of you, no more games til they make this right.'\n\n'As a la native and a dodgers fan, I'm disappointed in them,' said another. 'I'm so glad you SANNNG it in Spanish even though they told you not too! You got a new follower queen'.\n\n'God damn. Dodgers have botched the last week pretty badly,' another fan posted on X about the anthem controversy.\n\nWhile one said about Nezza: 'Good for her. The @dodgers are being hypocritical. They’ll have Mexico Night, hire Mariachis to play at the games, & have surely cashed in on billions of $ of revenue from a loyal Latino fan-base, much of it undocumented. Maybe when/if they get hit in the pocketbook….'\n\nThe 30-year-old opened up on the 'insane' reaction to her protest in a new TikTok video\n\nThe Dodgers visited Donald Trump at the White House back in April as World Series winners\n\nHowever, other members of the Dodgers faithful were less impressed by her protest after being invited by the team to sing in English.\n\n'Total lack of respect by @Nezza,' one concluded. 'She's invited by @Dodgers to sing in English. But makes decision to sing in Spanish. This is why people don't take WOKE/DEI/serious. People should boycott her music'.\n\nAnother commented: 'If the @Dodgers invite Nezza back to Dodger Stadium for another reimagining of our Star Spangled Banner I know I won't be the only one who stays away. Spoke to many friends (Latino included) and it doesn't sit right with any of us. She can serenade Dominican Rep crowds instead.'\n\nWhile one even claimed: 'After Nezza singing [in Spanish] and not being banned forever, I will never attend another Dodger game'.\n\nIn a tearful follow-up video to her original TikTok post, Hernandez suggested she has been banned from Dodger Stadium after ignoring the request to perform in English.\n\n'Thank you for all the sweet messages,' she concluded at the end of the video before adding, 'I love you guys so much. Safe to say I am never allowed in that stadium again.' \n\nYet according to The LA Times, she was not punished for ignoring the team request and is not banned from Dodger Stadium in the future.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nNational anthem singer reveals true extent of fury at her incendiary ICE protest before Dodgers game\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The 30-year-old, known by her stage name Nezza, defied orders from the Dodgers to sing a Spanish rendition of the American national anthem before Saturday's game against the San Francisco Giants .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mlb/article-14826917/nezza-ice-protest-dodgers-national-anthem-protest.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/19/01/99397883-0-image-m-16_1750291564886.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/15/3972299165897803940/1024x576_MP4_3972299165897803940.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-19 00:10:11","author":"Editor,Max Winters","authors":["Editor","Max Winters"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.011},{"id":332870166,"title":"President Donald Trump hints at possibly withholding wildfire aid to California","text":"President Donald Trump on Wednesday, June 18, hinted at the possibility that his latest feud with Gov. Gavin Newsom over mass federal immigration raids – and the use of military troops to protect federal buildings and agents as they carry out those enforcement actions – could impact additional wildfire aid to California.\n\nAsked by a reporter if his latest “dust-ups” with Newsom could impact relief aid to help California recover from the devastating January wildfires, Trump said, “Yeah, maybe.”\n\n“Hatred is never a good thing in politics,” Trump went on to say. “When you don’t like somebody, you don’t respect somebody, it’s harder for that person to get money if you’re on top.”\n\nNewsom responded shortly after, posting on his X social media account that “sucking up to the president should not be a requirement for him to do the right thing for the American people.”\n\n“Only a truly disturbed person would threaten to withhold aid from victims because they don’t like someone,” Newsom added.\n\nIn February, the governor requested nearly $40 billion in additional aid from the federal government in response to the Southern California wildfires.\n\nAsked about the status of California’s request, a White House spokesperson last week referred to a recent Trump Oval Office address, where the president said his administration will be “phasing out” the Federal Emergency Management Agency after hurricane season ends in November. Trump said he wants states to “wean off of FEMA” and wants disaster relief efforts to be more state-led.\n\nAt the same time, Trump recently approved disaster declarations for other states, including Missouri, a state with a Republican supermajority that was hit with devastating tornadoes, storms and flooding in April and May.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has considered withholding aid to California because of the state’s politics. He reportedly weighed doing the same in 2018, after California suffered another brutal wildfire season, but changed his mind after being shown voter registration data from Orange County where more voters were registered Republican than Democrat.\n\nFast forward to 2025.\n\nWhether the latest standoff between Trump and Newsom over the president’s immigration policies will indeed impact wildfire aid to California remains to be seen.\n\nThere appeared to be a cooling-off period between the two during the January wildfires, with Newsom greeting Trump on the tarmac when the president arrived in Southern California to tour the Palisades area and Trump temporarily refraining from referring to the governor as “Newscum,” a moniker he has resumed using as of late.\n\nBut when the Trump administration ramped up federal immigration raids in the L.A. area on June 6, and later responded to protests by deploying thousands of National Guard troops to the area over the objections of Newsom, the state of California sued. Typically, the governor has control over their state’s National Guard troops, and it’s rare for a president to deploy National Guard members without the request or consent of a governor.\n\nA federal judge last week determined that Trump’s federalization of the National Guard was illegal. But the Trump administration immediately challenged the ruling.\n\nThree other judges on an appeals panel heard the case Tuesday but has yet to render a decision.","summary":"The president's latest tiff with Gov.

Wong replied. \n\n'The president left the G7 because of the war in the Middle East. \n\nPenny Wong said Trump had not been able to meet Anthony Albanese because of the conflict in the Middle East\n\nIn a strident interview on Sunrise, Nat Barr questioned Wong about the snubbing\n\n'Now, I know we all want to think it's about us, but he left the G7 because of the war in the Middle East and he was unable as a consequence, not only to not have a bilateral meeting with the prime minister, but with (Indian) Prime Minister Modi, (and) with the president of South Korea.' \n\nWong added that the 'world is an unstable place at the moment' and 'we've got a war in the Middle East and we have a war in Europe'.\n\nBut Barr was not satisfied with Wong's answer. \n\n'We have now, but there have been calls for many months,' Barr said.\n\n'Trump was in in November and many of the leaders lined up and went to the White House earlier in the year, you were at the inauguration yourself in January, and there were calls for our prime minister to go and meet him much earlier than this.'\n\nWong then repeated the line, also used by Albanese this week, that the prime minister has had three 'very constructive calls with the president'. \n\n'But no meeting,' Barr said. \n\n'A meeting was scheduled, (and) wasn't able to happen because of the Middle East conflict,' Wong replied.\n\nThe snub was a crucial blow for Albanese as he tries to shore up the AUKUS submarine deal, now under review by the US\n\nAnthony Albanese embraces Zelensky - as he prepares for his next chance to meet Trump\n\nBarr continued to call out Wong: 'But there were months before that.'\n\nWong then unleashed on Barr. \n\n'Nat, I'm sure that a meeting will be arranged. We look forward to it. But I think the perspective, we need to remember, is what is happening in the world right now.'\n\nAfter Wong snapped back, Barr stopped questioning her about Trump meeting Albanese.\n\nBefore the Trump meeting was cancelled, Albanese told media on Sunday that he was looking forward to 'building on the very constructive phone conversations that we've had on the three occasions that we've had the opportunity to talk'. \n\nThe cancelled meeting was a crucial blow for Albanese as he tries to shore up the AUKUS submarine deal, now under review by the US, and to negotiate an easing of tariffs on Australian goods.\n\nThere was pressure on the prime minister to negotiate an exemption from the tariffs: a 50 per cent levy on Aussie aluminium and steel products sent to the US, and a baseline 10 per cent levy on other goods. \n\nOn Sunrise, Barr also asked Wong for her reaction to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei declaring 'the battle begins' after launching missile strikes on Israel.\n\nTrump had left the summit early due to the Israel-Iran conflict, scotching a planned meeting with Albanese, who has only ever spoken to him on the phone\n\n'The world does certainly face a dangerous moment,' Wong said.\n\n'But our message to Iran, along with so many countries of the world, is it's time to stop any nuclear program and it's time to come to the table. \n\n'We see what is occurring on the ground. We see the risk to civilians in the region. It's time for de-escalation, dialogue and diplomacy and Iran must return to the table and it must stop any production of nuclear weapons.'\n\nWong also played down a question from Barr about what the government's response would be if the US asked for Australia's help in the conflict.\n\n'We're not a central player in the Middle East,' she said. \n\n'Obviously we're a long way from this conflict but it does affect, as you know, regional stability and global stability. It also affects Australians.' \n\nAlbanese might get another chance to meet Trump in person within days.\n\nThe White House confirmed this month that Trump will attend the NATO Summit in the Netherlands next week, though his presence may now be in doubt because of the rapidly changing situation in the Middle East.\n\nAsked on Wednesday if he would also attend, Albanese said: 'I'm considering (it).'\n\nPenny WongCanadaThe NetherlandsIsrael\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nNat Barr calls out Penny Wong live on air as the senator snaps back about Trump question\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Nat Bar has called out Penny Wong live on air.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14826723/Nat-Barr-Penny-Wong-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/19/00/99512911-0-image-m-18_1750287696447.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-19 00:09:27","author":"Editor,Harrison Christian","authors":["Editor","Harrison Christian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":332873888,"title":"World News | PM Modi Receives Special Gift in Zagreb: Vezdin's Sanskrit Grammar, Written in Latin in 1790","text":"Zagreb [Croatia], June 19 (ANI): Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic gifted Prime Minister Narendra Modi a reprint of Vezdin's Sanskrit Grammar, a pioneering work on Indian languages and culture, in a gesture signifying the centuries-old close cultural links between the two countries.\nVezdin's Sanskrit Grammar is the first printed Sanskrit grammar written in Latin in 1790 by Croatian scientist and missionary Filip Vezdin during his time spent in India.\nAlso Read | 'PM Narendra Modi Fantastic Man, Trade Deal Coming' Says US President Donald Trump After Phone Call With Indian Prime Minister Modi.\nIn a post on X, Croatian PM said, \"I presented to the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a reprint of Vezdin's Sanskrit Grammar - the first printed Sanskrit grammar, written in Latin in 1790 by Croatia scientist and missionary Filip Vezdin (1748-1806), based on the knowledge he gained while living in India from Kerala Brahmins and local manuscripts.

Reid told The Daily Signal that Hashmi was out protesting President Donald Trump rather than participating in the recent 250th anniversary of Patrick Henry’s “Give Me Liberty” address and that she was one of five sponsors of the Senate’s version of the proposed constitutional amendment that would enshrine a woman’s ability to abort her baby right up until the moment of birth. \n\nThere is a saying that boxing promoters use: “Matchups Make Fights.” It means that just because someone is an unknown, if he is a stronger boxer where the other is vulnerable, upsets are much more likely.\n\nThis could be bad news for the Democrats because Reid, through his career as a conservative commentator, has always been viewed as fair and open-minded. While his “lifestyle” (he is a gay man) might keep some socially conservative Republicans from voting for him, the less-radical, business-oriented Democrats might support him over Hashmi. \n\n>>> Sign up for our Virginia email newsletter\n\nMeanwhile, the race for the nomination for the Democrat candidate for attorney general to face incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares was equally close, with Del. Jay Jones edging Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor 50.9% to 49.05%. The endorsements of former Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, along with late attack ads highlighting Taylor for having received campaign contributions from Dominion Energy, pushed Jones over the top in an equally light turnout vote.\n\nNow, the formula for the Democrats will have to be getting those turnout numbers up for the general election. Most polling organizations like Christopher Newport University and Roanoke College have been “oversampling” Democrat voters because of the perceived enthusiasm for the “anti-Trump” vote come the general election.\n\nBut the primary turnout doesn’t back that up, and if better jobs numbers continue each month in Virginia and an economy that has been growing each quarter continues to grow, getting those turnout numbers up will be even more difficult.","summary":"131,793.

Though KCR and former Irrigation Minister Harish Rao had cooperated with the government back then, with complete understanding and even offered suggestions. We agreed to accommodate their inputs.

This project, however, got delayed either due to political reasons or lack of compatibility and camaraderie between Chandrababu Naidu and KCR until 2019.\nAccording to the press release, he added that things took a turn after YS Jagan Mohan Reddy became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh for the first time and KCR got a renewed term in Telangana.\nKCR had held four rounds of meetings with Jagan and decided to transfer water to Rayalaseema. Details of the deliberations between the two governments were explained to the media by the then ministers Eatala Rajender and Buggana Rajendranath Reddy at a press conference. KCR had declared at that time: \"We will transform Rayalaseema into Ratnala Seema (Land of Gems.\"\nRevanth Reddy said that Andhra Pradesh was now moving ahead with the project based on discussions that happened between KCR and Chandrababu Naidu in 2016 on the Godavari-Banakacherla issue.\nKCR stated back then, \"There are no basins or solutions.\" AP wasn't pursuing a 200 TMC project--it's for 300 TMC. \"KCR had agreed that Andhra Pradesh could take even up to 400 TMC.\"\nThe Chief Minister said: \"We don't want to join the issue and engage in arguments. So, we appealed to the Union Water Resources Ministry, asserting Telangana would never compromise on its interests and let go of its natural resources. Our government has never shied away from its primary responsibility of protecting the interests of Telangana, come what may.\n\"BRS never worked for Telangana. The interests of the State were never a priority for them. They did not complete a single project in districts like Palamuru. In 10 years, they failed to finish even one pending project,\" Reddy said.\nThe Godavari-Banakacherla Link Scheme is a massive project proposed by the Andhra Pradesh Government at an estimated cost of Rs 80,112 crore. The plan involves diverting 200 TMC of water from the Godavari River at Polavaram to Rayalaseema through the Bollapalli reservoir and Banakacherla head regulator. The proposal seeks to interlink the Godavari, Krishna, and Penna rivers.

(AP pic)SEOUL: North Korea today slammed Israel’s launching of strikes to spark its conflict with Iran, and warned the US and European powers against “fanning up the flames of war”, according to a foreign ministry spokesman.The North expressed “serious concern” over “Israel’s military attack and resolutely denounces it” the spokesman said, adding that Israel’s killing of civilians was “an unpardonable crime against humanity”.“The illegal act of state-sponsored terrorism by Israel (is) raising the danger of a new all-out war in the Middle East region,” said the statement, which was published by state-run news agency KCNA.Israel on Friday launched strikes that it said targeted Iran’s nuclear programme, sparking six days of continuing exchanges that have seen both sides firing salvoes of missiles at each other.Iran said Sunday that Israeli strikes had killed at least 224 people, including military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians.It has not issued an updated toll since then.Since Friday, at least 24 people have been killed in Israel and hundreds wounded, according to the Israeli government.Those casualties also reportedly include civilians.North Korea has in recent years grown closer to Russia, supporting its military operations against Ukraine in Moscow’s grinding war with that country.Russia and Iran in January inked a far-ranging strategic partnership agreement to broaden military ties, and Kyiv and its allies have long accused Iran of supplying Russia with drones and short-range missiles.US President Donald Trump has fuelled speculation about the US joining its key ally Israel in military action against Iran, saying yesterday that his patience had “run out” with Tehran, but that it was still not too late for talks.He later said he had not yet made a decision on whether to join Israel in bombing Iran and warned that the country’s current leadership could fall as a result of the war.Pyongyang warned Trump and others against joining Israel’s war.“The present grave situation witnessed by the world clearly proves that Israel, supported and patronised by the US and the west, is a cancer-like entity for the peace in the Middle East and a chief culprit of destroying global peace and security,” said the foreign ministry spokesman.“The international community is strictly watching the US and western forces fanning up the flames of war, taking issue with the legitimate sovereign right and exercise of the right to self-defence of Iran, the victim,” they added.The spokesman said actions by the US and European powers were “pushing the situation in the Middle East to an uncontrollable catastrophic phase”.","summary":"Pyongyang also warned the US and European powers against fanning the flames of

George V decided on a prime spot in Trafalgar Square, in front of the National Gallery.\n\nBack then, a huge crowd heard the welcome speech by the foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, who embraced Washington as an ancestral Brit – 'one of the greatest Englishmen who ever lived because though he fought us and vanquished us, he was fighting for ideals and principles which were as sacred to us as they were to the American people.'\n\nA century on, a number of concerned Americans, led by Virginian businessman John Gerber, had noticed that Washington was looking rather forlorn. \n\nThe mundane words on his Portland Stone plinth – 'Presented To The People Of Great Britain And Ireland By The Commonwealth Of Virginia 1921' – were barely legible. Passers-by had no idea who he was.\n\nMoved by Curzon's words, the Friends of the Washington Statue set to work and, yesterday, the great man reappeared from beneath a huge velvet drape, complete with new inscriptions around the base: 'Rededicated In Honour Of Enduring Friendship 2025'; 'To Our Common Ideals And Principles'; and 'To Our Common Sacrifices'.\n\nAs for Washington's alleged allergy to British soil, Mr Gerber acknowledged that 'it was probably never said, but it's a good story'. \n\nNonetheless, Governor Youngkin and his wife, Suzanne, had flown in with some unusual luggage – a cannister of fresh Virginian soil to sprinkle around the base.","summary":"A US President received the warmest of welcomes back to a sweltering London yesterday afternoon - with not a single protester to be seen or heard.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14826913/Gleaming-George-Trafalgar-Square-US.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/19/00/99514725-0-image-m-62_1750290131184.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 23:49:06","author":"Editor,Robert Hardman","authors":["Editor","Robert Hardman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.383},{"id":332873342,"title":"'Be careful, our Iranian friends…': Putin backs Tehran after Trump demands ‘unconditional surrender’","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed growing tensions in the Middle East, pushing back against Israeli suggestions of regime change in Tehran.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., joins “The Signal Sitdown” to discuss.\n\n“I think President Trump’s instincts are to try to keep us out of war,” Paul told The Daily Signal. “I think he has these instincts within his belief system of restraint and less intervention.” Nevertheless, Paul warned that there might be “forces within his administration that would like to get us more involved.”\n\nThe United States’ support for Israel in the war that broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, has, as of writing, been limited to assisting Israel defend against drone and missile strikes and providing Israel with intelligence, military aid, and weapons sales. At the same time, the United States was pursuing a new nuclear deal with Iran, and news reports suggested American and Iranian negotiators were getting close.\n\nBut the war entered a new phase when Israel launched Operation Rising Lion on June 13 in what the Israeli government has described as a preemptive attack on Iranian nuclear capabilities. The U.S. government has insisted this action was taken unilaterally by the Israelis but with some knowledge by the U.S. The extent of that knowledge and American policymakers’ feelings toward it remain unclear.\n\nIn the first hours of fighting, however, Israel’s strikes in Operation Rising Lion targeted not only Iran’s nuclear facilities but its nuclear scientists, as well as top military and political officials. “Senior leaders in Iran are already packing their bags,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed in a June 14 video address. “They sense what’s coming.” \n\n“The real question is, ‘How is Iran going to respond to this?’” Paul said. \n\n“This is the difficulty of foreign policy. We can say all the things we want: ‘We don’t want them to have a nuclear weapon,’” Paul explained. Yet he urged that Americans consider “how they will respond to being attacked.”\n\nIran has “been attacked by Israel—significant attack. Their scientists have been killed and their higher echelon of military leaders have been killed. So do you think they’ll come to the negotiating table or leave?” Paul told The Daily Signal. “I would imagine they are humiliated because they’ve been really, utterly decimated. I mean, Israel’s shown incredible military prowess. They’ve killed people at will. They rule the skies. They’ve knocked out a lot of nuclear capacity—probably not all.”\n\n“What happens if negotiations go by the wayside?” Paul asked rhetorically. “I think that’s what we’re facing right now.”\n\nThere are no “easy” and certain answers to that question, Paul suggested. Iran “could say, ‘Well, alright, we hear you … We’re going to submit to your will.’” The other scenario is much more concerning: “Or they might respond by saying, ‘We’re going to commit the final steps to go ahead and have a weapon because the only thing that’ll keep you guys out of our country is to let you know we have a nuclear weapon.’”\n\nThe missile salvos between Tel-Aviv and Tehran continue, and America has repositioned military assets from all over the world—the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was brought in from the Indo-Pacific and aerial fuel tankers have flown over from U.S. bases—gearing up for a potential response.\n\nThose advocating for America’s involvement to denuclearize Iran, however, have not answered other questions. Questions such as how far is the U.S. willing to go to deny the Ayatollah the bomb? Regime change? \n\n“Militarily, I think we can defeat Iran probably in a matter of weeks,” Paul said. “It’s what comes afterwards” that gives him pause.\n\n“The unintended consequences in Afghanistan took 20 years,” he noted. “When we finally left, it reverted back to the stone ages within six months. We wasted a trillion dollars there. And I’m not saying we shouldn’t have gone after our enemies there. We should have, but we should have come home three months later.”\n\n“Just the whole nation-building enterprise in Afghanistan was a huge mistake,” Paul explained. “In Iraq, we take out the main opposition to Iran. So by anybody’s estimate, Iran is more of a problem, regionally, because Saddam Hussein is gone.”\n\nThe question every American policymaker needs to ask themselves right now, Paul said, is, “What are the unintended consequences of this? Do they rush to the bomb?” \n\nPaul’s hope is that the president ”will resist the calls of people wanting to bomb Tehran,” and get everyone back to the negotiating table. “Donald Trump, while I don’t think he’s a libertarian—although he tells me all the time ‘I’m more libertarian than you are,’ I don’t believe that’s probably true, Mr. President—but he does have some libertarian instincts.”\n\n“My hope is still that there’s a route for diplomacy,” Paul told The Daily Signal. Such an agreement, he said, “has to be not just about nuclear weapons, it needs to be about ballistic weapons and … quit committing war and proxy wars throughout the Middle East.”","summary":"At any moment, President Donald Trump could decide to directly involve the United States in yet another war in the Middle East—this time against Iran....

The 63-year-old Virginia resident served as an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1988 to 2021, during which time he became a sharpshooter and served as a FEMA instructor. Judge Ivan Davis on Wednesday said he did not believe, under the conditions he laid out, that Stinson’s release to home detention posed a threat to the community. Stinson, who wore a green prison jumpsuit to the hearing, was seen speaking with his attorneys during the proceeding. FBI DIRECTOR PATEL SAYS MAN WHO THREATENED TRUMP USED SAME MESSAGE AS COMEY'S 'DESTRUCTIVE' INSTAGRAM POST Prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Stinson made multiple threats against Trump on various social media platforms, including X, Reddit and Bluesky. Stinson’s public defender, however, pointed out that Stinson said things like, \"Someone should take the shot…he said I can’t shoot but I can drive. I’d take the shot, but I’m a lousy shot, so it would be a waste.\" Prosecutors countered the argument by saying Stinson lied about his skills, noting that he received expert marksman ribbons while in the service. GEORGIA MAN INDICTED FOR MAKING ALLEGED THREATS AGAINST SENATORS CRUZ, FISCHER IN DISTURBING VOICEMAILS Stinson’s public defender also argued that the statute in question is specific in relation to threatening language, and that political hyperbole is protected speech under the First Amendment. Judge Davis appeared to agree with the public defender as prosecutors were having a tough time meeting the burden of establishing probable cause. He ultimately gave prosecutors until next Wednesday to file additional written briefs on the matter. In an affidavit filed on Friday, a task force officer from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed details about the myriads of online threats that Stinson allegedly made. In one instance, Stinson reportedly wrote that Trump needed to be \"[L]uigied,\" on May 9. The post was a reference to Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year. FORMER COAST GUARD OFFICER ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGEDLY THREATENING TO ASSASSINATE TRUMP: FBI Stinson allegedly made graphic threats against Trump involving guns, poisoning and even knives on multiple social media platforms. Stinson also allegedly referenced \"not having the necessary skills,\" to successfully complete an assassination, but also eerily suggested that he was not being entirely truthful. The document also alleges that Stinson made several references to 8647, which government officials say \"is likely in reference to an Instagram post made by former FBI Director James Comey.\" According to the affidavit, Stinson \"self-identified as a member of ANTIFA.\" On Feb. 2, Stinson allegedly posted on his X account, \"Sure. This is war. Sides will be drawn. Antifa always wins in the end. Violence is inherently necessary.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The most recent post referenced in the document was published on BlueSky on June 11, when Stinson allegedly wrote, \"When he dies, the party is going to be yuge.\" Fox News Digital’s Andrea Margolis contributed to this report.","summary":"Federal judge orders ex-Coast Guard officer to home detention following accusations of multiple threats against Trump on X, Reddit, and Bluesky.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/federal-judge-orders-gps-monitoring-ex-coast-guard-officer-who-allegedly-threatened-assassinate-trump","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/peter-stinson-mugshot.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 23:45:15","author":"Greg Wehner,Jake Gibson","authors":["Greg Wehner","Jake Gibson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.248}]}
