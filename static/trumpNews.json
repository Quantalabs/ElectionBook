As per the report by CNN, the US President and his top advisors are preparing for the gathering of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers, three Trump administration officials told CNN. The summit, which would take place in Gyeongju between late October and early November, is being viewed as a key opportunity for Trump to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, CNN reported. Citing the officials, it said that there have been serious discussions about a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of APEC, but no firm plans are in place. CNN highlighted how in a phone call last month, Xi had invited Trump and his wife to visit China, an invitation the US president reciprocated, though no dates have been set. As per CNN, while the details are still being finalised, it is unclear whether the president may add other stops on the trip. The officials stated that the administration is also viewing the trip as an opportunity for the president to secure additional economic investments in the US. \"A visit to South Korea is being discussed, which would focus on economic collaboration,\" a White House official told CNN. Other goals include a focus on discussions around trade, defence and civil nuclear cooperation, the official said. Trump's visit could also put him in a position to sit down once again with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, however whether Kim attends is still a question. CNN reported that the officials say more attention is being placed on organising a potential meeting with Xi. During the visit of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung last week, he had invited Trump to attend the APEC summit and suggested that the setting could provide the US President with an opportunity to meet with Kim, sources familiar with the talks told CNN. While addressing reporters earlier in the day, Trump told Lee he was willing to meet with Kim. \"I will do that, and we'll have talks. He'd like to meet with me,\" Trump claimed of the North Korean leader. \"We look forward to meeting with him, and we'll make relations better.\" The expected trip of Donald Trump to South Korea thus comes at a tenuous time in his relationship with both Xi and Kim. While feathers were ruffled in Washington over the recently concluded SCO Summit in Tianjin earlier this month, where Xi Jinping had hosted Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin and PM Narendra Modi, Trump was quick to criticise the meetings. \"May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on social media as the parade was underway. On Friday, Trump shared a photo of Xi, Putin and Modi, writing: \"Looks like we've lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!\" However, on Friday (US local time), Trump expressed optimism towards India. Calling India-US ties a \"very special relationship\", United States President Donald Trump affirmed that he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would always be friends, asserting that there is \"nothing to worry about\". The gesture was taken with good spirits in New Delhi as Prime Minister Modi, on Saturday, responded warmly to US President Donald Trump's affirmation of the India-US ties, saying he \"deeply appreciates and fully reciprocates\" the US President's sentiments and positive assessment of the bilateral relations. A potential meeting with his Chinese counterpart would come at a time when Washington and Beijing have been repeatedly engaged over Trump's tariffs.","summary":"Trump  and his top advisors are preparing for the gathering of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-plans-south-korea-trip-in-oct-possible-meeting-with-xi-1902061","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/09/07/1955266-aa-5459759.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 01:07:23","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.218},{"id":358106888,"title":"South Korea condemns mass detention of its citizens in US","text":"South Korea has lodged a protest after US immigration authorities detained hundreds of workers at Hyundai’s electric vehicle manufacturing complex in Georgia.\n\nThe raid took place Thursday at the construction site of a battery plant in Bryan County near Savannah, a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution that employs about 1,200 people.

OCCUPATION” in both English and Spanish, participants marched over two miles from Meridian Hill Park to Freedom Plaza near the White House, protesting the fourth week of National Guard troops and federal agents patrolling D.C.’s streets.\n\nThe “We Are All D.C.” rally, organized by advocates of Home Rule and the American Civil Liberties Union, was possibly the most coordinated protest to date against Trump’s federal intervention in Washington. The president had justified the deployment last month as a measure to curb crime and homelessness in the city, although city officials pointed out that violent crime rates are actually lower than they were during Trump’s first term.\n\nTrump’s focus shifted to D.C. after he sent the National Guard to Los Angeles earlier in the summer, amid efforts to tighten immigration enforcement and manage protests. Washington presented a unique opportunity for Trump due to its distinct status under federal governance, allowing him to advance his tough-on-crime stance.\n\nThe presence of armed military personnel on the streets has left Washington residents uneasy, leading to weeks of protests, especially in local neighborhoods. Trump’s emergency decision to take control of D.C. police is scheduled to conclude on Wednesday.\n\nMark Fitzpatrick, a former U.S. diplomat and a decade-long D.C. resident, expressed concern to The Associated Press on Saturday about the administration’s “authoritarian nature” in treating D.C.\n\n“Federal agents, national guards patrolling our streets, that’s really an affront to the democracy of our city,” he said, adding that it’s worse for D.C. residents due to their lack of federal representation. “We don’t have our own senators or members of the House of Representatives, so we’re at the mercy of a dictator like this, a wanna-be dictator.”\n\nAmong the protesters Saturday were also former D.C. residents like Tammy Price, who called the Trump administration’s takeover “evil” and “not for the people.” \n\nJun Lee, a printmaker artist living in Washington, showed up with a “Free DC” sign that she made on a woodcut block. She said she came to the protest because she was “saddened and heartbroken” about the impact of the federal intervention on her city. \n\n“This is my home, and I never, ever thought all the stuff that I watched in a history documentary that I’m actually living in person, and this is why this is important for everyone, this is our home, we need to fight, we need to resist,” she said. \n\nAlso on Saturday, Trump repeated threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he wants to target for expanded federal enforcement. His administration is set to step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, similar to what took place in Los Angeles, and deploy National Guard troops. Like the District of Columbia, Chicago’s recent crime data does not reflect the war zones Trump has repeatedly compared it to. \n\nViolent crime in Chicago dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. Shootings are down 37%, and homicides have dropped by 32%, while total violent crime dropped by over 22%.\n\nIn response to Trump’s threats, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, called the president a “wannabe dictator,” who is “threatening to go to war with an American city.” \n\n“This is not a joke,” Pritzker wrote on X. “This is not normal.”\n\nAmiri reported from New York.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of demonstrators marched across Washington, D.C., on Saturday&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Massive Protests Demand &#8216;Freedom for DC&#8217; as Federal Oversight Enters Fourth Week first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/massive-protests-demand-freedom-for-dc-as-federal-oversight-enters-fourth-week/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Thousands-protest-for-a-039Free-DC039-on-the-fourth-week.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 00:45:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":358106374,"title":"South Korean president vows support to Koreans arrested in US immigration raid","text":"SEOUL: South Korean President Lee Jae Myung ordered all-out efforts on Saturday (Sep 6) to swiftly respond to the arrests of hundreds of the nation's citizens in a US immigration raid on a Hyundai Motor car battery factory.\n\nForeign Minister Cho Hyun said the government has set up a team to respond to Thursday's arrest of over 300 Koreans at the facility in the southern state of Georgia and that he may go to Washington to meet with officials if needed.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned.

In an interview with UK newspaper The Sunday Times, the prolific writer defended his outspoken criticism of Trump on social media. King acknowledged he was \"aware\" some of his fans may support Trump but said he felt it was his duty to speak up. \"It’s a question, like the song says, ‘Which side are you on?’\" he said. King suggested that future history books would portray Trump negatively and that Trump’s supporters would be quick to disassociate from him. ANTI-TRUMP NY TIMES COLUMNIST ADMITS PRESIDENT IS 'MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL' THAN EXPECTED \"There’s a story about the home run that was heard around the world,\" King told the outlet. \"There are… tens of thousands of people who will say, ‘I saw [the baseball player Bobby Thomson] hit that home run,’ and there were only, like, 5,000 people in the stands that day. So I think the opposite is true [with Trump]. Twenty or 30 years down the line, when I’ll be dead, and you’ll be old, I think a lot of people are going to say, ‘Well, I never voted for Trump.’\" King pointed to his 1979 book \"The Dead Zone\" as having foreshadowed Trump’s presidency, saying few would have believed fiction could become reality. \"Nobody would have believed where we are today, with Gestapo agents in the street — they call themselves ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], but they’re basically guys that are armed, they are wearing masks, they have huge amounts of money to spend, and they are everywhere,\" he said. TRUMP RESPONDS TO CRITICS WITH COUNTERPUNCHES ACROSS POLITICS AND ONGOING CULTURE WARS White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Fox News Digital, \"Since Stephen has spent so long writing fiction, it’s understandable that he’d have no grasp on reality.\" King, who has nearly seven million followers on X, wrote on Sept. 1 that Americans would turn against Trump by the next election. \"Trump and his greedhead cronies may get a big surprise in spite of their efforts to rig the 2026 election.

Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach — the boundary lines would change to lump in Orange County’s Newport Beach, a more conservative voter base, with the more liberal Long Beach in L.A. County – “because when you think of Newport Beach, you think Robert Garcia,” he said to laughs.\n\nMark Meuser, an attorney with Dhillon Law Group, which has filed two unsuccessful lawsuits on behalf of Republicans challenging Democrats’ redistricting efforts in California, said during the session that his firm is prepared to file another lawsuit — and to take the case to the Supreme Court — should voters approve Prop. 50.\n\nHe said his firm will also seek to stop the new maps from taking effect should voters pass Prop. 50 until the constitutionality of the new district lines is determined in court.\n\n“If the voters vote yes (on Nov. 4), guess where I’m going to be on the 5th?” Meuser said.\n\n“We will be in front of a three-judge panel here in the state of California. And if that three-judge panel does not give us an immediate injunction, we will be on the rocket docket straight to the Supreme Court … asking them to enjoin the new district lines,” he said.\n\nWith much at stake, political observers expect the special November redistricting election to cost about $250 million as campaigns make a mad dash to win over voters.\n\nNoting that there are just 58 days until the election, Steel said the way to win is through grassroots efforts and urged those in attendance to do their part to get voters to pay attention.\n\n“We need to awaken our base, and that’s how Trump did it. He had to flip seven states … and he was trying to say, ‘Get out of bed and get to work.’ And that’s what we have to do. This is that kind of election,” Steel said.\n\n“This is a big deal. This is the future of our party,” he added.","summary":"Proposition 50, the Democrat-led redistricting measure, was top of mind at the CAGOP convention.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/06/republicans-strategize-about-upcoming-redistricting-special-election-at-annual-convention/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LDN-L-CAGOP-REDISTRICT-0907_09.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 00:16:37","author":"Gqlshare,Linh Tat","authors":["Gqlshare","Linh Tat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":358103008,"title":"US Open Asks  Broadcasters To Censor Reaction To Donald Trump","text":"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 08: Melania Trump and Donald Trump attend day 9 of the 2015 US Open at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 8, 2015 in New York City.

Trump was on hand to watch Serena Williams beat her older sister Venus in the quarterfinals.\n\nActor Alan Cumming Tweeted at the time, “So much fun joining in the mass collective boo at Donald Trump here at the U.S. Open!!”\n\nAsked about Trump’s appearance, Alcaraz said: “It’s a privilege for the tournament having the president from (any) country to support the tournament and support tennis.\n\n“For me playing in front of him, to be honest, I will try not to be focused and think about that.\n\n“I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it, but I think attending the tennis match is great for tennis to have the president there.\"\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"US Open Asks  Broadcasters To Censor Reaction To Donald Trump","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2025/09/06/us-open-asks--broadcasters-to-censor-reaction-to-donald-trump/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68bccb642fe142fee58aa0fc/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 00:10:44","author":"Adam Zagoria,Contributor,Uri Schanker","authors":["Adam Zagoria","Contributor","Uri Schanker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.189},{"id":358106458,"title":"Chicago mayor pledges to defend city against 'authoritarianism' after Trump's 'Chipocalypse Now' threat","text":"Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he would defend his city from Donald Trump's 'authoritarianism', after the president made a social media post threatening to sic the military on Illinois's largest city.\n\nJohnson, elected mayor in 2023 as a progressive, has been advocating for his fellow Democrats to take a more aggressive posture against Trump.\n\n'The President’s threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,' Johnson wrote on X.\n\n'We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.'\n\nJohnson's post included a screenshot of Trump's message on Truth Social, which included an illustration of him wearing a cowboy hat with explosions and military helicopters behind him with the words 'Chipocalypse Now.' \n\n'I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.'\n\nThe line is a reference the movie Apocalypse Now when the character says, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.' \n\nTrump rebranded the Department of Defense to the Department of War this week. That name was last used for a comparable agency in 1947.\n\nTrump's warning to Chicago came ahead of expected Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker also responded to Trump's post on X, writing: 'The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. \n\n'This is not a joke. This is not normal.\n\n'Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.' \n\nICE is reportedly readying operations in the Windy City after Trump said he selected it for the next federal military takeover.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security asked the Pentagon to have access to Naval Station Great Lakes - the largest military base in Illinois - to base the operation, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe request said that around 250 federal agents and 140 vehicles would utilize the base.\n\nNational Guard troops could also be sent in to assist the effort, according to The Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nEquipment and personnel started arriving at the naval base earlier this week. One MAGA radio personality has branded it the beginning of 'the siege of Chicago.'\n\nGovernor JB Pritzker warned the raids could start on Saturday. \n\nOn Tuesday, Pritzker accused Trump's White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller of choosing to target Chicago in September because the city hosts a myriad of events for Mexican Independence Day. \n\n'We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September of come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every day,' Pritzker said.\n\nMiller is the administration's top immigration hardliner, the architect of the first Trump administration's controversial child separation policy. \n\n'It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades,' the governor continued. 'Let's be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.'\n\nOn Thursday, El Grito Chicago organizers scrapped a planned two-day festival over ICE raid fears.\n\nThe city's Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson is resisting the federal action.\n\nLast weekend, he signed an executive order that, among other things, bars law enforcement from wearing face masks, as ICE agents have done in other US cities.\n\nJohnson and Pritzker are sticking with the state's sanctuary city policies that ban local law enforcement from helping ICE agents, unless they have a criminal warrant.\n\nOn Thursday, the mayor encouraged Chicagoans to still celebrate Mexican Independence Day.\n\n'Why would I ask you to stay home?' he asked. 'Why would we allow someone who is auditioning to become a dictator of democracy to intimidate the soul of America, the city of Chicago? We should celebrate.'\n\nThe president claims that sending in the National Guard is helping the Democratic cities' crime problem. \n\nThe National Guard deployment in DC came hand-in-hand with ICE raids in the city.\n\nOn Thursday, DC's Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit arguing the more than 1,000 troops now deployed to the capital are an illegal use of the military for domestic law enforcement.\n\n'No American jurisdiction should be involuntarily subjected to military occupation,' Schwalb said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Trump revealed that after Washington, DC, Chicago was his next pick for a troop deployment.\n\n'When we're ready, we'll go in and we'll straighten out Chicago, just like we did DC,' Trump said in the Oval Office at a World Cup event.\n\n'Chicago is a mess. You have an incompetent mayor. Grossly incompetent and we'll straighten that one out probably next, that will be our next one after this and it won't even be tough,' Trump said.\n\n'And the people in Chicago, Mr. Vice President, are screaming for us to go. They're wearing red hats, just like this one. But they're wearing red hats,' Trump told Vice President JD Vance, who was standing alongside him.\n\n'African-American ladies, beautiful ladies, are saying: \"Please, President Trump, come to Chicago,\"' the president continued.\n\nHe added that he did 'great' with the black vote.\n\n'So I think Chicago will be our next and then we'll help with New York,' he said.","summary":"Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he would defend his city from Donald Trump's 'authoritarianism', after the president made a social media post threatening to sic the military on his city.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15073307/chicago-mayor-brandon-johnson-donald-trump-military-threat.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/06/17/101901269-0-image-m-52_1757175742311.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/02/7118313812625805003/1024x576_MP4_7118313812625805003.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-07 00:07:23","author":"Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":358103082,"title":"Nadine Dorries Calls for Johnson and Farage Alliance to Secure Britain’s Future","text":"Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson have been urged to join forces to stop Labour winning the next General Election.\n\nNadine Dorries, who recently made headlines by leaving the Tories for Reform UK, has suggested that the prominent figures in British politics unite to overthrow what she describes as Sir Keir Starmer’s faltering Government.\n\nA staunch ally of Mr. Johnson, Ms. Dorries expressed that if there is a genuine desire to improve people’s lives, both leaders could potentially set aside their differences and collaborate for the nation’s benefit.\n\nThe former Culture Secretary shared these thoughts on the Mail’s Alas Vine And Hitchens podcast as Mr. Farage wrapped up his party’s conference, encouraging his enthusiastic supporters to focus on gaining power while maintaining unity. He emphasized the importance of discipline in achieving success.\n\nIn other developments, the Prime Minister is working to regain control of his Government following Angela Rayner’s abrupt resignation due to unpaid taxes amounting up to £40,000 on her luxury coastal apartment.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Rayner incident, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch penned an article in today’s Mail on Sunday, questioning Sir Keir’s ‘moral authority’ to propose property tax increases in November’s Budget.\n\nMs. Badenoch argued: ‘While Rayner was evading her tax responsibilities, Labour was simultaneously preparing to raise property taxes on responsible, tax-paying families in the upcoming Budget.’\n\n‘Angela Rayner was leading the charge, writing to the Treasury in a memo that was then leaked, demanding higher stamp duty. It’s nothing less than pure hypocrisy. And now the dust is settling on this scandal, it’s clear that Labour has no moral authority to raise taxes on family homes.’\n\nSir Keir’s panic reshuffle was at risk of unravelling after Jewish leaders complained that Shabana Mahmood, the new Home Secretary, was a pro-Palestinian ‘activist’ who had ‘encouraged mob rule’.\n\nIn addition, outspoken criticisms incoming Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper made of Donald Trump also emerged in which she accused him of ‘Islamophobia, xenophobia and hatred’.\n\nThe Prime Minister is now facing the fresh nightmare of a party election for the vacant post of Labour deputy leader, with the Left mobilising to field a high-profile candidate.\n\nLast night there were even suggestions from sources near Ms Rayner’s Ashton-under-Lyne constituency that she could make things even more difficult for Sir Keir by resigning from the Commons all together. \n\nThat would raise the prospect – hoped for by some on the Labour Left – of Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham giving up his post and standing in the by-election as a precursor to a bid to succeed Sir Keir. \n\nMs Dorries – who revealed her defection on Thursday by telling the Daily Mail that she was leaving the Tory Party because it was ‘dead’ – warned that if the Right continued to be split then it could pave the way for a Left-wing ‘unholy alliance’ of Jeremy Corbyn, the Greens and even Ms Rayner taking power.\n\nMs Dorries declared: ‘We need all the political talents on the right of centre putting their shoulder to what needs to be done for the country. ‘\n\nShe said that there would have to be ‘some kind of accommodation’ between the Tories and Reform – but warned that Mr Farage was not interested in attracting the ‘majority’ of Conservative MPs.\n\nShe said: ‘I think there are some figures, but very, very small in number, that he would welcome. But the truth for most Conservative MPs is there would be no common ground for rapprochement.’ \n\nDelegates at the Reform conference in Birmingham claimed that former Prime Minister Liz Truss had been ‘sniffing around’ the party, with two groups she founded – Popular Conservatism and the Growth Commission – said to be ‘dominating’ fringe events. But one delegate with knowledge of Mr Farage’s thinking did not expect her to be invited to join, saying: ‘Nigel is not mad.’ \n\nMr Farage has put his party on red alert for a general election as early as 2027 after predicting that the Labour government would disintegrate.\n\nLucy Connolly, who was imprisoned for a ‘racist tweet’ and visited in jail by Reform’s deputy leader Richard Tice, appeared at the conference yesterday, telling the crowd she ‘learnt a lot, not all legal’ from prison and would use her ‘experiences to work with Reform UK in the future’ on criminal justice reforms. She received a standing ovation.\n\nTo listen to the full interview with Nadine Dorries on the rise of Reform and the state of British politics, search for Alas Vine & Hitchens now, wherever you get your podcasts.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNigel Farage and Boris Johnson have been urged to join forces to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Nadine Dorries Calls for Johnson and Farage Alliance to Secure Britain&#8217;s Future first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/nadine-dorries-calls-for-johnson-and-farage-alliance-to-secure-britains-future/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Johnson-and-Farage-must-unite-to-save-Britain-urges-Nadine.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 00:05:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":358103090,"title":"Donald Trump Claims Ignorance of Alleged Failed 2019 North Korea SEAL Team 6 Mission","text":"President Donald Trump stated on Friday that he was unaware of a 2019 classified SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea, as reported by the New York Times, in which unarmed North Korean civilians were killed during an aborted operation.\n\nThe Pentagon and U.S. Special Operations Command declined to comment to ABC News about The New York Times report.\n\nABC News has not confirmed the details in the report.\n\nSpeaking to reporters from the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was asked by a reporter: “Can you confirm that it happened?”\n\n“I don’t know anything about it.

There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,” Trump said, responding to a question on whether he was ready to reset relations with India.Live EventsAsked how trade talks with India and other countries were progressing, Trump said, “They are going great. Other countries are doing great. We’re doing great with all of them. We’re upset with the European Union because of what’s happening with not just Google, but with all of our big companies.”The US President also said he was “very disappointed” India was buying “so much oil” from Russia.“I’ve been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia, and I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India, 50% tariff, a very high tariff. I get along very well with Modi, he’s great. He was here a couple of months ago,” he said.Trump imposed 25% additional tariffs on India, on top of the existing 25%, starting August 27, citing purchase of discounted Russian oil, which he claimed was funding the Ukraine war.Reacting to the latest developments, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said, \"PM Modi attaches enormous importance to our partnership with the US. He has always had a very good personal equation with President Trump. But the point is that we remain engaged with the US, and at this time, I can’t say more than that. But that’s really what I would say.”Trump’s praise for the PM came less than 24 hours after he pulled up the RIC (Russia-India-China) grouping. In a post on Truth Social, he had said, “Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to the deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!”People familiar with the matter said that while the US President’s latest remarks indicated a thaw, the situation was still delicate and it remained to be seen whether the US would offer some relief on tariffs.What may have worked, as per one of the persons, was the informal huddle among the leaders of Russia, India and China at the Shanghai Cooperation Summit in Tianjin, which sparked a debate in the pro-Trump media on the future of India US ties as well as in the ‘Make America Great Again’ camp.Simultaneously, India remained firm on its policy of strategic autonomy and maintained that its oil purchases from Russia were based on domestic requirements and the need to keep global oil prices stable.On Friday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said India will continue to import crude oil from Russia, despite mounting US pressure and newly imposed tariffs. She emphasised that India’s energy decisions are based on national interests and economic logic, not external demands. The Reserve Bank of India has already started diversifying its holding in the US Treasuries, along with purchasing of gold, she said. Significantly, over the past week, Trump did not take credit for brokering the IndiaPakistan ceasefire, an issue that has been the biggest bone of contention with India in recent months.However, hours before Trump’s comments on Modi, a number of senior US officials attacked India. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday said he expects India will be back at the negotiating table in the next one or two months “saying sorry” to try to sign the trade deal, as the US is the largest consumer in the world and because the “consumer is always right”.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onDonald Trump Narendra ModiUS tariffs on IndiaPM Modi response to Trumpenergy independence IndiaIndia oil imports from RussiaRussia India China relationsNirmala SitharamanDonald Trump\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Around 290 were granted asylum, or about 7 per cent of the total.\n\nMost of those granted asylum were from countries including war-torn Myanmar, Malaysia — where LGBT people face persecution — and Iran.\n\n“Prior to Covid it was predominantly people who had entered on visitor visas,” said Dr Rizvi.\n\n“There still are a lot applying from visitor visas, but an increasing portion are students and PALM visa holders.”\n\nHome Affairs data show a growing number of onshore refugee applications from Pacific nations including Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga, which make up the bulk of Pacific Australia Labour Mobility [PALM] scheme.\n\nFijians made a total of 1138 asylum claims last year, while around 70 were granted protection.\n\nAs of July there were 30,475 PALM scheme workers in the country, according to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR).\n\nSimilarly, the second half of 2023 saw a massive surge in asylum claims from Vietnamese nationals, associated with the Ag Visa agreement struck by former Agriculture Minister David Littleproud.\n\n“Labor closed the visa except there was an MOU with Vietnam already signed and they couldn’t get out of it, so they let in 1000 to 2000 Ag Visa holders,” said Dr Rizvi.\n\n“Inevitably the bulk of them ended up applying for asylum, like night follows day.”\n\n2023 also saw a sharp rise in Colombian students applying for asylum.\n\n“The Colombian ELICOS (English-language course) sector went berserk for a while,” he said.\n\nDr Rizvi said the growing number of unlawful non-citizens had simply been swept under the rug by successive governments because the cost of deporting them “would be eye-watering”.\n\nHe estimated it would cost easily in the “tens of thousands” per person.\n\n“Many ministers have asked that question, and the response they’re given is, ‘Yes, Minister, we can do that but you’re going to have to find us a huge amount of money.’ Most likely in the hundreds of millions, if not more,” he said.\n\n“You’re going to have to build huge numbers of detention centres, then there’s going to be a huge amount of legal costs as these people appeal their deportation decisions. Many of them will be difficult to deport even after that.\n\n“Most governments, when confronted with those facts, have just said, ‘Let’s let it go through to the keeper.’”\n\nDr Rizvi pointed out that even US President Donald Trump, with $US170 billion ($260 billion) in additional funding for immigration enforcement, was struggling to deport significant numbers.\n\n“You can increase deportations at the margins, particularly cohorts … (whose) asylum claims are so weak that the legal case they can run will not last long,” he said.\n\n“But you can only do that to people who’ve recently been refused. If they’ve been here years and years, even if their asylum claim is weak removing them is hard, like the Biloela family.”\n\nThe best solution, he argued, was for Home Affairs to reverse processing asylum claims from newest to oldest.\n\n“Process the newest first with a focus on where the case is really weak,” he said.\n\nDr Rizvi also called for a crackdown on migration agents.\n\n“Target the agents that are organising (these claims),” he said.\n\n“Most of these people have very little English. Filling out an asylum application requires a high level of English. They will be getting help. The government has got to target the people who are helping them, particularly those who are organising very weak claims.”\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Home Affairs Department said the Australian government “is committed to ensuring the protection visa system serves its intended purpose — to provide protection to those who are found meet Australia’s protection obligations”.\n\n“On October 5, 2023, the Australian government announced measures to remove incentives for non-genuine applicants to apply for protection and reduce the number of on-hand protection visa applications,” a spokeswoman said.\n\n“These reforms are designed to break the business model of people exploiting visa processing delays to extend their stay in Australia, by ensuring visa applications are decided much more quickly.\n\n“As a result, protection visa primary decisions are now at an all-time high and consistently outstripping lodgements.\n\n“While the government is committed to deciding new protection visa applications quickly, it will also ensure lawful, reasonable and fair decision making.\n\n“The government is committed to upholding Australia’s international obligations and making lawful visa decisions. It will ensure each application continues to be assessed on its individual merits by a departmental decision maker and that legal assistance is readily available for protection visa applicants.”\n\nSalvatore Babones, Associate Professor Sociology and Criminology at the University of Sydney and author of the 2021 book Australia’s Universities: Can They Reform?, has long been a vocal critic of the international student sector.\n\nProf Babones told news.com.au last month there was an “emerging phenomenon” of increasing dropout rates as international students “recognise you can get in on a university visa and switch”.\n\n“This is the new scam,” he said.\n\n“We have many universities, mostly regional, that have dropout rates of (more than) 50 per cent after the first year.”\n\nThe most recent figures from the Education Department for 2022 showed Central Queensland University had an attrition rate of 67 per cent within the first year, while Victoria’s Federation University had a 48 per cent attrition rate.\n\nEarlier this year, Queensland University of Technology (QUT) revealed nearly half its foreign students — 46 per cent — dropped out in their first year.\n\n“That makes it very clear that international students are not applying to these universities for the purpose of studying in Australia, they’re applying for the purpose of getting into the country, after which they can apply for a different visa,” Prof Babones said.\n\n“They can easily get a bridging visa and then get a visa to study at a cooking school or a language school, and then you can stay in Australia almost indefinitely.”\n\nGriffith University, where more than one in four international students dropped out last year, told The Australian in April that the low retention rates for cohorts from Kenya, Pakistan and parts of India reflected “the evolving international student landscape and the flexibility students have under current regulations, which sees visa holders able to transfer to other institutions after six months study”.\n\nA 2023 report from the Australian government’s Centre for Population revealed fewer than half of international students had left the country a decade after arriving.\n\nOf the 103,000 students arrivals in 2006-07, only 44 per cent had completed their studies and returned offshore by 2016-17, while 39 per cent gained permanent residency and another 17 per cent remained in the country on various temporary visas.\n\nProf Babones said Australia’s annual permanent migration intake, currently set at 185,000 places, was “large but not extreme”, although it’s among the highest in the world on a per capita basis.\n\n“The real problem is the succession of temporary visas, which has created a class of guest workers in Australia,” he said.\n\nThe Albanese government last month announced it was increasing the 2026 national planning level by 25,000 to 295,000 international student places in order to provide “stability and certainty for the international education sector”, with a focus on increasing numbers from Southeast Asia.","summary":"International students are flooding the asylum system with bogus refugee applications, as the country’s deportation backlog surges towards 100,000.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/very-weak-claims-international-students-flood-asylum-system-as-deportation-backlog-nears-100000/news-story/0769477cd71f7de5d5a34b3c5a181610?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2ae2010cd02466502291fcaf6ff68dd8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 23:54:07","author":"Frank Chung","authors":["Frank Chung"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.456},{"id":358103100,"title":"Maximizing Returns: Strategies for Profiting from Rising Government Debt Costs Tax-Free","text":"A spike in the cost of UK borrowing is bad news for Chancellor Rachel Reeves but this offers investors willing to lend money to the Government a chance to lock in generous returns.\n\nTurmoil in the bond markets led to the yield on 30-year gilts – long-term UK debt – hitting 5.75 per cent last week.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for investors to buy gilts direct and hold them to maturity to pick up higher rates.\n\nOr if rates fall back again, they could sell at a tax-free profit earlier, as capital gains tax isn’t levied on gilts.\n\nLending money to the Government by buying its gilts direct is seen as a low-risk and lucrative earner by a growing number of ordinary investors. They can currently turn Reeves’ misfortune to their advantage, by securing an annual return above 5.5 per cent for decades.\n\nDIY investment platforms have made it easy to buy single gilts and stash them in your Isa or pension while financial advisers increasingly tend to recommend them to higher earners for the tax perks. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat are gilts and how do you buy them?\n\nThe UK issues new debt, called gilts, to help fund the business of government, from borrowing for infrastructure projects to fulfilling spending commitments and refinancing existing debt.\n\nGilts are usually issued for a set period – for example five years, ten years or 30 years – and pay a regular interest-based income, called the ‘coupon’. The face value of the gilt is paid back at the end of the term, known as maturity.\n\nInvestors buy gilts in return for this income, knowing that if they hang on until the maturity date they get all their money back, except in the unlikely event that the UK defaults on its debt.\n\nBut you can buy and sell gilts through their lifetime on the secondary market, where they may trade for more or less than face value depending on the demand for the interest rate they pay. This means investors can also sell out earlier and might get more than they bought the gilt for. A special feature of gilts is that these profits are free of capital gains tax.\n\nMany top investing platforms – including Hargreaves Lansdown, Interactive Investor and AJ Bell – offer gilts. You can check their sites for a list of what’s currently available and upcoming issues.\n\nYou can also buy direct from the UK Debt Management Office, which offers a service run by Computershare. Victoria Hasler, head of fund research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ‘They are popular partly because they are relatively low risk if you are prepared to hold them to maturity – and you can buy gilts that mature within anything from a few months to a few decades.\n\n‘Investors like the income-generating potential – but perhaps most popular of all is the fact that there’s no tax to pay on any profit when they mature or you sell up.’\n\nWhy is there trouble within the bond markets?\n\nThe cost of long-term borrowing has risen in the UK due to concern over whether the Government can get the economy growing enough to meet its spending and debt obligations. The prospect of a tough, tax-raising Budget to get the country’s finances on track is failing to calm nerves.\n\nThere is also a wider bond sell-off under way. International investors are worried about US President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve, undermining the US central bank’s independence, while his tariff policy appears to be coming unstuck in the courts.\n\nThe French government is also facing collapse over failed attempts to control spending.\n\nTom Becket, co-chief investment officer at wealth manager Canaccord Wealth, says: ‘Investors are clearly skittish around the problems in the UK gilt market, where concerns over the Government’s fiscal approach, as well as sticky inflation and challenges over future Bank of England rate cuts, are presenting a miserable mix.\n\n‘It is very hard to know how the ‘doom loop’ in UK bond markets will ease, given the reality of the Government’s finances and the likelihood that inflation in the UK reaches 4 per cent by the end of September.’\n\nWhy is buying the gilts direct attractive for higher earners?\n\nGilts can be very tax efficient, especially for those paying higher tax rates looking to invest outside Isas and pensions.\n\nMany opportunities lie in the secondary market, where you can buy gilts trading below redemption value and look to make a capital gain. While the coupon is subject to tax, just like cash savings interest, price gains are exempt from capital gains tax.\n\nThis works with gilts with low coupons, where you gain on any uplift from the purchase price.\n\nJason Hollands, from wealth manager Evelyn Partners, warns investors must be ready to do some maths regarding ‘yield to maturity’ and tax to make this work.\n\nThe ‘yield to maturity’ is the annual return you would get from the gilt at the price paid for it, if you held it till the end date. It accounts for the interest paid along with whether you bought it at above or below face value.\n\nHollands says: ‘It isn’t quite as straightforward as picking the gilts with the highest headline yields. If you look at platforms offering execution-only dealing in gilts, the information provided is typically limited to coupon, maturity date and price – so you would have to work out the yield to maturity, and then the post-tax yield.’\n\nHe suggests getting a financial adviser to help if you are unfamiliar with direct investing in bonds.\n\nShould you really opt for a bond fund instead?\n\nMany investors find it easier to buy a bond fund and let a professional manager do the hard work of deciding which bonds to buy or sell and spread the risk as their value rises or falls over time.\n\nA professional will be better placed to forecast bond market moves. Buying a bond fund means stumping up management fees though, and you don’t get the option of holding bonds to maturity and getting your capital back.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA spike in the cost of UK borrowing is bad news for Chancellor&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Maximizing Returns: Strategies for Profiting from Rising Government Debt Costs Tax-Free first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/maximizing-returns-strategies-for-profiting-from-rising-government-debt-costs-tax-free/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rewrite-this-title-How-to-make-a-tax-free-profit.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 23:52:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":358098082,"title":"Trump's DOJ refuses to release names of Epstein associates who wired him $350,000 before his arrest","text":"The Department of Justice is refusing to name two associates of late billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein who received six-figure payments from the criminal just before his 2019 arrest.\n\nThe payments - $100,000 for one and $250,000 for another - came in 2018, when the press began investigating the sweetheart plea deal he got from the state of Florida in 2008 ensuring his allies would never be prosecuted.\n\nWhen Epstein was eventually arrested and indicted in New York in 2019, the cash giveaways became public knowledge. \n\nThe prosecution claimed Epstein 'wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled, to an individual named as [REDACTED] a potential co-conspirator — and for whom Epstein obtained protection in — the NPA' on November 30, 2018.\n\n'NPA' is short for 'non-prosecution agreement,' which Epstein had attained for both individuals as part of his plea bargain.\n\nThe associate was 'named and featured prominently' in a series of stories run by the Miami Herald regarding the 2008 deal. \n\nOn December 3, 2018, prosecutors write that 'the same records show that... the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to [REDACTED], who was also named as a potential co-conspirator — and for whom Epstein also obtained protection in — the NPA.'\n\n 'This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that she and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant's trafficking of minors by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida,' they added. \n\nEpstein is accused of making 'efforts to influence witnesses.'\n\n'This course of action, and in particular its timing,' they said, 'suggests the defendant was attempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light of the recently re-emerging allegations.'\n\nNBC News asked U.S. District Judge Richard Berman to reveal the names of these associates last month.\n\nThey justified the request by saying that Epstein is dead and the criminal cases are now over, with no further charges related to the case coming from the DOJ. \n\nU.S. Attorney Jay Clayton responded by denying the request, saying the two associates are 'uncharged third parties who have not waived their privacy interests.' \n\nNBC News have until September 12 to respond.\n\nThe news comes as public interest in the Epstein case remains at a high, with questions over who was connected with the billionaire pedophile, including President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has claimed that Trump was once an 'FBI informant' in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's illegal activities.\n\nJohnson made the stunning comments in the halls of Congress on Friday after being pressed by CNN's Manu Raju about Trump routinely calling the Epstein files controversy a Democrat-invented 'hoax'.\n\n'What Trump is referring to is the hoax that the Democrats are using to try to attack him,' Johnson said. 'I’ve talked to him about this many times, many times. He is horrified. It’s been misrepresented. He’s not saying that what Epstein did is a hoax. It’s a terrible, unspeakable evil. He believes that himself.'\n\n'When he first heard the rumor, he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago. He was an FBI informant to try to take this stuff down,' added Johnson, which now raises new questions about Trump's relationship with Epstein.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday, Trump called Epstein scandal a 'hoax' after the Department of Justice insisted in July that there was no client list.\n\n'This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,' Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n'From what I understand, I could check, but from what I understand, thousands of pages of documents have been given. But it's really a Democrat hoax because they're trying to get people to talk about something that's totally irrelevant to the success that we've had as a nation since I've been president,' he continued.\n\nJohnson offered no other details about Trump's supposed role as an informant to the FBI on the Epstein case. He did not reveal when Trump talked to the FBI or what they might have talked about.\n\nTrump's relationship with the financier-turned-child predator has been well-documented, with Trump himself admitting that he was friendly with Epstein throughout the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nTrump and then-girlfriend Melania were also pictured with Epstein and his sex trafficking accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell at a Mar-a-Lago party in February 2000.\n\nEver since Trump retook the White House this January, his political base has demanded answers and has wanted the criminal investigation files into Epstein to be released.\n\nThat desire has been around since Epstein mysteriously died awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan on August 10, 2019.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump did promise to release the Epstein files. \n\nHowever, his supporters were disappointed when the DOJ in July came to the conclusion that Epstein had in fact killed himself and that there was 'no credible evidence' that he blackmailed 'prominent individuals'.\n\nThe agency also said there was no client list, even though Attorney General Pam Bondi previously stated the documents were 'sitting on my desk'.\n\nFor the last two months, certain segments of MAGA have blasted Trump for breaking his promise, which has become one of the first cracks in the president's coalition.\n\nDays after the DOJ seemingly did not follow through, Trump addressed the situation on Truth Social.\n\n'We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening. We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and “selfish people” are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,' Trump wrote.\n\nHe added that America should 'not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody nobody cares about'.\n\nMany MAGA devotees openly disagreed with Trump, and now there's an effort in the House to compel the DOJ to release the Epstein files.\n\nThe bill was originally sponsored by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna. It's also supported by Republican Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie.\n\nBoth Greene and Massie have promised to read the names on the so-called Epstein list on the House floor, given that their official speech as lawmakers is constitutionally-insulated from defamation lawsuits.\n\nMassie has been pushing for a discharge petition that would force a vote on the Khanna bill that would release the Epstein files within 30 days.\n\nHe has said 214 House members, including four Republicans have signed the petition thus far. That's four votes away from the 218-threshold needed to pass the measure.","summary":"The payments - $100,000 for one and $250,000 for another - came in 2018, when the press began investigating the sweetheart plea deal he got from the state of Florida in 2008.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15073171/Trumps-DOJ-Epstein-associates-wired-payments.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/07/00/101906711-0-image-m-13_1757200255793.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/05/5072863538005363246/1024x576_MP4_5072863538005363246.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-06 23:18:55","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

While addressing the group, the president swore his loyalty “for the rest” of his life — a comment that follows rampant speculation concerning his health, which peaked with death rumors over Labor Day weekend.\n\n “You've been unbelievable. I'll be with you for the rest of my life,” the president said while thanking the top allies as they stood on the patio space, the fruit of his summer renovations that covered the historic, Kennedy-era lawn.\n\n “I will be with you, and you're going to be with me and with leadership,” Trump continued, before turning his attention to the patio, which he called “this little beautiful grouping of some of the finest stone in the world.” The patio, Trump continued, “is, I think, going to go down as a very important place over the period of time for news conferences, for celebrations, for dinners, and we're going to bring people together here.” \n\n As for the reason behind the exclusive dinner party, the president said: “I'll tell you very simply why you're here. Because you are the ones that I never had to call at 4 o'clock in the morning. You are the ones that have been my friends.”\n\n Elsewhere in the speech, Trump made reference to his health and the death rumors. The topic arose as he addressed Ronny Jackson, a presidential physician turned pro-Trump congressman in the dinner crowd. Trump boasted that Jackson allegedly declared him “the healthiest” when compared to former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush — even though Jackson was not physician to the president during the latter politician’s presidency.\n\n “You're a special group of people, and you're the first people that I've had at the White House at the Rose Garden, and it's an honor to have you,” Trump told the crowd.\n\n He then turned his attention to the viral death rumors shortly after, stating, “We'll say goodbye to the press, but it's an honor to have you. And actually, the press has been very good lately, except for one rumor that they spread.”\n\n Trump continued, “I did about eight press conferences… day after day after day. Then, I missed one because I was in the Oval Office, and I also went out to the club because I had meetings at a club, and they saw that I was, and the rumor started — this horrible rumor — that Trump is no longer with us. I got to the club: ‘Sir, are you okay? Are you okay?’ ”\n\n “The fake news was at it again,” he later added. (Although the theory that he had died arose organically from social media users, Trump previously blamed the conspiracy theory on \"fake news” in a Sept. 2 press conference, along with the media for spreading it — even though it was never treated as fact by major news outlets.)\n\n Trump not only addressed the rumors swirling about his death and health in the speech to his top allies, but also the controversial changes to the historic rose garden. While kicking off his speech, he said, “We have worked very hard to bring it to fruition and not an easy situation, but it's something that I think we're all going to enjoy for many, many years to come. It's a tremendous place.”\n\n The president also claimed that during the summer renovations, “we never touched” the actual roses. The grass, meanwhile, was “not usable,” he said: “Every time we'd have a press conference, women in particular were sinking deep into the mud and at some point I said, ‘You know, it's time to make the change.’ ”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n The latest renovations to the White House Rose Garden began in early June.

The award is traditionally presented to an “outstanding citizen” who is not an alumnus of the academy but exemplifies its ideals of “duty, honor, and country.” Former president Barack Obama received the honor last year. \n\nRetired Army Col. Mark Bieger, president and chief executive officer of the West Point Association of Graduates, announced in an email Friday that the ceremony and parade would no longer go forward.\n\n“This decision allows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world’s most lethal force, the United States Army,” Bieger wrote, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIt was not made clear whether Hanks’ honor had been revoked or if he would be celebrated in a different way.\n\nThe Independent has contacted West Point and Hanks’ representative for comment. \n\nHanks, a longtime Democrat, was originally named the 2025 recipient of the institution’s Thayer Award in June. “Tom Hanks has done more for the positive portrayal of the American service member, more for the caring of the American veteran, their caregivers and their family, and more for the American space program and all branches of government than many other Americans,” said Robert McDonald, a former secretary of veterans affairs and the alumni association’s board chairman.\n\nThe prolific Hollywood star has portrayed U.S. service members in several movies, including Saving Private Ryan (1998), Forrest Gump (1994), and Greyhound (2020).\n\nAt the time, the Sleepless in Seattle actor and frequent Donald Trump critic called the honor “humbling and meaningful.”\n\nThe ceremony’s unexpected cancellation comes as the college faces mounting political pressure from the Trump administration, which has barred military academies from “promoting, advancing or otherwise inculcating” ideas deemed “un-American,” including “gender ideology” and the idea that “America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”\n\nLate last month, West Point dissolved its sociology major and canceled history classes on gender and race and ethnicity. Professors were forced to remove works from James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, and other writers of color.\n\nJust last week, the institution’s library rehung a portrait of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The picture had been removed in 2022 to comply with a Department of Defense directive that ordered the academy to address racial injustice and do away with installations that “commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy.”\n\nAfter the painting was restored, Rebecca Hodson, the Army’s communications director, said in a prepared statement: “At West Point, the United States Military Academy is prepared to restore historical names, artifacts, and assets to their original form and place. Under this administration, we honor our history and learn from it — we don’t erase it.”","summary":"Actor was expected to receive the prestigious Sylvanus Thayer Award at a September 25 ceremony","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/west-point-tom-hanks-award-b2821597.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/06/20/07/Tom-Hanks.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5vIjp8L9-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-06 22:39:07","author":"Inga Parkel","authors":["Inga Parkel"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.039},{"id":358097222,"title":"Vice President JD Vance doesn’t ‘give a s***’ if you think lethal Venezuela boat strike was a war crime","text":"Vice President JD Vance “doesn’t give a s***” if people consider the Trump administration’s strike on an alleged Venezuelan gang’s boat a “war crime,” he posted Saturday on his official X account. \n\nThe Trump administration has been under pressure to explain a lethal military strike it carried out September 2 on a boat allegedly carrying drugs and affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The strike killed 11 people. \n\nLegal experts, former national security officials, and Democrats have raised concerns that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by carrying out the strike in international waters, without giving those on board due process. \n\nVance defended the strike Saturday, stating: “Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.”\n\nBrian Krassenstein, a prominent social media personality, responded: “Killing the citizens of another nation who are civilians without any due process is called a war crime.”\n\nThe vice president shot back: “I don’t give a s*** what you call it.”\n\nTrump has long-promised to go after drug cartels, blaming them for drug overdoses and deaths in the U.S. He’s particularly focused on Tren de Aragua, a transnational organization that has a reputation for engaging in extreme violence, sex trafficking and drug smuggling.\n\nTrump has designated Tren de Aragua as a “foreign terrorist organization” which allows him to bring financial or legal penalties, or sanctions, but does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force. \n\nWhile the president has the power to use military force when it constitutes national interest, it’s unclear if that legal justification applies because cartel members, historically, have been treated as criminals with the right to due process. \n\nDemocratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Navy veteran, told Axios he did not think U.S. military members should be put in a situation where they’re “doing things that are outside of legal boundaries.”\n\nJuan S. Gonzalez, a former National Security Council official in the Biden administration, wrote on X that the attack was “legally questionable under both U.S. and international law.”\n\nThe Trump administration has offered few details about the strike. Those killed have not been identified, nor have any details about the drugs they were supposedly carrying. \n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has maintained that U.S. officials were certain that members of Tren de Aragua were on the boat and intended to “poison” the U.S. with drugs. \n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump claimed they had identified those on board as “Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists” who were “operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro,” the president of Venezuela.\n\nOn Friday evening, Maduro condemned the boat strike and urged Trump to engage in respectful dialogue over the two countries’ differences, according to PBS. \n\nA White House spokesperson said the strike against a “designated terrorist organization” was “fully consistent” with armed conflict law and done “in defense of vital U.S. national interests.\n\nSenior administration officials have made it clear they intend to continue carrying out strikes against cartels. \n\n\"We've got assets in the air, assets in the water, assets on ships, because this is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won't stop with just this strike,\" Hegseth told Fox & Friends last week. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist will face the same fate.”\n\nVance’s comment comes one day after, the president signed an executive order to informally rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War.","summary":"US military killed 11 people on a boat that Trump claims was operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-war-criminal-venezuela-boat-strike-b2821599.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/06/21/13/GettyImages-2232575802.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Rnoj1TBV-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-06 22:33:06","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":358092544,"title":"Global Watch | The Irony Of Sanctions: As The West Funds Russia, India Safeguards Global Economic Order","text":"US President Donald Trump has recently imposed an additional 25 per cent in tariffs on Indian exports to the United States for importing Russian crude, taking the total tariffs to a whopping 50 per cent. The argument is that India is “enabling” Russia to carry on its war against Ukraine by buying Russian oil.\nHowever, beneath the clamour of political rhetoric and dramatic posturing lies the irony: India’s procurement of Russian crude is not only rational but also necessary for even those who are decrying it. On the other hand, it is the West that is funding Russia by buying its oil in much larger quantities.\nA deeper, objective look into the context would help dispel several myths that have been propagated against India. As Western countries severely sanctioned Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the European Union, which had been Moscow’s largest customer of oil and petroleum products (importing around 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and 1.2 million bpd of refined oil products in 2021), faced a serious challenge.\nThe truth is that even as Western countries sharpened their tirade against trading with Russia and banned direct Russian imports, many of them kept acquiring Russian oil and gas through indirect routes. One of the key trade routes was to get it re-exported from Turkey. According to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), EU member states spent €21.9 billion (£18.1 billion) on Russian fossil fuels in the third year of the war, much more than their expenditure on financial aid to Ukraine. In fact, since the beginning of the war, EU countries have bought more energy fuel from Russia than India, with the former accounting for 23 per cent of Moscow’s earnings from fossil fuel exports, in contrast with India’s contribution of 13 per cent.\nNow, while it is true that India’s crude import from Russia has surged since the war, from nearly negligible to now accounting for around 40 per cent of India’s total oil purchases, it is still not the largest consumer of Russian crude. China stands as the single largest buyer of Russian crude, primarily owing to the connectivity through pipelines, purchasing around 2 to 2.5 million bpd of oil. Moreover, the amendment of the G7 sanctions policy in September 2022, which put the price cap for Russian oil at $60 per barrel, incentivised India to not only take advantage of the huge discount for its humongous population but also diversify its crude acquisitions from costlier West Asian sources.\nIndia is the world’s third-largest oil consumer, with a demand of around 5.2 million bpd. Therefore, to meet its domestic demand at affordable prices, the Indian government decided to shift its energy dependence away from West Asian and African nations by procuring discounted Russian crude. This, in turn, allowed these countries and the US to redirect their shipments and fulfil the energy vacuum created by the post-war sanctions for European countries. Thus, if India does not enable the continued circulation of Russian oil, the resultant destabilisation of the market can cause a wild surge in oil prices. According to analysts, the price could shoot up between $100 and $200 a barrel. Naturally, this will significantly hurt US and EU consumers as well, which is why the Biden administration had welcomed India’s purchases of discounted Russian crude, as it kept global oil prices from spiralling while also ensuring reduced revenues to Moscow.\nIn light of these facts, the blatant targeting of India by the Trump administration for its energy trade with Russia is absolutely bizarre. In addition to exaggerations regarding India’s gain from Russian oil imports, the country is being singled out and egregiously mischaracterised as “fuelling Russia’s war machine” even as China remains the largest buyer of Russian crude. China, as well as other countries that heavily import Russian oil—Saudi Arabia, Turkey, et al.—are not being slapped with similar punitive measures because of the US’s own geopolitical and economic assessment, which arguably is questionable, especially under the Trump administration.\nIt must be remembered here that many EU member states continue to indirectly source Russian fuels. Furthermore, Trump’s belligerent methods reveal themselves to be particularly problematic when one considers that India’s purchase of Russian oil is not only carrying out its own domestic interest but also acting as a shock absorber, effectively preventing a global oil price spiral and its cascading effects on food security and economic growth of a large number of countries.\nThere is another dimension that needs to be highlighted here. In choosing to buy crude from Russia or staying diplomatically neutral on the question of the Russia-Ukraine war in multilateral forums, India is exercising its policy of strategic autonomy. This principle is deeply embedded in Indian foreign policy, taking root from the non-alignment during the Cold War era. Russia has long been a close military and economic ally of India. Although current geopolitical pressures cannot be overlooked, India cannot jeopardise this decades-old, reliable relationship. So, when Trump targets and pressurises India to cut ties with Moscow, he is not just putting at risk the energy security for India as well as the world, but also challenging a sovereign nation’s right to carve its own foreign policy.\nIt is important to note that the US has already tightened the oil ecosystem through severe sanctions against Iran and Venezuela. It is also important to note that, unlike some other countries, India does not have a shadow banking system to bypass sanctions and thus functions transparently within global policy frameworks. Therefore, to unnecessarily poke a responsible and rational global actor like India when it demonstrably is safeguarding its own as well as global energy security interests is not just counterproductive but also reveals the short-sightedness and hypocrisy of Western energy politics. Whatever Western powers say due to their narrow, rash, and short-sighted geopolitical considerations, India is actually not the problem but a solution safeguarding the global economic architecture.\nThe writer is an author and columnist.

OCCUPATION” in both English and Spanish, the demonstrators walked over two miles from Meridian Hill Park to Freedom Plaza near the White House. Their protest was against the ongoing presence of National Guard troops and federal agents in D.C.’s streets, which has persisted for four weeks.\n\nThe protest, named “We Are All D.C.” and organized by advocates for Home Rule and the American Civil Liberties Union, marked one of the most structured demonstrations opposing Trump’s federal intervention in the city. The president had touted the intervention as necessary last month to combat crime and homelessness, despite local authorities highlighting that violent crime levels are lower compared to Trump’s first term.\n\nTrump’s focus on D.C. follows the earlier deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration enforcement and protest suppression. Washington provided a unique backdrop for Trump to emphasize his stringent crime policies due to its distinct relationship with the federal government.\n\nThe visible presence of armed military personnel has unsettled Washington and sparked ongoing protests, with particular intensity in local neighborhoods. Trump’s emergency declaration assuming control over D.C. police is scheduled to conclude on Wednesday.\n\nMark Fitzpatrick, a former U.S. diplomat and a decade-long resident of D.C., expressed concern to The Associated Press on Saturday about the “authoritarian manner” in which the administration is handling D.C.\n\n“Federal agents, national guards patrolling our streets, that’s really an affront to the democracy of our city,” he said, adding that it’s worse for D.C. residents due to their lack of federal representation. “We don’t have our own senators or members of the House of Representatives, so we’re at the mercy of a dictator like this, a wanna-be dictator.”\n\nAmong the protesters Saturday were also former D.C. residents like Tammy Price, who called the Trump administration’s takeover “evil” and “not for the people.” \n\nJun Lee, a printmaker artist living in Washington, showed up with a “Free DC” sign that she made on a woodcut block. She said she came to the protest because she was “saddened and heartbroken” about the impact of the federal intervention on her city. \n\n“This is my home, and I never, ever thought all the stuff that I watched in a history documentary that I’m actually living in person, and this is why this is important for everyone, this is our home, we need to fight, we need to resist,” she said. \n\nAlso on Saturday, Trump repeated threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he wants to target for expanded federal enforcement. His administration is set to step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, similar to what took place in Los Angeles, and deploy National Guard troops. Like the District of Columbia, Chicago’s recent crime data does not reflect the war zones Trump has repeatedly compared it to. \n\nViolent crime in Chicago dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. Shootings are down 37%, and homicides have dropped by 32%, while total violent crime dropped by over 22%.\n\nIn response to Trump’s threats, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, called the president a “wannabe dictator,” who is “threatening to go to war with an American city.” \n\n“This is not a joke,” Pritzker wrote on X. “This is not normal.”\n\nAmiri reported from New York.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A significant protest took place in Washington, D.C., on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Thousands Rally for &#8216;Free DC&#8217; During Fourth Week of Federal Oversight in Washington first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/thousands-rally-for-free-dc-during-fourth-week-of-federal-oversight-in-washington/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Thousands-protest-for-a-039Free-DC039-on-the-fourth-week.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 22:29:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":358092888,"title":"DAVID MARCUS: The Department of War marks the end of America as the world’s policeman","text":"In 1947, the United States War Department became the Department of Defense, as our nation was entering what would be four decades of Cold War with the Soviet Union, and taking its place as a global superpower. On Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order bringing the original name back to the department created by George Washington in 1789. It brings with it a change that would have earned the hearty approval of our first president. TRUMP SIGNS ORDER RENAMING PENTAGON BACK TO ‘DEPARTMENT OF WAR’ In the 78 years in which the United States has had a \"Department of Defense,\" we never declared war a single time, but that didn’t stop thousands upon thousands of American soldiers from sacrificing their lives in Korea, Vietnam, and later, the Middle East. During this time, the United States widely became known as the world’s policeman. Without actually declaring wars, we played a violent game of Twister across the globe, our Defense Department dipping its toes into conflicts across continents. Too often, the role of our soldiers was not to kill the enemy, but to maintain order, and just as a police force is restrained from using total force against criminals, our military was too often simply not allowed to bring its full force to bear. There is a fundamental and important difference between war and policing. Wars can be won, policing cannot. Policing is a never-ending struggle, and that is exactly what America’s military interventions felt like under the reign of the Department of Defense. \"I want offense too,\" Trump has quipped about the name change. But what he really means is that he wants wars we can win, not endless nation-building boondoggles meant to maintain balance in a world full of conflagrations from Ukraine to Gaza. Secretary of War, as he is now known, Pete Hegseth has made clear his priority is lethality, not just being a stick for diplomats to use. He wants an army, not a police force. It was Carl von Clausewitz, the early 19th Century father of modern war, who defined military victory as compelling the enemy to do your will by destroying their desire and means to resist. That is something our military has not done in some time. But that may be changing. It was no accident that this cabinet-level name change occurred in the wake of the Trump administration blowing an alleged speedboat full of drugs and drug smugglers from Venezuela to smithereens. Under the old rubric, that boat might have been stopped, its crew given Miranda rights. In other words, it would have been policed. But does this mere police work actually work, per Clausewitz, to destroy the Venezuelan gangs’ and government’s will and means to flood our country with deadly drugs? It does not, it just maintains the status quo from the border to the graveyard. But now, the next guys in line to jump aboard a drug-laden boat headed for Florida aren’t looking at possible jail time, in facilities all but run by their gangs. No, they are looking at a quick exit to eternity under the sea. Likewise, Trump’s direct attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities sent a new message to the Ayatollah that if he goes too far, we will destroy him and his nation. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Department of Defense, may it rest in peace, was a noble idea. It was launched in the spirit of ending war, not winning wars. It was meant to prop up democracies around the planet until all nations found the right and just path of freedom and capitalism. It may have been worth a shot, but it just didn’t work, and that is why the Trump administration is returning to the original premise, that armies don’t exist to protect and serve the world, they exist to kill our enemies. Not long after President Washington established the War Department, he would give a farewell address in which warned against engaging in foreign entanglements, and yet under the name Department of Defense, our military seemed to do little else. President Trump is sending the message that the United States will no longer be defending itself through proportional half measures and never-ending peace missions. No, from here on out, the Department of War does not exist to contain or constrain our enemies, it exists, as it should, to destroy them.

Reynolds said he has always tried to embody Canadian values such as conflict resolution, emphasizing that he aims \"to learn, rather than win.\" He said this approach enables him to have collaborative, rather than combative, conversations with people who might not share his views.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also attended, and spoke ahead of the premiere of Reynolds' documentary, criticizing President Donald Trump during his speech. During his remarks, he highlighted Candy’s acting roles in a way that appeared to reference the U.S. president. \"We’re in a more dangerous, divided and intolerant world. In Canada, our sovereignty, our identity has come under threat. And when Canadians heard those threats, they channeled their inner John Candy — stood up, elbows up, wrote our own lines,\" the politician said.

Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!”\n\nBut now, according to Arkansas station KAIT, hundreds of farmers gathered in Brookland to beg state leaders for help.\n\nChris King, a Woodruff County farmer, reminded the crowd that Trump had once told him, “I love you,” and now he wanted to see “the fruit of that love.” (Ew.) \n\nKing explained that this was his 39th harvest, and he had never seen conditions so dire. \n\n“I have never been as worried as I am now about whether or not my kids and grandkids will be able to carry on,” he admitted. \n\nThe problem, he said, is simple: They can’t sell for profit. \n\n“I just would like to see somebody help us get our markets back. We need our exports, and we just need to be paid for what we do, and that’s not happening, and we’re in real trouble,” King said.\n\nBut who cost King and his buddies those exports in the first place? Trump, the man they happily elected. Why should anyone feel sorry for them, funneling more blue-state resources to people who insist on punching themselves in the face?\n\nScott Brown, a farmer from Biggers, was just as gloomy. He warned that “you are going to lose 25-30% of the farmers in this country if they don’t do something.” \n\nAnd he said that Trump’s tariffs are the final straw.\n\n“I think the tariffs are the ice cream on the cake of a perfect storm. When you try and sell a product, okay, U.S. soybeans leaving New Orleans without the tariff to China are cheaper than Brazilian soybeans, at the current market. But when you put the tariff on top of them, Brazilian beans are cheaper.”\n\nMaybe you shouldn’t have voted for the guy who ran on tariffs and promised they’d be fun? Because for these farmers, Trump’s “fun” has meant lost markets, collapsing prices, and neighbors talking about going under.\n\nAnd there’s the crux: U.S. consumers don’t need these farmers for cheaper groceries—we can get them from overseas. Trump can’t raise tariffs on imports much higher without driving up grocery prices even further, which would crush Republicans at the ballot box. \n\nRelated | They voted for Trump—now they're reaping his crappy jobs market\n\nMeanwhile, farmers are being slammed with Trump-induced inflation, Trump-induced labor shortages as immigrant workers are deported or driven away, and Trump-induced cuts to the very programs that once gave them a cushion. Their hospitals and clinics haven’t closed yet—but give it time, that’s coming, too. So much fun, they’ll be tired of all the fun.\n\nBrown conceded that, in the short term, “they have no choice but to mail us a check.” \n\nHe also insisted that no farmer likes taking taxpayer dollars, but “nobody wants to go broke, nobody wants to lose everything. Long term, we have to have options, markets, and places to sell our product.”\n\nHow about no? Students didn’t get debt relief, even though millions were promised a fresh start from crushing loans. Hungry families are watching food pantries close as pandemic-era assistance dries up. Cancer researchers see their funding slashed, teachers are told to buy their own supplies, and veterans fight tooth and nail for basic benefits. But these Trump-voting farmers think they’re owed a taxpayer bailout?\n\nIf they want relief, maybe they should stop voting for politicians who keep kneecapping them while distracting them with culture war nonsense about trans kids. Zero sympathy. None. So they can fuck off.\n\nNow, if the state of Arkansas wants to bail them out, that’s fine. But Republicans hold overwhelming supermajorities in Little Rock, with 29-6 in the Senate and 81-19 in the House. So good luck with that.\n\nMay they have the day they voted for. Fun, right?","summary":"According to MAGA, students saddled with overwhelming debt didn’t deserve student loan forgiveness. People suffering from food insecurity didn’t deserve government assistance.

August’s report is much worse and pointing to more.\n\nFirst monthly job losses in five years\n\nWith the monthly revisions, standard operating procedure by the way, July’s paltry number of 22,000 jobs created was overshadowed by June’s new status as the first month since December 2020 showing a loss. More dramatically, June 2025 and August 2010 were the only months since 2010 – 301 in all – showing a loss at all.\n\nMajor job market shift\n\nKeep in mind, this is what the stewardship of the job market by Donald Trump looks like only seven months after he inherited it – the strongest in history – from Joe Biden. Trump’s numbers – 587,000 in eight months this year – were routinely surpassed by Biden in a … month. So the major shift – and it is tectonic – is that there are now more unemployed candidates – 7,384,000 – than there are open jobs in America – 7,181,000. It is now an employer’s market – and this trend is deepening.\n\nJob loss in almost all sectors\n\nFor the last three months, only health care and social assistance have created jobs – and much fewer than expected.

Interior community of Edgewood, has been attempting to stop the Canadian Food Inspection Agency from destroying the birds since the cull was ordered amid an avian flu outbreak in December 2024 that killed 69 ostriches.\n\nIn a letter filed in the Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday, a lawyer for the ostrich farm said the CFIA was “imminently” mobilizing to enforce the cull order.\n\nIn a decision dated Saturday, the Federal Court of Appeal granted an interim stay until the stay motion “is decided on the basis of a full record.”\n\nThe decision says a notice to cull the birds is “hereby stayed pending the disposition of the stay motion.” The CFIA was given until Tuesday to respond to the motion.\n\n“This gives us a little bit of time, not a lot,” lawyer Umar Sheikh, who represents the farm, said in an interview shorty after the interim stay motion was granted.\n\nKatie Pasitney, farm spokeswoman and daughter of the farm’s co-owner, said in a video posted to social media on Saturday afternoon that the granting of the interim stay allows several days of breathing room.\n\n“It’s been a very emotional few days. It is still very emotional today,” Pasitney said in the video, which was recorded in front of an ostrich pen where she has posted numerous updates from the farm.\n\nThe farm, which argues the birds are now healthy, has maintained that they pose no threat and are scientifically valuable.\n\nCourt documents filed by the farm say the flock has been “healthy” for more than 230 days, with no new avian flu infections and the last death recorded in mid-January, and claims the cull will “irreversibly destroy a flock built over decades.”\n\nThe letter filed Thursday says Universal Ostrich Farms wants to explore two routes of legal recourse to stop the cull: asking the agency or the minister to reconsider in light of fresh evidence, and seeking a hearing at the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe CFIA says on its website that allowing a flock previously exposed to avian flu to remain alive means a potential source of the virus persists and increases the risk of reassortment or mutation of the virus.\n\nThe farm’s situation has drawn attention from officials in the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly called for the animals to be spared and studied. Supporters seeking to avert a cull have also been camping out at the farm and staging musical concerts.\n\nThe interim stay motion notes that the CFIA is still allowed to take preparatory steps to kill the birds.\n\nIt says that after the CFIA files its response to the application for a stay of the cull order, the farm will have until Wednesday to respond.\n\n— with files from The Canadian Press.","summary":"Hundreds of ostriches on a farm in the British Columbia Interior have been given a temporary reprieve from being destroyed in an order issued by the Federal Court of Canada.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11399689/bc-ostriches-farm-reprieve-cfia/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cd707b6611f5cf5d0d2166aabb6ea94dc63d8a0fb068912fa95864abeaf2cec9_db1ec7.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 22:06:32","author":"Ken MacGillivray","authors":["Ken MacGillivray"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":358089046,"title":"Trump will watch US Open men's singles final from Rolex suite, AP source says","text":"New York, Sep 6 (AP) President Donald Trump will watch the US Open men’s final from Rolex’s suite in Arthur Ashe Stadium, a person with knowledge of the details said on Saturday.\nTrump’s first appearance at the Grand Slam tennis tournament in New York since 2015 will be Sunday as a guest of the Swiss watchmaker, the person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because those plans were not publicly revealed.\nIf there is any negative reaction to Trump’s presence, it won’t be shown on ABC’s telecast of the match between No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz. That’s a standard US Tennis Association policy.\n“We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions,” the organisation said in a statement.\nTrump frequently attended the US Open in the years before that when he lived in New York and before he launched his political career. He now primarily lives at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, when he’s not in Washington.\nAccepting use of Rolex’s suite is noteworthy since it comes weeks after the Trump administration imposed a whopping 39 per cent tariff on Swiss products. That’s over 2 1/2 times higher than the one on European Union goods exported to the US, and nearly four times higher than on British exports to the US — which has raised questions about Switzerland’s ability to compete with the 27-member bloc that it neighbours.\nIt’s the latest high-profile sporting event for Trump after the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the Daytona 500 in Florida, as well as UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nThe Trump Organization once controlled a suite at the US Open, which was adjacent to the television broadcasting booth in Arthur Ashe Stadium, but suspended it in 2017, during the first year of Trump’s first term.\nDespite Trump’s past association with the tournament, having a sitting president at the US Open is unusual.

While Winer turned down the initial offer to meet Musk, he says it was eventually agreed that the retired fighter would text the X boss for a fee of $1million instead. \n\nBut the businessman alleges Mayweather never contacted Musk and claims the screenshot he was sent as 'proof' was fake and fraudulent.\n\nThen, he says, a new deal was set up with the boxer’s representatives for a video call between Winer and Musk in exchange for two of his designer watches, valued at over $160,000, and an additional $20,000 in cash. \n\nCourt documents state that a person claiming to be Mayweather’s security guard came to Winer’s home in Miami and collected the watches and cash – but no video call ever took place. \n\nFloyd Mayweather has been accused of flogging bogus FaceTime calls with Elon Musk for $4m\n\nTequila tycoon Jayson Winer says his call with the world's richest man never happened\n\nFans fear for Mike Tyson's safety and claim he could DIE in Floyd Mayweather fight\n\nWiner was told that Mayweather and Musk had grown close after the former world champion boxer helped train Musk for a 'cage match' against Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg. While the battle of the tech titans never took place, Mayweather endorsed Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential race – to the delight of Musk. Mayweather later described Elon as 'my guy'. There is no suggestion Musk was aware of any of Mayweather’s promises. \n\nWiner, a digital artist who operates under the pseudonym 'Mr. Black,' claims that Mayweather and his friend Rechnitz preyed on his 'desperation' after his X account appeared to be 'shadow banned,' which meant his content was less visible. The ‘ban’ came as he attempted to sell 21,000 digital pieces of art in a seven-day auction and he claims he was unable to properly advertise the collection. \n\nReal estate developer Jona Rechnitz, 42, has been embroiled in multiple legal and criminal cases in recent years. He pleaded guilty in 2016 to conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, then served as a key cooperating witness to federal prosecutors in several high-profile corruption trials. \n\nThe convicted fraudster has been at Mayweather’s right hand through his break into New York real estate and the launch of his firm Vada Properties. When asked about Rechnitz’s brushes with the law, Mayweather said: 'Jona is my friend. Whatever his case was, he dealt with it like a man, and we’re going to continue to do business.' \n\nMayweather, Rechnitz and Musk have been contacted for comment. \n\nFloyd MayweatherTeslaElon Musk\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nFloyd Mayweather accused of fraud after 'flogging $4m FaceTime calls with Elon Musk that never happened'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Court papers filed in Miami claim Floyd - a former world champ like his father - boasted of his connection to the world's richest man and offered to set up online audiences with him.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-15072153/floyd-mayweather-elon-musk-fraud-jayson-winer-boxing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/06/13/101897767-0-image-m-14_1757161357036.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 21:59:48","author":"Daphne Barak,Editor","authors":["Daphne Barak","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.453},{"id":358107710,"title":"Prosecutors: California Woman Registered Her Dog to Vote, Mailed a Ballot in Its Name","text":"A California woman was arraigned on five felony counts this month for illegally registering her dog to vote in 2021 and 2022 elections — and then posting on Facebook a photo of her dog with an “I Voted” sticker and the canine’s mail-in ballot.\n\nOrange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has charged Laura Lee Yourex, 62, of Costa Mesa with “one felony count of perjury, one felony count of procuring or offering a false or forged document to be filed, two felony counts of casting a ballot when not entitled to vote, and one felony count of registering a non-existent person to vote,” according to a statement from the DA’s office.\n\nThe woman allegedly cast ballots in the dog’s name “Maya Jean Yourex” in the 2021 recall election against Gov. Gavin Newsom and the 2022 primary election. The dog’s vote was successfully counted in the 2021 recall but was rejected in the 2022 primary, according to prosecutors.\n\nIt has not been revealed how Maya herself voted.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently again repeated his persistent call for the abolishment of vote-by-mail ballots, calling them ripe with “fraud” and “cheating” in a post last month on Truth Social.\n\nYourex is scheduled to be arraigned on September 9 in a California court. She faces a maximum sentence of six years in state prison if convicted on all counts, prosecutors said.\n\nEven more ill-advised than registering the dog was that Yourex reportedly told an election official what she had done.\n\nAccording to the district attorney’s office:\n\nOn October 28, 2024, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office was contacted by the Orange County Registrar of Voter’s Office about a resident who self-reported that she had registered her dog to vote and had in fact cast a mail-in ballot she received addressed to her dog, Maya Jean Yourex, for the 2021 gubernatorial recall election and the 2022 primary election.\nAccording to the California Elections Code, in order to vote a person must be registered as a voter by filling out and submitting an Affidavit of Registration which includes the voter’s name, residence, mailing address, date of birth, political party preference, and a certification that the voter is a citizen of the United States. The affidavit must be signed under penalty of perjury.\n\nHowever, proof of residence or identification is not required for Californians to vote in state contests, while proof of residence and registration is requited for first time voters in a federal election.\n\n“As a result, the 2022 primary ballot cast in Maya Jean’s name was challenged and rejected,” prosecutors said.\n\nIn another post in October of 2024, Yourex showed a photo of Maya’s dog tag and a vote-by-mail ballot with the caption, “May is still getting her ballot” — even though the dog had previously passed away, prosecutors said.\n\nIt appears that even a dead dog, with the help of a vote-by-mail ballot, can cast a fraudulent vote in the State of California.\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the author of the New York Times best seller House of Secrets and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

I hope this tradition will never end. I hope people won’t be scared.”\n\n“We’re here, and we’re not leaving,” she added.\n\nRodriguez, of Little Village, was just one of thousands gathered to celebrate the parade, despite President Donald Trump saying federal agents “are going in” to Chicago in his mission to curb crime and make immigration arrests in Chicago. Legislative officials Sen. Dick Durbin, Rep. Mike Quigley and Rep. Jesús “Chuy” Garcia were in attendance at the parade.\n\n“It’s important to show up,” Garcia told the Sun-Times. “It’s important to live normally, and it’s important to invite all of our allies to be supportive of the community. This is the time for solidarity.”\n\nThe parade in Pilsen is just one of several events planned throughout the city for Mexican Independence Day, including the Little Village parade happening on Sept. 14. The two-day annual El Grito festival was recently postponed due to possible U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity.\n\nOrganizers said there were more people in attendance this year at the Pilsen parade, but didn’t provide exact estimates. In previous years, organizers said, around 3,000 people were in attendance.\n\nVicky Lugo, secretary of the United Merchants of Pilsen Chamber of Commerce, said many people are scared to show up to events like the parade due to ongoing immigration rhetoric and the threat of arrests.\n\n“But because we felt the support of the community… that is why we decided to continue on with the parade,” she told the Sun-Times. “We have to be a voice for a people without a voice.”\n\nDurbin said he’s seen a “genuine fear” in the city of increased immigration arrests. He said it was important to him to show up to the parade as tensions rise.\n\n“I’ve told people, be careful, but don’t be afraid,” he said. \n\nLugo said the parade went on with additional precautions, such as parade participants handing out whistles for people to sound if ICE was present or attempting to make arrests. No ICE agents were seen at the parade.\n\nAndrea Soria, 27, walked alongside her 6-year-old daughter, handing out whistles to parade attendees. She said she had a lot of mixed emotions since many community members were scared to participate in the parade.\n\n“A community that helps out is what makes stronger people,” Soria, a resident of Hermosa Park, said. “It feels good that we’re here to do this.”\n\n Some community members, like Cristina Vazquez, said they felt like the crowds were smaller.\n\n“A lot of people didn’t come out because they’re scared,” Vazquez, 40 and a Pilsen resident, said. “We have to show up and support.” \n\nRafael Yañiz walked with his three children and wife in the parade, waving the Mexican flag. Yañiz, who is Mexican and from Pilsen, said it’s sad to see how many people are scared of immigration enforcement around the city.\n\nBut, he said, people will continue to fight back.\n\n“We’re celebrating people who have immigrated,” he said. “The parade is a way for us to not forget where we’ve come from, and celebrate our culture. We’re going to keep fighting and keep our hope.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/09/06/pilsen-mexican-independence-day-parade-immigration","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7dbd0d3/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6222x4148+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F04%2F06%2F656834d94d72bf5d858923af6389%2Fpilse","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 21:46:15","author":"Selena Kuznikov","authors":["Selena Kuznikov"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":358088578,"title":"ICE launches Trump’s latest immigration crackdown in Boston, says report","text":"Immigration and Customs Enforcement has reportedly started detaining immigrants in Boston. \n\nThe ICE operation in Massachusetts is reportedly going to last several weeks, according to sources who spoke to the New York Times. \n\nOperation Patriot 2.0, as the initiative is reportedly called, kicked off just days before President Donald Trump is expected to send the military and federal agents to conduct immigration raids in Chicago. \n\nOne U.S. official speaking anonymously told the paper that Trump has plans for even more immigration raids beginning this month. \n\nThe Trump administration has made numerous claims that it will crack down on \"sanctuary cities,\" where local officials limit police assistance to federal immigration officials. \n\nTom Homan, Trump's border czar, said earlier this week that immigration enforcement would continue to ramp up in several so-called sanctuary cities. \n\nA source who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity reportedly said that ICE was targeting Boston specifically because of its policy to limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. \n\nICE is reportedly targeting immigrants who have previously been sent to jail but who were not turned over to immigration officials. \n\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu has been a vocal critic of Trump and his immigration policies. \n\n“I’m just stating that these tactics are the opposite of what makes communities safer, and no one’s buying that line, that ‘we’re just here to help make everyone safer,’” she said during a June interview on Boston public radio. “We know what safety looks like in the city of Boston.”\n\nWu previously issued a statement saying Boston is the safest major city in the U.S. and that Trump’s forces aren’t needed to maintain that safety. \n\n“Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law – city, state and federal,” Wu said in a statement. “We are the safest major city in the country because all of our community members know that they are part of how we keep the entire community safe. Stop attacking cities to hide your administration’s failures.”\n\nIn March, Wu, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, and New York Mayor Eric Adams were called to testify before Congress about their cities' immigration cooperation policies. During her time before Congress, she pleaded for lawmakers to pass comprehensive immigration reforms.\n\n“Please: Pass comprehensive immigration law that is consistent and compassionate,” Wu responded. “That will make our jobs possible and we would so appreciate that partnership.”\n\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration sued Boston over its policies limiting police cooperation with federal immigration officials, arguing that the policies violate federal law. \n\nTrump has launched similar lawsuits against New York, New Jersey, and Los Angeles. \n\n“The City of Boston and its Mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America – they explicitly enforce policies designed to undermine law enforcement and protect illegal aliens from justice.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “If Boston won’t protect its citizens from illegal alien crime, this Department of Justice will.”\n\nWu responded, saying that the city will defend its constitutional rights, according to Politico.\n\n“This is our City, and we will vigorously defend our laws and the constitutional rights of cities, which have been repeatedly upheld in courts across the country,” Wu said. “We will not yield.”","summary":"President Donald Trump is reportedly planning more immigration raids for September","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ice-trump-immigration-boston-b2821607.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/19/17/06/ICE-Detains-Immigrants-Inside-New-York-City-Courthouses-44t5xnhk.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3COugFFl-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-06 21:45:25","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":358107708,"title":"President Trump Signs EO Providing More 'Tools' To Free U.S. Hostages After Already Recovering 72 This Year","text":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday that gives the United States more “tools” to free American hostages – while his administration has already recovered 72 captives in the first eight months of his term.\n\nThe signing of what was Trump’s 201st executive order was captured in an Oval Office video.\n\nThe order creates a new mechanism to declare a country that participates in hostage taking practices a “State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention” and provides for “legal tools” to address the practice, according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nDuring the signing, Trump asked Adam Boehler, Special Envoy for Hostage Response, for an accounting of hostage retrievals so far.\n\nBoehler held up a graphic and said, “Mr. President, you’ve brought back 72 hostages since your term. If we compare that to President Biden, he’s gotten 20 taken. So, he’s 20 negative –“\n\n“Twenty taken,” Trump interjected. “They don’t take our people so often.”\n\n“And we paid nothing,” for hostages’ freedom, the president added, while “they paid six billion” in a hostage swap.\n\nPresident Joe Biden boasted near the end of his term that he had secured the release of more than 100 American hostages and then later dropped that number to 70. However, covering those comments, the National Review wrote, “As with many things Joe Biden boasts about, it is not clear where he’s getting his numbers.”\n\nTrump continued after his signing, “Once you pay money, then a lot of people start disappearing. They start grabbing reporters, too,” he added, looking at the journalists covering the signing. “They think the reporter is going to get a lot of money.”\n\n“And to me they would,” he said to some laughter from the press corp. He quickly added, “You would be, you’ll be well taken care of. I want to stress that. Otherwise, we have headlines. No, I’m not smiling about it.”\n\nWhite House Senior Director for Counterterrorism Sebastian Gorka explained some of the tactics detailed in the order.\n\n“With this EO you are signing today, you are drawing a line in the sand that U.S. citizens will not be used as bargaining chips,” he told the president. “And it provides your secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the same tool set to punish states who take our citizens wrongfully the same way that we can punish those who sponsor terrorists. This is very significant.”\n\nGorka later went on to say that aides had been told by families of American hostages that the Biden administration told them “not to talk about their missing loved ones – to be quiet, not to create any pressure” on President Biden and other White House aides.\n\nBy contrast, he said, “this administration has met with these families on a weekly basis.”\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the author of the New York Times best seller House of Secrets and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

This information comes from a source who spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, as the visit had not been officially announced.\n\nAny potential negative reactions to Trump’s presence will not be broadcast during ABC’s coverage of the match between top-seeded Jannik Sinner and second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz, due to standard policy by the U.S. Tennis Association.\n\n“We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions,” the organization said in a statement.\n\nPreviously a regular attendee at the U.S. Open, Trump often attended while residing in New York before his political career began. He now spends significant time at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida when not in Washington.\n\nThe use of Rolex’s suite draws attention, especially after the Trump administration recently enforced a 39% tariff on Swiss imports. This tariff is significant, being over twice the rate applied to EU goods imported into the U.S., and almost four times that of British goods, bringing up concerns about Switzerland’s trading position compared to its neighboring EU countries.\n\nThis appearance follows several other high-profile sports events Trump has attended, including the Super Bowl in New Orleans, Daytona 500 in Florida, UFC events in Miami and Newark, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia, and the FIFA Club World Cup finale in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nThe Trump Organization once controlled a suite at the U.S. Open which was adjacent to the television broadcasting booth in Arthur Ashe Stadium, but suspended it in 2017, during the first year of Trump’s first term.\n\nDespite Trump’s past association with the tournament, having a sitting president at the U.S. Open is unusual.

One day after PM hits the reshuffle panic button, key ministers already on the back foot","text":"Keir Starmer's panic reshuffle was already unravelling tonight with questions raised about his two highest profile appointments.\n\nJewish leaders complained that new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was a pro-Palestinian 'activist' who 'encouraged mob rule'.\n\nAnd just ten days before Donald Trump's State visit to the UK, outspoken criticisms of the US President by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also emerged in which she accused him of 'Islamophobia, xenophobia and hatred'.\n\nThe Prime Minister was forced into an emergency reshuffle on Friday after Angela Rayner's resignation for failing to pay up to £40,000 in tax owed on a luxury seaside flat.\n\nMany Labour MPs believe an alleged feud between Mrs Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves helped to accelerate the downfall of the former Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nTensions between the two first spilled into the public domain in May when a memo from Mrs Rayner to Ms Reeves – in which she put pressure on her to raise taxes, including by cutting stamp duty loopholes – was 'leaked'.\n\nSome Labour MPs believe the Treasury played a role in feeding the media frenzy which followed The Mail on Sunday's front page revelation that the Housing Secretary had bought an £800,000 flat in Hove.\n\nThe turning point came when it was revealed she had nominated the property as her main residence to avoid the higher second-home rate of stamp duty. The MPs believe that information came from inside Whitehall.\n\nTreasury sources however strongly denied that Ms Reeves or any of her allies had leaked sensitive information about Ms Rayner. \n\nFriction between the two Cabinet ministers came to a head in July when Ms Rayner helped force Sir Keir to back down on plans to cut welfare spending, which some of the MPs believe contributed to Ms Reeves crying in the Commons.\n\nMs Mahmood has taken part in a number of pro-Palestine marches in the past ten years and attended protests organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. \n\nShe joined the picket of a Sainsbury's store in Birmingham with other pro-Palestine activists in 2014, forcing it to close for five hours.\n\nShe and others from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement accused the store of stocking goods from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. \n\nMike Freer, then a Tory MP, said at the time: 'For any parliamentarian to encourage mob rule as a way of protesting is shameful.'\n\nMs Mahmood also did not take part in the vote that led to the banning of Palestine Action after activists damaged planes at RAF Brize Norton – a ban she will now have to defend in court after supporters were granted permission for a legal challenge. \n\nSources close to Ms Mahmood said she had been away from the Commons that day and would have voted for the ban.\n\nOne said: 'Shabana is a long-standing believer in a two state solution in Israel and Palestine. She supported the proscription of Palestine Action and will defend it in the courts as Home Secretary.'\n\nOther Labour figures rallied to Ms Mahmood's defence.\n\nMichael Rubin, director of Labour Friends of Israel, told the Mail on Sunday: 'Shabana stood with the Jewish community in the battle against antisemitism in the Labour Party.\n\n'She is an ally in the pursuit of a two-state solution and using outdated stories to mischaracterise what she believes is totally unfair.'\n\nA Jewish Labour MP said: 'She’s a long-standing ally of Jewish community, including when she was instrumental in building Labour Together, funded by several prominent Jewish donors.\n\n'She is a supporter of a safe and secure Israel alongside a sovereign Palestine.'\n\nBut Fiona Sharpe, of Labour Against Antisemitism, said: 'In the past she has aligned herself with causes and rhetoric troubling to many, particularly in the Jewish community. \n\n'We hope she will be meeting with the Jewish community... to clarify her views.'\n\nMs Cooper – then a backbencher – made her remarks about Mr Trump in 2017, when he was a year into his first term. \n\nShe claimed he had built his campaign for the presidency 'on vitriol and abuse', adding: 'The aggressive misogyny, the violent language towards Hillary Clinton, the Islamophobia, the xenophobia, the hatred. And he hasn't stopped since he got into the Oval Office.'\n\nTonight, a Foreign Office source said she will play 'a key role' during Mr Trump's visit, and as Home Secretary had 'worked closely with the Trump administration on a range of security and migration issues'. \n\nYesterday there were suggestions from local sources near Mrs Rayner's Ashton-under-Lyne constituency that she may quit the Commons, raising the prospect of Manchester mayor Andy Burnham standing in the by-election as a precursor to a leadership bid.\n\nBut even if she stays on in the Commons, Mrs Rayner's resignation as deputy leader has plunged the party into a bitter row over who replaces her in that role.\n\nOne MP said Sir Keir's inner circle had been desperate to 'remove Angie' to stop her taking over if he was forced out after Welsh Parliament and council elections next year. \n\nThere was also anger at Sir Keir for naming Justice Secretary David Lammy as deputy before waiting for members to choose.\n\nThere were predictions the contest would be between a 'leadership approved' candidate such as Mr Lammy or Ms Mahmood, and a 'rebel' elected by party members.\n\nFriends of ex-Cabinet Minister Louise Haigh did not rule out her going for the role. \n\nThere were also claims many new MPs would back Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, and it is expected that Left-wing MP Rosena Allin-Khan will stand.\n\nOne minister said whatever the final line-up of contenders 'there's going to be carnage'.","summary":"Jewish leaders have accused Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood of being a pro-Palestinian 'activist', while Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper accused Donald Trump of 'xenophobia and hatred'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15073103/Starmer-PM-reshuffle-key-ministers-foot.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/06/22/101906251-0-image-m-75_1757192684680.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 21:21:02","author":"Abul Taher,Brendan Carlin,Editor,Glen Owen","authors":["Abul Taher","Brendan Carlin","Editor","Glen Owen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":358086798,"title":"Katie Price displays extreme weight loss and a painful-looking eye injury as she arrives for the first night of her and Kerry Katona's tour in Lancashire","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Sep 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeaming Kate Middleton ties back her lighter locks as she cheers on England at the Women's Rugby World Cup\n\nBoris Johnson and Nigel Farage must unite to crush Labour for the good of the country, says Nadine Dorries\n\nStarmer sacks Rachel Reeves' sister as flailing PM frantically tries to relaunch his Government by axeing MORE ministers in desperate attempt to save face \n\nThe six causes of AUTISM, according to experts: from painkillers, a common condition and these 'toxins', how to escape the disorder that plagues so many\n\nPETER HITCHENS: We're not being told the truth about Ukraine.

Get Me Out Of Here!, the importance of family, their constant press attention and turning their lives around.'\nEach night will also feature singing, dancing and questions from the audience.\nKerry rose to fame in 1998 as a member of the girl group Atomic Kitten, while Katie gained recognition for her glamour modelling work.\nWhen Katie went on to tie the knot with Peter Andre in 2005, Kerry supported her pal on her big day as one of her bridesmaids.\nHowever, the pair then famously fell out in 2007 when Katie called Kerry a 'druggie' and accused her husband at the time, Mark Croft, of being 'a bully'.\nThey did not speak for months, until Kerry revealed that Katie had apologised for her comments and they have called a truce.\n\nThe star, who has raised concerns over her rapid weight loss, flaunted her enhanced assets in a grey tank top paired with matching jogging bottoms\n\nShe tied a black jumper around her waist and completed the look with fluffy leopard-print slippers\n\nKatie appeared on a mission as she arrived on location \n\nMeanwhile, Married at First Sight star JJ kept things casual, sporting a yellow top, black joggers, and chunky trainers as he followed closely behind\n\nAn Evening with Katie and Kerry is set to kick off in Ellesmere Port on Thursday, September 11 and conclude in Hull on October 22\nHowever, by February 2008 the two had reignited their feud once more, after Kerry commented on allegations made by Katie's former nanny about her employer's abilities as a mum.\nFollowing Katie and Peter's split in 2009, Kerry took her revenge by getting very cosy with the Mysterious Girl singer and going on playdates with their kids.\nWhile both insisted they were just pals, Kerry said he would be her 'ideal' boyfriend, after they joined the same management company.\nTheir closeness reportedly infuriated Katie, but later that year it was alleged that Kerry was hoping to reconcile their friendship.\nKerry and Mark eventually divorced in 2011, after a relationship marred by cheating allegations from both parties and claims he had an 'obsession with spending her money,' that contributed to her bankruptcy.\nKerry went on to admit to her drug abuse and crippling addiction, saying her marriage to Mark was 'about cocaine'.\nIn the wake of the split, Kerry buried the hatchet with Katie again, later admitting that her friend had been 'right' when she called her out.\n\nThe duo are set to share 'stories of their friendship, marriage and divorce, bankruptcy, I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the importance of family, their constant press attention and turning their lives around'\nThe pair became so close that Kerry invited Katie to be her bridesmaid at her wedding to her next husband George Kay, in September 2014.\nHowever, Katie pulled out of her official duties last minute because she couldn't get into the size eight bridesmaid dress, after giving birth to daughter Bunny six weeks earlier.\nDespite this the BFFs seemed to still be on track, appearing together in Instagram posts and at football matches, before making joint appearances on Loose Women, where Katie gushed that the pair had a 'true friendship'.\nIt was reported that the duo had become inseparable once again now they both lived in Sussex and had both suffered heartbreaks, with Katie's ex husband Kieran Hayler cheating on her and Kerry divorcing George.\nDespite the former foes becoming best pals once again, rumours of their war of words rising again still swirled.\nIn September 2019, Katie was reportedly 'furious' with her friend, after the Atomic Kitten star said Katie had 'crossed the line' with her latest cosmetic surgeries.\nAt the time Katie had displayed the results of one of her many plastic surgery sprees, after undergoing yet another face and eye lift, a breast reduction and a bum lift reversal in Turkey.\nIn an attempt to give her a more youthful-looking visage, surgeons made incisions by her ears, and photos after the procedure showed the star sporting painful looking wounds and stitching at the base of her ears.\n\nThe pair have taken part in a number of projects together, including playing the wicked stepsisters in Cinderella at Northwich Memorial Court in Cheshire last year (Pictured)\n\nKerry admitted she was worried when she saw gruesome images of her pal after going under the knife once again.\nBut The Sun reported that Katie felt as though she has been 'stabbed in the back' by her friend and sees her word as hypocritical as Kerry has also been open about having had multiple cosmetic surgeries in the past.\n\n Katie Price and Kerry Katona reveal they WANT their teenage daughters to sign up for Love Island \nHowever, Kerry denied that the pair had fallen out and said they were still 'great friends' while insisting that 'nothing could destroy their friendship'. The duo made sure to squash the feud rumours once and for all by filming a video together, poking fun at the speculation.\nThe two TV personalities have stayed close, with their daughters even forming a strong friendship of their own, which had been credited with keeping their mothers' bond going.\nKatie's daughter Princess, 18, and Kerry's daughter Heidi, 18, have been best friends since birth and have brought Kerry and Katie back together many times.\nWhile both enjoy having a laugh together, Katie and Kerry have also supported each other through tough times.\nIn July 2020, Kerry looked after Princess while Katie's son Harvey was in intensive care with a fever and breathing issues. And she was there for the star in August 2021, when Katie was hospitalised herself after being assaulted by her then fiancé Carl Woods.\nHowever, the pair still took subtle swipes at each other over the next few years, suggesting their bond wasn't always so steadfast.\n\nKerry rose to fame in 1998 as a member of the girl group Atomic Kitten, while Katie gained recognition for her glamour modelling work (Pictured in 2014)\nKerry complained that Katie wouldn't answer her calls and that she speaks to Princess more than her mum.\nIn February 2022, she even quipped that Katie only got in touch with her to get her advice about OnlyFans. The mother-of-five has raked in thousands on the adult subscription site, with Katie then following in her footsteps.\nThe singer also mocked her pal for all her public scandals and her infamous relationship with ex-husband Peter.\nSpeculation that the friendship had soured grew over recent years, until Katie shut down the rumours in February 2023. That same month, Kerry was said to have vowed to help Katie 'turn her life around' following her split from fiancé Carl.\nSo when Katie moved on with Married At First Sight star JJ Slater, Kerry didn't hesitate to give her seal of approval and voiced her joy that her friend had found love again.\nAfter finally declaring Katie was his 'girlfriend' following a whole host of of loved-up snaps on Instagram, JJ said it would have been 'ideal' if she had been the one he was matched with on the E4 reality show, as it would have 'saved a lot of time'.\nJJ SlaterMarried At First Sight Australia\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKatie Price displays extreme weight loss and a painful-looking eye injury as she arrives for the first night of her and Kerry Katona's tour in Lancashire\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 11\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

A senior UAE diplomat reportedly told Israeli media earlier this week that such a move would be a “red line” that would block Israel’s path to regional integration.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to discuss the issue at a major government meeting on Friday, according to local media. On Wednesday, UAE special envoy Lana Nusseibeh told the Times of Israel that annexation would “foreclose the idea of regional integration.”\n\n“For every Arab capital you talk to, the idea of regional integration is still a possibility, but annexation to satisfy some of the radical extremist elements in Israel is going to take that off the table,” she stated.\n\nThe UAE was the first Arab nation to normalize relations with Israel in over a quarter century under the Abraham Accords brokered by President Donald Trump during his first term in office.\n\nThe public warning from Abu Dhabi “came as a surprise,” an Israeli official told the Post, calling the situation “very unusual.”\n\nOn Thursday, the issue of annexation was removed from the Israeli ministerial meeting agenda, according to the newspaper.\n\nWashington has not taken a stance on the issue so far. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described potential annexation as “not a final thing” earlier this week, adding that he was “not going to opine on that.”\n\nThe West Bank returned to the spotlight earlier this year after a group of Israeli ministers urged that the territory be formally annexed. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claimed control could be asserted at any moment.\n\nIsrael seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and has been actively building settlements there – which is widely regarded as illegal by the international community. It was close to annexation in 2020 but dropped the idea in exchange for normalizing relations with the UAE and Bahrain.","summary":"West Jerusalem was taken by “surprise” by the admonition, the Washington Post has reported \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/624223-israel-west-bank-annexation-uae/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.09/article/68bca23085f5400f145e016b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 21:16:24","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":358086816,"title":"Chicago mayor calls Trump's federalization threats 'beneath the honor of our nation,' protests planned","text":"Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson on Saturday shot back at President Donald Trump's potential plans to temporarily federalize the city, calling on citizens to \"protect Chicago from Donald Trump.\" Johnson was responding to one of Trump's Truth Social posts, which said he \"loves the smell of deportations in the morning…\" and \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.\" A photo accompanying Trump's post showed him photoshopped into the city with fire and military helicopters overtaking the iconic Chicago skyline.

It is unclear why the organization decided to pick the 5 p.m. time frame, as opposed to a time when there is a larger time period of daylight. The coalition also posted an \"emergency protest plan,\" noting that if federal troops are deployed before 3 p.m., they will march near Congress Plaza at 5 p.m. that same day. If federal troops are deployed after 3 p.m., organizers said protesters will march at 5 p.m. the next day, according to the coalition's website. \"Our Coalition is prepared to hit the streets as soon as federal troops are deployed in our city,\" the coalition wrote on its site. \"We need the broadest unity possible to fight back against Trump’s escalating attacks against working and oppressed people. THE PEOPLE, UNITED, WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED!\" PRITZKER RAILS AGAINST 'UN-AMERICAN' POSSIBLE NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT BY TRUMP The conflict comes after Trump shared there would be a federal surge in the city, similar to the action in Washington, D.C., which could include National Guard troops and immigration authorities. Democratic leaders, including Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, have aggressively pushed back on the idea. Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez, a Democrat, told Fox News Channel’s \"Fox Report\" Sunday he thinks a federal surge would be \"helpful.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Even though we see our statistics are trending in the right direction, who would argue against making them trend even further, even lower, meaning less victims on the street,\" Lopez said. \"It’s absolutely asinine to me hear my Democratic colleagues say that we don’t want more help.\" CATA did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A photograph of the three leaders together made headlines around the world. It also seemingly irked U.S. President Donald Trump, prompting a series of sarcastic statements, even as the U.S. doubled down on 50% tariffs, sanctions on India’s import of Russian oil, and asking the European Union to do the same. By the end of the week, however, Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump appeared conciliatory.\n\nWhat happened in Tianjin?\n\nThe week saw a series of high-level summits seen as a projection of power by China, beginning with the 10-nation SCO summit in Tianjin, where several other leaders including from Turkey, Nepal, Maldives, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Indonesia and Malaysia were invited. From there, the action moved to Beijing, where Mr. Xi led Mr. Putin and dozens of other leaders including North Korea’s Kim Jong Un to a massive military parade commemorating 80 years since the end of the Second World War. The statements released included a number of counter-West elements, with Mr. Xi promoting a “Global Governance Initiative” and Mr. Modi pitching for a “civilisational dialogue” between SCO countries. The SCO declaration criticised “coercive, unilateral” economic measures, believed to be aimed at U.S. tariffs and European sanctions. During a photo-shoot for the SCO meet, Prime Minister Modi was seen purposefully leading President Putin down the red carpet to where President Xi was standing. A day before that, Mr. Xi and Mr. Modi held bilateral talks that had been cordial and possibly paved the way for the tri-leader photo.\n\n Editorial | ​Unmistakable shift: On SCO Summit and Indian foreign policy \n\nWhat happened at the bilateral meeting?\n\nThis was Mr. Modi’s first visit to China since 2018, and his first meeting with President Xi not in a third country since the military standoff and Galwan clashes in 2020, where both sides agreed to normalise ties. China appeared conciliatory, with Mr. Xi referring to India and China as “partners not rivals”, while India appears to have climbed down from an insistence that the LAC situation be normalised before a resumption of ties in other spheres. They agreed to let the border situation be discussed between Special Representatives Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. Besides revival of flights, visa facilitation and the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra, they agreed to resolve the trade issues between them.\n\nHow did the U.S. view the meetings?\n\nIn Washington, the photograph of the Tianjin “troika”, as well as subsequent images of the leaders of Russia, China, North Korea, Central Asian states, Iran, Pakistan and others, were seen as a challenge to the Western order, as well as proof that India had now “switched sides”.\n\nOn social media, Mr. Trump posted a photo from the SCO summit saying that it looked like the U.S. had “lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China”. The White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro, seen as one of the officials driving tariffs against India, said it was a “shame” that India as a democracy was getting closer to Russia and China. There were a number of other comments criticising the Modi government, including calling the Ukraine conflict “Modi’s war”, which the Ministry of External Affairs rejected as “inaccurate and misleading”. India will also participate in a BRICS online summit chaired by Brazil on September 8 to discuss a common response to the U.S. tariffs, which may send up more red flags.\n\nDelhi-Washington ties have been fraught over many issues, including visa, immigration and trade policies, and Mr. Trump’s repeated assertions of mediating the ceasefire in Operation Sindoor. But amid the tension, came yet another turnaround. Mr. Trump on Friday said that India and the U.S. have a “special relationship” and that he would “always be great friends with PM Modi”. Mr. Modi, who had not responded to any of the statements thus far, welcomed them and said he shared Mr. Trump’s “positive assessment” of the partnership.\n\nWhat lies ahead?\n\nWhile many foreign policy observers may have faced whiplash from the perception that Indian policy had shifted from the “west to the east” and possibly back to the west, the shifts are less perceptible if you consider India’s decades-old policy of strategic autonomy and balance. The visit to China for the SCO had been expected for months, after the Xi-Modi meeting in Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in October 2024 had restarted ties. While India had put SCO on the backburner for the past two years and PM Modi skipped the Summit in Astana last year, the visit to China was considered important. In that sense, the Modi-Xi meeting was simply an attempt to normalise ties after years of serious tensions, and the Modi-Xi-Putin chat, would have been more significant if followed by a revival of formal Russia-India-China talks.\n\nIndia-U.S. relations have no doubt been impacted by months of tensions on a range of issues, but official exchanges and military exercises have not stopped. Much will depend on whether the U.S. and India can find a compromise over demands to cancel Russian oil imports or for India to open its agricultural and dairy sectors, and whether the U.S. reconsiders its 50% tariff on India. With Mr. Jaishankar headed to the U.S. for the UN General Assembly this month, talks about scheduling the Quad summit, where Mr. Trump is due to visit India later this year, will be closely watched.","summary":"How productive was the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit?
