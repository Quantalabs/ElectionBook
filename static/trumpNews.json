The talks came amid heightened concerns about North Korea’s growing military partnership with Russia and Pyongyang’s stepped-up cadence of ballistic missile tests.\n\nBiden celebrated the partnership between Japan and South Korea, two countries that have historical enmity but under Biden’s presidency are now tightening security and economic ties as their corner of the world becomes more complicated.\n\nBiden noted that it would be his last meeting with them but that the trilateral partnership should be preserved for years to come.\n\n“I’m proud of how far we’ve come,” Biden said. “Whatever the issue, we’ve taken it on together.”\n\nIt comes as North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized earlier this year.\n\n“As we can see from the recent deployment of DPRK troops to Russia, the challenging security environment within and outside the region once again reminds us the importance of our trilateral cooperation,” Yoon said, using the initials for North Korea’s formal name and speaking through a translator.\n\nIshiba also emphasized the importance of the three nations acting as a bulwark against North Korea and pointed to recent military exercises between the three nations as a sign of cooperation.\n\nA three-day exercise in June was geared toward improving joint ballistic missile defense, anti-submarine warfare, surveillance and other skills and capabilities and to help the three countries improve their ability to share missile warnings — increasingly important as North Korea tests ever-more sophisticated systems.\n\n“I look forward to furthering our partnership in response against North Korea and in many other areas,” Ishiba said through a translator.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered a series of ballistic missile tests in the lead-up to this month’s U.S. election and is claiming progress on efforts to build capability to strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nWhite House officials are concerned that Pyongyang could be dialed up for more provocative action ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration and the early days of his administration.\n\n“I do not think we can count on a period of quiet with the DPRK,” said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. “The transitions have historically been time periods when the DPRK has taken provocative actions both before and after the transition from one president to a new president.”\n\nBiden, Yoon, and Ishiba’s conversation largely focused on the growing threat caused by North Korea and Russia’s cooperation, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations. The official said Trump and how the change in administration might affect the trilateral relationship did not come up.\n\nBiden is on a six-day visit to Latin America for the final major international summits of his presidency, following up APEC with a gathering in Brazil of leaders from the Group of 20 top economies. He’s likely to face questions from world leaders about the incoming administration as they turn their attention to what Donald Trump’s return to the White House will mean for them.\n\nBiden took part in an informal meeting with other APEC leaders and met with Peru President Dina Boluarte. Biden thanked her for Peru’s efforts to counter drug trafficking and noted the $65 million the U.S. is providing her country over the next five years to assist in that effort, including nine Blackhawk helicopters.\n\nBiden also met one-on-one with Ishiba — their first in-person since the Japanese prime minister took office on Oct. 1 — ahead of the three-country meeting focused on North Korea-Russia ties.\n\nThe introduction of North Korean troops to the Russia-Ukraine conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict.\n\nUp to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments.\n\nU.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.\n\nThe talks between the U.S., South Korea and Japan follow up on a partnership launched at a historic 2023 meeting at the U.S. presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland.\n\nBiden nudged Japan and South Korea to put aside years of historic animosity and strengthen economic and security ties as they confront the threat from North Korea and increasing military assertiveness by China in the Pacific.\n\nThe three countries signed a pledge agreeing to consult, share information and align their messaging with each other in the face of a threat or crisis.\n\nSullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure the three-country cooperation is “an enduring feature of American policy.” He expects it would continue under Trump, noting its bipartisan support, but acknowledged it was up to the incoming president’s team.\n\nBoth Yoon and Ishiba already have reached out to Trump and are aiming to keep their countries’ relationships with the incoming administration on steady footing amid the heightened tensions.\n\nJust hours before Election Day in the U.S., North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea.\n\nThose launches came days after Kim supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to be able to reach the U.S. mainland. In response, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force.\n\nSantana reported from Washington.","summary":"Biden noted that it would be his last meeting with the two countries but that the trilateral partnership should be preserved for years to come.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/11/15/biden-praises-cooperation-at-meeting-with-south-korean-japanese-leaders-amid-north-korea-worries/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Peru_APEC_Summit_51505_5e51c8.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 01:07:26","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.273},{"id":265126654,"title":"Davina McCall's friends Amanda Holden, Holly Willoughby and Alan Carr lead the well wishes after her partner Michael Douglas revealed she was out of her brain tumour surgery","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Nov 16th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump unveils 'phenomenal' 27-year-old mum Karoline Leavitt as his White House press secretary after rampant speculation\n\nChancellor is accused of being 'economical' with her CV: Rachel Reeves DELETES her experience as an 'economist' from LinkedIn and replaces it to say she worked in 'retail banking'\n\nOutlandish Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul 'fight script is LEAKED' - but fans react with disbelief\n\nThought police in Keir Starmer's Britain 'are like Soviet Union', warns Boris Johnson: Ex-PM attacks growing number of social media 'hate incident' probes as threat to free speech\n\nWhy real-life Baby Reindeer stalker is convinced she'll win £95m in bombshell lawsuit... as lawyer reveals Richard Gadd's 'nauseating' actions and Netflix's 'risky game'\n\nANDREW NEIL: Starmer wants to tell us what to eat, what to drive and how to heat our homes.

Michael xx'\nDavina explained that she received the diagnosis by chance after booking in for a 'health scan'.\nDavina said in a video: 'I was offered a health scan which I thought I was going to ace but it turned out I had benign brain tumour which is very rare, three in a million.\n'I slightly put my head in the sand for a while, I saw a few neurosurgeons, had quite a lot of opinions and realised I needed to take it out.\n\nThe TV presenter, 57, shared the news in an Instagram post on Friday that she had a 'very rare' colloid cyst that affects only three in a million people\n\nSharing a health update following her surgery, Michael said that the operation was 'text book' and she was grateful for everyone's support\n\nA worried Amanda, 53, wrote: 'Such a relief, I've been thinking about her all day and all of you x'\n\n'It's quite big, it's 14mm wide and it needs to come out because if it grows it would be bad. I'm having it removed.'\nShe added: 'Say a prayer for me. I'm in good spirits.'\nDavina explained that while she was at no immediate risk, doctors were concerned that the tumour could grow larger and cause complications.\nShe revealed she had been feeling 'up and down' and explained she would be in hospital for at least nine days before coming home.\nWhile she has known of the diagnosis for a few months, Davina hasn't allowed it to slow her down and she was pictured last week enjoying a night out at Garnier's celebration hair mask party.\nA colloid cyst is a slow-growing tumour typically found near the center of the brain. The benign growth contains gelatinous material.\nThey are often asymptomatic and found incidentally during imaging tests.\nIf symptoms do occur as the tumour grows, they are commonly reported to include headaches that are most severe in the morning upon waking, nausea and blurry vision, with other key signs including vertigo and double vision.\nMost patients present with headaches, although other symptoms including vertigo, memory problems and double vision can occur.\nIf large enough, a colloid cyst obstructs the movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain which leads to a high risk of sudden death.\nDavina's partner Michael Douglas uploaded the video for her, captioning the post: 'Hey everyone. Michael here. She will be “off grid” for a bit while she recovers from this brain operation.\n'She is in great shape and in very good hands. I’ll do the odd update from her account here for anyone interested.\n\nHe wrote: 'Hey all, Davina is out of surgery and according to the surgeon it was textbook! 'She's currently recovering in ICU as a precaution, as you can imagine she's utterly exhausted'\n\nWhile she has known of the diagnosis for a few months, Davina hasn't allowed it to slow her down and she was pictured last week enjoying a night out at a Garnier party\n'I’m sure she’ll read all the comments when she’s able to so feel free to send love ❤️ . The support of people is amazingly powerful. Have a great day everyone. Michael xxx'.\nFollowing her announcement, celebrities including Amanda Holden, Pussycat Dolls singer Ashley Roberts and Olympic heptathlon gold medallist Dame Denise Lewis reached out to the presenter.\nAmanda said: 'Sending so much love,' while former Big Brother winner Kate Lawler wrote: 'I'm in awe of your positivity Davina. Wishing you all the love and healing prayers post surgery. See you soon.'\nDavina and Michael first met when he styled her hair during her time presenting Big Brother, which she worked on from 2000 until 2010.\nThey turned their friendship into romance during the summer of 2019.\nA source told The Sun at the time: 'The romance blossomed from a place of friendship and trust and the couple are just enjoying each other’s company and having a laugh.'\n'Davina especially likes Michael’s sense of humour and kind nature. It’s fairly early days but Davina’s mates think Michael is a good guy.\n'Davina feels ready to move on now after her marriage split and is really happy.'\nThe couple confirmed in January 2023 they had moved in together just before Christmas.\nThe first of their traditions as a pair living together was watching the King's Speech on Christmas Day afternoon.\n\nDavina is passionate about health and fitness and is in the shape of her life after devoting herself to ritualistic daily workouts\nSpeaking on their podcast Making The Cut , Davina admitted : 'I am quite enjoying as a new couple doing new things, because we are newly living together.\n'It's quite nice making new traditions because we did that before Christmas, we sat down together and talked about it: ''Ok, blank space, what shall we make tradition from now on?''\nBut earlier this year, Davina said the pair had no plans to tie the knot, adding that they are both 'happy' as they are.\nExplaining that they were both keen to not 'rock the boat', Davina said that getting hitched was 'off the table'.\n'We’re not interested. I knew Michael for so many years [before we got together] that there were no questions to ask like that. I know him. It was easy', she said.\nDavina confirmed she her separation from husband Matthew Robertson in November 2017, when she told MailOnline: 'I am very sad to say that Matthew and I have separated.\n'Our amazing children are our number one priority, above everything else so therefore we ask for as much space and respect from the media as possible while our family goes through this difficult time.'\nThe former couple have three children together, Holly, 22, Tilly, 20, and 17-year-old son Chester.\nThey married at a lavish ceremony at Eastnor Castle, in Hertfordshire, in 2000.\nDavina has battled with several health issues including drug addiction.\nShe revealed in December 2023 she had avoided alcohol for 30 years, and gave up sugar completely when her sister Caroline died of lung cancer in August 2012, while admitting to having become more 'gentle' with herself in recent years.\nShe told Good Housekeeping: 'I'm quite often all or nothing as a person. I haven't had a drink in 33 years. I've spent my life being quite rigid with myself.'\nBut her best friend Sarah Hiscox had to lock her in a car to call out her drug use, which lead to her getting clean, she said.\n\nThe former Big Brother host has previously given an insight into her health and fitness regime as she spoke about how exercise is important for her mental health \n\nDavina said in 2019 that she is too busy with her responsibility as a working mum to devote her life to the gym, despite concerns from fans about her 'addiction' to exercise\nSarah pretended to drive her to Santana before taking the opportunity to call out her friend's drug problem, which proved to be the turning point for Davina.\nThe former Big Brother host is also known for being a fitness fanatic, and says she exercises for 'three or four times a week for a minimum of half an hour, but no more than 40 minutes because I don't have time'.\nHer lean physique, frequently displayed on Instagram, had previously sparked concern among fans, with many claiming she looks emaciated, ill and underfed as a result of her dedication to personal fitness.\nBut Davina has dismissed suggestions that she is addicted to the gym, telling Health and Wellbeing in 2019 that she was too busy as a working mother to dedicate her life to exercising.\n'Because of my busy schedule, the most I can do is three to four times a week, but the minute I retire or the kids leave home or whatever, I’d love to work out daily. I don’t see what’s wrong with it', she said.\n'I’d love to do an hour every day, whether it be a walk, or a cycle, or a swim – just to keep moving.'\nAlan CarrMichael DouglasDavina McCall\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavina McCall's friends Amanda Holden, Holly Willoughby and Alan Carr lead the well wishes after her partner Michael Douglas revealed she was out of her brain tumour surgery\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nAmanda Holden, Holly Willoughby Rylan and Alan Carr send their love to Davina McCall after discovering she is out of surgery as her partner Michael Douglas shares health update\n\nPaddy McGuinness left speechless as Sir Chris Hoy reveals comedian raised jaw-dropping amount during 300-mile charity bike ride\n\nBig Brother fans claim the show's final was 'FIXED' as show makes history with winner of 2024 series revealed\n\nEXCLUSIVEWhy real-life Baby Reindeer stalker is convinced she'll win £95m in bombshell lawsuit... \n\nRebekah Vardy BLASTS rival Coleen Rooney in furious rant as she says she hopes she is forced to 'eat penis or humble pie' in the I'm A Celeb jungle\n\nChristine McGuinness steps out with 'well done daddy' balloons for ex-husband Paddy after he complete brutal 300 mile charity cycle \n\nDavina McCall is out of surgery and recovering in ICU: Michael Douglas shares health update after TV presenter underwent operation for tumour \n\nEXCLUSIVEMy drama-filled call with Rebekah Vardy that blew up her row with Coleen Rooney - and how they'll NEVER forgive each other \n\nKylie Jenner teams up with fellow 'nepo baby' Amelia Gray Hamlin for sexy new Khy campaign\n\nApp-tastic!

He says President-elect Donald Trump's threat to increase tariffs will force him to charge more.His company's Yedi Evolution air fryer is currently priced at $130, Djavaheri said. He estimates that Trump's proposed tariffs would raise that price to about $200. Yedi's two-quart air fryer currently costs between $30 and $40. Trump's tariffs could raise that to almost $100.Trump campaigned on implementing a blanket tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports, along with an additional 60% or more on goods from China.\"It would decimate our business, but not only our business,\" Djavaheri said. \"It would decimate all small businesses that rely on importing.\"Djavaheri says it is not Chinese companies that pay the tariffs, it is his own business.\"We're getting the bill, the bill comes straight to us from the government,\" Djavaheri said.Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, says Trump's tariffs could also be a negotiating tactic.\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck said. \"…It's important for the American people to understand that the people who pay tariffs are U.S. importers. Not China, not foreign governments, not foreign companies. That's going to come down to your wallet.\"An August study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics indicated that Trump's proposed tariffs could cost middle-income households more than $2,600 a year.In 2018, when Trump slapped tariffs on imported washing machines, prices jumped almost $100. But foreign appliance makers also moved some production to the U.S., and a year later they had created 1,800 new jobs.Other countries, however, retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports, which led to job losses.According to Djavaheri, most of Yedi's products cannot at the moment be manufactured in the U.S.\"There's no factory in America,\" Djavaheri said. \"A factory that could potentially produce hundreds of thousands of air fryers in one year, same quality, there's no where in the world other than the Chinese.\"Djavaheri's advice? If you're considering a purchase, make it before the potential tariffs kick in.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on implementing a blanket tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports, along with an additional 60% or more on goods from China.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariff-proposals-business-owners-worried-about-impact/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/16/92063e75-40b9-477b-bc13-2f5e5a719dfe/thumbnail/1200x630/7ed1db974075c2ef2366fee8d8d6c1f3/1731718378244.png?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3341794_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-11-16 01:03:04","author":"Carter Evans","authors":["Carter Evans"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":265126034,"title":"Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson LIVE: UK start time, scorecard and round-by-round updates as  YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul, 27, faces 'Iron Mike', 58, in controversial Netflix clash","text":"Outlandish Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul 'fight script is LEAKED' ahead of Netflix showdown and predicts a KNOCKOUT - but fans react with disbelief\n\nJake Paul vs Mike Tyson: UK start time, undercard and where to watch as 'Iron Mike' gears up to face 'The Problem Child' who is 31-years his junior in blockbuster clash\n\nWatch snooker star miss countless easy shots as footage emerges of match he fixed after he was hit with FIVE-YEAR ban and hefty fine\n\nFrench giants are 'provisionally RELEGATED from Ligue 1 and banned from signing players' after announcing debt of £422MILLION - with 'all of their stars on sale' amid latest crisis after Bordeaux bankruptcy\n\nRevealed: Reason Mike Tyson slapped Jake Paul at weigh-in - as legendary boxer's friend slams YouTuber as a 'lurching animal'\n\nInside Saudi Arabia's space-age $1BILLION 'cliffhanger' stadium for the 2034 World Cup - designed by Man United's architects with its own lake, a slide-away stand and preparing to host Cristiano Ronaldo's team\n\nHarry Kane WAS dropped but does anyone seriously believe Thomas Tuchel will try to win the World Cup without him?

It was Argentina, long considered one of Latin America’s most socially progressive countries.\n\nUnleashing an avalanche of criticism across the political spectrum on Friday, the ‘no’ vote by Buenos Aires marked the latest in a series of dramatic foreign policy shifts under President Javier Milei, the most right-wing leader in Argentina’s 41 years of democracy.\n\nIt comes just days after Milei, an outspoken climate change skeptic, abruptly called Argentina’s negotiators home from the U.N. climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, stirring concerns that the radical libertarian might seek to emulate U.S. President Donald Trump in withdrawing Argentina entirely from the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nNot only has Milei transformed Argentine foreign policy in line with the United States and Israel, his government has also taken fringe positions on the global stage that fly in the face of the liberal, rules-based international order.\n\nArgentina’s vote at the U.N. Thursday recalled a similar clash last month when all Group of 20 nations, including Saudi Arabia, agreed to adopt language about gender equality in a joint statement — except Argentina.\n\n“Argentina votes alone, against the rest of humanity,” the conservative party of former President Mauricio Macri, an ally of Milei’s government, wrote on social media platform X Friday.\n\nNearly a year into his presidency, the former Argentine TV pundit remains erratic and idiosyncratic in the global spotlight, in striking similarity to Trump. Milei became the first foreign leader since the U.S. election to meet Trump, albeit informally, late Thursday during an annual gala for the right-wing America First Policy Institute at the president-elect’s private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\n\nThe Argentine presidency Friday proudly released a stream of photos from the opulent event featuring Milei in a sharp suit beaming alongside Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, with whom Milei has also publicly cultivated a bromance over their shared contempt for “wokeness,” gender issues and socialism.\n\nIn November 2023, an angry Argentine electorate fed up with sky-high inflation, debt defaults and bank runs handed the outsider a sweeping mandate to carry out an overhaul of Argentina’s crisis-stricken economy.\n\nBut along with Milei’s libertarian crusade has come a series of cultural battles — both at home, where the president eliminated Argentina’s women’s and environment ministries and scrapped the national anti-discrimination institute, as well as abroad, where Milei has sought to fashion himself as a far-right icon.\n\n“By fighting imaginary cultural battles we end up isolated from the world,” said Senator Martín Lousteau, president of the centrist Unión Cívica Radical party.\n\nLousteau denounced Argentina’s U.N. vote opposing an end to gender violence as a “disgrace.” Top official Guillermo Francos defended the decision, saying “neither commitments nor treaties will solve the issue of gender violence.”\n\nTensions over Milei’s culture war has escalated this month. When Argentina voted at the U.N. in favor of ending the American economic embargo against Cuba on Oct. 30, Milei fired then-Foreign Minister Diana Mondino and swiftly replaced her with wealthy businessman Gerardo Werthein, who had been Buenos Aires’ ambassador to the U.S.\n\nThis weekend, Milei and Werthein plan to meet Trump again at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe dismissal of Mondino — a polished political performer who mended relations with allies strained by Milei’s frequent profanity-laden attacks — sent shockwaves through Argentina’s diplomatic ranks.\n\nMilei vowed to purge his foreign ministry of so-called “traitors to the country” who have strayed from his radical stance, which includes rejecting the “Pact for the Future” adopted by the U.N. in September that promotes climate action, female empowerment and the regulation of artificial intelligence.\n\nLocal media has reported the forced resignations of at least seven veteran diplomats in recent weeks who were seen as resistant to the government’s reversal of its support for the collective philosophy of the U.N.

I never would have agreed to that,” Poilievre said.\n\nHe added he would work to end tariffs on softwood lumber and secure an exemption to “Buy American” policies.\n\n“But more importantly, I’ll fight fire with fire,” he said, noting Canada has seen large levels of investments falling and moving to the U.S. in recent years. “I want our money back.”\n\nThe Conservative leader said his long-stated plan to eliminate the consumer carbon price, as well as cuts to income tax and taxes on foreign investments, will end the flow of investment and industry from Canada to the U.S.\n\n“Trump wants our jobs, Trudeau wants to help them take them,” he said. “When I’m prime minister, that ends.”\n\nTrump has also promised reductions on taxes and regulations to drive investment into the U.S. to counter China, who he said will face 60-per cent tariffs on imported goods.\n\nThe Liberal government has expressed confidence that the first Trump administration, which saw tit-for-tat tariffs on steel and aluminum, proved Canada should be exempt from such tariffs. It has also said Canada’s alignment with the U.S. on Chinese auto industry tariffs puts Ottawa on “firm” ground for scheduled free trade talks in 2026.\n\nBut Poilievre said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government should have secured an exemption from U.S. tariffs in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement that replaced NAFTA during Trump’s first term — including on softwood lumber.\n\nThe Biden administration this year significantly increased duties on softwood lumber from Canada, to 14.54 per cent from 8.05 per cent.\n\nThe increase has received backlash from government and industry in British Columbia, where the forestry sector has struggled for years under the high export costs.\n\nPoilievre said he would end those duties but wouldn’t say how.\n\n“Trump wants what’s best for American workers, I want what’s best for Canadian workers,” he said.\n\n“We’re not going to be suckers anymore … Trump would love nothing more to keep than keep Trudeau in power because he can walk all over him and he can take his money.”\n\nHe added Trump will likely take advantage of the planned increase to the consumer carbon price next April by attracting more businesses and workers to come to the U.S.\n\nThe government has been pressed by opposition parties and provinces on its plan for border security and enforcement of people looking to enter Canada irregularly from the U.S. amid a Trump-led immigration crackdown, including deportations.\n\nThe Liberals say agencies have been preparing for such a scenario for months and that government is prepared to provide additional resources if necessary.\n\nPoilievre said he wants to see more front-line officers at the Canadian border as well as legislative changes “if necessary to prevent people from abusing our system.”\n\nBut he pointed the finger squarely at Trudeau, rather than Trump, for issues at the border.\n\n“Let’s not get distracted,” Poilievre said. “The problems we have in immigration happened under Justin Trudeau before this election. I mean, President Trump has not even taken office yet.”\n\nTrudeau announced last month Canada would slash the number of permanent residents accepted per year in a bid to slow population growth and address housing and social service shortages that have been blamed on immigration.\n\nThe Customs and Immigration Union told Global News in an emailed statement that staffing shortages at the Canada Border Services Agency have been “a long-standing issue,” and estimates the agency would need an additional 2,000 to 3,000 officers just to meet its current operational needs.\n\nWhen pressed by Johal on the need to address an expected surge of migrants fleeing Trump’s deportation plan, Poilievre dismissed the notion that it would overwhelm the refugee system.\n\n“It’s not possible to be a refugee from the United States,” he said. “We vacation there. It’s not a dictatorship. It’s not a dangerous country that you need to flee from.”\n\nTrump’s newly-named “border czar,” Tom Homan, said this week that the Canada-U.S. border represented “an extreme national security vulnerability” and vowed to address it when he’s in the White House.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Walz, who Trump chose as his national security adviser, has openly cheered on Poilievre to win the next election against Trudeau, which is currently set for no later than next October.","summary":"The Conservative leader said he will work to bring foreign investment and industry back to Canada with policies similar to Trump's vows to slash taxes and regulations.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10872407/poilievre-trump-tariffs-immigration-us-canada/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241028091048-20241028091036-7cde61ac01b34f0e850661337154c5aab657825e3e7f1c44839081cc1d03af5c.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:45:41","author":"Sean Boynton","authors":["Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":265126220,"title":"Trump names Karoline Leavitt as youngest ever White House press secretary","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - \n\n\r\n U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named Karoline Leavitt, his campaign press secretary, to serve as his White House press secretary.\n\n\r\n Leavitt, 27, currently a spokesperson for Trump's transition, would be the youngest White House press secretary in history.

Developing countries need at least $1 trillion annually by the end of the decade to cope with climate change, economists told the U.N. talks.\n\nMany countries have said that money is essential to their setting ambitious climate goals ahead of next year’s COP30 in Brazil.\n\nBut reaching a deal could be tough at this year’s summit, where the mood has been soured by public disagreements and pessimism about shifts in global politics.\n\nDonald Trump’s presidential election win has cast the United States’ future role in climate talks into doubt, and tension between developed and developing nations has bubbled to the surface on the main stages and in negotiating rooms.\n\nThe previous annual finance goal of $100 billion expires this year. But wealthy countries only met the pledge in full starting in 2022.\n\nEarly Thursday, a report from the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance said the target annual figure would need to rise to at least $1.3 trillion a year by 2035 if countries fail to act now.\n\nBehind the scenes, negotiators are working on draft texts, but early stage documents published by the U.N. climate body show views around the table still diverge widely.\n\nMany Western governments arrived in Baku reluctant to pledge big sums.\n\nThe likely withdrawal of the United States from any future funding deal will raise pressure on delegates to find other ways to secure the needed funds.\n\nAmong them are the world’s multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, funded by the richer countries and in the process of being reformed so they can lend more.\n\nTen of the largest have said they would plan to increase their climate finance by roughly 60% to $120 billion a year by 2030, with at least an extra $65 billion from the private sector.\n\nOn Thursday Zakir Nuriyev, head of the Association of Banks of Azerbaijan, said the country’s 22 banks would commit nearly $1.2 billion to finance projects that help Azerbaijan transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nSo far the conference – which many global leaders decided to skip altogether – has been marked more by division than unity.\n\nArgentina’s abrupt departure on Thursday followed an order from Buenos Aires.\n\nThe country’s presidential spokesperson said the move would allow Gerardo Werthein, the new foreign affairs minister, to “revaluate the situation, reflect on the position”.\n\nThe minister is “withdrawing the delegation in virtue of a whole reform the minister is going to do. There’s not much else to say,” the spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, told a news conference in Buenos Aires.\n\nArgentina’s President Javier Milei, who previously has called global warming a hoax, was due this week to meet Trump, also a climate change denier.\n\nObservers criticised the withdrawal by Argentina’s right-wing government, and said it could hurt the country’s hopes of raising future climate cash.\n\nAzerbaijan’s COP29 Presidency described it as a matter between Argentina and the United Nations.\n\nA negotiator from a developed country said they had seen no signs so far that any other countries would follow Argentina’s lead and walk out.\n\nA day earlier, French climate minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher cancelled her trip to COP29 after Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev accused France of “crimes” in its overseas territories in the Caribbean.\n\nFrance and Azerbaijan have long had tense relations because of Paris’ support of Azerbaijan’s rival Armenia. This year, Paris accused Baku of meddling and abetting violent unrest in New Caledonia.\n\nThat followed Aliyev’s opening speech at the conference that accused the United States and EU of hypocrisy for lecturing countries on climate change while remaining major consumers and producers of fossil fuels.","summary":"Countries at the COP29 summit tried to make progress on how to raise up to $1 trillion in climate finance for the world&#8217;s most vulnerable, as political tensions overshadowed the talks and Argentina on Thursday pulled its delegation from Baku.

Anyone with a cell phone or a computer screen knows this. The lust for power and wealth among the Elon Musk and Pay-Pal Mafia types are now as boundless as their mind-controlling algorithms are powerful. They will control Trump, not vice versa.\n\nSecond, most congressional Republicans have abandoned ethical norms. Few Republican defenders of constitutional priorities remain, those like Liz Cheney, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and Susan Collins. The others voted in 2021 not to convict Trump and allowed him to remain eligible for reelection. The Republicans who rid us of Nixon in 1974 would be disgusted.\n\nRamsay Thomas\n\nBiden deserved better\nthan Trump victory\n\nYes, I too am angry and dreading the next four years (at least), but I found myself thinking of what Joe Biden must be feeling.\n\nImagine if you had spent more than four years working to better the lives of the people you work for, building a more just society, contributing to the health of your country, and cooperating with our international partners, only to have the people turn on you and put all that at risk of the stroke of a pen by the most repugnant president we have ever been saddled with.\n\nI marvel at the strength he is showing in orchestrating a smooth transition for the next administration.

The warnings that went unheeded by Americans are being played out. He has been handed unlimited power backed by a cowardly Republican Party and a Supreme Court that refuse to hold him accountable. Trump is not appointing people who will protect Americans but himself.\n\nLike remarrying an abusive ex-spouse, we ignored his dark side. This time it won’t end in divorce, it’ll end in the morgue with the death of democracy, rule of law and American standing in the world.

However, their relationship was marred by infidelity. Fast forward to the present as allegations mount against Diddy's alleged misdeeds, his relationships with both peers and exes have come under intense scrutiny. Recent surfacing of pictures of the couple fighting at a party on a night a 13-year-old was allegedly abused, has dragged Lopez into the scandal. Lopez has stayed quiet on the matter and the federal charges against Diddy, fueling suspicion. In light of the sane, recently a former staffer from Lopez’s past stepped forward to defend her.\n\nAs reported by Fandom Wire, Thea de Sousa, an ex-staffer, said, \"If you knew Jennifer Lopez, if you ever worked with her like I did, or if you were close with people who are like family to her like I am, you would know she did not have any idea about Diddy.\" De Sousa, who worked with Lopez in the 2002 movie Maid in Manhattan, added, \"She barely drinks, she is not a partier, she isn’t a good time girl, she is a workaholic who uplifts a woman and who was charmed by him for a brief time in her life. [Lopez] does not deserve to be conflated with [Combs’] shocking and criminal misdeeds.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, billionaire Elon Musk recently questioned Lopez's trustworthiness when she expressed opposition to Donald Trump's reelection and supported Vice President and Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris. Alongside fellow Trump supporter Joe Rogan, Musk brought up Lopez's 1999–2001 relationship with Combs during a podcast segment. As reported by the New York Post, he said, “J. Lo was like his ex-girlfriend and it’s like now deciding she is like warning people against Trump. How many people did she warn against Diddy, right? Oh zero, okay. Maybe we shouldn’t trust her opinion.”\n\nRecently when ambushed by paparazzi during a film screening for her film Unstoppable, Lopez ignored a question about Diddy and abruptly left the venue with her bodyguard, as reported by Marca. In the past, Lopez reflected on her whirlwind romance with Diddy and described it as stormy and emotionally draining. In another interview, she revealed that Combs repeatedly asked for a divorce, even though the two were never married, as reported by The Mirror. Meanwhile, Diddy once in an interview admitted that he had only dated Lopez to make his ex Kim Porter jealous and win her back.","summary":"Recent surfacing of pictures of  Diddy and Lopez fighting at a party on a night a 13-year-old was allegedly abused, has dragged her into the scandal.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/jennifer-lopezs-ex-staffer-breaks-silence-on-her-involvement-in-diddys-scandal-if-you-knew","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/724079/uploads/3a57cf60-a0b6-11ef-a2cd-851fdb51aaff_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:30:00","author":"INQUISITR,Simran Kumari","authors":["INQUISITR","Simran Kumari"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":265126230,"title":"Race merchants think ‘whiteness’ explains their beatdown at the polls","text":"Judging by the analysis on cable news since the election, Democrats seem determined to lose every presidential race for years to come.\n\n The party should be reflecting deeply after Kamala Harris spent more than $1 billion and secured endorsements from celebrities and billionaires, only to lose to Donald Trump. Democrats should be asking how a man they’ve called a fascist, racist Nazi sympathizer managed to win support from such a diverse group of voters.\n\n If progressives had any sense, they would learn to listen to what people say instead of projecting their own biases onto millions of Americans they do not know and do not understand.\n\n Instead of addressing their mistakes, Democrats and their cable news allies continue to focus on the identity politics that voters rejected. Several analysts have claimed they know why Trump won, but their explanation ignores issues like economics, inflation, crime, or immigration.\n\n No, they say the reason comes down to one word: whiteness.\n\n MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude made this claim during a recent election postmortem. With intense passion and conviction, the Princeton professor insisted he could not see any other explanation. Though he never defined “whiteness,” he was certain it’s what motivated the masses.\n\n I shared his video on social media, telling him he sounded more like a religious cleric than a political analyst. He’s not alone in this rhetoric. While progressives have become more secular over the past few decades, they still exhibit religious impulses. Their discourse on “whiteness” reflects their view of original sin. They have major and minor “prophets” of race and are eager to evangelize unbelievers on topics like “white privilege,” “systemic racism,” and “white supremacy.” They view dissenters with contempt, as seen in their criticism of Latino voters who hopped on the Trump train.\n\n They see nonbelievers not as people to persuade but as sinners to redeem.\n\n This fixation on “whiteness” is not only simplistic but also fuels racial conflict that the left is ill-equipped to handle. A year ago, a black Christian woman sparked controversy in the evangelical community when she told a room full of white women that they must “divest from whiteness,” which she described as rooted in plunder, theft, slavery, and genocide. I’m no minister, but I know my Bible well enough to understand that no group — regardless of race, ethnicity, or nationality — holds a monopoly on sin.\n\n I remember thinking then, as I do now, that the public would have a fit if a white commentator blamed “blackness” for voters’ choices in this election. Conservatives who claimed “blackness” is rooted in self-destruction and broken families would be shunned and shamed, not celebrated as prophetic truth-tellers.\n\n This is why impartiality is a crucial ingredient for healthy discourse in the public square. An honest person should apply the same standards to friends and opponents alike. Moreover, the way we speak about other groups is how we should expect others to speak about us.\n\n This principle is nonpartisan and non-ideological. If you need an extra therapy session because a white conservative criticizes a black liberal on legitimate grounds, you shouldn’t write headlines labeling angry white men as the most frightening people in America.\n\n People pushing identity politics are a cancerous tumor on our body politic. Not only do they reduce Americans to their immutable traits, but they also create the perfect breeding ground for extremist views. Put simply, when you “sow” Robin DiAngelo, you will “reap” David Duke.\n\n This is not unique to white people. Rejection of moderation almost always leads to radicalism.\n\n Imagine a 17-year-old black kid in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1964 watching his parents going out to a civil rights march to protest segregation. Having learned about the First Amendment in school, he assumes law enforcement officials will respect his parents and that their grievances will be heard by their elected officials.\n\n But when he turns on TV that night, he sees them being sprayed with water hoses, attacked by dogs, and beaten over the head with clubs by police. When that teen sees how the white people in power treated his parents — Christians dressed in their Sunday best — no one should be surprised if he is drawn to the more militant posture of the Black Panthers.\n\n The same principle applies today. Young white men have been told that they are the cause of all the country’s problems and are constantly painted as racists only concerned about maintaining power. They see how every white conservative, from George W. Bush to Mitt Romney, is called racist or compared to a Nazi at some point.\n\n They see how perfectly mediocre academics get rich by pushing seminars on “white fragility” and “white rage.” Most are not nearly as race-obsessed as the liberals on television, but some are ripe for the picking by white identitarians who will affirm both their race and sex and won’t attack them for how they were born.\n\n The left does not want to hear that analysis, but that doesn’t make it any less true. When you open the door to the demons of identity, you have no idea what’s coming through that portal. If progressives had any sense, they would learn to listen to what people say instead of projecting their own biases onto millions of Americans they do not know, have never met, and do not understand.\n\n Democrats have a choice. They can either accept the fact that their radicalism on race, sex, and identity has driven away voters or continue to blame “whiteness” and bigotry for their defeat.\n\n This may be one of the last elections in which their silly theories will be taken seriously. Donald Trump earned about 55% of the Latino male vote, roughly 20 percentage points more than in 2020. While he didn’t make significant gains with black men nationwide, there were regional differences in the support he received. For example, about 25% of black men in Pennsylvania voted for Trump. If Democrats don’t do some honest self-reflection, the “white supremacists” they criticize on the right will be more diverse than their own party.","summary":"Judging by the analysis on cable news since the election, Democrats seem determined to lose every presidential race for years to come.\n\n\n\n\tThe party should be reflecting deeply after Kamala Harris spent more than $1 billion and secured endorsements from celebrities and billionaires, only to lose to Donald Trump.

Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader of the House, quoted the adage that “sunlight is the best disinfectant”.\n\n“In a democracy, transparency is always the best course of action, particularly when it relates to high-ranking government officials,” Jeffries said, signalling his support for the report’s release.\n\nAs Trump’s pick for attorney general, Gaetz is slated to lead the Department of Justice and serve as one of the highest-ranking law enforcement officers in the country.\n\nBut allegations of sexual misconduct have fuelled the controversy surrounding Gaetz’s nomination for the post: The Justice Department itself launched a nearly three-year investigation into Gaetz, though it ultimately chose not to pursue charges.\n\nGaetz faces what is expected to be a contentious Senate confirmation proceeding in 2025 to decide whether his nomination will pass.\n\nA ‘weaponised’ system?\n\nIn April 2021, just months after the Justice Department probe began, the House Ethics Committee started its own investigation into Gaetz’s behaviour.\n\n“The Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Matt Gaetz may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift,” a press release at the time read.\n\nGaetz, however, has denied any wrongdoing. Like Trump, he has accused rivals in the government of weaponising the justice system against him.\n\n“I believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to criminalize my sexual conduct, you know, when I was a single guy,” he told the publication Axios in March 2021.\n\nIn nominating Gaetz to head the Justice Department on Wednesday, Trump cited their shared view that the legal system had been wielded against them. The president-elect also pledged “desperately needed reform”.\n\n“Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans’ badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department,” Trump said in an online statement.\n\nProbe stays secret\n\nGaetz’s resignation from the House, in the aftermath of his nomination on Wednesday, brought the Ethics Committee’s work to an end.\n\nThe committee is charged with investigating possible ethics violations among sitting House members. Now that Gaetz is no longer a representative, its findings have been left in limbo.\n\nOn Friday, House Speaker Johnson cited those limitations in his decision not to push for the report’s release.\n\nHe added he planned to urge House Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest not to provide the Gaetz report to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n“The rules of the House have always been that a former member is beyond the jurisdiction of the Ethics Committee,” said Johnson.\n\n“I think it’s a terrible breach of protocol and tradition and the spirit of the rule,” he added. “I think that would be a terrible precedent to set.”\n\nJust hours earlier, Johnson had returned to Washington, DC, after a trip to visit President-elect Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He and Trump have been pushing for party unity in 2025, as Republicans prepare to take control of the White House and the Senate, in addition to the House.\n\nGaetz controversial pick\n\nGaetz, however, has been a controversial pick for a cabinet-level position, even among Republicans.\n\nIn 2023, for instance, Gaetz spearheaded an effort to unseat former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, resulting in a weeks-long impasse over his replacement.\n\nCritics also say he has minimal experience to qualify him for a cabinet-level position. Already, some Republican senators have expressed doubt about his viability for the role.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told US media. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious.”\n\nIn order to take up the role, Gaetz would need to be confirmed by the Senate, where Republicans are slated to have a majority of 53 seats out of 100.\n\nDemocrats are also pressuring their colleagues in the Senate to make the Gaetz ethics report public. On Friday, US Representative Steny Hoyer told reporters that he believes the Senate would be in its right to request the report before voting on Gaetz.\n\n“Certainly the Senate has the authority to ask for it, and I frankly think the House ought to produce it. After all, this is a critical issue that the Senate has to address,” Hoyer said.\n\nHe added he was “deeply disappointed” by President-elect Trump’s choice for the attorney general role.\n\n“I don’t know how many times this has happened in history, where a nominee for the attorney general of the United States, the chief of law enforcement of the United States, would have the ethical and legal issues that this nominee has had,” Hoyer said.\n\n“This is a historic issue.”","summary":"The probe, slated to be released Friday, has been left in limbo after Gaetz resigned his role as House representative.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/16/house-speaker-johnson-resists-calls-to-make-matt-gaetz-ethics-report-public?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24318738008155-1731709313.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:21:37","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":265126486,"title":"Outage hits Bluesky just as the platform’s popularity takes off","text":"The social media platform Bluesky was hit by an outage on Thursday, amid a rising wave of popularity for the app, which is often described as a friendlier alternative to X.\n\nBluesky has at times been the most downloaded app on both the US and UK Apple Stores in recent days, with many social media users leaving X, formerly Twitter, in the wake of the US election.\n\nBut on Thursday, some users around the world had trouble getting their feeds and notifications to load.\n\nBluesky spokesperson Emily Liu told the BBC that one of its internet providers “had some downtime, apparently because a fibre cable was out. That means it happened outside of our company”.\n\nBluesky provided a status notice from Cogent Communications that said some customers using part of its network located between Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia, had temporarily lost connectivity.\n\nNot all users experienced the outage, which appeared to be largely resolved late Thursday, according to the company.\n\nIn the week since Donald Trump won the US presidential election, 2.25 million users have signed up for Bluesky, which was started by Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter’s cofounders.\n\nThe platform said on Thursday evening that an additional one million people had joined within 24 hours.\n\nWhat is Bluesky?\n\nBluesky was originally thought up by the founder and former chief executive of Twitter, Jack Dorsey.\n\nThe key difference between Bluesky and most other social media platforms is that it is decentralised, meaning it is operated on independent servers and not those owned by the company.\n\nIt describes itself as “social media as it should be” – a place where people can come together over shared interests “and have some fun again”.\n\nUsers can post text, images and video, reply to other users publicly or have one-to-one conversations in direct messages – though these are not yet protected by the most secure and private method, end-to-end encryption.\n\nMr Dorsey has said previously he intended for Bluesky to be a decentralised version or extension of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.\n\nDespite helping fund and start it, he is no longer part of the team behind the social network.\n\nIt is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.\n\nIts userbase – while growing – remains relatively small.\n\nThe platform hit 16m total users on Thursday.\n\nWhy are people joining it?\n\nMany new users have said their decision to join Bluesky was driven by Elon Musk, who heavily backed Trump’s election campaign and intends to remain involved in the new administration.\n\nThreads, Meta’s competitor to X, has also continued to expand.\n\n“People are both disgusted and afraid of Elon Musk and what Twitter has become,” said Cory Johnson, Chief Market Strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research.\n\n“Users are fleeing X, and Bluesky and Threads are the beneficiaries.”\n\nIt is not the first time that apps trying to rival X with a similar format for text posts have had a flurry of new sign-ups.\n\nA decentralised network called Mastodon added hundreds of thousands of users after it popped up in the wake of Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover.\n\nBluesky and Threads both had a spike in users in 2023 as Mr Musk began to implement changes to the platform.\n\nThis week, the British news outlet the Guardian announced it will no longer post on X, saying the US election underlined its concerns that Musk had been able to use X to “shape political discourse”.\n\nAs Thursday’s outage unfolded, Bluesky staff tried to make light of the situation, with one developer joking: “Btw — Today will get interesting!

Jared Golden comes out ahead through Maine's ranked choice voting, but there may be a recount","text":"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Democratic Rep. Jared Golden came out ahead in the congressional race through Maine’s ranked choice system, election officials said Friday.\n\nIf the results stand it would be the third time in four elections in the hotly contested district that Golden won after votes were retabulated because first choices failed to produce a majority for any candidate.\n\nThis time it was Republican challenger Austin Theriault who came out behind. His campaign had said he would seek a recount, and his campaign reiterated the request Friday evening.\n\nGolden said the results show that he won, and he thanked his supporters, but he said Theriault was within his rights to request a recount.\n\nTheriault’s campaign manager, Shawn Roderick, said a recount was warranted given the closeness of the election.\n\n“Every Mainer’s voice should be heard and their vote counted in this historically close race and we have seen several anomalies that can only be rectified with a full recount. We appreciate everyone’s patience and support as we work to ensure every vote is counted,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press has not yet called the race since it is seeking more information from the secretary of state’s office to determine if the result will withstand an expected recount.\n\nMaine’s 2nd District, which is largely rural and known for its lobster fishing and logging, has favored President-elect Donald Trump in each of his three elections.\n\nNeither candidate won a majority of the first place votes on Election Day. The initial count of first-place choices put Golden ahead of Theriault by about 2,000 votes but both fell shy of a majority with less than 49% of the votes cast because of some 12,000 ballots that were either blank or had write-in candidates.\n\nThe initial outcome triggered Maine’s ranked choice process. All of the district’s ballots were shipped to the state capital, verified, scanned into a computer and retabulated in a process narrated on a livestream by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows. Then, any second choices for Golden or Theriault on the blank ballots or by voters for write-in candidates were reallocated to determine a winner.\n\nSome media prematurely declared Golden the winner before the secretary of state’s office invoked the ranked choice process, and Theriault’s campaign previously said he would request a recount. If there’s a recount, it could be weeks before it’s completed. Meanwhile, election workers must certify election results and sent to the governor by Maine’s Nov. 25 deadline, though state law grants an exception for recounts.\n\nThis race was one of relatively few truly competitive contests nationwid e as both parties struggled to control the House of Representatives, and it drew about $50 million in political spending, a large sum for a mostly rural district.\n\nGolden, who was known for his willingness to defy his own party, campaigned on his ability to work with both Democrats and Republicans and his advocacy for the lobster industry, which is the crucial to the economy in the region.\n\n“I’ve been one of the most independent-minded members of Congress, one of the most bipartisan,” Golden said during an October debate, adding that he had voted against President Joe Biden “more than any other Democrat in the House of Representatives.”\n\nBut Golden was attacked for his opposition to assault weapons, which he announced after an Army reservist used an assault rifle to kill 18 people and injure 13 others in Lewiston in October 2023.\n\nTheriault, who was first elected to the Maine House in 2022, portrayed Golden as too liberal for the district. And although Theriault had the backing of Trump, he also portrayed himself as a potential uniter during a time of division.\n\n“We need more balance and less extremism in Washington,” Theriault said during the debate. “I’m somebody that can go down there and get the job done. I want to advocate for everybody.”\n\nThe district’s voters repeatedly sent Golden to Congress after election night-squeakers that weren’t settled without the state’s ranked-choice process. Ranked choice tabulations allowed Golden to unseat Republican incumbent Rep. Bruce Poliquin in 2018, and to win a rematch in 2022.\n\nThe voting system adopted by Maine voters in 2016 lets voters rank their first, second and third choices of candidates on the ballot. A candidate who collects a majority of first-place votes is the winner. If there’s no majority winner, then last-place candidates are eliminated and their supporters’ second choices are used to reallocate the votes, and so on, until one candidate surpasses 50%.\n\nThe 2nd Congressional District is among the nation’s largest by area, stretching to Maine’s northernmost corners. Logging is a mainstay, and lobster fishing is a key source of income along the craggy Down East coast.\n\nMaine is one of two states to apportion electoral votes by congressional district — Nebraska is the other — and Trump has won his sole New England electoral vote in Maine’s 2nd District three times.\n\nMaine’s other electoral votes — two for the statewide vote and one for the 1st Congressional District — have gone to the Democratic candidate because the deep blue 1st District is based around Portland, the largest city in the state and a liberal stronghold. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree won her ninth term there, over Republican challenger Ron Russell and independent Ethan Alcorn.","summary":"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Democratic Rep.

Under the agreement, Ukraine surrendered its 1,734 strategic nuclear warheads in exchange for protection.The briefing was authored by Oleksii Yizhak – the head of department at Ukraine’s National Institute for Strategic Studies, which provides research and advises the president and National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine – and was published by influential military think-tank the Centre for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies. \n\nSo far, Kyiv officials have not endorsed the briefing.Have a tip?

Could a tattoo derail Trump’s pick for defense secretary?","text":"Concerns have been raised over a tattoo belonging to Pete Hegseth, the Fox News host nominated by Donald Trump to lead the Department of Defense – with opinion divided over whether it is a “Christian motto” or a white nationalist dog whistle.\n\nHegseth, an Army National Guard veteran, has the words “Deus Vult” tattooed on his bicep, which has been associated with white supremacist groups. \"Deus Vult\" is a Latin phrase meaning \"God Wills It,\" and was a rallying cry for Christian crusaders in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the tattoo previously resulted in Hegseth being flagged as a possible \"Insider Threat\" by a fellow service member. However, the AP report has led to outrage on both sides, including from Vice President-elect JD Vance.\n\n“They’re attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm,” Vance wrote on X. “This is disgusting anti-Christian bigotry from the AP, and the entire organization should be ashamed of itself.”\n\nOlivia Troye, former White House Homeland Security and counter-terrorism adviser, said that the mark should disqualify Hegseth from consideration for the position. “Pete Hegseth’s tattoos are the ones that white nationalists get,” she wrote.\n\n“Federal law enforcement know these symbols well. Hegseth was banned from national guard duty at Biden’s inauguration for those tattoos. The Senate should consider this disqualifying for a nominee for Secretary of Defense…”\n\nAccording to Hegseth, the “Deus Vult” phrase is also the last two words of his 2020 book American Crusade: Our Fight To Stay Free.\n\nHegseth has downplayed the role of military members and veterans in the January 6 2021 attack and railed against the Pentagon’s subsequent efforts to address extremism in the ranks.\n\nHe has also shown support for members of the military accused of war crimes and criticized the military’s justice system.\n\nHesgeth previously claimed he was pulled by his District of Columbia National Guard unit from guarding Joe Biden’s January 2021 inauguration after being unfairly identified as an extremist due to another tattoo – a Jerusalem cross – on his chest.\n\nThat cross has a long history in Christianity but has lately been co-opted by some far-right groups as a symbol of the fight for Western civilization.\n\nThe Associated Press’s report follows an email sent to the outlet from a fellow Guard member who was the unit’s security manager and on an anti-terrorism team at the time, that proved concerns were in fact raised at the time about the bicep tattoo.\n\nHesgeth was one of the more surprising nominations made by Trump, in a fairly surprising field – which includes controversial former congressman Matt Gaetz and Robert F Kennedy Jr.\n\n“Pete has spent his entire life as a Warrior for the Troops, and for the Country. Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,” the president-elect said in a statement on Tuesday. “With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down.”\n\nHegseth, 44, is a former Bear Stearns banker who later served tours with the Army National Guard in Guantánamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, as well as led veterans-focused advocacy organizations.\n\nHe joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 and co-hosts “Fox & Friends” – which has been known to broadcast favorable coverage of the Trump campaign.","summary":"Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran, has the words ‘Deus Vult’ tattooed on his bicep, a rallying cry for Christian crusaders in the Middle Ages","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-hesgeth-tattoo-trump-administration-b2648147.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/15/23/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4l6trWGF-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:17:33","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.11},{"id":265124598,"title":"Trump is considering making Sean Spicer his Navy secretary","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14089027/donald-trump-navy-sean-spicer.html\" on this server.\nReference #18.54247e68.1731717933.86ede2\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.54247e68.1731717933.86ede2","summary":"Donald Trump 's former Press Secretary Sean Spicer is on a shortlist to become U.S. Navy secretary, DailyMail.com has learned.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14089027/donald-trump-navy-sean-spicer.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/16/00/92131225-0-image-m-56_1731715222340.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:17:12","author":"Editor","authors":["Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-1},{"id":265126622,"title":"With Donald Trump's Return, Will EU Go Easier On Ally Elon Musk?","text":"Donald Trump's White House comeback gives his ally Elon Musk a sizeable advantage in a running standoff with EU tech regulators -- who may now think twice before fining his X platform over disinformation concerns.The world's richest man -- as the boss of Tesla and SpaceX as well as the former Twitter -- threw his full weight into Trump's campaign to reclaim the US presidency.Elon Musk backed the Republican with hard cash but also used his far-reaching social media platform to push pro-Trump messages, including inflammatory disinformation, to his more than 200 million followers.The bet amply paid off, with a victorious Trump tapping Musk for an outsized role to overhaul the US government -- and putting Brussels in an uncomfortable spot.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");With the European Union counting on continued US backing to keep an aggressive Russia from its borders, can it really afford to upset Trump by going after a prized ally?Trump's future vice-president J.D. Vance even mused on the campaign trail that Washington could drop support for NATO if the EU presses on with attempts to regulate Musk's X network under a landmark new content law.\"American power comes with certain strings attached. One of those is respect free speech, especially in our European allies,\" he warned.For Musk, hostility to the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) is about more than just business: along with supporters on the American right he increasingly paints it as an ideological battle against censorship.\"The election in the US will not impact our enforcement work,\" a spokesman for the European Commission -- the powerful tech enforcer for the 27-nation EU -- told AFP.But experts are not so sure.Billions in fines?Musk's X platform was formally accused by the commission in July of misleading users with its blue checkmarks for certified accounts, of insufficient advertising transparency and failing to give researchers access to the platform's data.The allegations are part of a wider DSA inquiry into how X tackles the spread of illegal content and information manipulation.Each offence could theoretically trigger a fine of up to six percent of the annual global turnover of all the companies Musk controls -- reaching into the billions.According to several sources close to the proceedings, the commission was wrapping up its probe -- and readying a heavy fine -- when its digital chief Thierry Breton quit in September, having been denied a second term by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen.But the stars have since realigned, with the EU now caught in the headlights for fear the volatile Trump will start a trade war and cut support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion.'Provoke' Trump?With Trump at the reins, enforcing EU tech rules against X may become a matter of politics as much as anything else.\"I'd be surprised if the commission chooses to provoke Trump over something like this,\" said Alexandre de Streel, an expert at the Center on Regulation in Europe (CERRE) think tank.\"Transatlantic relations are going to become more complicated -- and this probably isn't the area where they will need to fight hardest,\" he said.\"Musk believes the DSA goes too far in how it asks platforms to regulate content -- and that is also the view of far-right parties in Europe,\" de Streel noted. \"It's become a battle of ideas, and I don't see Musk folding -- especially not now.\"The European Commission also has to factor in Trump's hard-right allies within the bloc, from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Italian leader Giorgia Meloni.After Trump's re-election, von der Leyen stressed the importance of the EU-US \"partnership\" and a \"strong transatlantic agenda\" -- a stance echoed by Breton's designated successor as digital enforcer, Henna Virkkunen.\"With war on its doorstep, Europe must think carefully,\" said Umberto Gambini, of European affairs consultancy Forward Global. \"I don't think it can afford to upset Trump in these first months.\"Gambini predicts that the commission's probes into X will keep ticking along but the departure of Breton -- who clashed spectacularly with Musk via social media -- will offer a chance to reset the relationship.Already back in August, Brussels had distanced itself from a letter of warning sent by the French commissioner before Musk interviewed Trump live on X.That said, \"if Europe wants to remain credible\" in the fight to rein in Big Tech, it \"has to keep threatening fines in the billions, not millions\", Gambini said.But with fragile transatlantic ties in mind, it may choose to focus its firepower on Chinese platforms such as TikTok instead, judged the EU expert.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Donald Trump's White House comeback gives his ally Elon Musk a sizeable advantage in a running standoff with EU tech regulators -- who may now think twice before fining his X platform over...","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/with-donald-trumps-return-will-eu-go-easier-on-ally-elon-musk-7030414","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/0lbt9618_elon-musk_625x300_13_November_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:15:20","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.195},{"id":265123306,"title":"Woman told House Ethics Committee she saw Gaetz having sex with a minor","text":"A woman who attended a 2017 party with former Rep.

The committee planned to vote Friday on whether to release their report, but the meeting was canceled after President-elect Donald Trump announced he intended to nominate Gaetz as attorney general and the Florida Republican resigned from Congress.\"As the Senate considers former Rep.

Vice President Kamala Harris called for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, while former President Donald Trump favors loosening concealed carry laws nationwide.\n\nThough neither platform is likely to clear Congress, Trump's victory could give him the power to dismantle three years of gun violence prevention measures enacted under President Joe Biden, who has arguably done more to try to stem gun violence than any president in decades.\n\n\"In my second term, we will roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment—the attacks are fast and furious—starting the minute that Crooked Joe shuffles his way out of the White House,\" Trump told National Rifle Association members gathered for a convention in Dallas in May. \n\nThe Trace shares a look at the Biden-era policies most likely to be on the chopping block. Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSacking ATF Director Steve Dettelbach\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF—the lead law enforcement agency charged with regulating the gun industry—never had a permanent director under Trump when he was president. In July 2022, former federal prosecutor Steven Dettelbach became the first Senate-confirmed director of the agency in more than seven years. Trump has vowed to remove him.\n\n\"At noon on Inauguration Day, we will sack the anti-gun fanatic Steve Dettelbach,\" Trump told the NRA in May. \"Have you ever heard of him? He's a disaster.\"\n\nSince taking office, Dettelbach has increased oversight of the firearms industry, much of it at Biden's direction. In 2021, Biden ordered the agency to implement a zero tolerance policy toward gun dealers who willfully sell to prohibited purchasers or fail to conduct background checks. The policy resulted in the ATF revoking more gun store licenses in 2024 than in any year over at least the past two decades.\n\nBiden also ordered the ATF to issue annual reports on gun trafficking, something it hadn't done in two decades. The agency has since released three, with a fourth volume expected by the end of Biden's term.\n\n\"I don't think we will see that under a Trump administration, and that will make it really hard for researchers and law enforcement to understand how guns are moving and trafficking and which policies are best,\" said Nick Wilson, the senior director of gun violence prevention at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a progressive think tank.\n\nThe White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention\n\nBiden launched the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention last year to coordinate federal efforts for a more holistic approach to the issue. While the office doesn't make gun laws, or even enforce them, it serves as a clearinghouse for the administration's messaging and policymaking on gun violence. \n\nThe office launched a resource center to help states implement red flag laws, which temporarily disarm people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. It has also regularly met with survivors, supported communities affected by mass shootings, and helped carry out Biden's executive orders (more on those below).\n\nBefore Biden even took office, gun reform advocates urged the office's creation as a visible symbol of the federal government's commitment to addressing the crisis. Now, they fully expect the office—currently overseen by Harris—to be shuttered as soon as Trump takes office. \n\nWith Trump reelected, \"There's no more White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention,\" said Adzi Vokhiwa, vice president of policy at the Community Justice Action Fund, a gun violence prevention group. \"I think all of that goes away.\"\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida, introduced bills to make the office permanent, but the legislation stalled in a narrowly divided Senate and Republican-controlled House. \n\nThat likely means the office will be gone \"on Day One\" of the second Trump presidency, Murphy told The Trace. \"The progress we've made has saved lives, but it has also given a lot of victims' families the sense that their advocacy means something,\" he said. \"They're going to be talking to a brick wall if Trump is in the White House, and to the extent anybody in the White House talks to them, it'll just be for show.\"\n\nShould Trump decide to keep the office, it would be at his whim—possibly refashioned as a repository for pro-gun policies or, as some gun rights advocates have suggested, an outfit to push Second Amendment expansion.\n\n\"The obvious choice is for the Trump administration to completely dismantle it,\" said Devin Hughes, founder of the gun violence research outfit GVPedia.\n\n\"More likely, however, they will use the office as a platform to spread disinformation on gun violence that is favorable to the gun lobby, with someone like John Lott at its head,\" Hughes said, referencing the debunked economist and Trump administration alum whose skewed crime statistics are touted by Republican lawmakers and the gun lobby.\n\nThe Bipartisan Safer Communities Act\n\nPassed in 2022 in the wake of mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, the BSCA was the first significant gun reform law in nearly three decades, receiving bipartisan support in the Senate. It has since become a target.\n\nFully repealing the law would require an unlikely 60 votes in the Senate and a Republican majority in the House, but Trump plans to unwind as much of it as he can via executive action, a gun-friendly attorney general, and a revamped ATF that favors gun rights over gun regulation.\n\n\"President Trump will appoint an ATF director who will review these extremely burdensome regulations that make Americans less safe,\" an unnamed representative of the Trump campaign told the NRA's America's First Freedom magazine in October, calling it \"unfortunate\" that Biden signed the law.\n\nGun Dealers and Background Checks\n\nA prime target appears to be a provision of the law that clarifies when a gun seller must obtain a federal license. The change aimed to reduce the number of gun dealers avoiding licensure so they would not have to keep records or conduct background checks on their customers. The seemingly small shift had a notable effect: Within a year, prosecutions for unlicensed dealing rose by 52%. \n\n\"The reason that the Biden administration is pushing these rules is to make sure that their national gun registry, which President Trump will also undo, will be able to track more people who own guns,\" the Trump campaign told the NRA's magazine. (Neither the BSCA nor any of Biden's executive actions create a national gun registry, which is prohibited by a 1986 federal law, but the NRA and gun rights advocates liken expanded background checks to a backdoor gun registry.)\n\nSome Republicans may support such a move by Trump. That includes Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who was the lead GOP negotiator on the BSCA. Cornyn has faced criticism from gun rights proponents for supporting the bill and was booed at the 2022 Texas Republican Party's state convention after Biden signed it.\n\nA spokesperson for Cornyn pointed to a letter to the editor the senator wrote in May criticizing the ATF's interpretation of the law: \"I stand by the reforms in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, but I reject the Biden administration's unconstitutional attempt to exploit this law in order to implement its radical gun control agenda counter to the will of Congress and the people who elected us.\"\n\nVokhiwa, who oversees federal and state policy efforts at Community Justice, said the ATF's regulatory change was legally justifiable. Still, at least three lawsuits are challenging it.\n\n\"They're defensible,\" she said. \"But I think that a Trump administration would just choose to not defend them, and not defend the actions of anything that was done under the Biden-Harris administration. That would really be dangerous for public safety. It would undermine ATF efforts to slow down trafficking of firearms.\"\n\nTrump or a Republican-controlled House could also hamper enforcement by cutting ATF staffing or reducing funding, which has long been sought by Republicans in Congress. \"If they fire all the licensing inspectors, then it's going to be very hard to enforce the rule,\" Wilson said.\n\nFunding for Gun Violence Prevention\n\nThe BSCA also set aside more than $13 billion in funding to support state crisis interventions like red flag laws, community-based violence intervention programs, school safety, and mental health services.\n\nCongress funded the BSCA through 2026, but a Trump administration could alter grant programs to favor other crisis interventions over red flag laws or try to shift money from community-based programs to law enforcement initiatives.\n\n\"It matters who is in these positions within the different parts of the executive branch who're actually responsible for reviewing applications and directing funding,\" Vokhiwa said.\n\nTrump's campaign told the NRA's magazine that he plans to appoint a pro-gun attorney general—responsible for overseeing much of the funding—\"who will stop the weaponization of government against lawful gun ownership and who will prioritize traditional law enforcement by catching and punishing criminals.\"\n\nMurphy, who was the lead Democratic negotiator of the BSCA and helped shepherd it through the Senate, said he believes Trump would try to roll back as much of the law as he can.\n\n\"You have to open up your imagination about what a second Trump presidency is going to look like,\" Murphy said. \"This isn't going to be normal. You may see him outright refuse to implement laws he doesn't like, like the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and potentially short-circuit Congress and try to impose certain gun industry priorities on the country without going through the legislative process.\"\n\nFederal law prevents funding from being shifted to other purposes, but Trump could simply refuse to distribute the funds. Trump has repeatedly said he would violate the federal Impoundment Control Act, which limits the president's ability to unilaterally refuse or redirect congressional spending. \n\nThere is also a mechanism for Congress to cancel spending at the president's request, said Wilson, of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. \"Trump could send a message to Congress saying, 'The NRA told me that they don't want this money going to the community.' That triggers a bill that could be voted on. And it's filibuster-proof, so Congress would only need a simple majority to rescind the money.\"\n\nBiden's Executive Orders\n\nBiden has announced more than 50 executive actions on gun violence since he took office in January 2021, most of which could be easily rescinded or ignored under a Trump administration.\n\n\"I take Trump at his word: He said he's going to roll back all the progress we made on guns under President Biden,\" Murphy said. \"And I believe him. I think he'll do whatever the gun lobby tells him to do.\"\n\nIn one of his first executive orders, Biden directed the ATF to issue regulations on ghost guns and other unserialized firearms, requiring buyers to undergo background checks. The new rules are currently before the Supreme Court, which appears likely to uphold them. \n\nBiden also directed the agency to propose a rule for regulating so-called stabilizing braces, which effectively convert AR-15-style pistols into more accurate short-barreled rifles while being more concealable and maneuverable than their full-length counterparts. The devices were used in mass shootings at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado; outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio; and at a private school in Nashville, Tennessee. The regulation—which requires owners to register brace-equipped guns as short-barrelled rifles under the National Firearms Act—took effect in 2023, but has faced court challenges.\n\nThe Biden administration's other actions have included encouraging safer gun storage, declaring gun violence a public health crisis, restricting exports of firearms abroad, and establishing a task force to target machine gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms. \n\nGun violence prevention advocates believe most of that work will be rescinded or halted.\n\n\"The bottom line is a Trump administration would be devastating for public safety,\" Vokhiwa said. \"It would walk back the progress that we've seen over the last several years, and frankly, it will cost us lives.

Dimon pointed to the slow permitting process for rare-earth mining in the United States as another example of regulatory inefficiency hampering economic growth.\n\n“Ten years—they haven’t got their permits yet,” he said of companies seeking to extract critical minerals crucial for technology and defense industries. “It’s a shame. And we’re doing this to ourselves, and it’s a mistake.”\n\nDimon also praised President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal for a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aims to streamline bureaucracy.\n\n“You could talk to any industry and they’ll give you examples of regulation that could be reduced to make it easier for them to do business while keeping the country safe,” he said.\n\nWhen asked about the market’s strong reaction to Trump’s election victory, Dimon said it reflects optimism for a “pro-growth shock” as businesses prepare to make aggressive capital investments.\n\n“You’ve already seen the markets have responded quite well,” he noted. “And I think America needs a growth strategy, so I literally applaud that,” he said.\n\nDimon emphasized that the agenda should go beyond slashing red tape to include broader reforms like improving the efficiency of the permitting process. “Collaboration between government and business is the way to have growth,” he said.\n\nWhile the Trump administration appears poised to pursue a deregulatory agenda, the administration of President Joe Biden has emphasized consumer protections and systemic risk management.\n\nThese reforms, developed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, aim to bolster the resilience of the banking sector by increasing capital requirements, enhancing risk-weighting measures, and introducing stricter leverage ratios.\n\nCritics, including Dimon, have said that the stricter rules would not have prevented past bank failures and could have a negative impact on the economy.","summary":"The JPMorgan Chase CEO said he expects Trump-era deregulation to unlock bank lending and spur economic growth.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/jamie-dimon-eyes-trump-era-deregulation-as-boost-for-banking-economy-5760543","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/16/id5760739-GettyImages-2180806087-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:11:59","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.15},{"id":265121978,"title":"Biden And Xi Express Concerns Over Uncertain Global Future With Trump’s Return","text":"US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping warned of turbulent times during a closely watched Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, this week. Both leaders expressed concerns over the prospect of global trade and political stability when former President Donald Trump prepares for a possible return to the White House.\n\nThe two men discussed delicate issues, including their risks, against a backdrop of increasing tensions between the U.S. and China during a week-long Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, close to where both countries’ top diplomats met briefly on an issue likely to be at the center of their talks.\n\nLeaders Express Concerns Over Growing Tensions\n\nThe APEC summit in Lima will have representation by more than 40% of world commerce and 60% of world GDP from 21 member economies. Both Biden and Xi can be said to have expressed their uneasiness at international affairs taking the wrong turn with the possibility of the return of Trump as president in January looming large.\n\nXi elaborated on those risks at a meeting of CEOs and said he sees the opening up of global trade as “an inherent part of spreading unilateralism and protectionism” and therefore fears a “fragmentation of the world economy.” The full significance of that concern, of course, falls into an even broader story about China’s rising unease with growing isolationist policies emanating from the West, particularly the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden characterized this moment in the world as a particularly critical time of political shift. Addressing leaders from Japan and South Korea, Biden reflected on the trilateral partnership by saying, “We have to make sure it lasts as a lasting alliance in Asia.”\n\nTensions Over Trade and North Korea Loom Large\n\nThe two leaders will attend the summit at a sensitive time with increased global trade tensions and rising instability in world geopolitics. U.S. President Biden clearly stated that increased cooperation between North Korea and Russia holds dangerous risks, such as possible involvement in the Ukraine conflict ongoing. According to him, it was a necessity to be able to prevent North Korea from making the region even more unstable than it already is.\n\nThe summit, intended to start discussing trade and inclusive growth, has been overshadowed by the political uncertainty of where Trump’s future policy directions lie. Trump signalled his plans for taking an aggressive stance on China by proposing up to 60% tariffs on Chinese imports due to claimed imbalances.\n\nIt has been at the receiving end of Trump’s “America First” policy that wishes to reduce US reliance on foreign imports and protect American jobs. Economists, however, argue that this development could harm not only China’s economy but also that of the US and its trading partners.\n\nBiden and Xi Push for Diplomacy Amid Rising Nationalism\n\nSouth Korea’s leaders briefed Yoon Suk Yeol, the president of South Korea, separately on what is required for regional cooperation for “stability and peace.” Technically still at war with North Korea, more posturing from Pyongyang heightens risks for volatile tensions in the region.\n\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the in-person meeting Saturday between Biden and Xi would focus on the management of the time of delicate transition, adding on the progress made in the bilateral relationship. Still, he stressed a point that needs to be handled concerning competition with China, so it doesn’t spin out of control into direct conflict.\n\nThe ‘America First’ agenda of President Trump cast a shadow over the bilateral relationship.\n\nNow that Trump is poised to re-enter the White House come January, the APEC summit acquires added importance. What Trump’s “America First” agenda has signalled so far is a drift away from multilateral diplomacy, at least as far as international trade and climate change are concerned. In contrast, Biden’s approach seems to focus more on alliances and collective action in response to global challenges.\n\nTherefore, the Biden administration focuses its attention on rearranging the relationship with historic friends, especially on this count, by rebuilding relations with Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. Notably, however, Trump’s policies have also ushered in tensions in major relations with allies and doubts about the long-term sustainability of international partnerships.\n\nThreats from Rising Economic and Geopolitical Risks\n\nRising Protectionism under Trump The new threat to global trade with Trump in the second term is the threat of rising tariffs and protectionist policies. Proposed tariffs under Trump will hurt not only China but also the US and other economies, potentially causing a global economic downturn. On top of that, trade, Trump’s reluctance to engage in foreign conflicts could drive America toward a more isolationist stance further complicating global diplomacy.\n\nIn the meanwhile, China has cranked up its military efforts, particularly in growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and putting immense pressure on Taiwan. Thereby, raising geopolitical risk, which will have immense implications for regional stability as well as the world at large.\n\nConclusion of APEC and World Trade\n\nBehind the scenes of tremendous political uncertainty, the APEC summit went on, with Trump signaling a great intent to harden up on China, leaving the future of global trade relations blurred. For all the attention on Trump moving to a new office, the delicate balance of global cooperation will face a test at a historic juncture.\n\nEconomists and policymakers in general are keenly following the post-summit debate to see whether such debate translates into concrete steps toward reducing trade tensions and avoiding further economic fragmentation. The outcome of such talks may define the face of the global economic landscape for a long period ahead.\n\nALSO READ: Trump Plans Major Military Overhaul, Targets DEI-Obsessed Leaders At Pentagon","summary":"US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping warned of turbulent times during a closely watched Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, this week.\n\n\nThe post Biden And Xi Express Concerns Over Uncertain Global Future With Trump’s Return appeared first on NewsX World.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/biden-and-xi-express-concerns-over-uncertain-global-future-with-trumps-return/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Biden-And-Xi-Express-Concerns-Over-Uncertain-Global-Future-With-Trumps-Return.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:11:22","author":"Prateek Levi","authors":["Prateek Levi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":265122082,"title":"Donald Trump Makes White House Press Secretary Pick","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has announced Karoline Leavitt as his pick for press secretary when he returns to the White House on January 20.Leavitt, former Republican congressional candidate who served as deputy press secretary during the first Trump administration, was the national press secretary for Trump's successful 2024 presidential campaign and is currently a spokesperson for the president-elect's transition team.\"Karoline Leavitt did a phenomenal job as the National Press Secretary on my Historic Campaign, and I am pleased to announce she will serve as White House Press Secretary,\" Trump said in a statement emailed to Newsweek on Friday.\"Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,\" he added. \"I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.\"At just 27 years old, Leavitt is expected to become the youngest White House press secretary in U.S. history.This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.","summary":"Karoline Leavitt previously served in the Trump White House and as national press secretary for Trump's 2024 campaign.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-makes-white-house-press-secretary-pick-1986752","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2522554/donald-trump-karoline-leavitt-press-secretary-pick.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:09:34","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.574},{"id":265126494,"title":"Donald Trump names Karoline Leavitt as press secretary","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle November 15, 2024 00:28 \n\n Donald Trump names Karoline Leavitt as press secretary \n Fox News host Laura Ingraham reports on President-elect Trump calling on campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt to become a member of his Cabinet on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard Tags OPINIONSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE INGRAHAM ANGLETRUMP TRANSITION","summary":"Fox News host Laura Ingraham reports on President-elect Trump calling on campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt to become a member of his Cabinet on &apos;The Ingraham Angle.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6364773461112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/d11b4da6-4834-4b9f-b582-24e6d1e77441/f6bb0ee7-805e-4166-8c9c-85295d368e05/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:07:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":265123784,"title":"Judge blocks Biden administration's rule to expand overtime pay for millions","text":"NEW YORK — A federal judge in Texas has blocked a new rule from the Biden administration that would have expanded access to overtime pay to millions more salaried workers across the U.S.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan sided with the state of Texas and a group of business organizations that argued the Labor Department exceeded its authority when it finalized a rule earlier this year to significantly expand overtime pay for salaried workers — ruling that the department could not prioritize employee wages over job duties when determining eligibility.\n\nUnder the federal law, nearly all hourly workers in the U.S. are entitled to overtime pay after 40 hours a week. But many salaried workers are exempt from that requirement — unless they earn below a certain level.\n\nThe Labor Department's now-scuttled rule would have marked the biggest increase to that cap in decades. Employers were required pay overtime to salaried workers who make less than $43,888 a year in certain executive, administrative and professional roles as of July 1 — and that was set to rise to $58,656 next year.\n\nThe Labor Department estimated that an additional 4 million lower-paid salary workers would become eligible for overtime protections in the first year under the new rule. An additional 292,900 higher-compensated workers were also expected to get overtime entitlements through separate threshold increases.\n\nNow, the previous threshold of $35,568 — which was set in 2019 under the Trump administration — is poised to go back into effect.\n\nA spokesperson for the Labor Department did not immediately comment when reached by The Associated Press Friday. It was unclear if the department would attempt to appeal the decision from Jordan, who was nominated to his seat by Republican President-elect Donald Trump during his first term.\n\nAt the time of the rule's finalization in April, acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su stated that the administration was \"following through on our promise to raise the bar\" — noting that it was \"unacceptable\" for lower-paid salaried workers to do the same job as their hourly counterparts with no additional pay.\n\nFollowing the finalization of this year's rule, legal challenges bubbled up. A handful of trade groups argued the move would harm businesses and lead to costs that would potentially result in employers' needing to cut jobs or limit their workers' hours.\n\nDavid French, executive vice president of government relations for the National Retail Federation — one of the groups that challenged the Labor Department's rule — maintained in a statement Friday that the changes \"would have curtailed retailers' ability to offer the most flexible, generous and tailored benefits packages to lower-level exempt employees across the industry.\"\n\nFriday's ruling is a bit of déjà vu. In 2016, an Obama-era effort to similarly expand overtime pay eligibility was ultimately shot down in court after facing pushback from some business leaders and Republican politicians.\n\nThe Trump administration later brought a smaller raise through, marking the first increase since 2004. Advocates pushing for higher overtime pay have stressed that it's far from enough — arguing that too many salaried workers are still cheated out of their time — but potential changes under Trump's upcoming second term are unlikely to meet the level of those demands.","summary":"A federal judge in Texas has blocked a new rule from the Biden administration that would have expanded access to overtime pay to millions more salaried workers across the U.S.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/15/nx-s1-5193354/overtime-pay-rule-biden-administration","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3898x2599+0+0/resize/3898x2599!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F8c%2F004444cf49d084aa5a8613888eaa%2Fap24320803566260.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:05:26","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":265123298,"title":"Doctor explains how RFK Jr.'s plans could affect Americans' health","text":"Doctor explains how RFK Jr.'s plans could affect Americans' health\n President-elect Donald Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to pick Robert F.

If confirmed to the position, Kennedy would have sweeping authority over a number of agencies that could directly affect access to abortion nationwide, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In a post Friday, Pence criticized Kennedy's selection as teeing up \"the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history.\"\"On behalf of tens of millions of pro-life Americans, I respectfully urge Senate Republicans to reject this nomination and give the American people a leader who will respect the sanctity of life,\" Pence said in a statement published by the group Advancing American Freedom, calling the choice \"deeply concerning to millions of pro-life Americans.\"Some of Trump's allies have dismissed Pence's objection, arguing that there is no reason to believe that Kennedy would buck the platform hammered out by Republicans over the summer that largely deferred the issue to the states.\"RFK Jr. is going to serve at the pleasure of the president. And the president has been very clear that his policy is that there's no federal role in abortion,\" Terry Schilling, head of the American Principles Project, told CBS News. Schilling's political action committee bills itself as \"the only national pro-family organization\" on a slate of issues including opposition to abortion and gender-affirming care. He said they spent $18 million in campaigns this year and also plan to work to support Kennedy's nomination.He pointed to other areas where Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda might find common ground with conservatives, citing Kennedy's past stances questioning puberty blockers and other kinds of hormone therapy for transgender minors.\"Trump chose him because of his Make America Healthy Again agenda. And it's very clear there are a lot of problems in our country, and I think RFK Jr. is the best suited person to get to the bottom of that,\" Schilling said.Another major activist group, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, also voiced concern over the Kennedy pick. \"There's no question that we need a pro-life HHS secretary, and of course, we have concerns about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group's president, said in a statement.But regardless of who is HHS secretary, Dannenfelser also said that they believed \"baseline policies\" set by Trump's first term would return.A person close to the president-elect's transition said did not think the abortion issue would pose an actual hurdle to Kennedy's confirmation, and said they were unsurprised that Pence was making the argument against Kennedy.Trump expressed support for Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform during the campaign, and offered to let him \"go wild on health\" in the new administration.\"Do whatever you want. You just go ahead. Work on pesticides, work on making women's health. He's so into women's health, and you know he's really unbelievable. It's such a passion,\" Trump said of Kennedy on Nov. 4.In a statement, the group Americans United for Life told CBS News that they were \"optimistic about working with RFK Jr. to correct the wrongs of the Biden/Harris administration.\" But they also appeared to acknowledge his views were not fully in alignment. \"Like many newcomers to the conservative pro-life movement, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. needs further education on the reality of abortion and its harmful effects,\" John Mize, the group's CEO, told CBS News in a statement.Mize pointed to Kennedy's comments at the Iowa State Fair in August, in which he suggested he would support a federal ban on abortion. Kennedy's campaign later walked that back — one of several changes Kennedy made to his shifting position on abortion during his longshot presidential bid.Before dropping out, Kennedy posted in June that he backed \"the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point,\" while also calling for policies that could \"reduce more abortions in America by choice than by force.\"There are ways that Kennedy could go further to cement his support among anti-abortion activists, Mize said. As one \"large signal to the movement,\" Mize suggested, Kennedy could support reinstating the FDA's restrictions requiring in-person prescribing of the medication abortion pill mifepristone. More than 60% of abortions in the U.S. in 2023 involved use of the pills, and many prescriptions are now obtained via telehealth.","summary":"Former Vice President Mike Pence said Kennedy \"should be deeply concerning to millions of pro-life Americans.\"","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-mike-pence-abortion/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/10/28/acd20540-a5e9-4069-a638-37d7a70d9e01/thumbnail/1200x630g2/cf43fd119806cbd64260d0ec7c3bfa12/ap23301662999688.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3340740_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:02:18","author":"Alexander Tin","authors":["Alexander Tin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.04},{"id":265121208,"title":"President-elect Trump names Karoline Leavitt press secretary","text":"Karoline Leavitt will serve as White House Press Secretary, the Trump team announced in an email.\n\nLeavitt was the Trump Campaign National Press Secretary and previously served in the Trump White House as Assistant Press Secretary.\n\n“Karoline Leavitt did a phenomenal job as the National Press Secretary on my Historic Campaign, and I am pleased to announce she will serve as White House Press Secretary,” President-elect Donald Trump said in a statement Friday night.\n\n“Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator.

The “largest federal grant in Bay Area port history” was made possible because of the Inflation Reduction Act’s acceleration of our nation’s clean energy transition.\n\nReplacing the port’s diesel-fuel shipping trucks and cargo handling equipment with hydrogen-fuel and battery-powered equipment will dramatically reduce the region’s pollution, providing environmental and economic benefits while improving public health outcomes.\n\nThe article also states that “the future of that effort may be uncertain,” as Donald Trump is contemplating rolling back the IRA. This would be a huge mistake.\n\nThe IRA has already proven to be beneficial throughout the United States, with red congressional districts actually benefiting the most. This is no doubt why 18 House Republicans (including two Californians) recently signed a letter urging Speaker Johnson not to repeal this legislation — a wise choice, and encouraging development.\n\nCommunity effort\ncan accomplish much\n\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 20, MidPeninsula Regional Open Space District Board will cast their votes regarding the future of historic Bear Creek Stables in the district’s Bear Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve outside Los Gatos, following five months of unprecedented board and community cooperation and planning.\n\nAn Ad Hoc Committee process brought 50 volunteers donating thousands of hours together with untold director time to produce plans to revive the historic stables, restart the community programs of the past, and guide the stables toward a bright and profitable future serving the public.\n\nWednesday’s vote will demonstrate the benefits of this groundbreaking model for community interaction, a powerful tool for nurturing ongoing environmental stewardship and advocacy.\n\nSuzanne Cornelius\n\nKrugman column\nsupports opposing view\n\nRe: “Deportations will drive up grocery bills” (Page A6, Nov. 13).\n\nProfessor Krugman inadvertently makes a case for the opposing view.\n\nHe suggests that the United States would not be able to make up for lost workers resulting from deportations by hiring more native-born workers. His reasoning is that labor force participation is currently higher than during Donald Trump’s first term. He neglects to mention that the current labor force participation rate of 62.6% is down considerably from the high of 67.3% during the Bill Clinton presidency.\n\nHe thus indirectly reveals the much larger issue of why so many people have decided to leave the workforce. Perhaps the higher wages for low-skilled workers that would result from deportations would induce more people (both native-born workers and legal immigrants) to join the workforce.\n\nBrian Suckow\n\nFor the holidays\nreject consumerism\n\nThe holidays are coming and shopping has started. Please be mindful of your impact on the environment with every purchase you make. Do friends and relatives need more plastic, in the form of trinkets, toys, housewares and clothing? Do they need products that pollute as they are made and shipped across oceans or continents? Will the gift elicit a momentary laugh and then end up in the trash or being donated to a thrift store?\n\nMaybe they would be happy with non-polluting items such as attending local events, local specialty foods, gift coupons to clean cars, run errands, mow lawns or watch kids, or even cookies from your kitchen?\n\nConsumerism is a learned behavior. We are taught to want things to make us feel good. We don’t really need them.\n\nThis holiday, enjoy the season, celebrate your friends and loved ones and try to lessen your load on the environment.","summary":"Mercury News Letters to the Editor for Nov. 17, 2024","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/15/letters-1933/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EBT-L-PORTFUNDS-1112-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 00:00:05","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.061}]}
