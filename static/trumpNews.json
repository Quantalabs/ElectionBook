The man, thought to be Antoine Massey, is pictured in front of a blue car in the social media post, which sources say police are \"treating as if it’s real\". Massey, who has distinctive facial tattoos, was one of ten inmates who escaped a prison in New Orleans, Louisiana, on May 16 . In the Instagram post, the person claiming to be Massey, 32, says: \"I’m showing y’all the whole world how corrupted the state of Louisiana is. I’m an innocent man. Yes, in my past I’ve made mistakes... but the system has failed a lot of people and not just me.\" But Massey faces charges of kidnapping, rape, domestic battery involving strangulation and motor vehicle theft. The only other prisoner not to have captured since the breakout is Derrick Groves, who is a convicted murderer. Police say it is unclear where or when the latest Instagram picture was taken. Deputy US Marshal Brian Fair told reporters: \"We would encourage Mr Massey to turn himself in and go through proper legal channels for his day in court.\" However, earlier this week, videos emerged on social media purporting to be Massey. In them, Massey asked for help from key figures, including President Donald Trump , Kim Kardashian , and several rappers. In the footage, he displayed paperwork which he claimed proves he was wrongfully jailed in a domestic abuse case. However, Massey has spent time inside after being convicted of crimes. As a result of the clips, authorities raised a home in New Orleans home around two miles from the jail, where they believed the videos were produced. They said they only found some of the clothing they believed Massey wore in the videos. Speaking after the videos surfaced, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged Massey and Groves to \"quit the hide-and-seek game\" and turn themselves in. He is yet to respond to the latest Instagram post. When the prisoners absconded last month, they yanked up a faulty cell door , crawled through a hole in a wall behind a toilet where steel bars had been cut and then scaled a barbed wire fence using blankets for protection. It was one of the largest jailbreaks in recent US history. A maintenance worker was arrested after allegedly turning off water to a toilet covering a hole in a cell wall. State and local officials heaped criticism on the management of Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who has largely blamed the jailbreak on poor infrastructure and the inability to make needed improvements at the 10-year-old $150 million (£110 million) facility. Eight of the escaped men have been apprehended, leaving Massey and Groves on the run.","summary":"Antoine Massey, still on the run after escaping more than two weeks ago from a New Orleans jail, says the &quot;the system has failed a lot of people and not just me&quot;","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/brazen-instagram-post-new-orleans-35346188","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35346211.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_SDC_MDG_-_11748JPG.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 01:12:27","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.607},{"id":328576260,"title":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Kyiv under drone assault after Russia vowed to retaliate for attack on bombers","text":"Welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine, where the capital is under attack from Russian drones early and authorities say drone fragments have fallen in different parts of the city.\n\nWitnesses reported a series of explosions in Kyiv, with one of them reporting a large fire at a site where one drone had fallen.\n\n“Enemy drones are approaching one after the other on approaches to the capital from different directions and in the city’s airspace,” Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city’s military administration, wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe attacks came after Russia accused Kyiv of state terrorism over its daring drone operation striking Russian heavy bomber planes at air bases in Siberia and the far north at the weekend and said it it would respond as and when its military saw fit.\n\nDonald Trump said that during a call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday he urged the Russian president to refrain from retaliating, but fully expected Moscow to strike back.\n\n“It’s probably not going to be pretty.

(Bernama pic)PETALING JAYA: A senior analyst at a think tank has described the country’s new ambassador to the US as a pragmatic choice, saying Malaysia needs a steady hand in the post.Thomas Daniel, from the Institute of Strategic & International Studies (ISIS) expects Shahrul Ikram Yaakob to be able to handle the role’s wide responsibilities, ranging from high-level negotiations to the more day-to-day matters.Thomas Daniel.“What Malaysia needs in Washington DC now is an experienced and steady hand,” he told FMT, referring to Shahrul’s 35-year tenure in the diplomatic corps.“Malaysia does not need a maverick or headline magnet.”Daniel said among the new ambassador’s top priorities would be to secure high-level access for bilateral talks and promote Malaysia’s interests in the US, especially in view of President Donald Trump’s “maximalist approaches”.The new ambassador would also have to manage Trump’s aggressive and uncompromising foreign policy style and the “lukewarm perception” of Malaysia within US foreign and defence policy circles, he said.Shahrul’s predecessor in the role, Nazri Aziz, agreed with the appointment. He said Shahrul was the right candidate to strengthen diplomatic relations.Nazri Aziz.Nazri, who served as the country’s ambassador to the US from February 2023 to February 2025, said Shahrul had extensive experience, having served as Malaysia’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York.“This appointment is very appropriate, especially when we are facing the unpredictable foreign policy approach of Trump,” he said.Shahrul’s prioritiesSamirul Ariff Othman.Samirul Ariff Othman, an adjunct lecturer at Universiti Teknologi Petronas, said Shahrul needed to manage Malaysia’s neutral stance on US-China tensions, with the two superpowers currently engaged in a trade war.Yeah Kim Leng of Sunway University said Shahrul’s immediate economic challenges would be to reaffirm Malaysian neutrality and a longstanding relationship with the US.Yeah Kim Leng.He said it was critical that Malaysia project its neutrality as both the country and Asean may be perceived by others as tilting towards China.Former Sungai Benut MP Tawfik Ismail called for Shahrul to urgently protect Malaysian students studying in the US, with the Trump administration tightening foreign student visa requirements.He said Malaysian students must watch what they say and how they conduct themselves as Trump has been “very sensitive” to the actions of foreign students in the US.Tawfik Ismail.“The ambassador’s role is also to advise students on what they should do or not do,” he said, adding that Shahrul must also be at the forefront in immigration-related issues affecting Malaysians in the US.Shahrul, the former foreign ministry secretary-general, was appointed the new Malaysian ambassador to the US on June 3. The position had been vacant for more than four months.He holds a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Ecology from Universiti Malaya and attended the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in the US.Shahrul, who hails from Pahang, also previously served as Malaysia’s ambassador to Qatar and Austria.","summary":"Thomas Daniel of ISIS lauds Shahrul Ikram Yaakob’s appointment, saying Malaysia does not need a headline-seeking maverick in Trump’s US.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2025/06/06/new-ambassador-to-us-a-steady-hand-says-analyst/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/0e730142-shahrul-ikram-yaakob-bernama-300525.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 01:00:33","author":"Minderjeet Kaur","authors":["Minderjeet Kaur"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":328578218,"title":"World News | All Party-delegation Led by BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad Arrives in Berlin","text":"Berlin [Germany], June 6 (ANI): The all-party delegation, led by BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, arrived in Berlin on Thursday (local time) to convey India's \"resolute and united\" stand against terrorism.

The spectacular collapse of the relationship between President Donald Trump and his former first buddy Elon Musk could provide a lift for its struggling space division.\n\nAmid a shocking exchange of angry statements on social media Thursday, Trump threatened to cancel federal contracts with Musk’s companies. The world’s richest man responded by asserting that his rocket and satellite company, SpaceX, would “begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\"\n\nShould Musk do that, it could provide a boost for Boeing’s erstwhile Dragon competitor, the Starliner crew capsule. Thursday’s blowup could also have a payoff for Boeing in two other areas: the embattled Artemis moon landing program, for which Boeing produces giant rockets; and for United Launch Alliance, its rocket joint venture with Lockheed Martin.\n\nIt’s unlikely that Trump would follow through on his threat to cancel contracts – that would provide rich grounds for legal challenges, said Todd Harrison, a space and defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. But there’s plenty of room for the administration to direct new business to Boeing and others – and potentially pull back from the support Trump promised in his inaugural address for Musk’s ambition to reach Mars. “Where Trump can single handedly harm SpaceX in a significant way is redirecting the mission goals for NASA,” Harrison said.\n\nNASA contracted Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 to develop spacecraft to fly U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station on a commercial basis rather than owning and operating the vehicles itself. But Boeing has suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks with Starliner, leaving NASA dependent on SpaceX’s Dragon. The agency has since added three more launches to SpaceX’s contract, for a total of nine.\n\nBoeing has lost $2 billion on its $4.6 billion, fixed-price contract.\n\nThere have been questions over Starliner’s future following its troubled first crewed test flight to the ISS last year. Though it transported astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore successfully to the ISS, thruster malfunctions led NASA to decide it was too risky for them to return to Earth on Starliner. The astronauts were forced to wait aboard the space station for nine months for a Dragon capsule to arrive to take them back.\n\nMusk’s threat to retire Dragon could change the calculus for the administration.\n\n“I think NASA may feel that having alternatives would be wise,” said Tim Farrar, an independent satellite industry consultant.\n\nA wildcard: Russia hasn’t committed to supporting the ISS beyond 2028. If Russia withdraws, it could force NASA to deorbit the station earlier than the end of 2030, as planned, reducing the need for transport services.\n\nTO THE MOON\n\nIn its 2026 budget request, the Trump administration proposed a radical overhaul of the Artemis program, begun during the president’s first term to return Americans to the moon. The administration wants to phase out the giant Boeing-produced rocket at the heart of the program, the Space Launch System, after two more launches. Nicknamed the “Senate Launch System” for the pork the program provides, a single launch costs a steep $4 billion. The budget request proposed transitioning to cheaper commercial systems – with the chief candidates expected to provide them being SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n\nBut it hasn’t been clear that Congress would go along with cutting SLS, which supports jobs in all 50 states. The Senate Commerce committee reportedly is considering restoring $4 billion cut from NASA’s budget for SLS, and the Trump administration may not be inclined to fight them.\n\n“It seems more likely now that NASA may continue with an Artemis program that utilizes SLS,” said Harrison.\n\nOne other potential winner besides Boeing: Blue Origin. NASA has contracted the Jeff Bezos-owned company and SpaceX to both produce lunar landers for the Artemis program. With three successive failed flight tests for SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket, which is needed to transport the company’s lander, NASA could well decide to double down with Blue Origin.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY\n\nThe blowup could lead the Department of Defense and other national security agencies to redouble their efforts to diversify their stable of satellite launch providers, which is dominated by SpaceX. But the immediate upside could be limited for ULA, Boeing and Lockheed’s launch company, which needs to scale up the launch rate of its new Vulcan heavy rocket. “ULA couldn't take all of SpaceX's contracts, even if they were handed to them,” Harrison explained\n\nThe toxic breakup with Musk could also lead defense officials to reconsider how much they would want to rely on SpaceX for Golden Dome, the administration’s plan to create a missile defense shield for the United States.\n\n“This might give people pause when thinking about whether that money should go to Musk or to more traditional contractors,” said Farrar. Like, say, Boeing.\n\nGot a tip?

It’s a fight we’re unlikely to win","text":"The Australian Labor Party just won an election victory for the ages. Now, it may be forced to walk back one of the key achievements of its first term. \n\nHere’s why: United States President Donald Trump is about to declare an income tax war on much of the world – and we Australians are not on the same side.\n\nOver in the US, the “One Big Beautiful Bill act” – a tax and spending package worth trillions of dollars – has been passed by the House of Representatives. It’s now before the Senate for consideration. \n\nWithin it lies a new and highly controversial provision: Section 899. This increases various US tax rates payable by taxpayers from any country the US claims is maintaining an “unfair foreign tax” by five percentage points each year, up to an additional 20% loading. \n\nHaving been an integral part of an international effort to create a global 15% minimum tax, Australia now finds itself in the firing line of Trump’s “revenge tax” warfare – and it’s a fight we’re unlikely to win.\n\nA global minimum tax rate\n\nThe origins of the looming income tax war started in 2013, when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its plan to stamp out “base erosion and profit shifting”.\n\nThis refers to a range of strategies often used by multinational companies to minimise the tax they pay, exploiting differences and gaps in the tax rules of different countries.\n\nThe OECD’s first attempt to tackle the problem was a collection of disparate measures directed not only at corporate tax avoidance, but also controlling tax poaching by national governments and “sweetheart deals” negotiated by tax officials. \n\nUnder both Labor and the Coalition, Australia was initially an enthusiastic backer of these attempts.\n\nHowever, the project was not a widespread success. Many countries endorsed the final reports but, unlike Australia, few countries acted on them. \n\nAfter the failure of this first project, the OECD tried again in 2019. This evolved to encompass two “pillars” to change the global tax rules. \n\nPillar one would give more tax to countries where a company’s customers are located. Pillar two is a minimum tax of 15% on (a version of) the accounting profits of the largest multinationals earned in each country where the multinational operates.\n\nLabor picked up this project for the 2022 election, promising to support both pillars – and they honoured that promise.\n\nMixed success\n\nAround the world, the two pillar project had mixed success. Pillar one was dead-on-arrival: most countries did nothing. But Australia and several other countries, mostly in Europe, implemented pillar two – the global minimum tax. \n\nThe OECD has always maintained the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project was a coalition of the willing, meant to rebalance the way income tax is allocated between producer and consumer countries, and rid the world of tax havens. \n\nIn the US, Republicans did not share that view. For them, BEPS was simply another attempt by foreign countries to get more tax from US companies.\n\nThis Republican dissatisfaction with the OECD is now on full display. On the first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order, formally repudiating any OECD commitments the Biden administration might have given. \n\nHe also directed his officials to report on options for retaliatory measures the US could take against any foreign countries with income tax rules that are “extraterritorial” or “disproportionately affect American companies”.\n\nWhy Australia is so exposed\n\nAustralia could find itself in the firing line of Trump’s tax warfare on many fronts. And the US doesn’t lack firepower. Section 899 adds to a number of retaliatory tax provisions the US already had at its disposal. \n\nThe increased tax rates would affect Australian super funds and other investors earning dividends, rent, interest, royalties and other income from US companies. \nAustralian super funds in particular are heavily invested in US markets, which have outperformed local stocks in recent years. \n\nIt would also affect Australian managed funds owning land and infrastructure assets in the US, as well as Australian entities such as banks that carry on business in the US.\n\nAnd there are other measures that would expose US subsidiaries of Australian companies to US higher tax. \n\nThe bill would even remove the doctrine of sovereign immunity for the governments of “offending” countries. Sovereign immunity refers to a tax exemption on returns that usually applies to governments. This means the Australian government itself could have to pay tax to the US.\n\nThere are concerns on Wall Street this will dampen demand for US government bonds from foreign governments, which are big buyers of US Treasuries. The argument may sway some in the Senate – but how many remains to be seen.\n\nWhat Australia may need to do next\n\nWe may be incredulous that anyone would consider our tax system combative, but enacting the OECD pillar two was always known to be risky.\n\nThere are other, homegrown Australian tax measures that have drawn American ire. \n\nIn 2015, Australia enacted an income tax measure (commonly called the “Google tax”) specifically directed at US tech companies. In 2017, we followed this up with a diverted profits tax. Trump’s bill specifically targets both measures.\n\nTying ourselves to the OECD’s global minimum tax project might have seemed like a good idea in 2019. In 2025, it looks decidedly unappealing, and not just because of Trump.\n\nFirst, there is not actually any serious revenue in pillar two for Australia. Treasury’s revenue estimate totalled only $360 million after four years, just slightly more than a rounding error in the federal budget. \n\nSecond, we are increasingly alone and vulnerable in this battle. It might feel emotionally satisfying to stand up to the US. If there was a sizeable coalition alongside us, there might be some point.\n\nIf Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill act does pass through the US Senate, the Australian government and business will be left exposed to much higher costs.\n\nSince abandoning the US market is not really an option, it might be time to surrender quietly and gracefully – by reversing, at the very least, the contentious bits of pillar two.","summary":"Australian super funds, businesses and even the federal government could face higher costs, with the US on the brink of declaring a new tax war on much of the world.","url":"https://theconversation.com/australia-is-in-the-firing-line-of-trumps-looming-revenge-tax-its-a-fight-were-unlikely-to-win-257961","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/671485/original/file-20250602-56-7prr7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C383%2C4853%2C2426&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:55:18","author":"Graeme Cooper,Professor of Taxation Law,University of Sydney","authors":["Graeme Cooper","Professor of Taxation Law","University of Sydney"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.012},{"id":328575288,"title":"«Il est devenu fou», «quelle ingratitude»: Donald Trump et Elon Musk se déchirent sur la place publique","text":"La rupture est désormais publique entre Donald Trump et Elon Musk.

En retour, Musk a dénoncé « l’ingratitude » de Trump, allant jusqu’à évoquer son nom dans les dossiers Epstein. Une passe d’armes qui vire à l’affrontement personnel et politique entre deux figures majeures de la scène américaine.\n\nTout est parti du rejet virulent, par Elon Musk, du texte budgétaire défendu par la Maison Blanche. Décrivant la loi comme « une abomination répugnante », Musk a accusé Trump de manipulation et d’exclusion volontaire. Trump, de son côté, affirme que Musk connaissait parfaitement le contenu du projet. Pour riposter, il a menacé de couper toutes les subventions et contrats fédéraux de Tesla et SpaceX, estimant que Musk était devenu « fou ».\n\nLeur alliance, née pendant la campagne présidentielle de 2024, reposait sur des intérêts mutuels : Trump bénéficiait du soutien d’un géant de la tech et Musk obtenait des leviers d’influence à Washington. En retour, il avait été nommé à la tête d’une mission sur la réduction des dépenses publiques. Mais la remise en cause du texte budgétaire par Musk, combinée à l’annonce de son retrait des projets spatiaux américains, signe une cassure nette.\n\nCette confrontation tombe mal pour l’administration Trump. Le projet de loi est encore en discussion au Sénat, où les Républicains tentent de le faire passer en force. L’appel de Musk à « tuer le projet de loi » complique l’équation. Sur le plan économique, les répercussions sont immédiates : l’action Tesla a perdu plus de 14 % à Wall Street, soit près de 150 milliards de dollars de capitalisation envolés, ramenant l’entreprise sous le seuil des 1 000 milliards.\n\nDans une réaction qui dépasse le simple désaccord politique, Elon Musk a annoncé le retrait progressif de SpaceX des missions spatiales américaines. Son vaisseau Dragon, utilisé par la NASA, sera mis hors service, a-t-il déclaré. Cette décision intervient quelques jours après la fin de sa mission gouvernementale et accentue la tension entre le pouvoir exécutif et un entrepreneur devenu difficilement contrôlable.\n\nAu-delà du désaccord budgétaire, c’est un affrontement personnel qui se joue. Musk reproche à Trump de minimiser son rôle dans sa victoire électorale, tandis que Trump s’agace de ce qu’il perçoit comme une trahison. Les accusations lancées sur les réseaux sociaux, notamment à propos des dossiers Epstein, marquent un point de non-retour. Ce conflit pourrait avoir des conséquences politiques durables, dans un paysage où les alliances sont souvent aussi fragiles qu’opportunistes.\n\nFalse, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025","summary":"La rupture est désormais publique entre Donald Trump et Elon Musk.

Talking not so much about the reaction with the terror attacks and India's reaction, but more about India's growth story and the fact that hopefully this can be another launch point to try to attract investment and help to build the economy because ultimately that's the biggest bulwark against terrorism when people have opportunities and growth and India is really leading the way.\"\nDuring the interaction, the discussion focused on India's fight against terrorism and the multi-faceted India-US partnership. \"The All Party Delegation led by Dr. @ShashiTharoor interacted with members of various think tanks at the Embassy today.

This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.' \n\n'Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.'\n\nMusk has also posted on X to claim that the president is plunging the US into financial ruin. \n\nHe wrote: 'This immense level of overspending will drive America into debt slavery!\" \n\nIn another, Musk asserted: 'Mammoth spending bills are bankrupting America!'\n\nAround 2am on Wednesday morning, Musk continued his tirade on his social media platform.\n\nHe also reposted a series of tweets aligning himself with Republican Sen. Ran Paul of Kentucky, who has been vocal about his opposition to the spending bill. \n\n'I've been pretty consistent in my time in the Senate: I oppose deficit spending—no matter which party is in charge. If we don't get serious about reigning in the debt, the next generation will pay the price,' Paul wrote in an X post that Musk reposted to his page.\n\n'Fiscal responsibility isn't a campaign slogan,' Paul continued. 'It's a duty which I take very seriously.'\n\nBut Musk's soured bromance outburst did not end with his qualms with political spending after claimed that he was the sole reason Trump wont the 2024 election. \n\nAfter Musk sent a raft of insults at Trump, the president fired back on Thursday afternoon.\n\n'Elon was “wearing thin,” I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!' he said on Truth Social.\n\nHe added in a follow up post: 'The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.\n\n'I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!'\n\nThe pair's soured bromance reached new levels after Musk suggested the President should be impeached and replaced with 40-year-old Vice President JD Vance before dropping a his biggest allegation yet that Trump was featured in the Epstein files. \n\n'@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,' Musk wrote. 'Have a nice day, DJT!'\n\nJeffrey Epstein is a serial child sex offender who died in prison in 2019.\n\nTrump pledged to release the files related to Epstein, with Attorney General Pam Bondi releasing some pages in February, but most of that information was already in the public domain.\n\n'Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,' Musk added.\n\nTrump didn't directly respond to Musk's Epstein charge, instead posting what amounted to a shrug on Truth Social, while also continuing to back the 'big, beautiful bill.'\n\n'I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,' Trump wrote. 'This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.'\n\nMusk's latest online assault of Trump came moments after the president went on a tirade about the billionaire while hosting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office.\n\n'Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will any more, I was surprised,' Trump said.\n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry - not over the bill ballooning the deficit - but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla.\n\nTesla stock took a series of hits during Musk's time leading DOGE, and is now down 17.6 percent amid the pair's feud. \n\nMusk himself admitted he was leading his companies with 'great difficulty' amid his DOGE work as Tesla boycotts, protests and vandalism stirred within the US and around the world. \n\nIn March, crowds of hundreds protested the billionaire and his work in DOGE after thousands of federal employees were fired and terminating hundreds of aid contracts and federal leases. \n\nSigns that read 'No Dictators in the USA' and 'Burn a Tesla: Save Democracy' were seen in New York City at one protest. \n\nIn Texas, multiple bombs were found inside a Tesla showroom in Austin. \n\nAn arsonist used Molotov cocktails to fire bomb five Teslas before firing rounds into the burning vehicles at a dealership in Las Vegas, Nevada. \n\nTrump declared that the violence against Tesla was akin to 'domestic terrorism.' \n\nIt became clear that the bromance between Musk and Trump was over earlier this year as reports emerged regarding clashes the billionaire had with those in the president's inner circle.\n\nUpon his exit from DOGE, however, it became more likely that the pair would part ways.","summary":"As Elon Musk and Donald Trump 's feud continues following Musk's DOGE departure, the billionaire's own AI bot trolled him with the President's Tesla for sale.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14785603/musk-ai-grok-picture-tesla-sale-white-house-trump-spat.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/06/01/99095209-0-image-m-17_1749170115894.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:45:31","author":"Editor,Lauren Acton-Taylor","authors":["Editor","Lauren Acton-Taylor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.027},{"id":328575600,"title":"Mahmoud Khalil details psychological pain and reputational harm in new legal filings: ‘Efforts to erase my humanity’","text":"The Columbia University student-activist at the center of a legal battle with Donald Trump’s administration has filed dozens of pieces of evidence and statements outlining the “irreparable harm” he faces in an immigration detention center in Louisiana.\n\nMahmoud Khalil — who was arrested by federal agents nearly three months ago for his role leading pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus — also submitted a declaration of his own, writing of the “visceral” pain he experienced missing the birth of his son.\n\n“Instead of holding my wife’s hand in the delivery room, I was crouched on a detention center floor, whispering through a crackling phone line as she labored alone,” Khalil wrote. “I listened to her pain, trying to comfort her while 70 other men slept around me. When I heard my son’s first cries, I buried my face in my arms so no one would see me weep.”\n\nThe massive tranche of filings unsealed on Thursday also include statements from Khalil’s wife, his fellow Columbia students and professors, a former State Department official condemning his “arbitrary” detention, and experts outlining the chilling effect of his arrest and Islamophobic reactions surrounding his case.\n\nKhalil’s arrest has sparked protests across the country and fears the Trump administration is crushing political dissent by targeting demonstrations against Israel’s devastating campaign in Gaza. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he “proudly” revoked hundreds of student visas over campus activism, leading to several high-profile arrests of international scholars.\n\nKhalil, who is Palestinian, grew up in a refugee camp in Syria. He entered the United States on a student visa in 2022 to pursue a master’s degree in public administration, which he completed last year. He missed his graduation ceremony last month.\n\n“As someone who fled persecution in Syria for my political beliefs, for who I am, I never imagined myself to be in immigration detention, here in the United States,” Khalil wrote in his declaration.\n\nLawyers for Khalil argue he suffers “irreparable harm from his arrest and detention” — including First Amendment violations, his separation from his wife and child, and “psychological harm specific to his arrest and detention.”\n\nThey also accuse the Trump administration of damaging Khalil’s reputation “by baselessly identifying him as a risk to the foreign policy of the United States, marking him and his family as targets for harassment and notoriety and severely undermining his ability to pursue a career in international diplomacy and human rights advocacy.”\n\nKhalil wrote that he was subject to “dignitary and reputational harm, personal and familial hardship, including constant fear for personal safety, continued detention, restrictions on my freedom of expression, and severe damage to my professional future.”\n\nStatements from the Trump administration amounted to “attacks” against him, amplified across social media and into the lives of his family, he said.\n\n“These were not just attacks on my character,” he added. “They were efforts to erase my humanity.”\n\nHis wife Noor Abdalla described the moment Khalil met his newborn son through a plate glass window inside a detention center — one month after he was born.\n\n“It was an awful feeling for all of us,” she wrote. “Mahmoud was right there, but he could not touch his son.”\n\nThe filings follow a federal judge’s ruling that the Trump administration’s attempt to deport Khalil on foreign policy grounds is likely unconstitutional.\n\nNew Jersey District Judge Michael Farbiarz has asked for additional information before ruling on his release from detention.\n\nThe administration has accused Khalil of “antisemitic activities” and of supporting Hamas, which he has flatly rejected. He has not been charged with any crime, but officials claim Khalil can be removed over what Rubio has characterized as “adverse foreign policy consequences.”\n\nKhalil also is seeking an order to block Rubio from relying on an obscure immigration law to similarly deport other activists.\n\nThere are no further hearings scheduled in his parallel immigration court proceedings in Louisiana. The judge in that case has determined Khalil can be deported.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/mahmoud-khalil-details-psychological-pain-004454204.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/93fad553ba08c7606ebd44b924318539","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:44:54","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":328578212,"title":"World News | Tesla Shares Fall Amid Public Feud Between Musk, Trump","text":"Washington, DC [US], June 6 (ANI): Shares in Tesla plummeted on Thursday as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump fired salvos at each other amid fallout, The Hill reported.

In 2024, Trump denied any association with Epstein.\nMusk's allegation came just minutes after Trump threatened to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies.

You saw the words he had for me. The words are great. And he hasn't said anything about me that's bad. I'd rather have him criticize me than the bill because the bill is incredible. It's the biggest cut in the history of our country. We've never cut. It's about 1.6 trillion in cuts. It's the biggest tax cut. Tax, you would say, people's taxes will go way down, but it's the biggest tax cut in history. We are doing things in that bill that are unbelievable.

And, you know, they're having a hard time with the electric vehicles, and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning. He knew it for a long time ago. That's been in there. That's been, I would say, JD, that hasn't changed. That's been right from the beginning. I think, Mr. Secretary, that hasn't changed at all, right from the beginning.

He said, \"He wanted and rightfully, he recommended somebody from, that he, I guess, knew very well. I'm sure he respected him, but to run NASA. And I didn't think it was appropriate. And he happened to be a Democrat, like, totally Democrat. And I say, you know, look, we won. We get certain privileges, and one of the privileges went out to appoint a Democrat. NASA is very important. We have great people. General Kane is going to be picking somebody with, we'll be checking him out, seeing -- but he wanted that person, a certain person, and we said no. And, yeah, I can understand why he's upset.\"\nTrump mentioned that Musk endorsed him and campaigned for him and he is \"disappointed\" as Tesla CEO knew the inner workings of the tax bill better than anyone sitting here. He said, \"Elon endorsed me very strongly. He actually went up and campaigned for me... But I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this (tax) bill better than almost anybody sitting here. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair. We want to have cars of all types. We want to have gasoline, combustion, hybrids. We want to be able to sell everything... If you saw the statements he made about me.

Idealistic supporters always hoped the world’s most influential man and the world’s wealthiest man could maintain their peculiar camaraderie, and Elon’s tearful, televised Oval Office departure on Friday seemed to indicate there might be hope for these political favorites.\n\nBut guess what… love stinks!\n\nHowever, reality struck more sharply than Brigitte Macron’s double-face palm on Thursday, as Trump criticized his former ally in defense of his Big Beautiful Bill, which apparently wasn’t appealing enough for Musk.\n\nThe Rocket-man exploded over debt-busting legislation as a slap in the face to his cost-cutting at DOGE. And when Trump and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz (or as Joe Biden calls him, ‘Angela Merkel’) sat for a chit-chat, the subject of you-know-who came up and Trump went full Mean Girl on his former First Buddy.\n\n‘Elon and I had a great relationship.’ Had? Uh oh, I thought. ‘I don’t know if we will anymore.’\n\nOh no, mom and dad are fighting!\n\nIs this the part where dad tells us nothing will change and he and mom are still best friends? Nope! This is where mom takes all of dad’s stuff, throws it on the front lawn and sets it on fire.\n\nTrump accused Musk of attacking his BBB (the acronym for Big Beautiful Legislation is cuter in my honest opinion) purely to protect electric vehicle subsidies for Telsa. And Elon essentially called him a liar.\n\nThen, things escalated further:\n\n‘Time to drop the really big bomb,’ he wrote on X. ‘@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!’\n\nSorry, kids. But daddy’s not coming home… EVER!\n\nThe reaction from Trump-loving Muskians online is now progressing through the seven stages of grief, with most stuck on denial at this early junction. So I decided to call a fiscally responsible Republican to get the truth of this lover’s spat.\n\n‘Elon was never in this for EV tax credits, his dance with politicians has cost him way more money than it ever made him. And he knew that going in,’ Kentucky Republican Congressman Thomas Massie told me.\n\n‘So many politicians get into politics for their own personal benefit, and I think that’s why they have a hard time imagining somebody like Elon judging a bill for what’s good for his wallet instead of what’s good for the country.’\n\nThis Kentucky boy has been reposting Musk’s objections to Trump’s BBB and he’ll almost certainly face a Trump-backed primary challenger. But he’s ticked off MAGA world in the past, and even though he agrees with most of Trump’s agenda he gives zero Fs if he lives in Donald’s long, cold shadow.\n\nAnd if you think that was blunt, Massie was just getting started.\n\n‘I hope Elon stays engaged in politics,’ he said. ‘I think he’s learning he needs to be involved in primary elections instead of the general elections, because not all Republicans are created equal.’\n\nWell, if that didn’t just send a chill down the spine of free-spending GOP phony-baloneys then I don’t know what will. Imagine Uncle Elon dropping $50 million on your Republican House primary race, throwing his weight behind those who support his fiscally conservative visions.\n\nI had to ask Massie if he was so enthusiastic about Elon because he hoped the bad-tempered billionaire might throw some cash his way to reach the Upper chamber. \n\nHe quickly shut that down, saying, ‘I’m not running for Senate, that’s the same circus with different clowns. I’m not doing it.’\n\nIn a MAGA world where it’s a lot easier to go along and get along and stay under the radar, Massie is still confident in Elon’s judgment when it comes to federal spending and the necessary cutting that leads to economic growth. \n\nHe said of the fresh Trump-Musk feud: ‘I’ll trust the guy who can land rockets backwards to do the math more than I trust the politicians in DC.’\n\nSounds to me like Massie may be moving in on Trump’s old flame.\n\nHow uplifting!\n\nMaybe you know your favorite celebrity’s In-N-Out order (mine is a #2, protein style, whole grilled onions, add pickles), but do you know their plastic surgery order?\n\nAfter a TikToker complimented Kylie Jenner’s nice knockers, she responded with alarming candor: ‘445cc, moderate profile, half under the muscle!!!!! Silicone!!!’\n\nHold the mayo, I think I’m going heave.\n\nWrite or wrong\n\nAs if yak-happy dumdum Karine Jean-Pierre wasn’t useless enough when she was a bumbling propagandist for President Potato Head, now she’s spinning a tell-all book that promises to finally tell the truth.\n\nShe wouldn’t know the truth if it was wearing a neon-orange blazer and matching lipstick.\n\nReportedly, KJP was also eyeing a gig on ABC News’ The View, but they couldn’t be bothered to call her back. Perhaps they’re already replete with verbally incontinent blowhards. But, hey, I hear MSNBC has some vacancies.\n\nAntisemitic Swede Greta Thunberg has traded her climate caterwauling grift for a ticket on a ‘freedom flotilla’ that she’s floating straight to Gaza with a band of anti-Zionist zealots.\n\nHas this screeching Gen Z’er thought about what could happen to a free-speaking woman like her when she docks in Port Jihad?\n\nLips aren’t sealed\n\nOn Reality TV alum Kristin Cavallari’s ‘Let’s Be Honest’ podcast said admitted to a tryst with dreamy actor Glen Powell in Greece.\n\nShe says he ‘literally ran into’ her and they ended up ‘dry humping’. I hate it when that happens.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Powell couldn’t be reached because he was dousing himself in lime.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIf you thought the Dakota Johnson-Chris Martin breakup was the week&#8217;s biggest&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: MAGA Insider Unveils Elon&#8217;s True Plans for Revenge on Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/maga-insider-unveils-elons-true-plans-for-revenge-on-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MAGA-defector-reveals-the-real-revenge-Elons-plotting-against-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:40:16","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":328574046,"title":"Trump threatens Musk's government deals as their feud explodes over tax-cut bill","text":"WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to cut off government contracts with billionaire Elon Musk's companies, while Musk suggested Trump should be impeached, turning their bromance into an all-out brawl on social media.The hostilities began when Trump criticized Tesla CEO Musk in the Oval Office.

Appearing on the panel this Thursday, 5 June are Alex Davies-Jones MP, Darren Millar MS, Llinos Medi MP, Annabel Denham, and Mark Serwotka with host Fiona Bruce. They tackled topics such as the new 20mph speed limits in Wales and the surge in illegal boat crossings during tonight's programme. However, their debate was abruptly paused for \"breaking news\" as US President Donald Trump issued a scathing threat to Elon Musk. In the latest report, Trump threatened to terminate Musk's government contracts, which sparked outrage among Question Time viewers. In the \"breaking news update\" US President Donald Trump expressed his \"very disappointed\" stance towards the SpaceX founder. Trump elaborated: \"I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should've done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It's a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn't pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn't create this mess, I'm just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\", reports the Mirror . The US President expressed his frustration, saying: \"I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this Bill better than anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it, he had no problem about it and all of a sudden, he has a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we're going to cut the EVs because that's billions and billions of dollars. I'm very disappointed in Elon, I've helped Elon a lot.\" Elon Musk promptly took to social media platform X to vent: \"Without me, Trump would have lost the election. Dems would control the House, and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\" followed by an accusation toward the President for showing \"such ingratitude\". Disgruntled Question Time viewers who were attempting to watch the show on iPlayer shared their annoyance. One viewer complained on social media: \"You disappeared from the @BBCNews channel and from the iPlayer at 9:15pm! Instead we now have some random commentators chatting about the spat between Trump and Musk. Bring back #BBCQT!\". Another viewer voiced similar frustrations: \"#bbcqt why on earth has bbc news cut away from question time on iplayer and bbc news to tell us about a spat between Trump and Musk absolutely ridiculous.\" The host of Question Time, Fiona Bruce, announced that next week's episode will take place in Fleetwood, Lancashire.","summary":"BBC Question Time was briefly pulled from airwaves this evening as the public fallout between Donald Trump and Elon Musk rages on","url":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/tv/bbc-question-time-viewers-fume-35346168","image":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article35346166.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_SDC_MDG_-_11716JPG.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:34:56","author":"Michael D.

Under Trump, It's Becoming a Liability","text":"Washington, Jun 6 (AP) Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%. Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world's best students. Now, the booming international enrolment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation's borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education. Also Read | Donald Trump Says He's 'Disappointed' With Elon Musk After He Turned On Republican Tax Bill (Watch Video). Trump's latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and the college on Thursday filed a legal challenge against it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform. It's rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump's gatekeeping powers.

Ivy League schools draw heavily on international students: People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the US in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia's 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%. As the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants. “The Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,” she said. Over the last two decades, she said, US universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes US students and keeps enrolments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math. America's universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers. It was part of a “gold rush” in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities. “Whether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University. The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren't eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students, he said. Some wealthier universities — including Harvard — offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. Still, international enrolment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrolment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don't face that pressure. Supporters say foreign students benefit colleges — and the wider US economy: Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the US economy, and many go on to support the nation's tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields. In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard's government and design schools, along with five of Columbia's schools. Harvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education. “If you don't recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,\" Kirby said. The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings. “That was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,'” he said. Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%. The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights.” In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of “a painstaking, decades-long project” to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school's mission and reputation, it said.

Ảnh: THX/TTXVN \n\n DW (Đức) đưa tin, đồng euro đã tăng hơn 10% so với USD kể từ tháng 1, đạt mức 1,1369 USD đổi một euro vào ngày 14/4. Trong khi phần lớn sự phục hồi của đồng euro bắt nguồn từ tình trạng tháo chạy khỏi đồng bạc xanh do các chính sách thương mại của Tổng thống Mỹ Trump, một phần sức mạnh của đồng tiề.n chung phản ánh sự tự tin ngày càng tăng vào nền kinh tế Eurozone. \n\n Eurozone gồm 20 thành viên đang phục hồi sau một cuộc suy thoái nhẹ vào năm 2023, với mức tăng trưởng 0,8% vào năm ngoái và dự kiến tăng trưởng 1,3% vào năm 2025. Tuy nhiên, mức thuế quan 20% Mỹ sắp áp dụng đối với hàng nhập khẩu từ Liên minh châu Âu (EU), hiện đang tạm dừng trong 90 ngày, vẫn có thể làm chệch hướng triển vọng này. \n\n Đáng chú ý, nhiều nhà đầu tư đã dự đoán về sự phục hồi của châu Âu và chuyển vốn từ đồng USD sang cổ phiếu và trái phiếu châu Âu, qua đó củng cố thêm giá trị của đồng euro. \n\n Sức mạnh của đồng euro cũng đang được thúc đẩy bởi các chính sách tiề.n tệ khác nhau. Trong khi Cục Dự trữ liên bang Mỹ (Fed) đã bắt đầu cắt giảm lãi suất, Ngân hàng Trung ương châu Âu (ECB) vẫn giữ lập trường cứng rắn để ứng phó với tình trạng lạm phát dai dẳng ở một số khu vực của Eurozone. \n\n Lãi suất thấp hơn của Mỹ khiến việc nắm giữ USD ít có lợi nhuận hơn, thúc đẩy các nhà đầu tư ưa chuộng đồng euro. Mặc dù vậy, việc thay đổi tới 10% chỉ trong vài tháng là tương đối hiếm. Đồng euro ngày càng được coi là đối trọng với đồng USD trong thời kỳ địa chính trị đầy biến động này, trong bối cảnh ngày càng có nhiều lo ngại rằng thuế quan của Tổng thống Trump có thể đẩy nền kinh tế Mỹ vào suy thoái. \n\n Ưu và nhược điểm của đồng euro mạnh hơn \n\n Đồng euro và đồng USD tại Brussels, Bỉ. Ảnh: THX/TTXVN \n\n Sức mạnh hiện tại của đồng tiề.n chung euro mang lại lợi ích cho người tiêu dùng và doanh nghiệp, những người có thể mua các sản phẩm do Mỹ sản xuất với giá thấp hơn. Du lịch đến Mỹ từ châu Âu cũng trở nên rẻ hơn một chút, trong khi các mặt hàng được định giá bằng USD, như dầu và khí đốt, trở nên phải chăng hơn. \n\n Đây là một sự giải tỏa đáng hoan nghênh đối với các nhà sản xuất tại Eurozone vốn vẫn đang vật lộn với chi phí năng lượng cao xung đột Nga- Ukraine. Bà Rebecca Christie tại viện nghiên cứu có trụ sở ở Bỉ Bruegel còn bổ sung rằng các hãng hàng không và quân đội châu Âu cũng có thể được hưởng lợi từ mức giá rẻ hơn đối với các máy bay mới, cũng được mua bằng USD. \n\n Bà Rebecca Christie nhấn mạnh:\"Một số nhà xuất khẩu châu Âu trong khi đó có thể cảm thấy tác động từ việc hàng hóa của họ trở nên đắt hơn một chút đối với phần còn lại của thế giới\". Đức được coi là quốc gia châu Âu dễ bị tổn thương nhất trước sức mạnh của đồng euro, vì xuất khẩu chiếm khoảng một nửa GDP của nước này vào năm ngoái. Đồng tiề.n mạnh hơn khiến ô tô, máy móc và hóa chất của Đức trở nên đắt đỏ hơn vào thời điểm nền kinh tế lớn nhất châu Âu đang phải vật lộn với giá năng lượng cao, nhu cầu toàn cầu yếu và sự cạnh tranh gay gắt từ Trung Quốc. \n\n Trong khi một số nhà giao dịch dự đoán đồng euro có thể mạnh hơn nữa so với đồng bạc xanh trước khi kết thúc năm, thì hầu hết các ngân hàng đầu tư lớn đều dự đoán đồng tiề.n này sẽ dao động quanh mức hiện tại. \n\n Nhà kinh tế học Holger Schmieding tại Ngân hàng Berenberg (Đức) phân tích với DW rằng mặc du USD đang mất đi một phần giá trị, nhưng đồng euro không phải là lựa chọn thay thế thực sự. \n\n Ông Schmieding đã trích dẫn mức độ thiệt hại được dự đoán có thể xảy ra với kinh tế toàn cầu từ chương trình nghị sự thương mại của Tổng thống Trump và đán.h giá rằng điều này\"có thể gây áp lực lên tăng trưởng của Eurozone và đòi hỏi ECB phải phản ứng bằng cách cắt giảm lãi suất nhiều hơn\". \n\n Oxford Economics ước tính rằng nếu Tổng thống Trump tiến hành áp thuế 20% đối với hàng hóa nhập khẩu từ EU, tăng trưởng của Eurozone có thể giảm tới 0,3 điểm phần trăm trong năm nay và năm sau. Dự báo này giả định rằng EU sẽ phản ứng bằng các biện pháp đối phó có mục tiêu đối với hàng hóa của Mỹ thay vì trả đũa toàn diện.","summary":"Một loạt các đợt cắt giảm của ECB trái ngược với Cục Dự trữ Liên bang Mỹ (Fed, ngân hàng trung ương), nơi đã giữ nguyên lãi suất gần đây trong bối cảnh lo ngại rằng các mức thuế quan của Mỹ có thể làm gia tăng lạm phát ở nền kinh tế hàng đầu thế...","url":"https://vietgiaitri.com/ecb-cat-giam-lai-suat-20250606i7458637/","image":"https://t.vietgiaitri.com/2025/6/2/ecb-cat-giam-lai-suat-600x432-c84-7458637.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:31:23","author":"Bích Liên","authors":["Bích Liên"],"language":"en","source_country":"vn","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":328574038,"title":"\"I Will Be Going To China\" Trump Has 'Very Good' Call With Xi Jinping Amid Full Blown Trade War","text":"Last Updated:June 06, 2025, 06:00 IST Crux World\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke and agreed that officials from the US and China will meet soon for more talks to resolve an ongoing trade war.

In reality, beyond the cliche, I am indeed delighted to be here. Whenever I have the opportunity of being in the midst of younger generations like yours, it is an opportunity to impact the little knowledge God has given me. The Lead City University Model United Nations (LCUMUN) Conference 2025 is such an opportunity. The chosen title for this conference, “Empowering change: Youth leadership for a resilient future” could not have been more apposite. The timing of the conference also couldn’t have been more auspicious. Both take cognizance of the onerous responsibility on your shoulders as change agents and – yet another cliche – the face of the future of our country and the world. Today, our country and the world in its entirety seem to be face to face with a new order, a new normal, if you like. Right there in the United States of America, we have a new Sheriff in town, President Donald Trump. The world was not used to his against-method leadership. Brash, uncompromising, with a terse bother about the rest of the world, except America, Donald Trump is re-writing the global paternalism that America had been known by for close to a century. With America’s tariff war on the whole world and Trump’s reductionist mantra of Make America Great Again (MAGA) which has seen America discontinuing its Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, avuncular favour to, especially the developing world, America is unraveling afresh.\n\nIn Nigeria, too, a lot of negatives are happening. These happenings implicate national leadership and call into question the need to foster a leadership that is people-centric. While we have heard consistent and sustained promises of hope and redemption from the Nigerian political leadership, the honest truth is that our people are yet marooned on an island of hopelessness. The level of unemployment among school leavers is astonishingly high, with a degree certificate from the university not a sine qua non for a daily bread. Parents face such gruelling economic realities that make the platitudes from governments mere rhetoric. If global leadership is not offering hope to the youths of today, shouldn’t the world prepare for a transition to the leadership of those who, in a few years to come, would take over the baton of world leadership? This is where all of you in this hall come in.\n\nYou hold the future of Nigeria and the world in your hands. To illustrate this, permit me to recommend an African Writers Series novel for you to read. It is entitled The Future Leaders (1973) by Kenyan author, Nwangi Ruweni. The plot of the novel is wrapped around a lead character, a young graduate of the Makerere University, called Reuben Ruoro. Ruoro had huge hopes of youth leadership of an emergent Kenyan nation. The country was at this period transiting from a British colony into an independent nation. However, through misadventures and miscalculation of his leadership potentials, Ruoro gets into messy adventures and predicaments, which give poignant indicators of a potential leadership that could go awry if not adequately projected. This brings me to a discussion of the role of values in leadership. As the next crop of leaders of Nigeria, Africa and the world, what values are expected of you?\n\nThere is no denying the place of pride that values in leadership occupy. Indeed, values are deemed to be very crucial in leadership because of the moral compass that they present for guiding leaders’ decisions and actions. The more fundamental reason why values constitute an essential ingredient of leadership in any sphere of life is that they underscore and establish leadership credibility. They also inspire trust of the led, giving implicit trust in leaders’ ability to get things done almost seamlessly.\n\nEffective leadership comes with value ingredients like integrity, respect, and vision. Ultimately, these ingredients help in shaping decisions. This is because of the implicit trust the led have in the personal conduct of their leaders. These have strong taproots in the approach the leaders take in administering their followers. Apart from all the above, effective leadership also comes with hard work. As intending leaders, you must build yourselves, your tomorrow on the crucible of work and hard work. Hardworking entails doing more than the needful, dredging more than the ordinary and sacrificing beyond the normal. You must inculcate the philosophy behind personal sacrifice being at the heart of leadership. Anyone who follows my writing trajectory will know that I burrow deeply into and borrow hugely from traditional societies. My aim of doing so is to import values that made those societies thick for an application to our present modern world. Folklore, proverbs, lore, songs and customs constitute major pillars through which we can understand those societies. Permit me to use a particular traditional African song to illustrate the values in hardwork. It is from the song of Yoruba’s Apala musician called Ayinla Omowura. In one of his albums, Omowura sang, and I translate:\n\nAt cockcrow, when a man (by that very fact, a woman, too) wakes up: “If he is not pursued by something/He should quickly pursue something…/ Whoever works conquers poverty Let us work with dark hairs.” So that it can guarantee us comfort and rest of mind at the latter days of our lives. For a very long time now, Nigeria and perhaps the world, has witnessed a leadership that is not thorough, nor strong on the side of values. Your generation must reconnect with the lost values of Africa, some of which I mentioned earlier. These are values like integrity, truthfulness and commitment to the lives of others. The leadership burden Nigerians carry today is that our leaders seldom bother about the led. Their actions border strictly on selves. It is a leadership devoid of morality, integrity and honesty. Your leadership must totally depart from this depressing and destructive leadership model. At whatever level of leadership you find yourselves, endeavour to underscore, emphasize and factor in the other. You must work towards the uplift and betterment of those under your watch.\n\nIf you subsequently become part of the political class, never ever partake in the uncritical and selfish narrative that politics and morality are strange bedfellows. It is why Nigeria is suffering the kind of colossal regression it is battling with today, on all fronts. It is why, wherever you go, you will see survival of the fittest and elimination of the weakest as the abiding philosophy of Nigeria. Not only is this politics of immorality, you only find such politics in Thomas Hobbes’ state of nature. No one can empower your leadership to change from this status quo of immorality to a moral leadership other than you yourselves. So many of your colleagues cannot go to school today, not because Nigeria is not rich enough to provide them free education. Many of our countrymen die from avoidable sicknesses and diseases. Nigeria is wealthy enough to provide quality healthcare for its teeming citizens. This country is wealthy enough to pay social security to people with inadequate or no income as they do in the western world. But we cannot have all those because there is a rat race for primitive acquisition among the ruling elite\n\nMy charge to you today is, make up your minds to be impactful leaders. As leaders, you must feel excruciating pain if a day goes by without you impacting lives. A leader must daily wake up to assess impacts they made the previous day. If there was a statistical reduction in the number of impacts they made on their people, they must be sober and persuaded to jerk up their impacts subsequently. In today Nigeria, presidents, ministers, legislators, governors, commissioners and political appointees go and come back from government offices like snakes that glide on the rock – zero impacts. An impact-less leader is a barren leader and such people are easily consigned into the dustbins of history. While I am beginning to bring this address to a close, please believe in yourselves, even from now onwards. Begin to evolve in yourselves a can-do spirit, the Obama creed that made the first Black president of America. Begin to see yourselves as leaders and act it out, even in your small corner. Leaders are not only born, they are equally made. In your homes, act like leaders. In school, act like leaders. Among your peers, act like leaders. Seek the interests of the collective first before yours. Those are values that make the likes of Nelson Rohilala Mandela immortal today. Though their bones are interred and their flesh consumed by maggots, they are here with us and their leadership deeds are still stuffs of legend.\n\nAs members of The Lead City University Model United Nations, you must not only simulate activities of UN bodies like the World Health Assembly, Economic and Social Council, ICJ, Human Rights Council, UN Security Council, simulate the ideals behind those organizations. Study the lives and footprints of their past and present leaders who made impacts and find out what the chemistry was that stood them out. Begin even from now to find out solutions to the challenges that our hapless country is confronted with. Immortal Obafemi Awolowo, while a student in the United Kingdom, was literally consumed by the need to find solutions to the challenges faced by the Yoruba nation. He was bothered by why that nation was factitious and was always at war with itself – the Kiriji war, Ekitiparapo war etc. He was thus persuaded that he could find solutions to them. This was what culminated in his founding of the Egbe Omo Oduduwa, even while still a student in London. Those impressions are still imperishable today, close to a century after his mind hatched them.\n\nThe challenges of Nigeria can be put to one disease – leadership. You can redraw the map of leadership. You can change the leadership equilibrium. It begins today.\n\nThank you immensely for having me here with you.\n\n•Dr Adedayo delivered this speech as Guest Speaker at recent Lead City University, Ibadan Model United Nations (LCUMUN) Conference 2025.\n\nREAD ALSO: Reps task FG to take deliberate action on youth leadership development","summary":"Tribune Online\n\nYouth, leadership and values\n\n\nPermit me to begin this speech with the usual public-speaking cliche of how it is a delight for me to be in your presence this morning.

Ảnh: Kyodo/TTXVN \n\n Theo cổng phân tích thông tin News.az của Azerbaijan, hội nghị thượng đỉnh NATO tại The Hague vào tháng 6 năm nay đang trở thành tâm điểm chú ý của giới phân tích và chính trị toàn cầu. Không chỉ là một cuộc họp định kỳ, đây còn là nơi các đồng minh châu Âu sẽ đối mặt với áp lực chưa từng có từ Mỹ, đặc biệt là từ chính quyền Tổng thống Donald Trump, về việc tăng đáng kể chi tiêu quốc phòng. Những yêu cầu này, vốn được Washington xem là \"những đòi hỏi\" hơn là \"gợi ý\", đang định hình lại cục diện liên minh quân sự lớn nhất thế giới. \n\n Từ 2% đến 5% GDP \n\n Trước khi nhậm chức và trong suốt giai đoạn đầu nhiệm kỳ đến nay, Tổng thống Trump đã không ngừng kêu gọi các quốc gia thành viên NATO tăng ngân sách quốc phòng. Ông Matt Whitaker, Đại diện thường trực của Mỹ tại NATO, đã xác nhận rằng Tổng thống Trump \"đã nói rất rõ ràng rằng các đồng minh châu Âu và Canada hiện cần phải (đóng góp) ngang bằng với Mỹ\" trong việc chia sẻ gánh nặng chi tiêu quốc phòng. \n\n Năm 2024, Mỹ chiếm tới 63,7% tổng ngân sách quốc phòng của NATO, tương đương 754,7 tỷ USD trong tổng số 1,18 nghìn tỷ USD. Điều này đặt ra một gánh nặng lớn cho Washington, và ông Trump mong muốn các đồng minh chia sẻ trách nhiệm này. \n\n Ban đầu, mục tiêu 2% GDP cho chi tiêu quốc phòng đã được các thành viên NATO cam kết vào năm 2023, khi cuộc chiến ở Ukraine kéo dài, và 22 trong số 32 thành viên đã đạt được mục tiêu này. Tuy nhiên, theo ông Trump, mức 2% vẫn là chưa đủ. Vào tháng 1 năm nay, ông thậm chí còn đưa ra con số gâ.y số.c: 5% GDP. Một cảnh báo được đưa ra rõ ràng: nếu các nước NATO không đóng góp công bằng, Mỹ sẽ không còn cảm thấy có nghĩa vụ phải bảo vệ họ. \n\n Thông điệp này được Ngoại trưởng Mỹ Marco Rubio tái khẳng định trước cuộc họp của các Bộ trưởng Ngoại giao NATO vào tháng 4 vừa qua: \"Tôi muốn rời Brussels với sự hiểu biết rõ ràng rằng mọi quốc gia NATO đều đã cam kết tăng chi tiêu quốc phòng lên 5% GDP\". \n\n Ngay cả khi Tổng thư ký NATO Mark Rutte thông báo về mức tăng chi tiêu quân sự lớn nhất của liên minh kể từ Chiến tranh Lạnh kết thúc (tăng lên 3% GDP), Tổng thống Trump vẫn chưa hài lòng. Hội nghị thượng đỉnh sắp tới tại The Hague sẽ đưa ra một mục tiêu mới. Trong khi đó, Thủ tướng Hà Lan Dick Schoof cũng tiết lộ rằng Tổng thư ký NATO mong đợi các nhà lãnh đạo chuẩn bị tăng chi tiêu quốc phòng lên 3,5% GDP vào năm 2032, cùng với mức tăng thêm 1,5% trong các khoản chi liên quan - tổng cộng chính xác là mục tiêu 5% GDP của Tổng thống Trump. \n\n Nga: Thách thức hay cái cớ? \n\n Điểm đáng chú ý trong chiến lược của chính quyền Trump là sự mâu thuẫn trong lập trường về Nga. Để biện minh cho yêu cầu chi tiêu quốc phòng tăng vọt, ông Trump dựa vào cuộc chiến ở Ukraine, nhưng cũng tìm cách xích lại gần Nga và tuyên bố rằng Moskva \"không còn là mối đ.e dọ.a nữa\". Chính Tổng thống Nga Vladimir Putin cũng đã nói rằng Moskva \"không có lý do, không có lợi ích - cả về mặt địa chính trị, kinh tế, chính trị hay quân sự - để gây chiến với các nước NATO\". \n\n Lập trường này đã làm dấy lên báo động trong số các đồng minh của Mỹ ở châu Âu. Nếu Nga không còn là mối đ.e dọ.a, tại sao lại yêu cầu chi tiêu quốc phòng lên tới 5% GDP? Các quan chức NATO bày tỏ sự bối rối, và nhiều người nghi ngờ rằng mục đích thực sự của Tổng thống Trump có thể là làm suy yếu châu Âu về mặt tài chính. Theo hãng tin AP, chính quyền Trump đang cố gắng thuyết phục các đồng minh rằng việc Mỹ tái liên kết với Nga thực sự là vì lợi ích tốt nhất của châu Âu. \n\n Áp lực từ Washington cũng không hề suy giảm. Ngày 17/4, trong cuộc họp với Thủ tướng Italy Giorgia Meloni tại Nhà Trắng, ông Trump tuyên bố cam kết 2% GDP của Italy là không đủ. Khi bà Meloni đảm bảo sẽ thực hiện cam kết, ông Trump đã ngắt lời, khẳng định \"chúng sẽ được tăng lên\", ám chỉ mức 2% đã lỗi thời. Cùng ngày, Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ Pete Hegseth cũng hối thúc Pháp và các đồng minh NATO khác \"đảm nhận trách nhiệm chính trong việc bảo vệ châu Âu khỏi các mối đ.e dọ.a phi hạt nhân\". \n\n Tuy nhiên, Đức đã đưa ra quyết định nhanh chóng. Theo Đài phát thanh Quốc tế Deutsche Welle, Bộ trưởng Ngoại giao Đức Johann Wadephul đã tuyên bố sẵn sàng đáp ứng yêu cầu của Mỹ và tăng chi tiêu quốc phòng lên 5% GDP sau cuộc hội đàm với Ngoại trưởng Marco Rubio tại Antalya vào ngày 15/5. \n\n Cho đến nay, không có quốc gia NATO nào chính thức cam kết đạt mục tiêu 3,5% - chứ đừng nói đến 5% GDP. Các nhà phân tích cho rằng Bỉ, Canada, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Bồ Đào Nha, Slovenia và Tây Ban Nha khó có thể đạt được mục tiêu này. Ví dụ, Tây Ban Nha chỉ được kỳ vọng đạt ngưỡng 2% GDP trong năm nay. \n\n Tóm lại, hội nghị thượng đỉnh tại The Hague sẽ là một phép thử quan trọng để xem các đồng minh NATO sẵn sàng tuân theo ý muốn của Nhà Trắng đến mức nào, và liệu những sức ép này sẽ củng cố hay làm suy yếu liên minh trong bối cảnh địa chính trị đầy biến động hiện nay. \n\n Vũ Thanh/Báo Tin tức và Dân tộc","summary":"Cùng với

serious threat to rights, coalition warns (Canada)","text":"A national coalition of civil society groups says the Liberal government's new border security bill poses a serious risk to liberties and human rights.\n\nThe Ottawa-based International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group is calling on the government to withdraw the bill and replace it with more targeted legislation on specific border concerns.\n\nThe coalition brings together dozens of non-governmental organizations, unions, professional associations, faith groups, environmental groups, human rights and civil liberties advocates and groups representing immigrant and refugee communities.\n\nThe bill introduced this week would give authorities new powers to search mail, make it easier for officials to pause or cancel immigration applications and expand the Canadian Coast Guard's role to include security activities.\n\nThe government says the legislation aims to keep borders secure, fight transnational organized crime, stop the flow of deadly fentanyl and crack down on money laundering.\n\nThe bill comes amid sustained pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has cited concerns about the southbound flow of irregular migrants and fentanyl in imposing tariffs on Canadian goods.\n\nThe new bill swiftly won support from Canada's police chiefs and child protection advocates working to prevent young people from being victimized by online predators.\n\nThe International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group says the federal government is using the bill to seek powers in the areas of immigration and police access to personal information that are not related to securing the border.\n\n\"If the government is serious about addressing concerns regarding illegal gun and drug trafficking, it must introduce legislation specifically tailored to that goal, as opposed to a wide-ranging omnibus bill,\" said Tim McSorley, the coalition's national co-ordinator.\n\nIf the government pursues new legislation to replace the bill, it should undertake full consultations with experts in civil liberties, privacy and immigration and refugee rights before introducing it, McSorley added in a statement.\n\nThe coalition said it's concerned about provisions in the bill that would limit the ability of people to claim asylum in Canada and give Canada Post powers to open and search letter mail.\n\nThe monitoring group also noted there is no independent oversight body for the Coast Guard, which would be allowed to conduct security patrols and collect intelligence under the terms of the border bill.\n\nThe coalition says it also has reservations about proposed changes to the Criminal Code and the law governing the Canadian Security Intelligence Service that would make it easier to access information about internet subscribers, and would allow for warrantless police access in urgent circumstances.\n\nThe bill would also ensure that electronic service providers support the police and CSIS in criminal and intelligence investigations by compelling them to fulfil legally authorized requests to access or intercept information and communications.\n\nDuring initial debate on the bill Thursday in the House of Commons, Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree said a forthcoming statement would spell out how the legislation complies with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nAnandasangaree said the bill would \"bolster our response to increasingly sophisticated criminal networks and enhance the integrity and fairness of our immigration system, all the while protecting Canadians' privacy and Charter rights.\"\n\nThe Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police welcomed the bill, saying in a media statement that Canada lags behind its international law enforcement partners in the ability to lawfully access electronic evidence linked to criminal activity.\n\n\"Transnational organized crime groups are exploiting this gap to victimize our communities across the country through serious crimes such as human, drug and firearm trafficking, auto theft, and violent profit-driven crime,\" the chiefs said in the statement.","summary":"A

As a result, he said that he had the right under the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny them entry into the country.\n\nBut in Thursday’s court filing, Harvard dismissed that argument as the latest salvo in Trump’s months-long campaign to harm the school.\n\n“The President’s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the ‘interests of the United States,’ but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,” the amended complaint says.\n\nIt further alleged that, by issuing a new executive order to restrict students’ entry, the Trump administration was attempting to circumvent an existing court order that blocked it from preventing Harvard’s registration of foreign students.\n\nThe complaint called upon US District Judge Allison Burroughs in Massachusetts to extend her temporary restraining order to include Trump’s latest attack on Harvard’s foreign students.\n\n“Harvard’s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders — and their dependents — have become pawns in the government’s escalating campaign of retaliation,” Harvard wrote.\n\nTrump began his campaign against Harvard and other prominent schools earlier this year, after taking office for a second term as president. He blamed the universities for failing to take sterner action against the Palestinian solidarity protests that cropped up on their campuses in the wake of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nThe president called the demonstrations anti-Semitic and pledged to remove foreign students from the US who participated. Protest organisers, meanwhile, have argued that their aims were non-violent and that the actions of a few have been used to tar the movement overall.\n\nCritics have also accused Trump of using the protests as leverage to exert greater control over the country’s universities, including private schools like Harvard and its fellow Ivy League school, Columbia University.\n\nIn early March, Columbia — whose protest encampments were emulated at campuses across the country — saw $400m in federal funding stripped from its budget.\n\nThe school later agreed to a list of demands issued by the Trump administration, including changes to its disciplinary policies and a review of its Middle East studies programme.\n\nHarvard University was also given a list of demands to comply with. But unlike Columbia, it refused, citing concerns that the restrictions would limit its academic freedom.\n\nThe Trump administration’s demands included ending Harvard’s diversity programmes and allowing the federal government to audit its hiring and admissions processes to “establish viewpoint diversity”. When those demands were not met, it proceeded to strip Harvard of its federal funding, to the tune of billions of dollars.\n\nTrump also threatened to revoke the school’s tax-exempt status and barred it from receiving future federal research grants.\n\nBut the attack on Harvard’s international students has threatened to drive away tuition revenue as well. Nearly a quarter of Harvard’s overall student body is from overseas.\n\nIn May, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would revoke Harvard’s access to a system, the Student Exchange Visitor Program, where it is required to log information about its foreign students.\n\nThat would have forced currently enrolled Harvard students to transfer to another school, if they were in the country on a student visa. It would have also prevented Harvard from accepting any further international students.\n\nBut Harvard sued the Trump administration, calling its actions “retaliatory” and “unlawful”.\n\nOn May 23, Judge Burroughs granted Harvard’s emergency petition for a restraining order to stop the restriction from taking effect. But since then, the Trump administration has continued to exert pressure on Harvard and other schools.\n\nEarlier this week, for example, the Trump administration wrote a letter to Columbia University’s accreditor, accusing the New York City school of falling short of federal civil rights laws.","summary":"The Ivy League university has expanded an existing lawsuit to include Trump&#039;s latest actions to restrict student body.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/6/harvard-challenges-trumps-efforts-to-block-us-entry-for-foreign-students?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25149633753816-1749163122.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:22:14","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":328572374,"title":"Investors dump Tesla as Trump-Musk clash escalates","text":"Investors bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Tesla stock after Donald Trump was elected on a bet that politics were more important than profits.\n\nIn three hours on Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.\n\nShares of Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14 per cent in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world's richest man.\n\nBy the end of the trading day, $US150 billion ($A230 billion) of Tesla's value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded US companies.\n\nThe disagreement started over the president's budget bill, then quickly turned nasty.

an exemption from both the Trump administration’s baseline 10 per cent levies on foreign goods and the 50 per cent imposts on steel and aluminium.\n\nDonald Trump had told Anthony Albanese that an Australian carve out was “under consideration” but ultimately decided there would be “no exemptions” as he set about prosecuting his “America first” agenda.\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler said on Friday that Australian officials were working through a request to accept beef from cattle slaughtered in the US that originated in third countries.\n\n“We will be making a decision in the national interest,” Mr Butler told Seven’s Sunrise.\n\n“That’s what we’ve done in relation to pharmaceuticals – we’ve said there’s no way our PBS will be on the negotiating table and we won’t compromise our biosecurity laws either.”\n\nHe said the government had been “reviewing this issue for some time”.\n\n“This is US beef that’s raised in Canada or Mexico, not cattle raised in the US itself but then brought into America, slaughtered there and proposed for exports,” Mr Butler said.\n\n“This will be a decision taken on its merits, not for convenience, not to get a deal.”\n\nNoting Australia’s “very strict biosecurity laws”, he said the officials had been reviewing the safety of American beef with third country origins even before the request was made.\n\nAppearing opposite Mr Butler, opposition senator Jane Hume said the Coalition supported the caution.\n\n“We certainly don’t want to see a watering down of our biosecurity laws that would potentially put our beef industry in danger,” Senator Hume said.\n\n“This isn’t about protecting an industry’s prosperity, it’s about protecting an industry’s integrity.\n\n“If you are tweaking biosecurity laws by watering them down that’s something I think we would be very concerned about.”\n\nThe Prime Minister has also ruled out watering down biosecurity laws to get a deal.\n\n“No, we will not change or compromise any of the issues regarding biosecurity, full stop, exclamation mark,” Mr Albanese told the ABC.\n\n“It’s simply not worth it, so it’s that simple.”\n\nOnly the UK has been able to secure a partial exemption from the US President’s blanket tariffs.\n\nA key UK concession was scrapping its 20 per cent duties on American beef and raising the import quota to 13,000 metric tonnes.\n\nBut with many British goods still subject to tariffs, analysts have questioned whether the deal was worth it.\n\nThe US has trade surpluses with both the UK and Australia.\n\nAustralia also has a free-trade agreement with the US, meaning goods should be traded mostly uninhibited.\n\nThe Albanese government has repeatedly criticised Mr Trump’s decision to slap tariffs on Australian products as “economic self-harm” and “not the act of a friend”.\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell is in Europe this week for high-level negotiations on a free-trade deal with the EU.\n\nHe also met with his US counterpart and pressed for an Australian exemption from the “unjustified” tariffs.\n\n“Australia’s position has been consistent and clear,” Senator Farrell said in a statement.\n\n“These tariffs are unjustified and not the act of a friend.\n\n“They are an act of economic self-harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade.\n\n“We will continue to engage and advocate strongly for the removal of the tariffs.”\n\nMr Albanese has vowed to raise tariffs with Mr Trump when the two leaders meet at the G7 in Canada later this month.","summary":"As Labor vies for an Australian carve out from

In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated, \"I just concluded a very good phone call with President Xi, of China, discussing some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal.

During the conversation, President Xi graciously invited the First Lady and me to visit China, and I reciprocated.

However, China rejected Trump's allegations on Monday and accused the US of provoking \"new economic and trade frictions.\"\nOn May 30, Trump accused China of violating a recent trade agreement with the US. However, he did not mention China's action that violated its agreement with China.\nIn a post shared on Truth Social, he stated, \"Two weeks ago, China was in grave economic danger! The very high Tariffs I set made it virtually impossible for China to TRADE into the United States marketplace, which is, by far, the number one in the World. We went, in effect, COLD TURKEY with China, and it was devastating for them. Many factories closed and there was, to put it mildly, 'civil unrest.' I saw what was happening and didn't like it, for them, not for us.\"\n\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY,\" he added.\nEarlier in May, the US announced a trade deal with China in Geneva. US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said that there was substantial progress between the parties.\n\"I'm happy to report that we made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks. First, I want to thank our Swiss host. The Swiss government has been very kind in providing us this wonderful venue, and I think that led to a great deal of productivity we've seen. We will be giving details tomorrow, but I can tell you that the talks were productive,\" the White House quoted Bessent as saying.\n\"We had the vice premier, two vice ministers, who were integrally involved, Ambassador Jamieson, and myself. And I spoke to President Trump, as did Ambassador Jamieson, last night, and he is fully informed of what is going on. So, there will be a complete briefing tomorrow morning,\" he added. Earlier in May, the two nations also agreed to withdraw reciprocal tariffs for an initial 90-day period. The US and China arrived at an agreement that they will withdraw their previously announced reciprocal tariffs and counter tariffs for an initial period of 90 days.\nIn the meantime, China will impose 10 per cent tariffs on US goods, and the US will tax Chinese goods at about 30 per cent. The understanding was arrived at recognising the importance of their bilateral economic and trade relationship to both countries and the global economy, as per a joint statement. Both countries recognised the importance of a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship.

Fellow Trump-supporting billionaire Bill Ackman tweeted that he supported both men and that “they should make peace for the benefit of our great country.”\n\nGOP caught in the crossfire as rift deepens\n\nThe increasingly frenetic exchange between the president and the man who helped underwrite his third presidential bid capped off a whirlwind day that began with a call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping designed to reset trade discussions that grew acrimonious over the past few weeks, as well as an Oval Office meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to discuss the US’s tense relationship with Europe. \n\nTax-cut Bill sparks breakdown in ties\n\nThe dispute over the GOP tax legislation devolved into personal bickering when Musk called Trump an ingrate and suggested the president would have never won the election without his help. Trump responded by threatening a main source of the billionaire’s wealth. Musk’s Tesla Inc. and SpaceX have benefited from federal contracts and subsidies. \n\nSpaceX’s deep government ties may complicate Trump’s threat\n\nEnding contracts with Musk’s companies could prove legally and practically unwieldy, given they are deeply intertwined with US space and defense operations. The Dragon spacecraft carries crew and cargo to and from the International Space Station. \n\nTotal revenue for SpaceX and Tesla from federal unclassified contracts since fiscal year 2000 is $22.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Government data.\n\nImpeachment calls and Epstein accusations ignite firestorm\n\n“Go ahead, make my day,” Musk posted on X in response to Trump’s threat. Later, he responded “yes” to a Twitter user’s suggestion Trump be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance and argued that the president’s tariff regime would tip the country into a recession by the end of the year. Musk also needled Trump over his past relationship with Epstein.\n\n“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Musk wrote. \n\nThe White House declined to comment on the Epstein accusation. \n\nTrump claims EV credit cuts drove Musk’s fury\n\nTrump said Musk’s opposition to the bill was rooted in a provision that would scale back electric vehicle tax credits that benefited Tesla.\n\n“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!,” Trump posted.\n\nMusk responded that Trump’s claim he was asked to leave was “such an obvious lie” and “so sad.”\n\nTrump first voiced animosity toward Musk earlier Thursday, saying that he was “disappointed” by the billionaire’s criticisms of the GOP bill, saying its cuts to electric-vehicle tax credits drove his opposition. \n\n“I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot,” Trump said earlier during an Oval Office meeting with Merz. “He said the most beautiful things about me, and he hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that’ll be next.”\n\nMusk hits back on X as Trump speaks\n\nIn a remarkable scene, Musk rebuked Trump in real time, firing off rebuttals on social media as the president spoke. \n\n“Such ingratitude,” Musk posted, citing his financial support for Republicans during the 2024 election. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.”\n\nMusk floated the idea of creating a new political party “that actually represents the 80% in the middle.”\n\nMusk denied that motivation in a post on X, saying he was fine with reducing the EV credits if lawmakers “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.”\n\nConservative voices turn on Musk amid outrage\n\nThe public display unleashed a new torrent of criticism from longtime Trump supporters who had greeted Musk’s appearance with weary suspicion. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon told the New York Times that the US should launch an investigation into the immigration status of Musk, a naturalized citizen.\n\n“I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,” Bannon told the paper.\n\nMusk says GOP Bill adds to debt, hurts Tesla profits\n\nSince leaving government, Musk has criticized the Republican package — Trump’s “one big beautiful bill,” as he calls it — because it is forecast to add to the US budget deficit.\n\nThe legislation would eliminate a credit worth as much as $7,500 for buyers of some Tesla models and other electric vehicles by the end of 2025, seven years ahead of schedule. That would cause a roughly $1.2 billion hit to Tesla’s full-year profit, according to JPMorgan analysts.\n\n“I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here,” the president said. “All of the sudden, he had a problem and he only developed a problem when he found out we’re going to have to the cut the EV mandate.”\n\nMusk, in another retort, said he was not aware of the details. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” he said in a post on X.\n\nTensions grew over NASA nominee tied to Musk\n\nThe pair have also clashed over Trump’s decision to withdraw the nomination of Musk associate Jared Isaacman to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Trump said he pulled back the choice after learning of Isaacman’s past support for Democrats.\n\n“I didn’t think it was appropriate,” Trump said. “He wanted that person, a certain person, and we said no.”\n\nThe exchange is the latest in what has been a relatively swift break with Musk, who served as a Special Government Employee overseeing cost-cutting efforts before leaving.\n\nJust last Friday, Trump staged an event for Musk in the Oval Office, celebrating his tenure and thanking him.\n\nTrump recalled that in Thursday’s meeting with Merz, noting that Musk was sporting a black eye at the time. \n\n“I said do you want a little makeup? We’ll get you a little makeup. but he said ‘no, I don’t think so,’ which is interesting and very nice,” Trump said Thursday. “He wants to be who he is.”\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\nPublished on June 6, 2025","summary":"After Elon Musk opposed Trump’s proposed tax-cut bill—calling it fiscally reckless—the president threatened to terminate SpaceX and Tesla’s government contracts.","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/trumpmusk-feud-escalates-as-elon-demands-impeachment-tesla-falls-over-14/article69663513.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/j0prg7/article69663523.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-06-05T222304Z_559209536_RC2JSEAX82M9_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MUSK-REGULATORS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:15:45","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.101},{"id":328572958,"title":"Trump-Musk feud: Democrats call for release of Epstein file; say 'kill the bill' after Tesla CEO’s allegation","text":"Democrats demanded the release of Jeffrey Epstein's file after Tesla CEO and Doge's former chief, Elon Musk, dropped the bomb, making a striking allegation against US President Donald Trump. In a post on X, the Democrats, taking advantage of the Trump-Musk feud, have demanded to kill the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" and release the Epstein file. Musk drops bomb, says Trump name in Epstein files Elon Musk Thursday alleged that Trump's name is in the Epstein Files and that's the reason why the administration is not releasing the list. In a post on his own platform X, Musk wrote, “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” \"Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,\" he further added. In his post, Musk's 'big bomb' allegations is something different, not just casual or social association, though Tesla CEO did not provide any insight into his claim. It seems that he hints that more truths about Epstein and Trump's associations are in the unreleased files. What are the Epstein files? Epstein files encompass numerous court documents, particularly court records, connected to Jeffrey Epstein, a financial executive and convicted sex offender who passed away in 2019. These records, predominantly from Virginia Giuffre's 2015 defamation case against Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein associate, contain flight records, witness statements, contact directories and additional evidence linked to Epstein's conduct. The files identify several prominent individuals who maintained social, professional or other connections with Epstein. The presence of names in these documents does not automatically suggest misconduct, as numerous individuals encountered Epstein in casual social settings. The US Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has disclosed these documents progressively, with substantial portions made public in January 2024 and February 2025. Is Trump's name there in Epstein files? This is not a hidden fact that Trump's name is in these documents, particularly within flight manifests of Epstein's private aircraft, the \"Lolita Express.\" Documentation shows Trump travelled on this aircraft seven times during 1993-1997, predominantly between Palm Beach, Florida, and New York City. These journeys included his former spouse Marla Maples, their daughter Tiffany, a nanny, whilst Jeffrey Epstein was listed amongst passengers on several occasions. Epstein accuser Johanna Sjoberg's statement references an occurrence in 2001 when Epstein's aircraft was redirected to Atlantic City, whereupon Epstein proposed visiting one of Trump's gambling establishments. Trump's details appear in Epstein's contact directory alongside other notable individuals including Ivana Trump and Mick Jagger. In a 2002 interview, Trump described Epstein as a 'terrific' guy, though he subsequently separated himself from association following the emergence of accusations against Epstein. Feud between Musk and Trump Trump and Musk, once political allies, are now embroiled in a public feud sparked by disagreements over the government’s 'ne Big Beautiful' bill. Musk sharply criticised the legislation, calling it “a disgusting abomination” and urging Americans to “kill the bill.” In response, Trump expressed his disappointment, claiming he had cut Musk out of key EV policy decisions and stripped him of influence in Washington.","summary":"Elon Musk ignited a political firestorm by alleging Donald Trump's presence in the unreleased Epstein files, prompting Democrats to demand their release amidst a growing feud between Musk and Trump over government legislation.

The spectacular flameout Thursday peaked as Trump threatened to cut Musk’s government contracts and the tech billionaire claimed that US government hasn’t released all the records related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein because Trump is mentioned in them. There is no suggestion Donald Trump knew of any crimes or participated in any criminal behaviour. Musk even shared a post on social media calling for Trump’s impeachment and skewered the president’s signature tariffs, predicting a recession this year. The messy blow-up between the president of the United States and the world ’s richest man played out on their respective social media platforms after Trump was asked during a White House meeting with Germany’s new leader about Musk’s criticism of his spending bill. Trump had largely remained silent as Musk stewed over the last few days on his social media platform X, condemning the president’s so-called “big beautiful bill.” But Trump clapped back Thursday in the Oval Office, saying he was “very disappointed in Musk.” Musk responded on social media in real time. Trump, who was supposed to be spending Thursday discussing an end to the Russia-Ukraine war with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, ratcheted up the stakes when he turned to his own social media network, Truth Social, and threatened to use the US government to hurt Musk’s bottom line by going after contracts held by his internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget , Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social media network. “Go ahead, make my day,” Musk quickly replied on X. Hours later, Musk announced SpaceX would begin decommissioning the spacecraft it used to carry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station for NASA. The bitter war of words reached a new depth when Musk wrote on X: \"Time to drop the really big bomb\" before claiming that Donald Trump \"is in the Epstein files\". Trump's name was released as previously sealed court documents were made public last year, in which he was named as an associate of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein . There is no suggestion Trump knew of any crimes or participated in any criminal behaviour. The deepening rift unfurled much like their relationship started — rapidly, intensely and very publicly. And it quickly hit Musk financially. After Trump started criticizing Musk, shares of his electric vehicle company Tesla plunged more than 14%, knocking about $150 billion off Tesla’s market valuation. Musk lost about $20 billion on his personal holding of Tesla. Politicians and their donor patrons rarely see eye to eye. But the magnitude of Musk’s support for Trump, spending at least $250 million backing his campaign, and the scope of free rein the president gave him to slash and delve into the government with the Department of Government Efficiency is eclipsed only by the speed of their falling-out. Musk offered up an especially stinging insult to a president sensitive about his standing among voters: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk retorted. “Such ingratitude,” Musk added in a follow-up post. Musk first announced his support for Trump shortly after the then-candidate was nearly assassinated on stage at a Pennsylvania rally last July. News of Musk’s political action committee in support of Trump’s election came days later. Musk soon became a close adviser and frequent companion, memorably leaping in the air behind Trump on stage at a rally in October. Once Trump was elected, the tech billionaire stood behind him as he took the oath of office, flew on Air Force One for weekend stays at Mar-a-Lago, slept in the Lincoln Bedroom and joined Cabinet meetings wearing a MAGA hat — sometimes more than one. Three months ago, Trump purchased a red Tesla from Musk as a public show of support for his business as it faced blowback. Musk bid farewell to Trump last week in a somewhat sombre news conference in the Oval Office, where he sported a black eye that he said came from his young son but that seemed to be a metaphor for his messy time in government service. Trump, who rarely misses an opportunity to zing his critics on appearance, brought it up Thursday. “I said, ‘Do you want a little makeup? We’ll get you a little makeup.’ Which is interesting,” Trump said. The Republican president’s comments came as Musk has griped for days on social media about Trump’s spending bill, warning that it will increase the federal deficit. Musk has called the bill a “disgusting abomination.” “He hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that will be next,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office, presaging the rest of his day. “But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.” Observers had long wondered if the friendship between the two brash billionaires known for lobbing insults online would combust in dramatic fashion. It did, in less than a year. White House aides were closely following the drama playing out on duelling platforms Thursday with bemusement, sharing the latest twists and turns from the feud between their boss and former co-worker, as well as the social media reaction and memes. Officials in the extremely online administration privately expressed the belief that like the other digital scuffles that have defined Trump’s political career, this would also work out in his favour. Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office that he and Musk had had a great relationship but mused: “I don’t know if we will anymore.” He said some people who leave his administration “miss it so badly” and “actually become hostile.” He added: “It’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.\" He brushed aside the billionaire’s efforts to get him elected last year, including a $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes in Pennsylvania. The surge of cash Musk showed he was willing to spend seemed to set him up as a highly coveted ally for Republicans going forward, but his split with Trump, the party’s leader, raises questions about whether they or any others will see such a campaign windfall in the future. Trump said Musk “only developed a problem” with the bill because it rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles. “False,” Musk fired back on his social media platform as the president continued speaking. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” In another post, he said Trump could keep the spending cuts but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.” Besides Musk being “disturbed” by the electric vehicle tax credits, Trump said another point of contention was Musk’s promotion of Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Trump withdrew Isaacman’s nomination over the weekend and on Thursday called him “totally a Democrat.” Musk continued slinging his responses on social media. He shared some posts Trump made over a decade ago criticizing Republicans for their spending, musings made when he, too, was just a billionaire lobbing his thoughts on social media. “Where is the man who wrote these words?” Musk wrote. “Was he replaced by a body double!?” On the White House grounds Thursday afternoon, Trump’s red Tesla still sat in a parking lot.","summary":"Elon Musk has been attacking Donald Trump's &quot;big beautiful bill&quot; for several days and suddenly the pair both went for the jugular in an ugly war of words on social media","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/every-elon-musk-donald-trump-35346054","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35346080.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_President-Trump-Holds-Press-Conference-With-Elon-Musk-in-White-Houses-Oval-Office.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:11:36","author":"Tim Hanlon","authors":["Tim Hanlon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":328572652,"title":"Move Over Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Micron. Brad Gerstner's Altimeter Capital Just Gave Investors 2,999,536 Reasons to Check Out the Hottest Artificial Intelligence (AI) IPO Stock of 2025","text":"Brad Gerstner is the founder and CEO of hedge fund Altimeter Capital. Some of his more notable wins include being an early investor in data cloud company Snowflake and Asian ridehailing leader Grab.\n\nAs is the case with many investment funds, Altimeter has made artificial intelligence (AI) stocks a core feature of its portfolio in recent years. According to its most recent 13F filing, Altimeter trimmed its stake in Nvidia during the first quarter while completely dumping its stakes in Micron and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nInterestingly, though, I discovered that Altimeter holds a position in red-hot AI IPO stock CoreWeave (CRWV -17.13%). This comes from an investment Altimeter made when CoreWeave was still a private company. As of the close of trading on June 4, Altimeter's 2,999,536 shares were worth about $489 million\n\nLet's explore some of the core themes in the ongoing AI revolution to try and discern what may have motivated these moves. From there, I'll break down CoreWeave's business and recent price action to help determine if the stock is a good buy right now.\n\nWhy sell Nvidia, Micron, and Taiwan Semi stock right now?\n\nConsidering how robust demand has been for high-end graphics processing units (GPU) and memory storage chips, reducing exposure to names such as Nvidia, Micron, and Taiwan Semi looks like a head-scratcher on the surface. However, this is not the first time that Gerstner has shown some contrarian characteristics in his investment style.\n\nWhile I cannot say for certain what Altimeter's current thesis is regarding chip stocks or the AI movement more broadly, I've come up with some reasons that may help justify the fund's recent moves.\n\nAccording to industry estimates, Nvidia currently controls roughly 90% (or more) of the data center GPU market. While a lead like that might suggest Nvidia's moat is insurmountable, there are some risks to consider. First, Nvidia's revenue sources are heavily concentrated among cloud hyperscalers such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.\n\nEach of these companies has been developing their own custom AI chips, potentially signaling their intentions to migrate away from Nvidia's architecture over time. When you layer on top that the fact that Advanced Micro Devices has steadily been gaining momentum in the data center arena -- as its deals with Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms demonstrate -- Nvidia's growth could be on course for some deceleration.\n\nLastly, one of the storm clouds hanging over Nvidia at the moment is its exposure to China. New U.S. export controls and President Donald Trump's tariffs could cut into its sales there.\n\nMicron operates in a unique pocket of the AI realm. It specializes in memory storage chips, which are vital hardware for data centers, personal computers, and smartphones, among other technologies. With that said, memory chips are relatively commoditized. On top of that, a shift toward cloud-based AI infrastructure could potentially serve as a headwind for Micron's hardware-centric chip memory business.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor specializes in fabrication services -- its foundries are where chips designed by Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and a host of others are actually manufactured. While demand for GPUs and other types of AI chips is strong, a deceleration in sales growth from key customers (i.e., Nvidia) could trickle down to TSMC's business, too.\n\nFurthermore, most of TSMC's factories are located in Taiwan. Given the ongoing geopolitical pressures Taiwan faces from China, it's possible that U.S. chip designers like AMD or Nvidia could begin to turn to alternative foundry providers such as Intel.\n\nWhat does CoreWeave do?\n\nCoreWeave is a cloud computing infrastructure provider that offers its clients access to Nvidia GPUs and a host of other chip integrations. As such, its business is not as exposed to the time it takes to design and manufacture sophisticated hardware -- unlike the names explored above. In a way, this makes the hyperscaler more nimble than other chip and data center stocks, allowing the company to scale at a faster pace.\n\nCoreWeave is able to take advantage of the booming chip landscape but more so on the AI training and inferencing side. Ultimately, it fills the gap between producing chipsets and accessing optimized AI cloud infrastructure.\n\nIt's not that Nvidia, Micron, or TSMC are poor investment choices right now. It's simply that those businesses might be reaching levels of maturity, whereas CoreWeave's model could be in the early phases of exponential expansion.\n\nIs CoreWeave stock a good buy right now?\n\nThe chart below illustrates how CoreWeave's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has progressed since its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year.\n\nCRWV PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nThere are a couple of big takeaways from this chart. First, it's clear that CoreWeave has experienced notable valuation expansion. In my view, outsize momentum is propelling CoreWeave stock right now -- and buying in the wake of its recent climb could leave you as an unsuspecting bag holder.\n\nIn addition, CoreWeave's P/S multiple is almost fourfold that of Oracle -- which also provides core data center infrastructure services. Oracle is a mature, profitable business, unlike CoreWeave's high-cash-burn operation.\n\nWhile I understand the thesis behind CoreWeave's value proposition in the AI landscape, I think the stock is overbought right now. I would pass on investing at its current valuation, but would keep tabs on the company and its growth prospects.","summary":"Brad Gerstner's Altimeter Capital holds 2,999,536 shares of this year's hottest AI IPO stock.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/05/after-selling-nvidia-taiwan-semiconductor-and-micr/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F820089%2Fgettyimages-1358049777-8.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-06 00:11:00","author":"Adam Spatacco","authors":["Adam Spatacco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":328568480,"title":"World News | India Participates in G20 Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group Roundtable, Emphasises Strengthening Int'l Cooperation","text":"Geneva [Switzerland], June 6 (ANI): Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, PK Mishra, participated in the G20 Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Working Group Roundtable on the margins of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (GPDRR) in Geneva on Thursday and emphasised strengthening international cooperation.

Another milestone after the #AU becoming a permanent G20 member during India's Presidency in 2023.\"\nhttps://x.com/indiaungeneva/status/1930560792958541895\nDuring his visit to Geneva, K Mishra highlighted India's robust Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) financing system--cumulatively exceeding USD 28 billion--and called for concrete, time-bound outcomes and the creation of a global facility for catalytic funding, technical assistance, and knowledge exchange.\nWhile delivering India's statement at the 8th Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (GPDRR) 2025 in Geneva on Wednesday (local time), Mishra commended the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and its partners for convening the ministerial roundtable on DRR financing, emphasising that its journey from a USD 1 million allocation to a projected USD 42 billion under the 16th Finance Commission underscores the importance of a rule-based, structured financing architecture backed by the Disaster Management Act of 2005.\n\"India commends the UNDR and its partners for convening this important ministerial roundtable on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) financing. We also appreciate the efforts made by Brazil and South Africa in continuing the global dialogue on this vital subject through their respective G20 presidencies,\" Mishra noted in the opening statement.\n\"For India, DRR financing is not a territorial issue -- it is central to the effective functioning of disaster management systems and the protection of development gains in an era of escalating climate and disaster risks. India believes that a robust and responsive DRR financing architecture is a cornerstone of resilience. Our journey has evolved steadily and purposefully -- starting from an allocation of approximately USD 1 million through the early Finance Commissions, our cumulative outlay now exceeds USD 28 billion and is expected to rise to USD 42 billion under the 16th Finance Commission. India's experience underscores the importance of rule-based, pre-determined allocations that flow seamlessly from the national to the state and district levels. This system is backed by a strong legislative foundation -- the Disaster Management Act of 2005 -- which has transformed disaster financing from a reactive mechanism into a structured and predictable system,\" he further added.\nAccording to a post on X by the Permanent Mission of India at Geneva, India showcased the world's largest DRR financing system.\n\"Principal Secretary to PM delivered India's statement at GPDRR 2025 Geneva, showcasing the world's largest nationally anchored DRR financing system.
