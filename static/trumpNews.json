However, regular Bleachers ($2,000); Premium Bleachers ($4,000); VIP ($12,500); and Skyline Seats ($25,000) tickets were still available when Observer Online checked the booking website on Saturday evening.\n\nJamaica must win the match to secure automatic qualification to what would be their second Fifa World Cup, almost three decades after their first appearance in 1998.\n\nIt follows Thursday’s disappointing 1-1 draw with Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) in Port of Spain, a result that saw the Reggae Boyz slip to second in their Group B qualifying group on 10 points. Curaçao’s 7-0 win over Bermuda pushed them to the top of the table on 11 points, meaning Jamaica now need nothing less than a win to finish first.\n\nREAD: Jamaica stay in World Cup contention despite being held 1-1 by T&T\n\nREAD: Reggae Boyz ratings vs T&T: High marks for Cephas, but 4 and 5s awarded after poor showing\n\nJamaica Football Federation Technical Committee Chairman Rudolph Speid earlier issued a rallying call to the nation ahead of the match.\n\n“I’d like everybody to come out and support the national team.

(Photo: AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nNovember 15, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Trump says he will sue BBC for billions over video edit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Undefined (AFP) — US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would sue the BBC for up to $5 billion, after the British broadcaster apologised but said it would not pay damages for a misleading speech edit.\n\nThe broadcaster has rejected Trump’s legal defamation claim, but the president appears determined not to let the matter rest, even after the departure of top BBC executives and as the controversy threatens to become a strain on ties with London.\n\n“We’ll sue them for anywhere between a billion and five billion dollars, probably some time next week. I think I have to do it. They’ve even admitted that they cheated,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nTrump earlier said he would sue the BBC for $1 billion, an already enormous sum that represents 13 percent of the organisation’s annual revenue. It is mostly funded by a license fee paid by the British public.\n\nThe broadcaster has been in turmoil since the edited clip from its flagship news programme “Panorama” — aired before the 2024 presidential elections — resurfaced last week.\n\nOn Monday, the BBC apologised for giving the impression in the documentary that Trump had directly urged “violent action” just before the assault on the US Capitol by his supporters on January 6, 2021.\n\n“The people of the UK are very angry about what happened, as you can imagine, because it shows the BBC is fake news,” Trump said on Friday.\n\nHe added that he planned to raise the issue with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has backed the broadcaster’s independence while avoiding taking sides against Trump.\n\n“I’m going to call him over the weekend. He actually put a call into me. He’s very embarrassed,” Trump said.\n\n– Sensitive period for BBC –\n\nTrump’s lawyers sent the BBC a letter on Monday accusing the broadcaster of defaming the president and giving it until Friday to apologize and pay compensation.\n\nThe BBC said Thursday that its chairman Samir Shah had sent “a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president’s speech.”\n\nHowever, it added: “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n\nIn Britain, the controversy has reignited a heated debate on the operations and impartiality of public broadcasting, as the organization has already been shaken in recent years by several scandals.\n\nThe editing row comes at a politically sensitive time for the BBC, which is due to renegotiate the Royal Charter that outlines the corporation’s governance. Its current charter will end in 2027.\n\nThe firestorm over the video edit has led the BBC director-general and the organization’s top news executive to resign.\n\nThe broadcaster has confirmed it is also investigating another edit of Trump’s speech from the day of the Capital riots, which the Telegraph newspaper reported had aired in June 2022 on the BBC’s “Newsnight” program.\n\nIn an interview with UK channel GB News broadcast on Friday, Trump again said he had an obligation to pursue legal action.\n\n“This was so egregious,” he said of the video edit.\n\n“If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: BBC Donald Trump Lawsuit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Joint Dominican-US operation halts alleged cocaine-smuggling boat \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AFP) -- Authorities in the Dominican Republic said Saturday they seized about 500 kilograms of cocaine from a boat ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene says she’s facing threats ‘fueled’ by president \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) -- Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former key political ally of Donald Trump, said Saturday she was being targeted by a wave... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alcaraz secures ATP Finals showdown with great rival Sinner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n TURIN, Italy (AFP) -- Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will face off for the ATP Finals title after tennis' two biggest stars cruised into the final o... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reynolds Entertainment rejects ‘unprofessionalism’ allegation by Allison Hinds after Cayman Fiesta non-appearance \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n Cayman Fiesta organiser Reynolds Entertainment Agency has refuted allegations of \"unprofessionalism\" and \"disrespect\" made by soca star Alison Hinds a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaican extradited to US facing charges for lottery scam involvement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (CMC) - A Jamaican man extradited to the United States to face fraud charges has been ordered detained pending trial for all... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trelawny community shops keeping prices steady, residents connected amid disaster \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm, Observer Online Reporter, malcolmd@jamiacaobserver.com \n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n Amid reports of price gouging in some areas following the passage of Hurricane Melissa, residents in Bounty Hall, Trelawny say their local corner shop... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n George Wright pleads for non-political distribution of hurricane relief supplies \n\n\n\n\n Rosalee Wood Condell, Observer writer \n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n WESTMORELAND, Jamaica - Former Member of Parliament for Westmoreland Central, the Jamaica Labour Party's George Wright claims some constituents are no... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

The US accuses Maduro of leading a drug cartel and is offering a $50 million reward for his capture.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said he had “sort of” decided his next steps regarding Venezuela, but declined to share further details. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: cocaine smuggling Dominican Republic United States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene says she’s facing threats ‘fueled’ by president \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) -- Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former key political ally of Donald Trump, said Saturday she was being targeted by a wave... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alcaraz secures ATP Finals showdown with great rival Sinner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n TURIN, Italy (AFP) -- Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will face off for the ATP Finals title after tennis' two biggest stars cruised into the final o... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reynolds Entertainment rejects ‘unprofessionalism’ allegation by Allison Hinds after Cayman Fiesta non-appearance \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n Cayman Fiesta organiser Reynolds Entertainment Agency has refuted allegations of \"unprofessionalism\" and \"disrespect\" made by soca star Alison Hinds a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaican extradited to US facing charges for lottery scam involvement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (CMC) - A Jamaican man extradited to the United States to face fraud charges has been ordered detained pending trial for all... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trelawny community shops keeping prices steady, residents connected amid disaster \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm, Observer Online Reporter, malcolmd@jamiacaobserver.com \n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n Amid reports of price gouging in some areas following the passage of Hurricane Melissa, residents in Bounty Hall, Trelawny say their local corner shop... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n George Wright pleads for non-political distribution of hurricane relief supplies \n\n\n\n\n Rosalee Wood Condell, Observer writer \n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n WESTMORELAND, Jamaica - Former Member of Parliament for Westmoreland Central, the Jamaica Labour Party's George Wright claims some constituents are no... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Opposition urges Government to act as garbage piles raise fears of disease outbreak \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Opposition People’s National Party (PNP) is calling on the Government to urgently implement a comprehensive national plan to a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Trump expressed frustration with her for the first time on Monday, saying she had “lost her way.”\n\nGreene’s sudden shift has prompted speculation that she is lining up for her own presidential bid in 2028, although she has dismissed it as “baseless gossip.”\n\nPerhaps the most sensitive area of criticism has been Greene’s position on the Epstein scandal, which ensnared Trump again in recent days with the release of a new trove of emails.\n\nAfter becoming a leading voice calling for justice for victims of the notorious sex offender over the summer, Greene this week was one of a few MAGA rebels who backed a push to vote on demanding the public release of files relating to the Epstein probe.\n\nIn her Saturday morning post on X, she again touched on the Epstein scandal. \n\n“As a woman I take threats from men seriously,” Greene said. “I now have a small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Donald Trump MAGA Make America Great Again Marjorie Taylor Greene \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alcaraz secures ATP Finals showdown with great rival Sinner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n TURIN, Italy (AFP) -- Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will face off for the ATP Finals title after tennis' two biggest stars cruised into the final o... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reynolds Entertainment rejects ‘unprofessionalism’ allegation by Allison Hinds after Cayman Fiesta non-appearance \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n Cayman Fiesta organiser Reynolds Entertainment Agency has refuted allegations of \"unprofessionalism\" and \"disrespect\" made by soca star Alison Hinds a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaican extradited to US facing charges for lottery scam involvement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (CMC) - A Jamaican man extradited to the United States to face fraud charges has been ordered detained pending trial for all... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trelawny community shops keeping prices steady, residents connected amid disaster \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm, Observer Online Reporter, malcolmd@jamiacaobserver.com \n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n Amid reports of price gouging in some areas following the passage of Hurricane Melissa, residents in Bounty Hall, Trelawny say their local corner shop... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n George Wright pleads for non-political distribution of hurricane relief supplies \n\n\n\n\n Rosalee Wood Condell, Observer writer \n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n WESTMORELAND, Jamaica - Former Member of Parliament for Westmoreland Central, the Jamaica Labour Party's George Wright claims some constituents are no... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Opposition urges Government to act as garbage piles raise fears of disease outbreak \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Opposition People’s National Party (PNP) is calling on the Government to urgently implement a comprehensive national plan to a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11 things you must bring on your relief trip to hurricane-ravaged parishes \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 15, 2025 \n\n\n In the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Jamaicans islandwide are joining forces to support families in the hardest-hit parishes as they begin the long ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Speaking on ABC television, Wong said the removal of US duties on more than 200 food products, including beef, would support both Australian exporters and American consumers facing rising grocery prices.\"We welcome the lifting of these tariffs. That's a good thing for Australian beef producers,\" she said.Australia became the United States’ largest supplier of red meat in 2024, offering competitively priced, leaner cuts that complement US domestic production. Wong said the tariff removal reflects the importance of open markets, noting that access benefits both consumers and producers on both sides..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}However, Wong declined to speculate on whether Australia now expects Trump to reverse the 50 per cent tariffs still imposed on Australian steel and aluminium. The Albanese government has pushed Washington for relief on these measures but has yet to see movement. “We’ll keep advocating our position,” Wong said.Trump’s decision on beef came shortly after the US reached agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Argentina to reduce agricultural import taxes: part of a broader push to address voter frustration over rising food and living costs. Earlier in the week, Trump also suggested lowering tariffs on coffee to encourage more imports.While Trump campaigned on rebuilding American manufacturing and tackling inflation, many US households continue to face higher bills for groceries, electricity, and housing. Despite this, he has defended his economic record, claiming his policies have strengthened the economy.Australian beef exports to the US surged to A$4 billion ($2.64 billion) last year amid a slump in American beef production. Months after Trump criticised the trade imbalance, Australia eased its own restrictions on US beef imports. Australia has shipped between 150,000 and 400,000 tonnes of beef annually to the US since 1990, where demand remains strong—particularly among fast-food chains.- EndsWith inputs from ReutersPublished By: Aashish VashisthaPublished On: Nov 16, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/australia-praises-trumps-removal-of-beef-tariffs-as-good-thing-for-producers-glbs-2820568-2025-11-16","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/penny-wong-161811400-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=xrhAk9mBZhrabJ9Gl4b4Y422mnPBCgOC?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 01:18:29","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.452},{"id":379402472,"title":"Trump Calls Marjorie Taylor Greene a ‘Traitor’ Over Her Push to Release Epstein Files","text":"Donald Trump is turning his flamethrower on one of his own, and this time the target is a congresswoman who built her political identity around defending him at every turn.\n\nOver the weekend, the president used his Truth Social feed to call Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene a “traitor,” ripping into her for backing a push to force the release of the remaining Jeffrey Epstein files and accusing her of betraying the party she claims to champion.\n\n“Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!” Trump wrote in one of several posts, misspelling her name as his allies cheered the attack and his critics recoiled. In another post, he mocked her as “Lightweight Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Brown (Green grass turns Brown when it begins to ROT!)” and claimed she had “betrayed the entire Republican Party when she turned Left, performed poorly on the pathetic View, and became the RINO that we all know she always was.” He added that she was “just another Fake politician,” even lumping her in with Rep. Thomas Massie, whom he derided as “Rand Paul Jr.”\n\nTrump calls Marjorie Taylor Greene “Marjorie Traitor Green” on Truth Social. Is Speaker Johnson ok with this? pic.twitter.com/2S2PNz8F20\n— Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 15, 2025\n\nThe insults came less than a day after Trump publicly withdrew his endorsement, announcing he was abandoning Greene and promising “Complete and Unyielding Support” to any conservative primary challenger in 2026. He also called her “wacky” and a “lunatic,” complaining that all she does is “complain.”\n\nGreene fired back quickly. In a late night post on X, she said Trump had “attacked me and lied about me.” She warned that he was “coming after” her to “make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files.” She framed the feud as part of a broader effort to intimidate anyone who crosses him on transparency.\n\nThe break between them has been building for weeks, driven by Greene’s support for a bipartisan House effort to force the full release of the remaining Justice Department files on Epstein, the disgraced financier and sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019.\n\nDonald J. Trump Truth Social Post 08:40 AM EST 11/15/25 pic.twitter.com/K6cTxZyMRq\n— Commentary Donald J. Trump Posts From Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) November 15, 2025\n\nGreene was one of just four Republicans to side with Democrats in advancing a petition to bring the matter to the floor. She has been adamant that the victims deserve clarity. “I think it’s a huge miscalculation, and I truly just stand with the women,” she said in an interview with CBS Mornings, adding that the point is to show authorities “will not protect the predators,” regardless of wealth or political connections.\n\nMeanwhile, newly released documents from Congress have reignited political pressure on the White House, including emails in which Epstein claimed that Trump “knew about the girls” he was bringing into his orbit. Confronted with those claims, Trump dismissed them outright. “I know nothing about that,” he said, calling the broader controversy a Democratic “hoax” and insisting that “if they had anything they would’ve used it before the election.” He has consistently denied any wrongdoing tied to Epstein.\n\nThe Epstein fight is only one of several policy breaks between the pair. Greene recently criticized Trump’s trial balloon for 50 year mortgages, saying she does not see half century loans as a real solution to the housing crisis. She has also described his tariff rollout as uneven, pushed him to focus more aggressively on rising healthcare costs, and rejected his reassurance that inflation is stabilizing. On foreign policy, she has gone further than most Republicans, calling the humanitarian crisis in Gaza “genocide,” a stance sharply at odds with the party’s mainstream.\n\nPut together, Trump’s “Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Green” broadside now reads less like a one day flare up and more like a political divorce. Greene is betting that standing with Epstein’s victims and charting her own populist path will matter more than staying in Trump’s good graces. Trump, meanwhile, is making clear there is no room in his inner circle for an ally who won’t fall in line on the most politically explosive files in the country.","summary":"Trump’s attack on Greene signals a political breakup, with the Epstein files at the center.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-calls-marjorie-taylor-greene-a-traitor-over-her-push-to-release-epstein-files","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Donald-Trump-shouting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 01:00:00","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":379402392,"title":"Democratic lawmaker texted Epstein during hearing — appeared to use his tips to grill Trump’s ex-lawyer","text":"A Democratic lawmaker admitted to texting with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, seeking his advice on how to question President Donald Trump's so-called \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen.\n\nCohen has claimed that Trump tried to conceal a $130,000 hush-money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels to hide an alleged extramarital affair. Trump has denied these claims, stating that the funds were sent directly to Cohen, his then-personal attorney, for legal expenses.

Met your friend Bill Clinton yesterday, followed up with [Nicholas] Sarkozy. Later in the day meeting your other friend Prince Andrew as he has some questions re Microsoft.'\n\nThe former Duke of York was in Davos in his capacity as UK special representative for international trade and investment at the time. He stepped down in 2011. \n\nEpstein writes back: 'You can tell Andrew we are friends.'\n\nWhen he is told by Nikolic that he does not 'need anything from him', Epstein responds: 'Yes you do. You need to laugh and have fun. He is good at that... He's great fun.' \n\nNikolic, who was name an an executor of Epstein's will after he died in 2019, replied and said he had heard that Andrew 'is not that fun, but I trust your judgement.'\n\nHe added that 'it would be blast that you are here. I was just flirting with 22 years old hot blond blue eyes mexican chick. \n\n'It turns out she is with her husband. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented.' \n\nHe added a winking face emoji to the end of his email. \n\nAnd after meeting with Andrew, Nikolic reported back to Epstein, writing: 'He is great... I think I would trade Davos for a good fashion week. Much more fun.' \n\nNikolic has previously said he was 'shocked' to be named a back-up executor on Epstein's will and has said he would not fulfil his duties if he was called upon to do so. \n\nThe email chain, which was released by the US Congress last week, was amid more than 20,000 documents obtained by the House oversight committee from the Epstein estate. \n\nThe documents also shed light on Epstein's connections, with one email to Jes Stalety, former bank boss at Barclays, suggesting that the former financier helped to arrange a meeting in Davos in 2010 between Staley, Lord Mandelson and Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time. \n\nThe email, written by Epstein, reads: 'I've set up you and Peter to meet in Davos with Darling.' \n\nLord Mandelson resigned as the UK ambassador to Washington earlier this year after he was found to have previously referred to Epstein as 'my best pal'. \n\nHe has said felt 'utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago'. \n\nBut messages showed he was still in contact with Epstein as late as 2016 - years after his conviction.\n\nThe correspondence shows that Mandelson took relationship advice from the Epstein and urged him to steer clear of Andrew.\n\nIn one email from Epstein to Mandelson on 6 November 2016, he writes '63 years old. You made it' not long after his birthday.\n\nMandelson replies within hours saying: 'Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US' before Epstein replies 'in the Donald White House' referring to the US presidential election due later that week.\n\nEpstein goes on to say 'you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]', seemingly a reference to Mandelson's partner Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.\n\nAnother email shows the 72-year-old advising Epstein not to speak to Radio 4's Today programme after he was approach about an 'interview' over his relationship with Andrew. \n\nWhen Epstein forwarded him the BBC's letter, Lord Mandelson replies 'No!!' \n\nThe publication of the emails comes amid a congressional inquiry into why Epstein, who died in a New York prison while awaiting trial for multiple sex trafficking offences, was not brought to justice at federal level. \n\nCongress is expected to vote on a motion which would demand the release of all the Epstein files held by the US Department of Justice in the coming weeks. \n\nIt comes as Andrew faced further pressure to appear in front of US politicians after Epstein was revealed to have confirmed the infamous photo of him with a teenage Virginia Giuffre is real amid other messages released this week. \n\nThe messages, in a bombshell cache of emails dating back to 2011, showed Epstein urged a journalist to investigate Ms Giuffre while admitting: 'Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have.'\n\nThe picture was unearthed by The Mail on Sunday that same year as Ms Giuffre claimed she slept with Andrew during a stay in London, claims the disgraced ex-prince has vehemently denied.\n\nEpstein took the photo on a disposable camera before the group, along with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, headed out for dinner and then to a nightclub, Ms Giuffre said.\n\nAndrew's links to Epstein have led to the King to strip him of his titles - putting an end to his public life. He will also soon be evicted from his 30-room mansion, Royal Lodge, in Windsor. \n\nHe and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, have occupied the property on the Windsor estate for over two decades.\n\nAndrew is now under pressure to explain the full nature of his relationship with Epstein with members of the US Congress demanded he appear before them to 'come clean and provide justice for the survivors'. \n\nSuhas Subramanyam, Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee, told the BBC's Newsnight programme earlier this week that Andrew had not yet responded to its invitation to testify in the US. \n\nHe added that the former prince 'doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely'. \n\nOther messages released this week document an exchange between Andrew, Epstein and convicted sex trafficker Maxwell - months after the former duke said he broke off all contact with the convicted paedophile.\n\nAs the MoS sought comment for its world exclusive story, Andrew emailed Epstein and Maxwell begging them to clear his name, saying: 'I can't take any more of this.'\n\nIn the email chain from March 2011, Maxwell initially forwarded the Daily Mail's press inquiry to Epstein who in turn sent it to someone listed as 'the Duke'.\n\nThe Duke, believed to be Andrew, appears to respond: 'What? I don't know any of this. How are you responding?'\n\nEpstein told him: 'Just got it two minutes ago. I've asked g (sic) lawyers to send a letter.\n\n'Not sure... it's so salcisous (sic) and ridiculous, im (sic) not sure how to respond, the only person she didn't have sex with was Elvis.'\n\nAn exasperated Andrew then appears to reply to Epstein, saying: 'Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations. I can't take any more of this my end.'\n\nJust months later in July 2011, Epstein appears to actively lobby journalists to turn the tables on Ms Giuffre, who sued Andrew in a civil sex assault case in 2021, with the pair settling for a reported £12million out-of-court but no admission of wrong-doing on the royal's behalf.\n\nIn one email, Epstein tells a reporter that Buckingham Palace would 'love it' if Andrew's accuser was 'proven to be a liar'.\n\nThe email reads: '...Andrew's accuser, criminal record, total liar.\n\n'I think Buckingham Palace would love it. You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro (sic).\n\n'I promise you she is a fraud. You and I will be able to go to ascot (sic) for the rest of our lives.'\n\nWhen the journalist expressed some interest in the story, a further email from Epstein on the same day claimed that her story has 'no credibility' and it was 'total horses****'.\n\nIt continues: '...she was never 15 years old working for me, her story made it seem like she first worked for trump (sic) at that age and was met by ghislaine maxwell (sic).'\n\nHe concludes: 'I will ask if they will cooperate - Prince people.'\n\nAndrew and his allies have long questioned the authenticity of the damning picture taken by Epstein of the then prince and Ms Giuffre at Maxwell's London home in 2001.\n\nThe image has become the enduring symbol of Ms Giuffre's shocking allegations before she took her own life in April this year.\n\nAndrew, in his disastrous 2019 Newsnight interview, denied ever meeting Ms Giuffre in London and claimed the image might have been doctored. \n\nMaxwell, who is serving 20 years in prison for facilitating the crimes of Epstein, also dismissed the image as fake in a recent interview from prison, while Andew's allies insisted his fingers were 'chubbier' and he was taller than depicted. \n\nThe scandal has also impacted Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, whose children's book has been axed amid the controversy. \n\nThe former Duchess of York was due to release her book, Flora and Fern: Kindness Along The Way on October 9, a press release in Bookseller stated. \n\nAnd at the beginning of last week, the children's book was listed as being available for purchase from November 20. Now, it is no longer available on the website at all. \n\nThe book has since been marked as 'withdrawn from sale' at the request of the publisher, NielsonIQ Book Data confirmed to the BBC. \n\nWaterstones 'moved' the release of the book last month, but had no new concrete date for publication. \n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for the bookseller said it had received no further communication with the publisher since. \n\nNo reason has been given for the book withdrawal, however an industry source has told the BBC it 'makes total sense commercially.' \n\nIt comes as 66-year-old Fergie has been mired in controversy after emails emerged showing she and her ex-husband had been in touch with Epstein, despite publicly denouncing him.\n\nMeanwhile Mr Trump's links to Epstein were brought back into the spotlight after Democrats released emails in which Epstein referred to Mr Trump in correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell and author Michael Wolff.\n\nMr Trump's Republican party later published more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate.\n\nThe Democrats had redacted the victim's name, including in a 2011 email Epstein sent to Maxwell which claimed '[Virginia] spent hours at my house with him' while another sent by Epstein in August 2018 said: 'I know how dirty Donald is.'\n\nMs Leavitt confirmed the victim referred to in the emails is Ms Giuffre.\n\nShe called the email release a politically motivated 'smear' campaign and repeated earlier comments from Ms Giuffre, who took her own life in April, about Mr Trump in which she absolved him of wrongdoing.\n\n'The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump,' Ms Leavitt said.\n\n'The 'unnamed victim' referenced in these emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions.'\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, President Trump said the documents were a way to 'deflect' from the US government shutdown, where thousands of workers have been furloughed in a dispute over federal funding.\n\n'The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the shutdown,' he said.\n\n'There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats.'\n\nMr Trump did not send or receive any of the emails released and has not been charged with any crime relating to Epstein or Maxwell.","summary":"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor was in Davos to promote British interests when the email exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and Boris Nikolic took place in January 2010","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15294053/Andrew-Jeffrey-Epstein-Davos-emails.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/15/21/103912893-0-image-m-73_1763242531712.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 00:54:33","author":"Editor,Francine Wolfisz,Gemma Parry","authors":["Editor","Francine Wolfisz","Gemma Parry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":379403516,"title":"US draft at UN Security Council Includes 'Palestinian State' leading to  Smotrich attack on Netanyahu","text":"The U.S. draft resolution being prepared for submission to the United Nations Security Council explicitly includes the term “Palestinian state,” stirring discord within Israel’s right‑wing government. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, head of the Religious Zionism party, has voiced sharp criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hesitation. Smotrich returned Saturday evening to a promise Netanyahu made after 10 countries recognized a Palestinian state about two months ago, and lashed out: “You committed you would respond decisively – and since then two months have passed in which you have chosen silence and diplomatic disgrace.” In a post on the X platform, Smotrich wrote: “The deterioration we are seeing now on this issue is dangerous – and it is your responsibility and the result of your silence. Form immediately a suitable and decisive response that will make clear to the entire world – a Palestinian state will never rise on our ancestral lands.” Meanwhile, National Security Minister Itamar Ben‑Gvir, head of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, declared: “There is no such thing as a Palestinian [people]. This is a fantasy with no historical, archeological or factual basis. A collection of immigrants from Arab countries is not a people. And certainly they don’t deserve a reward for the terror, the murder, and the atrocities they sowed everywhere, especially from Gaza — the place where they gained autonomy. The only real solution for Gaza is voluntary migration, and certainly not a reward state for terror, which will become a platform for continued terror. Otzma Yehudit will not be part of any government that agrees to that. I call on the Prime Minister to clarify that the State of Israel will not allow the establishment of a Palestinian state in any form.” In September, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly, Netanyahu said his response would come only after his return from the U.S. and a meeting with President Donald Trump. “A Palestinian state west of the Jordan will not be established. It will not happen,” he pledged. He attacked the leaders of the countries that had recognized the Palestinian state then: “You are giving an enormous reward to terror,” he said, referring to the October 7 Hamas attacks. “For years I prevented the establishment of this terror‑state in front of gigantic pressures inside and outside. We doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria — and we will continue in this path.” He added: “The answer to the latest attempt to force upon us a terror‑state in our heartland will be given upon my return from the U.S. Wait.” However, following the wave of recognition at the U.N., there has been no visible Israeli decision on how to respond. Last month, as reported by ynet, it was assessed that Israel’s response had fallen off the agenda and may not be forthcoming, after the U.S. vetoed annexation plans and declared so publicly. In the lead‑up to the U.N. vote, Israel had threatened diplomatic retaliation — especially against France and President Emmanuel Macron, who stood behind the recognition initiative. Right‑wing ministers pushed for full annexation of Judea and Samaria, or at least the Jordan Valley. The Foreign Ministry recommended closing the French consulate in Jerusalem. France warned that if Israel took such action it would respond with diplomatic blows. Among others, French media reported that Paris would reduce its Mossad station in Paris and expel Israeli diplomats. The U.K. likewise warned Israel that any retaliatory step would trigger immediate counter‑measures.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1v002qlgwx","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/12/31/HkV211cYbLke/HkV211cYbLke_0_119_1280_721_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 00:51:24","author":"Itamar Eichner","authors":["Itamar Eichner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":379403188,"title":"Epstein controversy erupts anew, threatening to fracture Trump's Republican coalition","text":"Newly released House emails reignite scrutiny of Trump’s past Epstein ties.Dems push for full disclosure of Epstein files, with some Reps joining them.Poll shows only 4 in 10 Republicans approve of Trump’s handling of issue.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was eager to claim victory this week after the record-long US government shutdown ended on his terms. But almost immediately, the White House was forced to battle a familiar bogeyman: Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nA trove of emails released by Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday reignited questions about Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and how much the president knew about Epstein's alleged abuse of girls.\n\nWhile the White House swiftly dismissed the effort as a Democratic smear campaign, the headline-grabbing messages underscored a potential vulnerability for Trump that could shadow the president and his Republican Party into next year's midterm congressional elections.\n\nTrump has weathered controversies that would have sunk many politicians. But the Epstein saga has proven to be a persistent liability that disrupts Trump's message discipline and complicates his effort to keep his coalition focused on policy rather than scandal.\n\nSome republicans break ranks\n\nMany of Trump's most loyal supporters believe the government is withholding sensitive documents about Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide in jail in 2019, that would reveal his ties to powerful public figures.\n\nA handful of Republicans have broken ranks to join Democrats seeking a full documents release, drawing a rebuke from Trump, who called them \"soft and foolish.\"\n\n\"I think the hope was that it would die down and go away, and that was never going to be the case,\" said Republican strategist Terry Sullivan, who headed Secretary of State Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"It's an impossible issue to handle effectively,\" he added. \"It's impossible to prove a negative. If he (Trump) didn't know anything, how do you prove it?\"\n\nPia Carusone, a Democratic strategist and partner at political consultancy SKDK, said the spectre of Epstein could depress Republican turnout in the 2026 midterm elections if new revelations keep dripping out.\n\nSome Trump supporters for years have fanned conspiracy theories about Epstein's clients and the circumstances of his death. \n\nWhile Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing related to the wealthy financier, he has faced a backlash from supporters over his administration's refusal, citing privacy concerns, to disclose all Epstein-related investigative files.\n\n\"The MAGA base has a way of attaching to insider issues and blowing them up,\" Carusone said. \"I think he's very vulnerable on this.\"\n\nWhile nine in 10 Republicans say they approve of Trump's performance in the White House overall, just four in 10 say they approve of his handling of the Epstein files, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in October.\n\nThe White House said it would not be distracted by the Epstein saga.\n\n“Democrats and the mainstream media are desperately trying to use this hoax as a distraction to talk about anything other than Democrats getting utterly defeated by President Trump in the shutdown fight. These emails prove literally nothing,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.\n\nUnity shows cracks\n\nThe president demonstrated near-total control over his party during the 43-day government shutdown. Even with this week's Epstein emails, some prominent conservative influencers downplayed messages that suggested Epstein believed Trump \"knew about the girls.\" The messages also showed Trump disapproved of his behaviour and forced Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago social club in Florida.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of Epstein's alleged abuse and sex trafficking of girls.\n\nRepublican unity has not held around the Epstein issue overall, and Democrats have still managed to cause trouble for Trump.\n\nOn the same day the government reopened, a petition supported by all House Democrats and four Republicans got the final signature needed for a vote on a bill to compel the Justice Department to release all files related to Epstein.\n\nHigh-level Trump aides failed to convince Representative Lauren Boebert to take her name off the Epstein petition, going so far as to meet with her in the Situation Room, a White House space typically used for pressing national security matters.\n\nRepublican Representative Nancy Mace, another Trump loyalist, also did not budge in her support for the petition. A source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity said that when Mace and Trump were unable to connect by phone, she wrote a message to the president that referenced her experience as a sexual assault survivor.\n\nThe recalcitrance of Boebert and Mace, members of a Republican congressional conference that has shown almost complete obedience to Trump, suggests the president will have to navigate internal dissent carefully to ensure the Epstein saga does not fracture his party heading into the midterm elections.\n\nAfter days of declining questions from reporters, Trump broke his silence on Friday night, lamenting how the Epstein affair had distracted from his accomplishments.\n\n\"When you talk about the Epstein hoax, what happens is, you're not talking about how well we've done,\" Trump told journalists aboard Air Force One. \"They want to waste people's time, and some of the dumber Republicans like that.\"\n\nThose comments came just hours after Trump announced that he would ask the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's ties with JPMorgan and prominent Democrats. The US bank said it regrets its past association with Epstein, who was a client between 1998 and 2013, and did not help him commit \"heinous acts.\"\n\nDemocratic and Republican strategists said the last few days have illustrated the Epstein scandal's remarkable staying power and its ability to commandeer any news cycle.\n\nThe continued attempts by the White House to suppress or deflect news around the saga have had the effect of prolonging the attention paid to it, they said.\n\n\"I don't think anyone could argue that they handled it well,\" veteran Republican strategist Alex Conant said, \"because we're still talking about it.\"","url":"https://www.geo.tv/latest/633849-epstein-controversy-erupts-anew-threatening-to-fracture-trumps-gop-coalition","image":"https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-11-16/l_633849_061105_updates.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 00:42:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.574},{"id":379400136,"title":"African Union Leader Refutes Genocide Allegations Against Christians Amid Cruz’s Warning to Nigerian Authorities","text":"Amid escalating violence in Nigeria, a senior official from the African Union has dismissed allegations of a Christian genocide, drawing a swift response from the United States.\n\nThis controversy arises as Nigeria grapples with a prolonged period of violence, including killings, kidnappings, and attacks on villages in its northern and central regions. The Christian communities residing in these areas have reported that the situation has become dire.\n\nWhen questioned about former President Donald Trump’s comments threatening Nigeria over the persecution of Christians, African Union Commission Chairman Mahmoud Ali Youssouf refuted the genocide allegations. Speaking at the United Nations, Youssouf stated, “There is no genocide in northern Nigeria.” He clarified that the situation should not be equated with the atrocities witnessed in Sudan or parts of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nYoussouf emphasized that Muslims are the primary victims of Boko Haram, not Christians, and cited documented evidence to support his claim. He described the situation as “extremely complex” and cautioned against simplifying it into a single narrative. “The complexity of the situation in northern Nigeria should not be taken lightly, nor described with overly simple language,” he reiterated, emphasizing once more, “There is no genocide in northern Nigeria.”\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., warned about a PR campaign being waged by the Abuja government to fight the accusations. \n\n“Nigerian officials know their policies have created an environment in which Christians are being persecuted and slaughtered, including their enforcement of sharia law and their tolerance of Islamist violence. Instead of reversing these policies, they are waging a media campaign to escape exposure and accountability. I intend to prevent them from doing so.”\n\nThe White House also responded in starkly different terms. A senior official told Fox News Digital: “As the president stated, if the Nigerian government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria and may take action to completely wipe out the Islamic terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.” The official added that President Trump has designated Nigeria a “country of particular concern” and ordered the Department of War to prepare for possible action.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, some lawmakers are pressing for even stronger measures. Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., said the United States could take a range of actions — including sanctions and “even kinetic military action” — in response to what he called the “genocide” of Christians in Nigeria. Trump designated Moore, a member of the Appropriations Committee, along with Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., to lead an investigation into the killing of Christians by Islamist militants in the African nation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, addressed the issue in response to a question by Fox News Digital at the daily press briefing about persecution of Christians in Nigeria — and whether the secretary-general supports President Trump’s warning that Nigeria must act or face consequences. Dujarric, said, “We believe that the Nigerian government has been struggling with an insurgency that has been killing people, whether Muslims, Christians or others, and I think whatever assistance is needed should be done with the cooperation of the Nigerian authorities.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAmid escalating violence in Nigeria, a senior official from the African Union&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: African Union Leader Refutes Genocide Allegations Against Christians Amid Cruz&#8217;s Warning to Nigerian Authorities first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/african-union-leader-refutes-genocide-allegations-against-christians-amid-cruzs-warning-to-nigerian-authorities/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cruz-clashes-with-Nigeria-over-his-claims-50000-Christians-killed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 00:39:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":379400128,"title":"Swing Voter Backlash: How Government Shutdown Fears Could Spell Trouble for Democrats","text":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) aimed to undermine President Donald Trump and the Republican Party through the recent government shutdown. However, this strategy appears to have backfired, leaving many in the Democratic base frustrated with Schumer, accusing him of conceding with no substantial gains after more than 40 days of deadlock.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that the shutdown might have adverse effects on the Democrats. Recent focus groups conducted by Engagious/Sago in Georgia reveal that swing voters believe the Democrats’ handling of the situation left them in a worse position than their Republican counterparts.\n\nParticipants in the focus groups, who supported Joe Biden in 2020 and Donald Trump in 2024, predominantly felt that the Democrats suffered more reputational damage from the shutdown. Out of 13 swing voters, seven expressed that Democrats emerged looking worse than Republicans, two believed Republicans took a greater hit, and four thought both parties were equally tarnished.\n\nThis feedback serves as a reminder to Republicans not to become complacent and to prioritize economic issues as they prepare for upcoming elections.

They followed Charlie from the gallery and stood side by side, as he made his way through the opening round.Charlie led Benjamin School into the event as their top player. He opened with a 74 on the El Campeon Course, carding four birdies, four bogeys, and a double bogey. The score placed him in a tie for nineteenth after day one of the 36-hole event. Benjamin School entered the week as the top seed in Class 1A, as it chased its fifth state title, first since 2023.Tiger Woods, who is recovering from back surgery he had in October, walked the course with Nordegren and a group of school supporters. Nordegren wore a white sunhat, a long-sleeved white top, black leggings, and carried a blue backpack. Woods chose a blue striped Sunday red polo with navy trousers.Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren were married from 2004 to 2010 and also share a daughter, Sam.

Here’s what to know.","text":"U.S. immigration agents are targeting Charlotte, North Carolina, despite objections from local leaders, prompting activists, elected officials and community groups to monitor any sweeps and support vulnerable residents.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.\n\nIt is the latest step in the Trump administration’s strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of several large, Democratic-run cities. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who lack legal status to be in the country, and sparked a number of lawsuits.\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\nWhy send agents to Charlotte?\n\nCharlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina’s two U.S. senators are Republican and Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.\n\nCrime was down this year through August, compared with the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.\n\nBut the Trump administration has seized upon the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with that murder.\n\nThere is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.\n\nHow have locals reacted?\n\nCritics have characterized the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the agents “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”\n\nLocal groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They are also informing immigrants of their rights.\n\n“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.\n\nMecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.”\n\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in such operations.\n\nIs the National Guard involved?\n\nThere is no sign that the guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation have urged Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to request it.\n\nThe governor’s office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.\n\nThe Trump administration has deployed the guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. Courts have blocked the guard from operating so far in the Chicago area and in Portland, Oregon.\n\nAssociated Press writer Christopher L.

Trump warned that trade talks with Thailand could be halted as Washington seeks to prevent the Trump-brokered truce agreement from falling apart.\nThe warning came just days after Thailand said that it was suspending the ceasefire deal, accusing Cambodia of laying fresh landmines along the border. The Thai authorities went on to claim that these landmines wounded a Thai soldier on patrol, who lost a foot in the explosion.

With over 175 financial buys, the highest total value of the bond purchases surpassed $337 million, filings showed.Corporate bonds Trump bought include offerings from chipmakers like Broadcom and Qualcomm, technology firms such as Meta Platforms, retailers comprising Home Depot and CVS Health and major Wall Street institutions like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the report noted.His late-August purchases of investment-bank debt also involved JP Morgan bonds.Meanwhile, Trump urged the US Justice Department on Friday to open an investigation into JP Morgan regarding its connections to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bank has stated that it regrets its previous relationship with Epstein and that it did not assist him in carrying out “heinous acts\". Trump also bought Intel bonds after the US government, under his leadership, took an ownership stake in the company.Most of the assets stated in Saturday’s filings are made up of bonds issued by municipalities, states, counties, school districts, and other bodies connected to public agencies.Trump’s recent bond holdings cover a wide range of industries, including some that have already gained, or are currently gaining, from policy shifts under his administration, such as moves toward financial deregulation, the report added. The White House did not immediately comment to Reuters' request on Saturday. Officials have previously mentioned that Trump continues to submit the required investment disclosures, but that neither he nor his family manages the portfolio, which is handled by an outside financial firm.Trump, whose wealth originally stemmed from real estate before he entered public office, has said in the past that he placed his companies in a trust managed by his children.A filing submitted in August showed that Trump had bought more than $100 million in bonds since returning to the presidency on January 20. His annual disclosure, filed in June, also showed that revenue from his various businesses still ultimately flows to him, prompting worries about possible conflicts of interest.That annual disclosure, which appeared to reflect the 2024 calendar year, listed more than $600 million in income from cryptocurrencies, golf courses, licensing deals and other businesses. It also indicated that his growing involvement in crypto had significantly boosted his net worth.Altogether, the president’s June filing listed assets totaling at least $1.6 billion, according to a Reuters estimate at the time.(With inputs from Reuters)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/which-companies-did-trump-invest-in-bond-purchases-337-million-meta-platforms-jp-morgan-broadcom-and-qualcomm-11763250277703.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/11/16/1600x900/logo/USA-TRUMP-BONDS-0_1763252041480_1763252057646.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 00:16:31","author":"Garvit Bhirani","authors":["Garvit Bhirani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":379398538,"title":"An American tsunami in Gaza","text":"More than a month after the cessation‑of‑hostilities pact in Gaza (signed on October 9), the contours of Israel’s past, present and future are coming into sharp focus. First and most striking: the answer to how Israel arrived at the end of the fighting is now unambiguously revealed. High‑level statements from the U.S. administration — led by President Donald Trump — leave no doubt: Israel was compelled to end the campaign after a failed strike in Qatar triggered Washington’s serious doubts about a shift in the strategic balance. The war didn’t end simply because military pressure worked, but because Trump decided that a campaign without defined time‑limits or planning was harmful both for Israel and the U.S. Since October 9, the new reality in Gaza has also become clear. Behind Israeli declarations of having not withdrawn from the entire Strip lies the fact that the dominant actor in the post‑war zone is no longer Israel but the Americans. The command post established in Kiryat Gat is to serve as Washington’s forward base for unprecedented involvement in the conflict. According to multiple reports, a large U.S. base is also planned on the Gaza border. The American hegemony in Gaza has been proven multiple times: Trump accepted Hamas’ response to his 20‑point plan despite the group’s refusal to disarm he insisted the process continue even when the group repeatedly broke protocols (notably the incidents in Rafah in which three IDF soldiers were killed, and the delay in returning hostage remains) and he demanded U.S. approval for any civilian and military move in Gaza. In Israel, policy‑makers continue to assert that at any moment the fighting can resume, that Israel can swiftly seize territory in Gaza — even the whole Strip — and ultimately destroy Hamas. In doing so they reflect a growing divergence from the Americans’ position on Gaza. Furthermore, it appears that every step the U.S. advances is designed to cement a new on‑the‑ground reality that will restrict Israel’s freedom of action and make a return to full‑scale war very difficult. A U.S.‑sponsored resolution is expected at the UN Security Council next week: President Trump’s post‑Gaza plan that centers on deployment of foreign forces in the area. Approval is far from certain (Russia and China remain skeptical), but even the draft texts introduced so far expose a complex challenge: the inclusion of the Palestinian Authority and the mention of a potential Palestinian state as part of the Gaza settlement. The issue of terrorists trapped in tunnels in Rafah also illustrates the expanding gap between Jerusalem and Washington. In Israel many politicians and commentators demand the elimination or at least incarceration of the fighters — while the U.S. insists they lay down arms and may return to Houthi‑controlled or Hamas‑controlled territory, reflecting Washington’s lack of interest in undermining the ceasefire. If Israel persists in clinging to damaging fantasies — as it did in the half‑year span from March 18 to the end of war — it risks losing relevance and, crucially, its veto power over major decisions: for example a future Gaza government dominated by former Hamas figures or foreign forces from hostile states (Turkey above all). Trump’s eagerness to salvage the deal may push Washington to accept compromises — even at Israel’s expense. For example, Hamas might be required to disarm only partially rather than fully. With the return of hostage remains completed and stage one of the deal nearing close, U.S. pressure on Israel to deepen its withdrawal past the “yellow line” may grow. Israel now stands at a strategic junction and must recognize it faces only two realistic choices: confront Trump and set red lines (a feasible path, but one that risks a heavy price) or accept the changing reality and attempt to preserve maximum operational freedom (especially the right to strike emerging threats, such as in Lebanon), and retain a veto over decisions that sharply conflict with Israeli interests. At a more distant stage a return to war may still arise — if Trump abandons the deal given Hamas’s intransigence and gives Israel a green light. The end of intense warfare in Gaza allows Israel a clearer strategic view of other arenas of conflict. Thus it becomes all the more apparent that, despite impressive gains in Lebanon and Iran‑linked fronts, the job is unfinished and requires additional effort to deepen the damage inflicted on the enemy. Fixating on Gaza and returning to large‑scale war there erodes Israel’s ability to deal with other key fronts — and, crucially, threatens international legitimacy, especially American.

During a Nov. 2 appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" the 42-year-old \"Modern Family\" alum revealed that he was buying a house in Texas after becoming deeply concerned by the direction that California was taking under the leadership of Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"I’m kind of in this kind of LA thing, and I could be guilty of being a victim of what I’m absorbing in my algorithm. But Gavin Newsom scares the s--- out of me and I don’t want to be a part of it,\" Dye said.

LA COMEDIAN CALLS NEWSOM AN 'EMPTY SUIT' THAT ALLOWED THE CITY TO BE BURNED DOWN The LA fires scorched over 55,000 acres, destroyed more than 16,000 structures, and caused at least 29 deaths. The two largest fires were the Palisades Fire, which burned 6,837 structures and killed 12 people, and the Eaton Fire, which decimated 9,414 structures and claimed 18 lives. Both Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass faced immediate backlash over the management of the fires. Critics alleged that despite recurring wildfire risk, authorities had not done enough in advance to mitigate the danger. Among the issues raised were water supply problems and firefighting resources being stretched or compromised. Many residents and some local officials have expressed frustration with the slow recovery in the wake of the fires, citing bureaucratic challenges, significant delays with permitting, insurance disputes, and infrastructure concerns. DANICA MCKELLAR EXPLAINS WHY LA HAS LOST ITS APPEAL AS MORE CELEBRITIES FLEE HOLLYWOOD During Dye's appearance on the podcast, the comedian and Rogan also slammed celebrities who declared that they would leave the United States if President Donald Trump was re-elected. \"They go, 'I’m going to move.'

Trump claims the edit misrepresented his words, giving the false impression that he called for violence, and insists legal action is necessary to prevent similar misrepresentation in the future. The BBC acknowledged that the edits created a misleading impression and issued apologies from its Indian-origin chair Samir Shah, but it has ruled out financial compensation. The controversy over the documentary led to the resignations of BBC Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness. While the BBC regrets the error, it maintains that there is no legal basis for a defamation claim.\n\nJadeja spins India domination \n\nRavindra Jadeja’s masterful spin bowling dominated the second day of the opening Test at Eden Gardens, leaving South Africa reeling at 93/7, chasing a lead of 63. Jadeja’s 4/27 in a 13-over spell dismantled the middle order, supported by Kuldeep Yadav (2/12) and Axar Patel (1/30), while Washington Sundar bowled minimally. The deteriorating track offered variable bounce and turn, amplifying the spinners’ effectiveness. Earlier, Jadeja contributed 27 with the bat, joining the elite club of 4,000 Test runs and 300 wickets. India’s lower-order collapse to 189, triggered by Simon Harmer and Marco Jansen, set the stage for a potential third-day finish.\n\nStand-in captain Rishabh Pant orchestrated the spin attack brilliantly, recognizing the track’s demands. South African resistance, led by Temba Bavuma, appears unlikely to reach the 125 runs required to extend the match. Eden Gardens’ crumbling surface, coupled with India’s spin quartet, suggests the series opener may conclude rapidly, demonstrating the spinners’ decisive control over the game.","url":"https://www.dailypioneer.com/2025/page1/pioneer-in-short-pioneer-in-short-2025-11-16.html","image":"https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 00:00:00","author":"Daily Pioneer","authors":["Daily Pioneer"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":379398828,"title":"Shrimp exports to EU, Russia, Australia set to swell; major relief for domestic fisheries","text":"APAndhra Pradesh accounts for 80% of India’s total shrimp exports and had been exporting about 70% of its produce to the US.\n\nVisakhapatnam: India is set to expand export of seafood products, including shrimp to Russia, European Union, and Australia, in what would be a major relief to domestic fisheries hit hard by high US tariffs.Speaking to ET, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said the government has ironed out legacy issues with these markets which will allow the fisheries to expand exports. Goyal said that his ministry is working closely with the Seafood Exporters Association of India to identify more export markets, evaluate trade impediments, and find solutions.“We have recently ironed out problems with the European Union,” said Goyal. “Due to their quality control orders, the EU had not been importing Indian fish. We pressured them to solve a nine-yearold problem. Now, 102 fisheries have got approval to export to the EU,” the minister said, speaking to ET on the sidelines of the CII Partnership summit in Visakhapatnam. He said the “good news” was that the EU was looking for seafood, especially shrimp, from India.Alternate MarketsThis reflected the growing confidence in India's food safety and quality assurance systems.“Exports to Russia will also be expanded in a big way. They (Russia) are in the process of giving final approvals to 25 fisheries. We are working actively to get more approved,” said Goyal.Live EventsThe minister noted that India had been able to identify alternate markets after the imposition of high US tariffs and gradually resolve export problems. US President Donald Trump has imposed a steep 50% tariff on Indian goods, half of which are penal tariffs for New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian crude oil.Andhra Pradesh accounts for 80% of India’s total shrimp exports and had been exporting about 70% of its produce to the US. The imposition of tariffs, which touched an effective rate of as much as 59.72%, severely dented the state's shrimp exports to the US.In October, Australia permitted unpeeled shrimp imports from Andhra Pradesh after an eight-year gap.

The American actor pleaded with the POTUS through a two-minute video that he released through his official X account (formerly Twitter).In the clip, Voight is sitting with the American flag serving as his background. He warned that the NYC Mayor-elect poses an existential threat to the city. The actor added that Mamdani would usher in 'socialism' and destroy the city's tradition of 'wealth' and hard-earned success.'We the people have put our trust in the President of the United States, Donald J Trump. He, and only he, can stop this horror, as this mayor, Mamdani, will try to destroy New York's wealth and turn it into a socialist crap city,' Voight said in the video. 'Let this be a warning to the people and may God bless.'Voight Pleaded for the President to InterveneThe actor wants to stop the installation of Mamdani, and as he sends his message to the POTUS, he uses intensely charged language. At one point, he said Mamdani will convert New York into a 'forbidden place of darkness.' He further claimed the new leader is leading the city into a rampant 'refugee shelter for the radical Muslim ideology' and repeatedly labelled the mayor as 'communist.'Angelina Jolie's father told Trump to act now because if don't, New York will lose its identity, its businesses, and the freedoms of its citizens. He assures his audience that he is not making this plea lightly: 'We are obligated to demand our rights for our private sanctuary, our businesses, our property, that we all have worked so hard for,' Voight declared.Who is Zohran Mamdani?Mamdani is a 34-year-old Democratic Socialist State Assemblyman who has been elected the next mayor of New York City. He secured victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who entered the race as an independent after losing the primary, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams initially ran as an independent but eventually withdrew and supported Cuomo.As per BBC News, Mamdani was born in Uganda to parents of Indian descent and moved to New York at the age of seven. He excelled at the Bronx High School of Science and went on to study Africana Studies at Bowdoin College. While undertaking his Africana Studies degree, Mamdani co-founded the campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, signalling early on his passion for social justice.Mamdani's multifaceted identity, Indian, African, and American, has sparked both conversation and controversy. In a 2009 Columbia University application, he listed his race as both 'Asian' and 'Black or African American,' a choice that critics have framed as strategic, though supporters say it reflects the complex realities of navigating multiple heritages in America.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/angelina-jolies-dad-jon-voight-asks-donald-trump-intervene-mayoral-race-new-york-risk-under-1755273","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1768738/jon-voight.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=85d7d3990ed2e5cd304b8de8b5e76eea","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 23:56:34","author":"Louise Bonquin","authors":["Louise Bonquin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.197},{"id":379398360,"title":"Michelle Obama responds to calls for a 2028 presidential run","text":"Michelle Obama isn’t buying the idea that Americans truly want her to run for president.\n\nMichelle's recent refusal came while speaking at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on November 5 about her new book, The Look.\n\nDuring the live talk, the former first lady, 61, said people should stop pretending they’re ready for a woman in the White House.\n\nReferencing Donald Trump’s 2024 win over Kamala Harris, she said, “Sadly, we ain’t ready.” \n\n“You’re not ready for a woman.

Varios agentes fueron vistos realizando arrestos en distintas ubicaciones.\n\nSe trata del más reciente paso en la estrategia del gobierno de Trump, que consiste en desplegar agentes de inmigración o del ejército en las calles de varias ciudades importantes gobernadas por demócratas. Esto ha causado miedo y ansiedad, especialmente entre las personas que no tienen estatus legal para estar en el país, y ha provocado una serie de demandas.\n\nEsto es lo que hay que saber:\n\n¿Por qué enviar agentes a Charlotte?\n\nCharlotte es una ciudad racialmente diversa de más de 900.000 residentes, entre ellos, más de 150.000 nacidos en el extranjero, según autoridades locales.

Un hombre con un largo historial criminal fue acusado de ese asesinato.\n\nSin embargo, no hay indicios de que los agentes fronterizos tengan o pudieran tener un papel en la aplicación de leyes locales o estatales.\n\n¿Cómo han reaccionado los locales?\n\nLos críticos han caracterizado la llegada de agentes fronterizos como una invasión. La alcaldesa de Charlotte, Vi Lyles, dijo que los agentes “provocan miedo e incertidumbre innecesarios”.\n\nLos grupos locales entrenan a voluntarios para protestar y documentar de manera segura cualquier redada de inmigración. También informan a los inmigrantes sobre sus derechos.\n\n“Hemos visto lo que ha sucedido en otras ciudades de este país cuando el gobierno federal se involucra”, dijo el representante estatal Jordan Lopez.\n\nLa comisionada del condado de Mecklenburg, Susan Rodriguez-McDowell, instó al público a “enfrentar el momento pacíficamente” y “reducir el pánico”.\n\nEl Departamento de Policía de Charlotte-Mecklenburg señaló que no tiene autoridad para hacer cumplir las leyes federales de inmigración y no participa en tales operaciones.\n\n¿Está involucrada la Guardia Nacional?\n\nNo hay señales de que la guardia vaya a Charlotte, aunque tres miembros republicanos de la delegación del Congreso de Carolina del Norte han instado al gobernador demócrata Josh Stein a solicitarla.\n\nLa oficina del gobernador dijo que la policía local es una mejor opción para mantener la seguridad en los vecindarios.\n\nEl gobierno de Trump ha desplegado a la guardia en el Distrito de Columbia y el área de Los Ángeles, mencionando los índices de criminalidad y la necesidad de proteger a los agentes de inmigración, así como en Memphis, Tennessee.

Copper: 50%. Cars: up to 25%. But an even bigger Trump-era levy looms: 107% on Italian pasta.\n\nIt started with the U.S. Commerce Department launching what it says was a routine antidumping review, based on allegations Italian pasta makers sold product into the US at below-market prices and undercut local competitors. That has led to a threat of 92% duties, which would come on top of the 15% tariff President Donald Trump’s administration imposed on European exports generally.\n\nThe news sent shockwaves through Italy, where 13 producers would be subject to the whopping one-two punch. They say sales in their second biggest export market would shrivel if prices to American consumers more than double. And while the measure would hardly prompt pasta shortages, it still has perplexed importers like Sal Auriemma, whose shop in Philadelphia’s Italian market, Claudio Specialty Food, has been operating for over 60 years.\n\n“Pasta is a pretty small sector to pick on. I mean, there’s a lot bigger things to pick on,” said Auriemma, pointing to luxury items as an alternative.\n\nBut pasta? “It’s basic food,” he said. “Something’s got to be sacred.”\n\nPasta adds heft to Italy’s economy\n\nItaly is a nation of avid pasta eaters. Less known is that most of the tortellini, spaghetti and rigatoni its factories churn out gets sent abroad. The U.S. accounts for about 15% of its €4 billion ($4.65 billion) in exports, making it Italy’s largest market after Germany, data from farmers’ association Coldiretti show.\n\nThe punitive pasta premium has become a cause célèbre for Italy’s politicians, executives and economists. Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida told lawmakers in mid-October that the government was working with the European Commission and engaging in diplomatic efforts, while supporting the companies’ legal actions to oppose U.S. sanctions.\n\nEU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic addressed reporters in Rome last month, stressing the lack of evidence backing the U.S. decision and calling the combined 107% levy “unacceptable.”\n\nMargherita Mastromauro, president of the pasta makers sector of Unione Italiana Food, told The Associated Press that prices for Italian pasta in the U.S. remain high, and certainly higher than American-made rivals — undermining any dumping claim.\n\nShe said that the measures could deal a fatal blow to small- and medium-sized producers. Lucio Miranda, president of consultancy group Export USA, agreed.\n\n“A duty rate of 107% would definitely kill this flow of export,” Miranda, who is Italian, said by phone from New York. “It’s not going to be something that you can just dump on the consumer and move on, life continues. It will definitely be a deal killer.”\n\nWacky Mac owner cries foul\n\nThe Commerce Department’s investigation started in 2024 after complaints from Missouri-based 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, which owns pasta brand Ronzoni, and Illinois-based Winland Foods, whose multiple brands include Prince, Mueller’s and Wacky Mac.\n\nThe office’s review focused on La Molisana and Garofalo, chosen as primary respondents because they are Italy’s two largest exporters, the Commerce Department said in an emailed statement. Any sale price below either producers’ costs or the price they charge in the Italian market would be considered dumping, in line with numerous other reviews of Italian pasta since 1996, it said.\n\nThe two companies presented information incorrectly or withheld it, significantly impeding analysis, according to the Commerce Department. And in the face of these alleged deficiencies, the office presented its 92% duty estimate, which it extended to 11 other companies based on an assumption the two companies’ behavior was representative.\n\n“After they screwed up their initial responses, the Commerce Department explained to them what the problems were and asked them to fix those problems; they didn’t,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in an emailed response to the AP’s questions. “And then Commerce communicated the requirements again, and they didn’t answer for a third time.”\n\nLa Molisana declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Garofalo didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe sanctions would be applied not just to imports going forward, but also the 12 months through June 2024, according to the Commerce Department. It added that only 16% of total Italian pasta imports may be affected. Its final decision is scheduled for Jan. 2, which could be extended by 60 days.\n\n‘Completely senseless’\n\nA little over an hour’s drive northeast from Naples is Benevento, a sleepy hilltop town of 55,000 people famed for its ancient Roman theater and Aglianico red wine. It’s also home to Pasta Rummo, founded in 1846, which prides itself on its seven-phase, “slow work” production method.\n\nCEO Cosimo Rummo is outraged by the threat to his company’s annual 20 million euros in exports to the U.S.\n\n“These tariffs are completely senseless,” Rummo said in a phone interview. “These are fast-moving consumer goods … Who would ever buy a pack of pasta that costs 10 dollars, the same price as a bottle of wine?”\n\nHe added that he has no intention to start producing pasta stateside, as some companies have done and so would be spared the prospective levy. That includes Barilla, which for decades has been the main Italian pasta brand in the U.S. and now has large-scale production facilities there.\n\nAn unsavory prospect\n\nWhen the transatlantic imbroglio started simmering, Robert Tramonte of Arlington, Virginia sought assurances. The owner of The Italian Store called his supplier, who told him there’s enough pasta inventory stocked in the warehouse to keep prices steady until Easter.\n\nTramonte’s clients count on him for top-shelf product and he was relieved that, at least for the time being, they won’t have to shell out for the real deal. Or worse — perish the thought! — purchase made-in-America pasta.\n\n“They’ve tried to make Italian products and use the same ingredients, but the source wasn’t Italy,” he said. “And they just didn’t taste the same.”\n\nZampano reported from Rome and Wiseman from Washington. Associated Press videojournalists Paolo Santalucia in Rome and Tassanee Vejpongsa in Philadelphia contributed to this report.","summary":"Steel: 50%. Copper: 50%. Cars: up to 25%.

The reaction definitely was a surprise, but I love jeans.\n'All I wear are jeans. I'm literally in jeans and a T-shirt every day of my life.'\nSydney's forthcoming film venture now faces a potentially negative reception, with critics threatening to boycott The Housemaid when it goes on general release in December.\n\nSydney completed her look with a pair of pointed red heels as her blonde hair was styled with subtle curls\n\nKerry Kohansky-Roberts and Sydney Sweeney at Deadline Contenders Film: Los Angeles\n\nLee Byung-hun pictured with the under-fire actress on Saturday\n\nOver the weekend, her new film, in which she plays Hall of Fame boxer Christy Martin, tanked at the box office after grossing a meager $1.3million\n\n Sydney Sweeney faces fresh career blow after disastrous Christy movie flop \nA new trailer and accompanying promotional posters, shared across Instagram on Thursday, appeared to hint at more problems for Sweeney by prompting a wave of scathing comments from followers, with many claiming they would only watch it to support her co-star, Amanda Seyfried.\nAccording to reputation expert Eric Schiffer, Sweeney has enlisted clever PR techniques in a bid to cool the mounting backlash.\nSpeaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, he explained that she has so-far bashed away criticism by simply never apologizing - and in doing so, has scaled her relevance. \nHowever, while Sweeney looks 'cancellation-bulletproof right now', Schiffer warns that she should tread carefully.\nSchiffer said: 'She's evading damage because she never fed the beast: no apology tour, then straight back to work.\n'Hollywood reads heat as currency, and she proved she can take a vicious wallop and survive. Guts with composure sells; audiences prefer confidence over contrition. It would be reckless debating eugenics semantics.\n'Her star persona is a weapon, and America - plus a lot of the world - like and gravitate toward her, and that's a jean covered bomb-proof reputation suit.'\nSydney SweeneyLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSydney Sweeney steps out in a chic mini dress as she shrugs off criticism after disastrous Christy movie flop amid growing backlash\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

California then responded in kind, approving a map to increase Democrats’ control by the same margins.\n\nSince then, a flurry of other states have finalized redistricting, are moving toward doing so, or are considering proposals.\n\nAs things stand, Republicans enjoy a slight advantage, standing to gain three more seats than Democrats.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of which states have been doing what, how the math works, the local legal challenges and politics, and what it might mean for the midterms.\n\nStates That Have Redistricted Their Maps\n\nThe Lone Star State added five new Republican-leaning districts in response to a letter from the Department of Justice alleging that some districts in the state were unconstitutionally drawn by grouping minorities into a majority. President Donald Trump signaled his support for the state’s redistricting.\n\nThe redistricting was not without a battle, though. State Democrats at one point left Texas to prevent a quorum in the state legislature.\n\nThe new map prompted Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat, to announce his retirement.\n\nSEAT CHANGE: R+5\n\nVoters approved a ballot measure on Nov. 4 to counter Texas’s changes, adding five new Democratic-leaning districts in line with a request from California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe measure, Proposition 50, garnered 64.6 percent support from the state electorate.\n\nProposition 50 is the subject of a lawsuit by the California Republican Party. The Department of Justice has joined the suit.\n\nSEAT CHANGE: D+5\n\nA newly drawn map in the state could help the GOP pick up an additional seat.\n\nGov. Mike Kehoe signed off on the new map in September after the state legislature approved it.\n\n“Missourians are more alike than we are different, and our values, across both sides of the aisle, are closer to each other than those of the congressional representation of states like New York, California, and Illinois,” he said at the time.\n\nThe seat targeted belongs to Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.).\n\nThe St. Louis seat, held by Rep. Wesley Bell (D-Mo.), is protected under the Voting Rights Act.\n\nSEAT CHANGE: R+1\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nLikewise, North Carolina’s new map—approved by the legislature in October—could give the GOP an additional seat.\n\nAlthough the state has voted for Trump and Republicans in most elections in recent years, North Carolina is often considered a swing state.\n\nCurrently, the GOP controls 10 of the state’s 14 congressional seats.\n\nOnly one of those seats, held by Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.), is a potential target. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, did not have the power to veto the new map.\n\nSEAT CHANGE: R+1\n\nAfter a judge struck down the map created by Republicans after the 2020 census, the Beehive State created a new Salt Lake City-based competitive seat for Democrats.\n\nCurrently, the state’s four congressional districts are split between Salt Lake City and the outlying rural areas. Redistricting would dilute the congressional map and its lines.\n\nRepublicans are planning to appeal the decision to the Utah Supreme Court. Former Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) could run for the seat.\n\nSEAT CHANGE: D+1\n\nStates Considering Redistricting Their Maps\n\nDemocrat gubernatorial candidate Phil Weiser, currently the Centennial State’s attorney general, expressed support for a possible constitutional amendment, which would need to be voted on by voters.\n\nColorado has become increasingly a safe Democratic state, with Republicans having last won the state in the 2004 election.\n\nIt is unknown which districts would be targeted, though Colorado’s congressional delegation includes four Republicans: Reps. Lauren Boebert, Jeff Crank, Jeff Hurd, and Gabe Evans.\n\nIn the Sunshine State, a special committee has been formed to take up the redistricting issue.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis has expressed approval for redistricting.\n\n“I think the state is malapportioned,” he said. “So I do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting in the mid-decade. So we’re working through what that would look like, but I can tell you, just look at how the population has shifted in different parts of the state over a four-to-five-year period. It’s been really significant.”\n\nFlorida has shifted politically in recent years, moving from a swing state in presidential elections to a solidly Republican state.\n\nCurrently, Republicans control 20 of the state’s 28 congressional districts.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has urged Democrats in the Land of Lincoln to redraw the district map.\n\n“We are going to support efforts to make sure that there are fair maps all across the country in the face of what Republicans are endeavoring to do,” he told reporters, accusing Republicans of gerrymandering.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker has said that all options are on the table. This could include potentially changing Republican districts to include larger portions of blue-leaning Chicago.\n\nIn the Democrat-dominated state, Republicans hold three of the state’s 17 congressional seats.\n\nDemocrat state lawmakers have suggested a constitutional amendment that would need to be approved twice by the legislature and then by voters.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul has expressed support for redistricting in the solidly Democratic state.\n\n“All’s fair in love and war. We’re following the rules. We do redistricting every 10 years,” she said. “But if there’s other states violating the rules and are trying to give themselves an advantage, all I’ll say is, I’m going to look at it closely with Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nDemocrats currently control 19 of the state’s 26 congressional districts.\n\nLawmakers are facing court challenges to Louisiana’s current map, approved in January 2024.\n\nSome voters brought suit against the map, claiming it violates the Voting Rights Act. The status of this challenge is in limbo as lawmakers await the federal Supreme Court’s decision, but steps have been taken to push back primary elections in case the maps need to be redrawn.\n\nDemocrats hold two of the state’s six congressional seats.\n\nOn Nov. 4, Gov. Wes Moore launched the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission to consider redrawing the state’s maps in favor of Democrats.\n\nHowever, the push has faced challenges in the state Legislature, with the Democratic state Senate president rejecting the notion outright.\n\nRep. Andy Harris is the state’s sole Republican member.\n\nStates Moving to Redistrict Their Maps\n\nFollowing the 2025 elections, Democrats in Virginia now have a clear path to move forward with redistricting efforts in the commonwealth to favor Democratic candidates.\n\nGov.-elect Abigail Spanberger will enter office in January with control of the governor’s mansion, a Democratic lieutenant governor and attorney general, and 64 Democratic seats in the state’s House of Delegates.\n\nDemocrats already hold the Senate, where seats weren’t on the ballot in 2025.\n\nCurrently, Democrats control six of the state’s 11 congressional districts.\n\nOn Oct. 31, the Ohio Redistricting Commission unanimously gave the green light to a new congressional district map put forward by the state’s GOP majority.\n\nThe new maps, if finalized, could increase the number of Republicans in the state’s congressional delegation from 10 to 12.\n\nOhio was legally required to change its maps ahead of the 2026 election because the previous maps were only valid for four years, given that they had failed to win bipartisan support following the 2020 census.\n\nDemocrats see the current map under consideration as their best option to avoid a potentially worse outcome.\n\nStates That Have Ruled It Out\n\nAfter pushing for months to bring Republican lawmakers on board with redrawing Kansas’s congressional maps, a push for a special session was abandoned on Nov. 4.\n\nRepublicans failed to garner enough support among state House Republicans to redraw the maps, which currently give Republicans 3 seats to 1 for Democrats.\n\nHouse Speaker Dan Hawkins announced that there were not enough votes in the state’s lower chamber to warrant convening a special session in November, meaning that the issue has, at least for the time being, been ruled out in the state.\n\nAlthough Gov. Jim Pillen has said he’s “open” to redrawing the maps, lawmakers in Nebraska’s state legislature don’t share his stance.\n\nSuch a redraw would doubtless seek to shore up GOP support in outgoing Rep. Don Bacon’s (R-Neb.) Omaha-based district. But at present, there is too much GOP opposition in the state’s unicameral legislature to move forward with any such bid.\n\nAt present, any push to redraw the state’s maps seems to have far less than the 33 votes that would be needed to overcome a potential filibuster.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGov. Kelly Ayotte has said now is not the time to redistrict.\n\n“The timing is off for this, because we are literally in the middle of the census period,” she said in an interview with WMUR. “And when I talk to people in New Hampshire ... it’s not on the top of their priority list.”\n\nThough Republicans have enjoyed victories on a local level in New Hampshire, the New England swing state has consistently voted with its neighbors in favor of the Democratic Party at the federal level.\n\nDemocrats currently control the state’s two congressional districts as well as the state’s two Senate seats.\n\nThe Trump administration’s efforts to persuade Indiana to redraw its maps hit a major roadblock on Nov. 14. State Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said in a statement that the votes are not there to change the Hoosier State’s congressional map.\n\n“Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state’s congressional maps,” he said. “Today, I’m announcing there are not enough votes to move that idea forward, and the Senate will not reconvene in December.”","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/redistricting-could-determine-2026-elections-heres-what-each-state-doing","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/2025-11-15_11-26-26.jpg?itok=NqQPSM5z","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 23:40:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":379393338,"title":"Chaos Erupts at Mexico’s National Palace: Protesters Clash with Police in Anti-Cartel Violence Rally","text":"On Saturday, Mexico City became the epicenter of a massive protest as thousands of demonstrators clashed with police and attempted to penetrate the security perimeter surrounding the National Palace, the seat of the federal government’s executive branch.\n\nThe air was thick with tear gas as protesters forcefully removed riot police from their positions, resorting to physical attacks using an array of improvised weapons.\n\nThis anti-government demonstration, which erupted in violence at Zocalo Square, was primarily orchestrated by Generation Z, individuals born from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.\n\nParticipants in the protest shared with the Associated Press that their grievances centered on issues of corruption and public safety.\n\nAmong the protesters was Arizbeth Garcia, a 43-year-old doctor, who expressed her demand for enhanced security measures and increased investment in the public health sector.\n\n“[Doctors] are also exposed to the insecurity gripping the country, where you can be murdered and nothing happens,” Garcia said.\n\nAnother demonstrator, Rosa Maria Avila, 65, of Patzcuaro in Michoacán, told the outlet she was marching in support of Uruapan Mayor Carlos Manzo, an anti-crime activist who was assassinated at a public event earlier this month in Michoacán.\n\n“The state is dying,” Avila said. “He was killed because he was a man who was sending officers into the mountains to fight delinquents. He had the guts to confront them.”\n\nManzo was shot seven times after condemning Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for her alleged lack of effort in combating cartels. \n\n“We need greater determination from the president of Mexico,” Manzo told local media in September. “I do not want to be just another mayor on the list of those who have been executed and had their lives taken away from them. … I am very afraid, but I must face it with courage.”\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office in October 2024 as Mexico’s first female president, recently came under fire after a series of high-profile murders.\n\nCritics accuse her of tolerating organized crime and failing to support anti-cartel efforts.\n\nIn May, Sheinbaum publicly confirmed she rejected U.S. military assistance from President Donald Trump, who was looking to help the country fight drug trafficking and violent cartels.\n\nShe allegedly told Trump the country will “never accept” the presence of the U.S. Army in its territory.\n\n“No, President Trump, our territory is inalienable, sovereignty is inalienable,” Sheinbaum previously said. “We can collaborate. We can work together, but with you in your territory and us in ours.

I’m a lifelong Catholic. I’m saying it not only as a border czar — I’ll say it as a Catholic. They need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church, in my opinion.\" Homan made the remarks at the White House when asked about the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which this week condemned President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and warned of \"a climate of fear and anxiety\" around immigration enforcement, according to Reuters. HOMAN BLASTS CRITICS, HAILS BORDER PATROL CHIEF GREG BOVINO AS ‘PATRIOT’ AFTER FIERY CHICAGO TEAR GAS HEARING The bishops’ statement followed recent comments from Pope Leo, who called for \"deep reflection\" on how migrants are being treated under Trump, whose administration has aggressively carried out mass deportations, according to Reuters. Homan urged the Church to \"fix itself\" before criticizing U.S. immigration policy and accused faith leaders of hypocrisy, noting that the Vatican imposes harsh penalties for trespassing on its grounds. \"So according to them, the message we should send to the whole world is that if you cross the border illegally, which is a crime, don’t worry about it,\" Homan said.

Is that the message you send to the whole world?\" Homan said the Trump administration’s immigration policy \"saves lives\" and is more humane than the Biden administration’s approach. He argued that desperate migrants often rely on violent cartels to smuggle them across the border in hazardous conditions, claiming that more than 4,000 migrants died during those journeys, while thousands of Americans died from fentanyl smuggled across the border.

But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said earlier this week that two federal officials had told him that customs agents would be arriving soon.\n\nPaola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino – a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte – said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents pulling people over since Friday.\n\n“Basically, what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said. “I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and Border Patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.”\n\nLocal organisations responded by holding trainings, trying to inform immigrants of their rights, and considering peaceful protests.\n\nTrump’s administration has defended federal enforcement crackdowns in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.\n\nTrump’s drive to deport millions of immigrants has prompted allegations of rights abuses and myriad lawsuits.\n\nBut Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said Friday that the vast majority of those detained in these operations have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.\n\nHe urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” they see and notify local law enforcement about it.\n\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasised ahead of time that it isn’t involved in federal immigration enforcement.","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/us-immigration-crackdown-arrests-under-way-in-charlotte-north-carolina/","image":"https://trinidadtribune.com/app/uploads/2025/11/AP25319730858059-1763240472-EBnYEV.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 23:33:38","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"tt","sentiment":-0.047}]}
