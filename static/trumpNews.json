Google DeepMind’s CEO said China’s technology is just months behind the US. Signal’s Meredith Whittaker called new adaptations of AI uniquely “perilous.”The message from tech executives at the World Economic Forum is that AI is a powerful geopolitical force, and one politicians and business leaders need to wield as such. It’s effectively one more piece of firepower in the global struggle between major economies like the US and China.The idea that AI is more than just a buzzy next-gen tech, but a crucial tool for whomever wants to be a 21st century superpower, means it’s high on the agenda at Davos. It’s holding its own in the attention stakes, even if the buildup to the annual gathering of the world’s global elite has been dominated by Donald Trump and tensions over Greenland.In a sign of the AI push at Davos, Anthropic and tech venture capital investors Lightspeed and General Catalyst planned exclusive parties. Even with a busy schedule ahead for the week, there was a line outside the VC event at 10:30pm. Palantir Technologies Inc. set up its house across the street from the USA House, a church just outside the Davos perimeter that’s the main venue for the Trump administration this week. AI is becoming a major driver of the global economy — with companies and nations committing billions to ensure dominance — and has implications for everything to the future of work and robotics to how wars are fought and space travel.With so much at stake, countries can’t afford to slow down when it comes to investment and innovation. And, according to Amodei, the US even risks giving up its edge over China by selling advanced AI chips to its rival.“If you think about the incredible national security implications of building models that are essentially cognition, that are essentially intelligence,” Amodei said. “It’s like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.”It was almost a year ago that Chinese large-language model DeepSeek spooked the industry – and the western world more broadly – with a new model that performed similarly to leading models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT on some metrics at a fraction of the cost.It drove a rout of nearly $1 trillion in US and European technology stocks and – temporarily – wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars from Nvidia’s market value. The technology has yet to meaningfully supplant its American rivals outside of China, but it was quite the wake-up call.“They may be only six months behind, not one or two years behind, the frontier. That’s what DeepSeek showed,” Google DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis said. “But they have yet to show they can innovate beyond the frontier.”Europe LagsIn this tech race between the US and China, Europe is falling behind. Microsoft Corp.’s Satya Nadella said the continent needs a change in mindset.In his view, Europe is too focused on regulation and not enough on encouraging home-grown tech.“You’re only going to be competitive if the products coming out of Europe are globally competitive,” he said. Europe has led in privacy and in safety around AI, Nadella added, “but you also have to complement it by building locally and thinking globally.”Europe is losing out as many of its most promising companies get absorbed by larger tech companies abroad. While governments have been marshaling resources to build out data centers and deploy AI, the scale is significantly smaller than the US and Asia.France’s Mistral AI is Europe’s leading AI startup. But valued at €11.7 billion ($13.7 billion) in a funding round last year, it’s a minnow compared with OpenAI, valued at north of $500 billion. Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO and a tech investor, said that Europe must ramp up investment in open source AI or it will be left with few options but to rely on China. US companies are moving toward a “closed source” AI. “Unless Europe is willing to spend lots of money for European models, Europe will end up using the Chinese models,” Schmidt said. “It’s probably not a good outcome for Europe.” ‘Intimidation’While economies and companies are working out how to safely integrate AI without losing their edge, the technology continues to become more powerful. For businesses thinking about adopting it, Whittaker said executives need to ask tough questions about what they need and what will work for them. She says there’s sometimes an “intimidation factor” at play when it comes to the tech.“Ask the questions, and ask the questions selfishly in relation to what your business actually needs,” she said. “Get as specific as possible.”The technology is also advancing in ways that will force governments to reconsider how they structure their economies and deploy resources. “We could have this very unusual combination of very fast GDP growth and high unemployment or at least underemployment or a lot of low wage jobs, high inequality. I don’t think that’s a macroeconomic combination we’ve ever seen before,” Amodei said. “That’s really going to be a problem we need to solve.”Hassabis said he’d like to see the world’s best minds collaborate in a scientific way — combining philosophers, social scientists, economists and technologists, to work out how best to deploy the technology. “Unfortunately it kind of needs international collaboration.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-execs-at-davos-highlight-ai-s-power-as-a-geopolitical-tool-11768936770750.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/18/1600x900/logo/tech3_1734536499109_1734536513984.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 19:19:30","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.089},{"id":394629284,"title":"‘Special guest’s' appearance at White House briefing delayed? Trump lists 'achievements' in first year - Key Highlights","text":"US President Donald Trump made a 'special appearance' at the White House briefing on Tuesday,20 January to mark the first anniversary of the start of his second term. However, the ‘special guest’s' appearance was delayed as per multiple reports.The White House press briefing schedule on Tuesday had announced Trump as a “special guest,” on the occasion of the 79-year-old completing one year in office since taking over in January 2025.Reportedly appearing 'very quiet and low key,' Trump arrived at the White House almost an hour behind schedule. He appeared with a large binder of files, which he called a list of his “achievements,” reported BBC.Trump's speech at White House – Key Highlights– ‘365 wins in 365 days’: Before Trump began to speak, reporters in the room were handed out copies of a press release talking about \"365 wins in 365 days” for the US President. Multiple reporters also posted on social media about the ‘31 page briefing packet’ handed out to them.– Immigration policies, photos of ‘criminals’: Listing his “achievements”, Donald Trump began his address to the White House by mainly talking about his immigration policies of the past 12 months. He also held up some photos of people who have been arrested in Minnesota, claiming they are \"criminal, illegal aliens\".– ‘10,000 undocumented residents apprehended in Minnesota’: The POTUS claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has apprehended 10,000 undocumented residents in Minnesota. Trump's claims come after the US experienced weeks of unrest and protests after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good earlier this month.– Machado ‘unbelievably nice woman’: Briefly touching on the topic of Venezuela, Trump hailed this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado as “an unbelievably nice woman.” She gave Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal when visiting the White House earlier this month. “Maybe we can get her involved in some way,” said Trump.The POTUS' rare appearance comes as he faces extraordinary pushback from America’s European allies over his planned tariffs over Greenland – tensions he's likely to confront in person this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.(This is a developing story.

(Photo by Federico PARRA / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 20, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Venezuela says US $300-million oil sale used to prop up currency \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AFP)—Venezuela’s interim leader Delcy Rodriguez said on Tuesday that her country has received $300 million from a United States sale of Venezuelan crude and she will use it to prop up her country’s battered currency, the bolivar.\n\nRodriguez said the sum from a $500 million sale conducted by Washington would be used to “stabilize” the foreign exchange market “to protect the income and purchasing power of our workers.”\n\nWashington last weekend said US President Donald Trump brokered a “historic energy deal” that would “benefit the American and Venezuelan people.”\n\nTrump said the oil could be sold at market price and that proceeds would be “controlled by me, as President of the United States of America.”\n\nForeign exchange has been vital to the Venezuelan economy since 2018, when the bolivar became virtually worthless and the dollar became the country’s de facto currency.\n\nThe dollar has since coexisted with the bolivar but a scarcity of greenbacks, caused by a six-year-old US embargo of Venezuelan oil, has caused its value to soar.\n\nBy intervening in the currency market, the government aims to gradually reduce the gap between the official dollar rate and the black market rate, the Ecoanalitica firm said.\n\nBefore the US capture of longtime leader Nicolas Maduro in a bombing raid on Caracas in January 3, Venezuela had been forced to offer huge discounts on its crude to circumvent the US oil embargo.\n\nThe biggest customer for its crude was China.\n\nWashington began clamping down on those sales in December by seizing tankers carrying sanctioned Venezuelan crude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: crude oil US currency Venezuela \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PNP welcomes upgrade of US travel advisory, describes it as boost for tourism recovery \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—Opposition Spokesperson on Tourism and Linkages Andrea Purkiss has welcomed the decision by the United States Department of State to... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Parent urged to register students for cashless transportation card before February 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Parents are being urged to register their children for the student transportation card ahead of February 1, when the Rural School ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mbappe, Vinicius help Real Madrid thrash Monaco in Champions League \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2026 \n\n\n MADRID, Spain (AFP)—Kylian Mbappe struck twice against his former side Monaco as Real Madrid romped to an emphatic 6-1 Champions League victory on Tue... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $158.01 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Tuesday, January 20, ended trading at $158.01, down by 25 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IMF approves US$45m disbursement to Jamaica under natural disaster window \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a disbursement of US$415 million to Jamaica under the Ra... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n One Drop beat drives Garfield Cowan’s Roots Rock Reggae Riddim \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2026 \n\n\n Although roots reggae had run its course by the time Garfield Cowan got interested in music production, he always admired the One Drop beat that made ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Two parish council officials charged in cocaine bust at Sangster airport \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Detectives assigned to the Firearms and Narcotics Investigation Division (FNID) have charged two municipal officials following the... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Efforts to expropriate assets from foreign oil companies in 2007 have further fuelled criticism from the Trump administration, which considers Venezuelan oil “stolen” from US owners.\n\nLegal experts, however, largely consider such arguments a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty.\n\nTrump has nevertheless said the US will control Venezuela’s oil and has used the threat of further military attacks to pressure Venezuela’s government into compliance.\n\nThe Trump administration has also placed steep sanctions on Venezuela’s economy, as part of a trend stretching back to the Republican leader’s first term as president.\n\nThe US has framed the tanker seizures as a way of enforcing those sanctions, although the legality of using military force to enforce economic penalties is disputed.\n\nTrump and his officials have said that the sale of Venezuelan oil on the world market will be dictated by the US and that the proceeds from those sales will be placed in a US-controlled bank account.\n\nTrump has also used control over Venezuela’s oil to ratchet up pressure on Cuba, for which access to Venezuelan oil is an important economic lifeline.\n\nThe US president told reporters on Tuesday at a White House briefing that he has taken 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela.\n\n“We’ve got millions of barrels of oil left,” he said at the White House. “We’re selling it on the open market. We’re bringing down oil prices incredibly.”\n\nInterim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, meanwhile, said that her country had received $300m from recent oil sales. In her inaugural state of the union address last week, she signalled that her administration would reform the country’s hydrocarbon law to allow more foreign investment in future.","url":"https://dominicanrepublicpost.com/us-seizes-a-seventh-venezuela-linked-oil-tanker/","image":"https://dominicanrepublicpost.com/app/uploads/2026/01/AP26020753515315-1768956524-11L6yq.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 01:33:15","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"do","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":394696962,"title":"The Blogs: We Have Trump's Morality to Keep Us Safe","text":"President Donald J. Trump made an observation about himself recently, the implications of which he may not even fully understand.\n\nBut it told us all we ever needed to know about him.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, when asked if there were any limits to his global powers, he replied:\n\n“Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.” Then he added, “I don’t need international law.”\n\nNothing will stand in his way, he proudly boasts. Not local, state, national or international laws. Thus, we have to rely on Trump’s morality for protection.\n\nThat revelation should have received massive coverage but it lasted for all of a few hours in the 24-hour news cycle.\n\nYou might want to read his statement again — and again.\n\nOur guarantees against lawlessness, depravity and corruption comes from a man who does not have one moral, decent, virtuous, ethical, commendable, honest, noble, honorable (I can go on but I think you get the picture) cell in his character,\n\nWhich, of course, translated, means, since morality is not an issue for Trump, anything goes. He will wield his power, while the law, decency, honesty, integrity be damned.\n\nFollowing the raid in Venezuela, Trump made that point by criticizing Democrats, stating: “They (Democrats) should say ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh gee, maybe it’s not constitutional. You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years.”\n\nYes, we have been “hearing” this, to be exact, for 250 years.\n\nWrote The Times: “It was the most blunt acknowledgment yet of Trump’s worldview: that national strength alone should be the deciding factor when nations’ interests collide. Past presidents, he suggested, have been too cautious with American power.”\n\nBut we should not be surprised. We had warnings — several — along the way.\n\nMary L. Trump, a psychologist and the president’s niece, warned us in her book, Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man (Simon & Schuster 2020).\n\nShe described the dysfunctional family and that should have helped us better understand Trump’s moral — immoral — standards.\n\nThen there was Marine Corps General John F. Kelly who served as chief of staff in Trump’s first term before resigning in 2019.\n\n“The depths of his dishonesty is just astounding to me,” Kelly was reported to have told friends. “The dishonesty, the transactional nature of every relationship, though it’s more pathetic than anything else. He is the most flawed person I have ever met in my life.”\n\nFormer New York Times political columnist Charles M. Blow wrote in October 2016, a month before the presidential election:\n\n“Your soul is dark…your character corrupt…a prime example of the worst of humanity (emphasis supplied).\n\nAt the time, when I was already writing very critical columns on Trump, I thought Blow crossed the indefinable journalistic line but, it turned out, he was ahead of his time.\n\nIn one instance, Trump seemed to understand his flawed character.\n\nWhen he was asked during a five-hour interview with Michael D’Antonio who was writing a biography, if he ever contemplated the meaning of life, Trump answered:\n\n“I don’t like to analyze myself because I might not like what I see.”\n\nThat, of course, is another unintentional confession. He knows very well what he would see.\n\nHis (im)moral compass explains Venezuela, Greenland, Canada, Nigeria, Iran, his praise for Vladimir Putin, the National Guard in U.S. cities, and so much more.\n\nIt all comes down to “might makes right” and he wants to become the Putin of the world.

Efforts to expropriate assets from foreign oil companies in 2007 have further fuelled criticism from the Trump administration, which considers Venezuelan oil “stolen” from US owners.\n\nLegal experts, however, largely consider such arguments a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty.\n\nTrump has nevertheless said the US will control Venezuela’s oil and has used the threat of further military attacks to pressure Venezuela’s government into compliance.\n\nThe Trump administration has also placed steep sanctions on Venezuela’s economy, as part of a trend stretching back to the Republican leader’s first term as president.\n\nThe US has framed the tanker seizures as a way of enforcing those sanctions, although the legality of using military force to enforce economic penalties is disputed.\n\nTrump and his officials have said that the sale of Venezuelan oil on the world market will be dictated by the US and that the proceeds from those sales will be placed in a US-controlled bank account.\n\nTrump has also used control over Venezuela’s oil to ratchet up pressure on Cuba, for which access to Venezuelan oil is an important economic lifeline.\n\nThe US president told reporters on Tuesday at a White House briefing that he has taken 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela.\n\n“We’ve got millions of barrels of oil left,” he said at the White House. “We’re selling it on the open market. We’re bringing down oil prices incredibly.”\n\nInterim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, meanwhile, said that her country had received $300m from recent oil sales.

He answered \"Yes\" when asked if he would arrest Netanyahu.In a separate interview on Friday, as reported by The National Post, Carney said the Netanyahu government's actions are \"explicitly designed to end any possibility of a state of Palestine in violation of the UN charter and going against Canadian government policy of whatever political stripe since 1947.\"Since 1947, Canadian government policy has been to support a two-state solution, Carney said.Canada recognized the state of Palestine on September 21, ahead of the United Nations General Assembly. This coincided with coordinated announcements from the United Kingdom, Australia, and Portugal, followed quickly by France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, and Andorra on September 22-23.Separately, in December 2023, South Africa initiated landmark legal proceedings against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), alleging violations of the 1948 Genocide Convention in its war on Gaza. Israel's genocide was temporarily halted after a ceasefire was declared by US President Donald Trump earlier that month.Between January and May 2024, the ICJ issued three sets of provisional measures ordering Israel to halt the genocide, halt its military operations, and allow humanitarian access to the enclave.Since October 2023, Israel's genocidal war has killed nearly 68,200 Palestinians, mostly children and women, and injured more than 170,200, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.Read: Canada Provides Rp266 Billion in Funding for Five New Initiatives in IndonesiaClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"Canada would enforce the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visited the country","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/2081860/pm-mark-carney-netanyahu-will-be-arrested-if-he-visits-canada","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/04/29/id_1395035/1395035_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 01:19:35","author":"Sita Planasari","authors":["Sita Planasari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"id","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":394693732,"title":"US military seizes another Venezuela-linked tanker in the Caribbean","text":"p>Washington: The U.S. military said it seized a Venezuela-linked tanker on Tuesday in the Caribbean, marking the ​seventh such apprehension since the start of ‌U.S. President Donald Trump's month-long campaign to ⁠control Venezuela's oil flows.The ‌U.S. military's Southern Command, which is overseeing nearly a dozen warships and thousands of troops in the Caribbean, said in a statement it apprehended the Motor ​Vessel Sagitta \"without incident.\"\"The apprehension of another tanker operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean demonstrates our ‌resolve to ‌ensure that the only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is ⁠coordinated properly and lawfully,\" it said in a statement..Trump has focused his foreign policy in Latin America on Venezuela, initially aiming to ⁠push Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from ⁠power.

While Democrats argue the administration is overstepping its power, many Trump voters have argued he has not gone far enough to accomplish the MAGA agenda he ran on. One thing Democrats and Republicans anticipate, however, is that when Democrats retake power, they will expand the Supreme Court, one of many upcoming reforms Acosta and Welch anticipated with the upcoming \"blue tsunami\" of the midterms.

We are prosecuting. We're going to uncover every document, every phone call, everything you did. We will be relentless about it.

We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,” Carney said. “The old order is not coming back.”Without naming the United States or President Donald Trump, Carney pointed squarely at what he called “American hegemony,” arguing that great powers are now weaponising the very economic integration that once promised shared prosperity..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}“We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,” Carney said. “That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. This fiction was useful — and American hegemony in particular helped provide public goods. But this bargain no longer works.”Carney said recent crises in finance, health, energy and geopolitics have exposed the dangers of deep global interdependence, especially as major powers increasingly deploy tariffs, financial systems and supply chains as tools of pressure. “Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons,” he said. “Tariffs as leverage. Financial infrastructure as coercion. Supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.”For Canada, Carney said, the implications are sobering. Long-held beliefs that geography and alliances alone would guarantee prosperity and security are no longer valid. “You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration when integration becomes the source of your subordination,” he warned.The prime minister said Canada must now pursue a “principled and pragmatic” strategy — strengthening domestic capacity while diversifying trade ties to reduce reliance on any single partner. He acknowledged that multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the United Nations have been weakened, forcing countries to operate more independently.“A country that cannot feed itself, fuel itself or defend itself has few options,” Carney said. “When the rules no longer protect you, you must protect yourself.”While warning that a “world of fortresses” would make nations poorer and more fragile, Carney argued that middle powers must build flexible coalitions with like-minded partners. “If you are not at the table, you are on the menu,” he said.Closing his speech, Carney rejected nostalgia for the past. “The old order is not coming back. We should not mourn it,” he said. “From the fracture, we can build something better, stronger and more just.” - EndsPublished By: Nitish SinghPublished On: Jan 21, 2026","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/canada-news/story/canadian-pm-mark-carney-says-old-world-order-is-dead-as-great-powers-weaponize-trade-2855294-2026-01-21","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202601/canada-pm-mark-carney-215848613-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=.vo3CQjyvCbqJ0Pw.6VCc6zEPbhzcns1?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:59:56","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.22},{"id":394691956,"title":"S&P 500: Investors dump stocks and bonds as Donald Trump triggers ‘Sell America’ trade","text":"Investors dumped stocks, bonds and the US dollar overnight rattled by President Donald Trump’s threat to renew a trade war with the Old Continent over the future of Greenland.\n\nThe most dramatic moves were felt in the US sharemarket with the S&P 500 and technology-heavy Nasdaq both tumbling more than 2 per cent as the market played catch up after being closed on Monday for a public holiday.","url":"https://www.afr.com/markets/debt-markets/stocks-and-bonds-dumped-as-sell-america-trade-returns-20260121-p5nvol","image":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3088%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_467%2C$y_55/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/1e0b40e285e73759422d24def171e8fce6136417","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:58:42","author":"Cecile Lefort","authors":["Cecile Lefort"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.537},{"id":394692852,"title":"Stocks, dollar, treasuries slide on  US-Europe trade tensions","text":"Stocks, United States long-dated Treasuries, and the dollar declined sharply on Tuesday as investors reacted to renewed trade tensions between the United States and Europe, according to Reuters.\n\nThe move reversed gains seen earlier in the week, reflecting heightened market uncertainty.\n\nReuters reports that President Donald Trump’s renewed threat to impose tariffs on European imports triggered a repeat of the “Sell America” trade seen after last year’s April tariff announcement, with investors pulling back from US assets.\n\nWall Street’s key gauge of investor anxiety, the Cboe Volatility Index, rose as much as 1.9 points to an eight-week high of 20.69, Reuters adds.

But that doesn’t mean there won’t be consequences. They just aren’t quite legal ones. \n\n“As far as I’m aware, there haven’t been any international treaties or any laws that have been broken due to this,” Maria Villegas Bravo, counsel for theElectronic Privacy Information Center, told HuffPost.\n\n“There’s no real expectation of privacy outside of the trust you place in these other people that you are working with and sending messages to, so it is definitely breaking an unspoken mutually-assured agreement among a lot of the members of diplomatic corps [and] among world leaders,” she said.\n\nHowever, it can be really concerning to see leaders demonstrate a less-than-safe cybersecurity ethos — and it makes sense if it raises some alarm for you as a citizen.\n\n“There really needs to be a lot stronger op-sec, both in terms of a counterintelligence angle of other governments learning what the US government is up to — that is obviously a huge angle — but also for transparency reasons,” Villegas Bravo said. “There are a lot of records that should be maintained by the federal archives that just aren’t being documented properly and that means that there’s less transparency into what the government is deciding to do, how they’re deciding to do things and what they’re able to provide in FOIA requests or other open-government requests.”\n\n“I do believe this is going to limit a lot of the trust and a lot of the ability of world leaders, international governments, from speaking candidly — and maybe not through official channels with the US government,” Villegas Bravo continued. “So there might be some breakdown in communication. But, technically, from what I understand, not illegal.”\n\nPrivate citizens do have a few more protections — for example, if your private information is “leaked to the press or the community at large,” Villegas Bravo said. You might be able to sue in cases where your privacy has been violated in a way that is “sufficiently widespread to be constituted as disclosure.” (Think: something like the Hulk Hogan sex tape situation in 2015.) \n\nLikewise, some state-level laws like Daniel’s Law in New Jersey allow “covered persons” (judicial officers, prosecutors, law enforcement, child protective service investigators and their immediate family members who share a household with them) to have publicly identifying information deleted from public websites. \n\n“If [a covered individual’s] private information, their address or their phone number, is leaked to the public, they are able to have that taken down or have that removed from public websites,” Villegas Bravo noted, “which is really great, but should be expanded really to the general public.” \n\nBut, again, these laws don’t protect you from someone you chose to communicate with choosing to pass along what you communicated to them. \n\nWe’ll get to some more technical tips later — but the best defense is not sending something you wouldn’t want read aloud via text.\n\n“There’s a very common refrain in like the legal world: ‘Don’t send an email, don’t send a text, unless you’re willing to have a judge read it into the record in trial.’” Villegas Bravo said, later adding: “That should be something you’re considering with every message you send, especially with more sensitive or more intimate details or maybe classified information.”\n\nThis can feel obvious, but it’s something a lot of people might overlook in daily life, when our phones feel like extensions of ourselves and the threats to privacy are so numerous.\n\nThat’s also why it’s important to consider the proper channel for the kind of communicating you’re doing before you send a text. This can range from making sure you’re using the “correct” channels for more official work (like if you work in the government) or “monitoring your communications, knowing what should be an in-person conversation versus what should be written down versus what should be maybe a phone call,” Villegas Bravo said. \n\nThis is also important for activists in group chats (yes, even the encrypted ones): “I think people get a little bit more willy-nilly there, thinking like ‘Oh, I’m on an encrypted chat platform. Therefore, this is safe,’” Thorin Klosowski, a security and privacy activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told HuffPost. “But that just kind of accounts for one part of the equation, one part of the danger. If there’s people you don’t know in there, that’s always gonna be a risk — even just people that you do know who maybe you don’t trust super well.” \n\nAvoiding handing a “paper trail” over to someone who sucks certainly helps. \n\nUltimately, the trustworthiness of the person on the other end of the line matters a whole lot when deciding whether to use a more informal (and often more insecure) channel like texting. \n\nVillegas Bravo said a lot of this comes down to “forethought” and “knowing who you’re talking to when you’re talking to them and what kind of paper trail you’re leaving.”\n\n“It’s one of those things where it’s like you don’t expect the leader of a country to so blatantly go against known diplomatic practices,” she said. “But for, like, the everyday person? Yeah, just know who you’re talking to. Do you trust them? How much are you willing to go public with certain things?” \n\nIn a worst-case scenario where your texts get screenshotted and leaked, as Klosowski said, you might just end up at the mercy of that recipient’s humanity. And, unsurprisingly, your mileage may vary with that one.\n\n“I don’t know that there’s much you can do beyond asking that person politely to remove the thing that they shared or to not [share it] if they have a screenshot but haven’t posted it on the internet,” Klosowski said. “I don’t think there’s a lot you can really do beyond just appealing to their human nature.”\n\nIt’s up to you to determine if the person on the other end is someone who has such a nature you can appeal to — but you can avoid putting yourself in that situation entirely by also staying firmly aware of who you are speaking to and what you are speaking to them about. (And that does include checking to make sure the chat you’re in doesn’t have some random guy in it.)\n\n“In my experience, people just kind of tend to forget — especially in group chats — there’s a lot of different people in those and forgetting who is in them or not knowing everyone who is in them is kind of a recipe for something to get screenshot or shared without your knowledge,” Klosowski said.\n\nYou do still need to practice some digital hygiene.\n\nA high-level faux pas can be an open door to cleaning up your own cybersecurity hygiene and safeguarding your own butt against an embarrassing and preventable disclosure. \n\nOne thing both Klosowski and Villegas Bravo emphasize is that using and familiarizing yourself with encrypted messaging options (and their features) is something you should prioritize. \n\n“There are some tools in some apps that you can use,” Klosowski adds. “Especially with one-on-one communications, you can turn on something like disappearing messages, which at least makes it so something doesn’t stick around — but does not stop someone from screenshotting in the moment.”\n\nEven if you are already firmly using one of these apps, it can help to get under the hood of the specific one you’re using (EFF has guides for Signal and WhatsApp readily available) and understand how features like disappearing messages, group chats and even your contact list work to avoid doing something you’ll regret.\n\n“There’s not a magic bullet here, and I think that’s kind of the lesson for all of us,” Klosowski said. “You can tweak settings to any degree, but if you aren’t familiar with how the apps work, what they’re doing and what your friends aren’t doing ... having a curiosity about how these work and actually spending time in [them] instead of just sending messages back and forth and assuming you’re safe is the best way to protect yourself with the people you talk with.” \n\nYou can also use resources like EFF’s “Surveillance Self Defense Toolkit” to familiarize yourself with more cybersecurity best practices that fit you and your communication style.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cybersecurity-text-leaks_n_696fa836e4b0ced6f58707d5?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/696fa8ad14000023f164c912.jpeg?cache=MU5TMoQD4a&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:57:16","author":"Katherine Speller","authors":["Katherine Speller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":394691984,"title":"Trump: ‘Criminal’ Immigrants Make Infamous Biker Gang Look Like ‘Sweetest People On Earth’","text":"President Donald Trump blamed the Biden administration for allegedly letting millions of murderers, drug dealers and “a lot of bad people” come into the U.S. before veering off on a tangent about his love for a notorious biker gang during a press briefing at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nWhile touting his sweeping immigration crackdown, Trump bragged about stemming the tide of illegal immigration across the southern border and claimed that for the first time in 50 years, the U.S. was experiencing “reverse migration.”\n\n“We have a big process for having people come in legally, by the way.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nThe European Union's top official on Tuesday called Trump's planned new tariffs on eight of its countries over Greenland a \"mistake\" and questioned Trump's trustworthiness. French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU could retaliate by deploying one of its most powerful economic tools, known colloquially as a trade \"bazooka.\"\n\nThe rising tensions concerning Greenland, and threats of a deepening trade war between the U.S. and Europe, caused global investors to shudder Tuesday, as stocks on Wall Street slumped.\n\nTrump prides himself on ratcheting up pressure to try to negotiate through a position of strength. He was leaving Washington Tuesday — the anniversary of his inauguration — for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a venue that offers Trump the chance to defuse tensions as quickly as he stirred them up.\n\nBut European leaders — digging in and vowing to defend Denmark and its control over semiautonomous Greenland — may be trying just as hard to meet an extraordinary moment with a show of their fierce resolve.\n\nThat could hurt the chances of Trump finding a quick way to turn around the crisis. Greenland's leader insisted on respect for its territorial integrity and called international law \"not a game.\"\n\n'We will work something out'\n\nTrump made an unusual appearance in the White House briefing room and spoke at length while stocks fell. Asked how far he'd be willing to go to acquire Greenland, Trump said only, \"You'll find out.\" He also mistakenly referred to Greenland as Iceland at one point.\n\nStill, the president predicted there could be a deal in the making. \"I think that we will work something out where NATO is going to be very happy, and where we're going to be very happy,\" he said, without providing specifics.\n\nTrump said he'd been encouraged that NATO had increased military spending, but he also belittled the alliance, saying other members may not protect Washington's interests. The president suggested NATO members expect the U.S. to come to their rescue but \"I just really do question whether or not they'll come to ours.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pushed back against Trump's announcement that, starting in February, a 10% import tax will be imposed on goods from eight European nations that have rallied around Denmark. Greenland is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO member.\n\n\"The European Union and the United States have agreed to a trade deal last July,\" von der Leyen said in Davos. \"And in politics as in business – a deal is a deal. And when friends shake hands, it must mean something.\"\n\n\"We consider the people of the United States not just our allies, but our friends. And plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape,\" she added.\n\nShe vowed that the EU's response \"will be unflinching, united and proportional.\"\n\nTaking firmer stances defied the approach that many European leaders have offered since Trump returned to office. It had mostly entailed saying nice things about the president to try to stay in his good graces, while working furiously through other avenues to find compromise.\n\nTrump says the U.S. needs Greenland to deter possible threats from China and Russia. But his continued insistence in recent weeks that anything short of the U.S. owning Greenland is unacceptable is testing the limits of the softer strategy.\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said \"the worst may still be ahead of us.\" Speaking to parliament, she said: \"We have never sought conflict. We have consistently sought cooperation.\"\n\n'We need to have respect for international law'\n\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a news conference in the island's capital, Nuuk, that \"we need to have respect for international law and territorial integrity.\" He said those principles should unite Western democratic countries, and expressed gratitude for EU allies' support.\n\n\"International law, it's not a game,\" he said, adding, \"We are willing to cooperate much more, but of course in mutual respect, and if we cannot see that, it will be very difficult to have a good and reliable partnership.\"\n\nTrump's threats have sparked outrage and a flurry of diplomatic activity across Europe, as leaders consider possible countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs and the unprecedented use of the EU's anti-coercion instrument.\n\nUnofficially known as the \"trade bazooka,\" the instrument could sanction individuals or institutions found to be putting undue pressure on the EU. The EU has two other major economic tools it could use to pressure Washington: new tariffs or a suspension of the U.S.-EU trade deal.\n\nMacron warned in Davos that the additional tariffs could force the EU to use its anti-coercion mechanism for the first time against the United States.\n\n\"Can you imagine that?\" he said, arguing that allied countries should be focusing instead on bringing peace to Ukraine. \"This is crazy.\"\n\nIn general, he said, the mechanism \"is a powerful instrument and we should not hesitate to deploy it in today's tough environment.\"\n\nTrump earlier posted a text message from Macron in which the French president suggested a meeting of members of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies in Paris after the Davos gathering. An official close to Macron, who spoke anonymously in line with the French presidency's customary practices, confirmed the message shared by Trump is genuine.\n\nIn his latest threat of tariffs, Trump indicated that the import taxes would be retaliation for last week's deployment of symbolic numbers of troops from the European countries to Greenland — though he also suggested he was using the tariffs as leverage to negotiate with Denmark.\n\n'In the midst of a rupture'\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose country is a founding NATO member, warned of global fissures beyond Greenland, suggesting it was an \"illusion\" and \"fiction\" that there remains a rules-based international order.\n\n\"Let me be direct: We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney said during a speech in Davos.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said at Davos that Europe cannot be a \"miserable slave to Trump.\"\n\nOthers encouraged NATO leaders to stand up to Trump. Speaking on the sidelines of Davos, California Gov. Gavin Newsom slammed Europe's response to Trump's tariff threats as \"pathetic\" and \"embarrassing,\" and urged continental leaders to unite and stand up to the United States.\n\n\"It's time to stand tall and firm, have a backbone,\" Newsom, a Democrat, told reporters.\n\nGreenland's European backers have also looked at establishing a more permanent military presence to help guarantee security in the Arctic region, a key demand of the United States, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson said.\n\nIn Moscow, meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov strongly denied any intention by Russia and China to threaten Greenland, while also describing Greenland as a \"colonial gain\" for Denmark.\n\nTrump was asked Tuesday what would happen to his tariff threats related to Greenland if the Supreme Court rules against his ability to impose import tariffs as part of a case it is considering.\n\n\"Well, I'll have to use something else,\" Trump said. \"We have other alternatives.\" He didn't respond when asked about using force.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2026/01/21/trumps-greenland-threats-spark-outrage-from-eu-and-test-longtime-nato-alliance","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/global_files/default_meta_image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:53:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":394693748,"title":"'No ICE, no KKK, no ‌fascist USA': Thousands protest against Trump immigration policies","text":"p>Thousands of U.S. workers and students marched through cities and university campuses on Tuesday in ​opposition to the immigration policies of President Donald Trump.

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nThe gathering in Davos, Switzerland, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push for the seizure of Greenland and the imposition of related trade tariffs.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, wearing aviator sunglasses because of an eye infection, warned of a \"new colonial approach\" that would undermine decades of collaboration.\n\nMark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and former central banker, urged countries below the top tier of global power to continue multilateral cooperation with a new, \"dense web of connections.\"\n\nAnd in the forum's entrance hall, Newsom was the most blunt, telling European leaders: \"It's time to get serious and stop being complicit. It's time to stand tall and firm – have a backbone.\"\n\nHere's a look at what attendees said:\n\nGavin Newsom\n\n\"I can't take this complicity. People rolling over. I should've brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders,\" the California governor and prominent Democrat said. \"I hope people understand how pathetic they look on the world stage. I mean, at least from an American perspective, it's embarrassing.\" He added: \"Diplomacy with Donald Trump? He's a T-Rex. You mate with him or he devours you. One or the other ... Wake up! Where the hell has everybody been? Stop with this (expletive) diplomacy of sort of niceties and somehow we're all going to figure it out, saying one thing privately and another publicly. Have some spine, some goddamn (expletive).\"\n\nEmmanuel Macron\n\nBefore expressing his concern, the French president began his address with a joke: \"It's a time of peace, stability and predictability.\"\n\nWarning major powers against the temptation of modern colonial adventures, he added: \"It's a shift towards a world without rules. Where international law is trampled underfoot and where the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest, and imperial ambitions are resurfacing.\" Then he took aim at the Trump administration, denouncing \"competition from the United States of America, through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe, combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty.\"\n\nMark Carney\n\n\"Great powers can afford for now to go it alone. They have the market size, the military capacity, and the leverage to dictate terms. Middle powers do not,\" the Canadian prime minister said.\n\n\"In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,\" he said. \"(We) argue the middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.\"\n\nCarney strongly opposed U.S. aspirations to expand its Arctic territory. \"We stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future.\"\n\nScott Bessent\n\nWith President Trump not due to address the elite global gathering until Wednesday, it fell to his treasury secretary to take up his defense in Switzerland.\n\n\"I think our relations have never been closer,\" Scott Bessent said, playing down the rift among Western countries over Greenland. \"Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.\"\n\nHe added: \"We are in the middle of President Trump's policies. And of course, Europe is an ally, the U.S.-NATO membership is unquestioned. We are partners in trying to stop this tragic war between Russia and Ukraine, but that does not mean that we cannot have disagreements on the future of Greenland.\"\n\nBart De Wever\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said that with Trump's Greenland provocations, \"so many red lines have been crossed\" in Europe.\n\n\"Being a happy vassal is one thing. Being a miserable slave is something else. If you back down now you're going to lose your dignity,\" he said during a Davos panel discussion on redefining Europe's place in the world.\n\nDe Wever said that he and Belgium's King Philippe will meet with Trump on Wednesday when they will plan to press for a return to the old military alliance between Brussels and Washington.\n\n\"We either stand together or we will stand divided, and if we are divided, there is the end of an era, of 80 years of Atlanticism, really drawing to a close,\" he said.\n\nThe former mayor of Antwerp, quoting the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci, said that in a time of great transformation that it is up to U.S. president if the alliance holds. \"It's up to him (Trump) to decide if he wants to be a monster - yes or no.\"\n\nUrsula von der Leyen\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a diplomatic \"downward spiral\" in the West would only embolden its adversaries.\n\n\"The proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies. The European Union and the United States have agreed to a trade deal last July. And in politics, as in business, a deal is a deal,\" the EU's top official said.\n\nThe Commission president said Europe was obliged to respond to international pressure.\n\n\"My point is: if this change is permanent, then Europe must change permanently too. It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new independent Europe,\" von der Leyen said. \"We consider the people of the United States not just our allies, but our friends. And plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape.\"","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2026/01/21/in-their-words-trumps-threats-over-greenland-draw-warnings-and-profanities-at-global-forum","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/global_files/default_meta_image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:47:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":394691358,"title":"World News | Pakistan: Gul Plaza Fire Tragedy Exposes Shortage of Fire Stations in Karachi","text":"Karachi [Pakistan] January 21 (ANI): The devastating fire at Gul Plaza, which killed 28 people, has brought into sharp focus the chronic lack of fire safety infrastructure in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city with an estimated population of nearly 25 million, ARY News reported. Officials have admitted that the metropolis is operating far below internationally accepted fire safety standards.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump's Greenland Tariff Threats Spark Outrage and Defiance From EU, Testing Longtime NATO Alliances.\nFire Chief Officer Muhammad Humayun Khan said standard operating procedures require one fire station for every 0.1 million people. By that benchmark, Karachi should ideally have around 2,500 fire stations.\nHowever, speaking to ARY News, he revealed that the city currently has only 28 fire stations, supported by 45 fire tenders and just six snorkels--resources he described as grossly inadequate for a city of Karachi's size and density.\nAlso Read | Fake Pizza Hut Store Inaugurated in Pakistan: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif Inaugurates ‘Fake’ Pizza Hut Outlet in Sialkot, American Multinational Issues Clarification.\nHighlighting global comparisons, ARY News noted that Dhaka has 112 fire stations, New Delhi has 61, while Tehran--despite having a smaller population--operates as many as 452 fire stations. The contrast has intensified concerns about Karachi's preparedness to handle large-scale emergencies.\nThe issue gained renewed attention following the deadly blaze at the Gul Plaza shopping mall on M.A. Jinnah Road. The fire, which broke out late on Saturday night, January 17, 2026, was brought under control only after nearly 36 hours of firefighting operations. The inferno claimed at least 28 lives, including one firefighter, while 81 people are still reported missing. Two sections of the building collapsed during the incident. Gul Plaza reportedly housed around 1,200 shops.\nAuthorities are now closely monitoring the remaining structure of the damaged building, with no final decision yet on demolition or reconstruction.\nAccording to ARY News, officials from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) said the basement is currently filled with hot water, making it impossible to immediately inspect the interior columns.\nSBCA officials stressed that any decision on declaring the building unsafe or opting for reconstruction would only be taken after a detailed assessment by the technical committee, fire brigade, and rescue teams. They added that it is too early to reach conclusions about the fate of the structure.\nMeanwhile, the recent collapse of Gul Plaza's exterior wall caused the building to tilt towards the adjacent Rampa Plaza, damaging two of its internal columns. SBCA Director Rehan said jacks would be installed between Rampa Plaza and the front portion of Gul Plaza to stabilise the structure.\nOnce stabilisation work is completed, Karachi Municipal Corporation teams will be permitted to enter the site to resume search operations. However, due to extreme heat conditions inside the building, immediate access remains unsafe, and water is being sprayed to reduce temperatures, ARY News reported. Officials said that depending on the technical assessment and operational clearance, the damaged sections of Gul Plaza could be demolished within the next two to three days.(ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Roosevelt famously illustrated with a simple metaphor the need for a healthy transatlantic alliance. Justifying his decision to lend Great Britain warships and other military supplies in the early days of World War II, Roosevelt likened it to loaning a neighbor a garden hose to put out the fire consuming his house. Sure, Roosevelt charitably wanted to help a neighbor in need. But it was self-interested too; if the neighbor could extinguish the blaze, it wouldn’t spread to FDR’s home. The United States benefited from the friendship—and the buffer—that allies could provide.\n\nToday, Donald Trump will fly to Europe. Ukraine is already ablaze. And now the president is ready to set a bunch of new houses on fire.\n\nThe president will speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, tomorrow, and he appears prepared to shatter the nearly 80-year-old NATO alliance in order to seize Greenland. In his quest to claim a strategically located island of ice and rock, Trump has turned against his nation’s most stalwart friends. He has antagonized and mocked panicked European leaders, threatened punishing tariffs on countries that object to his plans, and pointedly not ruled out using military force. Trump’s thirst for Greenland—even if he stops short of ordering an armed invasion—threatens to unravel the partnership born from the ashes of World War II that has, in the decades since, ensured the spread of peace, prosperity, and democracy on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nToday marks one year since Trump’s return to office, and in that time, he has fundamentally reshaped the United States’ relationship with the rest of the world. But nothing has upended the global order more than what would happen if he follows through on his threats toward Greenland. The island, of course, belongs to Denmark, which says it is not available for the taking. Troops from Europe have been dispatched to the territory, and Greenland’s prime minister warned his populace to prepare for an invasion. If Trump were to persist, Denmark could trigger NATO’s Article 5 mutual-defense pact and then the unthinkable could occur: American soldiers firing on Europeans while Russian President Vladimir Putin’s dream of NATO’s self-immolation is thoroughly realized.\n\nThe annual meetings in snowy Davos, normally a clubby gathering of business titans and political leaders, have been consumed by talk of what Trump may or may not do. European leaders have found themselves scrambling on strategy—appeasement? Defiance? Compromise? Early this morning, Trump posted screenshots of text messages that revealed the dilemma facing those leaders. (Lesson to everyone: Be careful what you text the guy unless you want the world to see.)\n\nIn one message, Mark Rutte—the secretary general of NATO, who has prized warm relations with Trump—praised the president’s foreign policies, then vowed that he was “committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.” But in another, French President Emmanuel Macron, whose relationship with Trump has been turbulent, admitted: “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” In fact, Trump couldn’t be more clear, as he demonstrated once again by circulating a pair of presumably AI-generated images on social media. In one, he’s planting an American flag in Greenland. In the other, he’s lecturing European leaders in the Oval Office with a map behind him that depicts Greenland as part of the United States. (Canada and Venezuela, too.)\n\nTrolling close U.S. allies has seemingly been an unofficial policy of Trump’s second administration since its first days, beginning with Vice President J. D. Vance lecturing Europe on the virtues of free-speech in Munich. But this time feels different for those nervously waiting in snowy Switzerland. The president’s address to the forum tomorrow is poised to be a defining moment, and Trump plans to make the unequivocal case that the United States should have Greenland, a senior White House official told me. For now, the administration is focused on purchasing Greenland or offering economic incentives to its residents and to those in Denmark, aides told me. But they are not ruling out the use of military force or economic pressure. The senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal strategy, added that the White House is exploring joint-military exercises, withholding participation in NATO and additional tariffs. (The Supreme Court has continued to delay its ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs, keeping that tool in play here.)\n\nYet even as the administration brandishes trade as a first-strike weapon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered this message in Davos today to European allies: “Sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate.” He added again: “Do not retaliate.” (Europe did not say it would listen.) But Trump’s audacious power play won’t stop there: While in Davos, he’s also expected to lean on foreign leaders to join his fledgling Board of Peace, which includes a $1 billion price tag for permanent membership. A number of European heads of state expressed reservations about the board—including that it has a seat earmarked for Putin, who seemed to celebrate the invitation by launching a massive strike against Kyiv this morning. When Macron suggested that he would not join, Trump angrily threatened higher tariffs.\n\nAnd now he has a new grudge: After being denied the Nobel Peace Prize that he covets, Trump this week registered his bitter complaints with the prime minister of Norway, writing that because of the snub, “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” while incorrectly claiming that Denmark’s ownership of Greenland was not supported by “written documents, it’s only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago.”\n\nSome greeted the note with fact-checks and derision. But not the White House: Officials proudly distributed it for all to read.\n\nGreenland is more than just ice and rock—and it has more strategic importance than looking really big on certain maps. Its location is key for Arctic defense and trade routes. It’s rich in minerals. And, yes, Trump has cited those factors as he has declared the island vital for American national security. But Denmark has repeatedly counter-declared that it would happily grant many of Trump’s new demands. Want to build a new military base? Sure! Name it after yourself? Just ask! Yet Trump’s lust for Greenland goes beyond that, people close to him have told me. It’s about increasing American dominance in the Western Hemisphere and redrawing the maps of the world. The island is roughly 836,000 square miles, which would make it the largest territorial addition in U.S. history, eclipsing the Louisiana Purchase and the acquisition of Alaska. It would be something for the history books, the people close to him have said. And that’s where Trump is focused.\n\nRecent polls are clear: Americans strongly disapprove of an attempt to seize Greenland, especially by force. But Trump has been gazing past the midterms and toward his own legacy. A look back at his two previous appearances at Davos illustrates Trump’s evolution. In 2018, he was willing to be something of a deferential guest, shelving some of his nationalist ideology and even saying, “‘America First’ does not mean America alone.” He continued: “When the United States grows, so does the world.” (Hard to believe, I know.) And then, in early 2020, he offered a fairly standard campaign speech, boasting about American progress but evincing little care about what happens beyond the United States’ own borders. That is not the case in Trump 2.0.\n\nAt the one-year mark, Trump’s foreign policy has been defined by rampant interventionism. Though he has not ended as many conflicts as he claims (Trump’s count is eight and growing), the U.S. has played a mediator role in global hot spots, most notably in Gaza. After months of watching the violence, the president pressured both Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to release the hostages and implement a fragile cease-fire. But he’s also continued to erode the U.S.-led global order, instigating risky diplomatic and economic fights with allies. He has not consistently focused on the threat posed by China. His attention to the war in Ukraine has come and gone, but he continues to reflexively defer to Putin. Part of why the European leaders were at first slow to challenge Trump’s Greenland rhetoric was that they didn’t want to provoke him into completely abandoning Kyiv, officials there have told me.\n\nTrump has also fallen in love with the concept of one-and-done military interventions: the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities; the strikes on alleged terrorist targets in Syria and Nigeria; and, of course, the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro earlier this month. Aides have boasted that the Caracas operation was a turning point for the presidency; after limping to the finish of 2025 amid a series of electoral defeats, poor polls, and scandals, Trump seems reinvigorated. He is unchecked domestically—Minneapolis is under siege by federal forces—and internationally. He has been emboldened, and has shown a new willingness to use force. In the hours before Air Force One was scheduled to lift off for Switzerland today, Trump was asked by a reporter how far he’d “be willing to go” to obtain Greenland.\n\n“You’ll find out,” Trump answered.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe waits. And watches for smoke.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/greenland-davos-trump-nato/685688/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/tA1JHHAHnnyzk_D0H0YpN3Zkb7I=/0x0:3717x2091/720x405/media/img/mt/2026/01/2026_01_20_Unpacking_Trumps_Trip_to_Davos/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:45:00","author":"Jonathan Lemire","authors":["Jonathan Lemire"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.328},{"id":394693666,"title":"Japan Court To Rule Today In Ex-PM Shinzo Abe Assassination Case","text":"A Japanese court will on Wednesday deliver its verdict on a man accused of fatally shooting former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, three and a half years after the assassination of the country's longest-serving premier stunned the nation. Tetsuya Yamagami, now 45, was arrested on the spot in July 2022 after fatally firing at Abe with a homemade gun while the former prime minister was delivering a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. Abe was 67.Although he was no longer Japan's leader at the time, Abe remained a powerful and binding force within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. His absence has left a vacuum within the party, which has since seen two leadership races and by extension, a revolving door of prime ministers. Abe himself served as prime minister for a total of 3,188 days over two separate terms, stepping down in September 2020 citing health reasons.His protegee Sanae Takaichi now leads Japan and the LDP, but the party's grip on power has considerably diminished.Abe's killing also brought to light a deep link between his party and the Unification Church, an organisation many consider a cult. An in-party investigation found that more than a hundred lawmakers had dealings with the group, leading many voters to shun the LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period.Media have quoted Yamagami as telling the court that he held a grudge against the Unification Church after his mother's large donation to it caused financial hardship for their family, and that he took out his anger on Abe because the former prime minister had once sent a video message to an event held by a group affiliated with the church.Founded in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church is famous for its mass weddings and counts Japanese followers as a key source of income. A guilty verdict is all but certain after Yamagami admitted to killing Abe in the first court hearing at the Nara District Court in October, and attention is on the severity of the sentence.Prosecutors sought a life sentence last month, calling the act an \"extremely grave incident that is unprecedented in post-war history\". Yamagami's lawyers, meanwhile, argued that the family's misfortune caused by the donation to the Unification Church should be taken into consideration and limit his prison term to 20 years at most.While Abe was a divisive figure domestically, he was among the few global leaders to have a strong rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump. Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his 2016 election victory and the two went on to forge a close bond over rounds of golf in the United States and Japan. Prime Minister Takaichi has repeatedly referenced their friendship in her own dealings with Trump.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"A Japanese court will on Wednesday deliver its verdict on a man accused of fatally shooting former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, three and a half years after the assassination of the country's longest-serving premier stunned the nation.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/japan-court-to-rule-today-in-ex-pm-shinzo-abe-assassination-case-10795838","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2026-01/4ff52bqg_tetsuya-yamagami_625x300_21_January_26.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:43:29","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":394691294,"title":"Despite Greenland, France&#039;s Macron and NATO&#039;s head make nice with Trump behind the scenes","text":"PARIS (AP) — While Europe is pushing back publicly against U.S. President Donald Trump over Greenland, the language appears softer behind the scenes.\n\n French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech as he visits the Istres military air force base, southern France, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (AP Photo/Philippe Magoni, Pool)\n\nTrump published a text message on Tuesday that he received from French President Emmanuel Macron, confirmed as genuine by Macron's office.\n\nStarting with \"My friend,\" Macron's tone was more deferential than the criticism that France and some of its European partner nations are openly voicing against Trump's push to wrest Greenland from NATO ally Denmark.\n\nBefore broaching the Greenland dispute, Macron opted in his message to first talk about other issues where he and Trump seem roughly on the same page.\n\n\"We are totally in line on Syria. We can do great things on Iran,\" the French leader wrote in English.\n\nThen, he added: \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,\" immediately followed by: \"Let us try to build great things.\"\n\nThat was the only mention that Macron made of the semi-autonomous Danish territory in the two sections of message that Trump published. It wasn't immediately clear from Trump's post when he received the message.\n\nTrump breaks with tradition\n\nWorld leaders' private messages to each other rarely make it verbatim into the public domain — enabling them to project one face publicly and another to each other.\n\nBut Trump — as is his wont across multiple domains — is casting traditions and diplomatic niceties to the wind and, in the process, lifting back the curtain on goings-on that usually aren't seen.\n\nThis week, a text message that Trump sent to Norway's prime minister also became public, released by the Norwegian government and confirmed by the White House.\n\nIn it, Trump linked his aggressive stance on Greenland to last year's decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,\" the message read.\n\nIt concluded, \"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump also published a flattering message from Mark Rutte, secretary general of NATO, which the alliance also confirmed as authentic.\n\n\"I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland,\" Rutte wrote. \"Can't wait to see you. Yours, Mark.\"\n\nRutte has declined to speak publicly about Greenland despite growing concern about Trump's threats to \"acquire\" the island and what that would mean for the territorial integrity of NATO ally Denmark. Pressed last week about Trump's designs on Greenland and warnings from Denmark that any U.S. military action might mean the end of NATO, Rutte said: \"I can never comment on that. That's impossible in public.\"\n\nMacron's relationship with Trump\n\nMacron likes to say that he can get Trump on the phone any time he wants. He proved it last September by making a show of calling up the president from a street in New York, to tell Trump that police officers were blocking him to let a VIP motorcade pass.\n\n\"Guess what? I'm waiting in the street because everything is frozen for you!\" Macron said as cameras filmed the scene.\n\nIt's a safe bet that Macron must know by now — a year into Trump's second spell in office — that there's always a risk that a private message to Trump could be made public.\n\nMacron said Tuesday that he had \"no particular reaction\" to the message's publication when a journalist asked him about it.\n\n\"I take responsibility for everything that I do. It's my habit to be coherent between what I say on the outside and what I do in a private manner. That's all.\"\n\nStill, the difference between Macron's public and private personas was striking.\n\nHosting Russia and Ukraine together\n\nMost remarkably, the French leader told Trump in his message that he would be willing to invite representatives from both Ukraine and Russia to a meeting later this week in Paris — an idea that Macron has not voiced publicly.\n\nThe Russians could be hosted \"in the margins,\" Macron suggested, hinting at the potential awkwardness of inviting Moscow representatives while France is also backing Ukraine with military and other support against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion.\n\nMacron wrote that the meeting could also include \"the danish, the syrians\" and the G7 nations — which include the United States.\n\nThe French president added: \"let us have a dinner together in Paris together on thursday before you go back to the us.\"\n\nHe then signed off simply with \"Emmanuel.\"\n\nMaking nice only goes so far\n\nDespite Macron's persistent efforts, in both of Trump's terms, not to ruffle his feathers, any payback has been mixed, at best.\n\nTrump bristled on Monday, threatening punitive tariffs, when told that Macron has no plans to join Trump's new Board of Peace that will supervise the next phase of the Gaza peace plan, despite receiving an invitation.\n\n\"Well, nobody wants him because he's going to be out of office very soon,\" Trump told reporters, even through the French leader has more than a year left in office before the end of his second and last term in 2027.\n\n\"I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join,\" Trump said.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2026/01/21/despite-greenland-frances-macron-and-natos-head-make-nice-with-trump-behind-the-scenes","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/global_files/default_meta_image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:43:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":394692688,"title":"The 'golden dome' is 'incredibly valuable' to the US, Liz Peek says","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nKudlow January 20, 2026 13:51 \n\n The 'golden dome' is 'incredibly valuable' to the US, Liz Peek says \n The 'Kudlow' panel discusses President Donald Trump's first-year accomplishments and his efforts to obtain Greenland.\n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSV-VIDEOSKUDLOWKUDLOW | LATEST EPISODESPOLITICS","summary":"The &apos;Kudlow&apos; panel discusses President Donald Trump&apos;s first-year accomplishments and his efforts to obtain Greenland.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6388012170112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/7f4f9f74-93d1-4c90-b336-ea8c534ba452/23fa2237-8e51-4753-962b-b030b0de6a6e/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:41:44","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.489},{"id":394682834,"title":"Trump Slams U.S. Funding of Ethiopian Dam as a ‘Terrible’ Move","text":"CAIRO - 20 January 2026: President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States was responsible for financing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), calling the decision a \"terrible thing\" that threatens Egypt's water security.\n\n Speaking during a White House press briefing, Trump asserted that the U.S. provided the funds for the massive project on the Nile River, though he expressed uncertainty regarding which administration authorized the payment.\n\n \"You know who paid for the dam?

Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed emphasised that the UAE's decision reflects the importance of fully implementing President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which is critical for the realisation of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. He reaffirmed the UAE's confidence in President Trump's leadership and commitment to global peace, exemplified by the historic Abraham Accords.Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed reaffirmed the UAE's readiness to contribute actively to the mission of the Board of Peace, supporting greater cooperation, stability, and prosperity for all, according to UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Trump has also invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to join the Gaza Board of Peace, describing him as one of several world leaders considered for the initiative.\n\nThe formation of the Gaza Board of Peace, as part of Phase 2 of the 20-Point Peace Plan to end the conflict in the Middle East, aims to promote stability and oversee post-conflict reconstruction in the Gaza Strip.Responding to questions from reporters during a media gaggle, Trump said that Putin was among those invited to participate in the board, which he claimed would work toward peace and stability in Gaza.When asked directly whether he had invited President Putin to join the Board of Peace, Trump replied, \"Yes, he's one of the people. These are world leaders. And the answer is yes.\"The Board of Peace was proposed by Trump last September as part of his plan to end the war in Gaza, although the initiative now seems to be aimed at mediating global conflict more broadly.According to a White House statement, the proposed Executive Board members will oversee portfolios critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success. These include governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilisation.Prime Minister Modi has been invited by Trump to serve on the Gaza Peace Board.However, countries that commit USD 1 billion would secure permanent seats on the board, while those that do not pay could still join for a three-year term.

Since then, the Trump administration has moved to assert control over Venezuela’s oil production, refining and global distribution.Administration officials have openly described tanker seizures as a way to generate revenue while rebuilding Venezuela’s battered energy sector. Trump recently met oil executives to discuss investing $100 billion in Venezuela’s oil industry and selling between 30 million and 50 million barrels on global markets.“We’ve already taken 50 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’re selling it on the open market. We’re bringing down oil prices incredibly.” The first tanker was seized off the coast of Venezuela on December 10. Most of the other tankers also have been captured in the waters near Venezuela, with the exception of the Bella 1, which was captured in the North Atlantic.- EndsWith inputs from Associated PressPublished By: Nitish SinghPublished On: Jan 21, 2026Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/us-seizes-seventh-sanctioned-tanker-defying-donald-trumps-venezuela-oil-quarantine-2855292-2026-01-21","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202601/venezuela-oil-tanker-072727202-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=730f15lj7EbvAQSX3S0EVDTvVKhFA_aT?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:39:10","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.606},{"id":394695180,"title":"‘India has stopped buying Russian oil’: US treasury secy says New Delhi geared down after Trump’s 25% tariff","text":"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday that India has stopped buying Russian oil after President Donald Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, he said in an interview with Fox Business that the US is considering tougher penalties for countries that continue to buy Russian crude, especially China. Bessent shared these remarks as Washington weighs a bill that could impose far higher tariffs, as much as 500 percent, on countries still purchasing oil from Russia. ‘India has geared down and stopped,’ Bessent says According to Bessent, India began purchasing Russian oil after the Ukraine conflict started. However, he said that the situation has now changed following the tariff imposed by the Trump administration. “India started buying Russian oil after the conflict began,” Bessent said. “But President Trump put a 25 percent tariff on them, and India has geared down and has stopped buying Russian oil.” ALSO READUS pauses immigrant visas for citizens of 75 countries from January 21—Full list Meanwhile, India has consistently defended its decision to buy Russian crude in the past. The government has said its energy choices are based on global market conditions and the need to ensure affordable fuel supplies for its population. A bill that could bring 500% tariffs Bessent was speaking in the context of a proposed Russia Sanctions Bill, authored by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. The bill would allow the US to impose tariffs of at least 500 percent on countries that continue to buy Russian oil. The legislation has already received political clearance from President Trump, but is still awaiting approval in the US Senate. “On the 500 percent tariff on the buyers of Russian oil, that is a proposal that Senator Graham has in front of the Senate,” Bessent said. “We don’t believe that President Trump needs that authority, that he can do it under IEPA, but the Senate wants to give him that authority.” While India was mentioned positively, Bessent directed his strongest criticism at Europe and China. “We have Europe buying Russian oil, still, four years later,” he said. “They are financing the war against themselves.” China, one of Russia’s biggest energy buyers, remains the main target of the proposed punitive tariffs. US officials have repeatedly said that China’s purchase of discounted Russian oil is helping fund Moscow’s war in Ukraine. ALSO READ‘Usha is pregnant with a baby boy’: JD Vance, Second Lady announce fourth child Senator Lindsey Graham has said the bill would give President Trump “tremendous leverage” over countries such as China, India and Brazil. He argued that the move would help stop what he described as the financing of “Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine.” Last October, Bessent had claimed that around 85 US senators were willing to give Trump the authority to impose tariffs of up to 500 percent on China for buying Russian oil. Trump speaks at White House briefing Meanwhile, President Donald Trump joined a White House briefing on Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of his inauguration. He spoke for more than an hour, speaking about his administration’s immigration, economic and foreign policies. Trump also warned that he could use other tools to raise revenue if the Supreme Court rules that the tariffs he imposed last year under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal. “I have to use something else. I mean, you know, take a look at the word ‘license.’ Take a look at other things,” Trump said. “I mean, we have other alternatives, but what we’re doing now is the best, the strongest, the fastest, the easiest, the least complicated.” The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality of the tariffs later this term. If the court finds them illegal, companies across the US could become eligible for hundreds of billions of dollars in refund payments.","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/india-has-stopped-buying-russian-oil-us-treasury-secy-says-new-delhi-geared-down-after-trumps-25-tariff/4114067/","image":"https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/11/ANI-20251121025033.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:38:57","author":"Aditi","authors":["Aditi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.122},{"id":394692562,"title":"Israeli UN ambassador sends stark warning to Iran amid growing unrest","text":"Israel is watching Iran and is sending a blunt warning to the regime, which is facing international pressure over growing protests. \"We are in high readiness,\" Israeli United Nations Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters. \"We are ready with our defense capability, and we're ready with our offensive capabilities...

In June 2025, Israel started \"Operation Rising Lion,\" which was aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities.

President Donald Trump threatened that if the regime met protesters with violence, the U.S. would act. However, the U.S. has yet to intervene, and the president has signaled that he has held off on military strikes because of canceled executions. \"I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed a similar message to reporters, saying that all options remained on the table.

He also vowed that once Iran was \"liberated from the yoke of tyranny\" Israel would be prepared to be a partner in peace. \"Israel is closely monitoring the events unfolding in Iran. The protests for freedom have spread throughout the country. The people of Israel, and the entire world, stand in awe of the immense bravery of Iran's citizens. Israel supports their struggle for freedom and firmly condemns the mass killings of innocent civilians,\" Netanyahu said at the beginning of his weekly cabinet meeting. \"We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be liberated from the yoke of tyranny, and when that day comes, Israel and Iran will once again be faithful partners in building a future of prosperity and peace for both nations,\" he added. Iran has also linked the U.S. and Israel to the protests.

In recent weeks his rhetoric on a takeover has escalated as he has refused to rule out military action.\n\nDespite global pushback on his Greenland ambitions, Trump has refused to back down on his threats, saying \"You'll find out\" when asked during a White House press briefing on Tuesday on how far he was willing to go to secure Greenland while dismissing the lack of support for a U.S. takeover. \n\nWhen pressed by ABC News' Mary Bruce about the many Greenlanders who have loudly voiced disagreement with the idea of U.S. control, Trump said that once he talks to them, they'll be \"thrilled.\"\n\nAsked about the possibility of the NATO alliance breaking up if the U.S. seizes Greenland, Trump said: \"I think that we will work something out where NATO's going to be very happy and where we’re going to be very happy. But we need it for security purposes. We need it for national security and even world security. It's very important.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland. I'm leaving tonight, as you know, Davos, and we have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland, and I think things are going to work out pretty well, actually,\" Trump said later. \n\n\"So I think something's going to happen that's going to be very good for everybody,\" he said. \n\nHowever, the president's optimistic outlook on a resolution to both sides' satisfaction comes as he increases attacks on NATO countries who are seeking to protect Greenland. Over the weekend, Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on eight NATO countries starting Feb. 1 if no deal is reached. The move, stemmed in part from the countries' decision to send a small contingent of troops to Greenland in the wake of Trump's threats. \n\nWhen Trump travels to Switzerland, the economic forum will be focused on \"a spirit of dialogue\" about how to better the world; however, ahead of his departure, the president touted his administration's success during his second term while critiquing the leadership of his European counterparts in a show of force likely to be displayed during his visit. \n\n\"I think more than anything else, what I'm going to be speaking about is the tremendous success that we've had in one year. I didn't think we could do it this fast ... We have the most successful country in the world. We have the hottest country anywhere in the world by far,\" Trump said. \n\n\"A lot of them could use some of the advice as to what we did,\" he said of European allies, going on to lash out about energy and immigration.\n\nMeanwhile, questions are swirling about the Board of Peace, which was originally billed as a committee that would oversee the reconstruction of Gaza from the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nCritics and government leaders are now decrying the board, saying it undermines the United Nations. \n\nA draft of the charter now says the Board of Peace would \"secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,\" not just Gaza. It also called for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body.”\n\nOn his domestic agenda, Trump has for weeks now teased unveiling \"some of the most aggressive housing reforms in American history\" in Davos, including a ban on large institutional investors from buying single-family homes and calling for the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds. \n\nTrump's speech will follow months of the White House recasting the nation's economic story as one of growth and falling prices due to Trump's economic policies as the midterm election season looms. The president has spent time traveling the country to deliver this message to Americans, but now he will do so on a global stage. \n\nDespite Trump's rosy imagery of the state of the American economy, voters are still experiencing rising costs and Republicans have been expressing concerns with messaging on the economy. Pressed about this dichotomy on Tuesday, Trump dismissed assertions that he was failing to address the needs of Americans, once again pointing blame to the Biden administration, calling the job he has done as president \"a miracle.\"\n\nABC News' Mariam Khan contributed to this report.","summary":"Trump makes first international trip of 2026 to Davos, where he's expected to deliver remarks focused on American dominance, including taking over Greenland.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-speak-world-economic-forum-amid-feud-nato/story?id=129393695","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b88d43bc-6280-427a-af59-13f711b6c78d/donald-trump-19-epa-gmh-260120_1768938161938_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:34:41","author":"Lalee Ibssa","authors":["Lalee Ibssa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.194},{"id":394688638,"title":"Trump flips position to attack U.K.’s Starmer over Chagos deal","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump criticized U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s plans to return sovereignty of Diego Garcia — an island that houses a crucial military base — to Mauritius, reversing his previous support for the proposal in a further deterioration of transatlantic relations.Trump cited the decision to justify his ambitions for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, in a post on Truth Social early Tuesday morning.'Shockingly, our ‘brilliant’ NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” Trump said.

The Americans though, have the lion's share of fixtures on their turf including the final.\nIt's also the second time in as many years that the US is hosting a high-profile tournament in football, or 'soccer', the term that Americans prefer. FIFA had hosted an expanded 32-team Club World Cup in this country last summer, with Chelsea defeating Paris Saint-Germain in the final at the Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nThe World Cup is also set to be bigger than ever this year with a total of 48 teams in action – up from 32 that had been the case from 1998 to 2022 – from 11 June to 19 July.\nBut where exactly does the tournament stand at the moment in terms of preparation as well as ticket sales? Here's what you need to know:\nTrump remains at the heart of World Cup preparations\nPresident Donald Trump can almost be considered the face of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, even if the United States isn't the sole host for the tournament. FIFA has made its biggest push into the American market yet by hosting two major events in successive years, event which just happens to occur during Trump's second term as president.\nAnd whether one supports Trump and the Grand Old Party or not, one cannot deny the fact that he is a polarising figure. And thanks to his influence, football fans are viewing the World Cup through the prism of Trump administration's policies as well.\nU.S. President Donald Trump (L) receives the FIFA Peace Prize from FIFA President Gianni Infantino (R) during the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Mandatory Credit:Reuters via Amber Searls-Imagn Images\nThe biggest talking point as far as Trump and the upcoming World Cup are concerned happens to be travel bans slapped on various nations by the US, some of which will be taking part in the upcoming tournament.\nTrump has also launched a nation-wide crackdown on illegal immigrants through the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and has spoken of relocating matches away from 'Blue Cities' – cities where voters primarily favour the Democratic Party.\nAlso Read | FIFA World Cup 2026 draw blends sport, showbiz and politics as Trump takes centre stage in Washington\nHowever, it remains to be seen if FIFA, whose president Gianni Infantino has gone out of his way to ensure good relations with Trump – going so far as to make him the inaugural recipient of the 'FIFA Peace Prize' – goes through with such a request.\nTrump's recent capture of Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro as well as his plans to annex Denmark from Greenland further created tension ahead of the tournament, with the latter straining US' ties with several European nations.\nConcerns over visas, travel\nTrump's policies, naturally, have led to concerns for the upcoming World Cup and whether fans in countries that have been slapped with travel restrictions will be able to make their way to the United States to cheer for their team or not.\nAnd let's not forget the fact that it's a two-tier issue for traveling supporters – not only will they have to worry about getting a visa, planning travel from one city to another across the three host nations as well as accommodation are some of the other things to be taken into account.\nAlso Read | FIFA World Cup matches in USA could force fans from 42 nations to share social media history\nCanada and Mexico are a lot more liberal compared to the US and it is expected to stay that way come June, when fans are expected to arrive in big numbers from all over the world. However, getting to the US from these countries will remain a challenge.\nAnd with the US hosting the all matches from the quarter-finals, fans are bound to come across such a situation if their team ends up doing the distance.\nWashington DC, however, has promised to expedite the visa process for fans with confirmed tickets for the World Cup, with wait time set at 60 days or fewer.\nDynamic ticket pricing leaves fans divided\nIt's not just travel that will be a challenge for those arriving from all over the world for the tournament. It's one thing to get a visa and enter the 'States'. It's one thing to enter the US and set up camp in one of the cities. It is an entirely different challenge for fans to buy tickets – whether one is discussing its availability or its affordability.\nFIFA, after all, have introduced a dynamic pricing model for tickets in the upcoming tournament, wherein the prices are adjusted according to demand. They have also stepped in to gain control of the resale market, charging a 15 per cent processing fee from sellers as well as buyers on its own platform.\nThe switch to dynamic pricing certainly has made tickets a lot more expensive, with a European fan group accusing the governing body of charging \"astronomical levels\" for tickets allocated to Participating Member Associations.\nAlso Read | FIFA launches $60 ticket tier amid criticism of 2026 World Cup pricing\nThat, however, has not affected demand for tickets, with FIFA claiming that more than 500 million requests had been made for the same since the draw on 5 December, according to The Guardian.\nFIFA also claims that that the additional revenue generated from the switch to dynamic pricing will ultimately boost revenue for member associations and will be used for football development around the world.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/sports/football-news/fifa-world-cup-2026-how-things-stand-usa-president-donald-trump-13970732.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/01/Donald-Trump-Metlife-Stadium-1200-2026-01-fd66442c1e7905a46544bf453f233a8c.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:30:43","author":"Fp Sports Desk","authors":["Fp Sports Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.226}]}
