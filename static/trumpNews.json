As the nation gears up for this significant moment in U.S. political history, Trump, along with his immediate family, began the journey to the U.S. capital on Saturday afternoon.\nTrump's official return to Washington began with his departure from West Palm Beach, Florida. Boarding a U.S. military aircraft provided by the Biden administration, Trump was accompanied by his wife, Melania, and their youngest son, Barron.\nPresident Trump with First Lady Melania, and Barron just landed in D.C.\nGod bless the USA!!!

For this important flight, which kicks off the weekend's inaugural events, Trump chose not to use his usual private jet, \"Trump Force One.\".\nTrump‚Äôs daughter Ivanka, along with her husband Jared Kushner, joined the president on this historic journey. While they flew together on the same flight, Trump‚Äôs middle son, Eric, and his wife Lara, chose to travel on the family‚Äôs private plane, highlighting the personal and family-oriented nature of the president-elect‚Äôs arrival.\nWeekend Of Inaugural Preparations\nBut when Trump arrived at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, his day was far from over. He had a busy weekend of ceremonies ahead of him before the big day on Monday: the swearing-in ceremony. That evening, he would hold a reception and fireworks display at his golf club in Virginia, which would attract some 500 guests.\nOn Sunday, the president-elect paid respects to the fallen at Arlington National Cemetery by laying a wreath at the site. This is an expression of his commitment to upholding American traditions and values in his presidency.\nTrump later spoke to his supporters during the \"Make America Great Again Victory Rally\" at the Capital One Arena in downtown Washington in front of thousands of enthusiastic participants. The rally was an impetus before Monday's historic inauguration as Trump continues to solidify his bond with the American public.\nTea With President Biden\nIn the evening, President-elect Trump spent the night with his family in Blair House. This is the traditional residence of incoming presidents; it is right across from the White House. This will be the first official night in Washington before he starts his presidency.\nOn Monday morning, Trump will have tea with outgoing President Joe Biden, who will be 82 years old at the time. This gesture shows the peaceful transfer of power between the two leaders. After the meeting, Trump is expected to head to the Capitol for his swearing-in ceremony.\nThe swearing-in ceremony will be held at the Capitol Rotunda, a venue that has not been used for the event in 40 years because of the cold weather conditions. Trump is expected to be sworn in at 12:00 p.m. local time, and his inaugural address is expected to outline the vision for his administration over the next four years.\nALSO READ | Migrants Torch Camp Amid Mexican Authorities‚Äô Crackdown In Northern Mexico","summary":"This weekend, a reception, rally, and a visit to Arlington National Cemetery were scheduled for this weekend, before the swearing-in ceremony on Monday at the Capitol Rotunda.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trump-and-family-touch-down-in-dc-for-historic-inauguration-watch/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trump-IN-DC.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-19 01:06:44","author":"Satyam Singh","authors":["Satyam Singh"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.117},{"id":281515974,"title":"Trump‚Äôs Tariffs: Will the New President‚Äôs Plan Prove Successful?","text":"Jan-18-2025\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has a plan.

During the plane ride, Eric Trump took to X, sharing his \"renewed hope and spirit for [the] country.\" \"The past 10 years have been a constant fight ‚Äî countless rallies, TV appearances, subpoenas, depositions, and weeks in cold courtrooms,\" Eric Trump wrote in the post. \"Through endless attacks on my family, the company I run, and the employees I care for, we faced slander, fake news, home raids, and countless games designed to break us.\" WHO IS SEAN CURRAN?

The inauguration will take place at noon Monday in the Capitol Rotunda, due to frigid temperatures in the area. Then Trump, just the second president in history to win non-consecutive terms, will give his inaugural address. Hours before the Trump family boarded the plane, thousands of protesters on Saturday descended on the streets of Washington, D.C., to protest.

Dozens held signs that read ‚ÄúLife is a right, not an option‚Äù and ‚ÄúAbortion stops a beating heart.‚Äù Some prayed and others sang during the walk that looped around the park. Adoption services, churches and anti-abortion groups also attended to promote their causes.\n\nAmong the attendees was Adelina Gonzalez of Imperial Valley. Feeling lonely and scared, she had an abortion at the age of 23 but immediately regretted it, she said to the crowd following the walk. In 2018, more than 40 years after her abortion, she said she visited Rachel‚Äôs Hope, a post-abortion retreat center in San Diego.\n\n‚ÄúThat year, my life changed forever,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI am a happy person and I have peace in my heart. ‚Ä¶ If you know someone who has had an abortion, don‚Äôt let them go through so many years before they get any help.‚Äù\n\nAnna Fredett and Cindy Graf, both 22, couldn‚Äôt help but notice the large number of youths that attended ‚Äî many more than they remembered from the 2016 Walk for Life.\n\n‚ÄúThere are so many signs that say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm the pro-life generation,‚Äô and it‚Äôs true. We‚Äôre making a difference,‚Äù said Fredett. ‚ÄúBut we need to just show up and be witnesses, and that will help many more young people realize that this is such a bigger and more important thing than it‚Äôs being presented.‚Äù\n\nThe event went on without counter-protesting.\n\nA few hundred yards to the south, Laila Latasa was hoisting a sign reading ‚ÄúSmash the Patriarchy‚Äù for the People‚Äôs March also held Saturday at Waterfront Park. The march, calling for justice and equality for all, comes days before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term.\n\nThe 19-year-old tutor from Oceanside said she was extremely concerned about preserving her legal ability to make important decisions for herself.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to stand up for women,‚Äù said Latasa. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ridiculous we still have to be here to fight for our rights ‚Äî for control over our own bodies and to love who we love.‚Äù\n\nLatasa said she was also very concerned about what the incoming president and his political appointees might do in the coming months and years. Trump‚Äôs handpicked U.S. Supreme Court justices overturned Roe v. Wade, which had legalized abortion, in June 2022. Many argue that further restrictions on abortion are coming under his second term. Abortion remains legal in California.\n\nMcElroy, who has led the Walk for Life event for the last 10 years, recently offered a public prayer for Trump, asking that the president-elect and other incoming leaders ‚Äútransform our political culture so that genuine dialogue and devotion to the sacred dignity of the human person will characterize our government at every level.‚Äù\n\nThe cardinal, who will participate in the National Walk of Life event in the nation‚Äôs capital on Friday, will take over the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Washington starting in March.\n\nStaff writer Jeff McDonald contributed to this report.","summary":"About 2,500 walked, prayed and sang at the event Saturday at Waterfront Park in San Diego","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/01/18/thousands-walk-against-abortion-in-event-led-by-catholic-cardinal-before-his-move-to-d-c/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sut-l-cardinal-mcelroy-001.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-19 00:47:16","author":"Tammy Murga","authors":["Tammy Murga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.01},{"id":281515184,"title":"The whole world will be listening to Trump‚Äôs inauguration speech ‚Äì will he be as aggressive as the first time?","text":"Presidential inaugurations are the American equivalent of the UK‚Äôs coronation and State Opening of Parliament combined. They take place regularly every four years, 10 or 11 weeks following a presidential election.\n\nThe only constitutional significance is that the newly elected president takes the oath of office solemnly swearing to ‚Äúsupport and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies‚Äù.\n\nHe (so far all 45 presidents have been men) then goes straight to the White House and starts governing.\n\nUnless a sitting president has been re-elected, inaugurations usually mark a fresh start for the United States with a new head of state. Not this time.\n\nDonald Trump is only the second president to be elected for a second time, having lost an election in between, making him both the 45th and 47th POTUS (President Of The United States).\n\nThe last two inaugurations, of Trump in January 2017 and of Joe Biden in 2021, were of more than constitutional significance. They both broke with the usual ceremonial niceties in ways which foretold and exemplified the extraordinary disruptions which have struck the US over the past decade. I reported on both of them from Washington DC for Sky News.\n\nTrump‚Äôs first inauguration is remembered for two things. The aggressive rhetoric of his speech and the refusal of the new president and his staff to accept the truth of their own eyes.\n\nIn their first address to the nation as president, the new man usually tries to be inspirational while humbly acknowledging the challenge of leading the greatest country in the world.\n\nNot Donald Trump. He had campaigned on the promise to make America great again, and he tore into the state of the nation he was taking over as ‚ÄúAmerican carnage‚Äù.\n\nHe complained: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry‚Ä¶ subsidised the armies of other countries‚Ä¶ America‚Äôs infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay‚Ä¶ millions and millions of workers left behind.‚Äù\n\nInstead, he promised ‚Äúfrom this moment on it‚Äôs going to be ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô‚Ä¶ America will start winning, winning like never before‚Äù.\n\nBush: ‚ÄòThat was some weird s***!‚Äô\n\nThe speech was a shock to the VIP guests assembled; as he left the dais outside the US Capitol, Trump‚Äôs predecessor as a Republican president, George W Bush, was heard remarking: ‚ÄúThat was some weird s***‚Äù\n\nThe day only got stranger. The District of Columbia is a strongly Democratic area which had voted for Hillary Clinton. Aerial photography, helped by white ground protection in the Mall, suggested that the turnout by the public to witness the event was less than usual.\n\nThe Washington Metro reported fewer passengers than on a normal Friday. Official estimates later confirmed that both live and TV audiences for Trump‚Äôs inauguration had been significantly smaller than they had been for Barack Obama‚Äôs and Ronald Reagan‚Äôs first inaugurations.\n\nBut that day Sean Spicer, President Trump‚Äôs first official spokesman, informed the White House press corps that there had been ‚Äúthe largest audience ever to witness an inauguration. Period.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs close aide Kellyanne Conway backed him up on network TV and provided one of the iconic quotes of the first Trump administration by explaining that Spicer had presented ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äú.\n\nThe size of the crowd was not an issue for Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration in 2021 because Washington DC was effectively in a state of lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 6 January assault on the US Congress.\n\nBarricades, barbed wire and troops guarded the grassy areas where spectators usually stand. In place of people, there was a ‚Äúfield of flags‚Äù of the 50 United States. The main swearing-in still took place outside the Capitol, albeit with health measures in force, including face masks and social distancing, and a more limited guest list than usual.\n\nTrump shuns Biden inauguration\n\nTrump had survived his second impeachment trial days earlier and continued to promote the ‚Äúbig lie‚Äù that he had won the 2020 election. He became the first living president since 1869 not to greet or attend the inauguration of his successor.\n\nHe staged his own rival, and near simultaneous, departure ceremony from the White House, and told those waving him off at Andrews Airforce Base: ‚ÄúGoodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form.‚Äù\n\nTrump‚Äôs absence from the inauguration was pointed, as is Michelle Obama‚Äôs no-show at his second inauguration on Monday. Her husband and the other living former presidents will be there.\n\nRead more:Trump‚Äôs swearing-in ceremony to be movedMelania: The first lady who makes her own rulesHow reality TV and cameos helped get Trump to the White House\n\nThe non-attendance of Sir Keir Starmer is a non-story. No British prime minister has attended an inauguration; foreign presidents and prime ministers are usually represented by their ambassadors. There is speculation that Netanyahu of Israel and Milei of Argentina might attend in person this year.\n\nCompared to Trump four years earlier, Biden‚Äôs inaugural speech was a traditional celebration of ‚Äúthe triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy‚Äù.\n\nHe looked forward to a return to normality and unity after the turmoil of the Trump years: ‚ÄúSo now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol‚Äôs very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPolitics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path,‚Äù Biden assured the American people, ‚Äúevery disagreement doesn‚Äôt have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured‚Äù.\n\nThe next four years did not turn out as he had hoped.\n\nBiden ‚Äòabuse of power‚Äô warning\n\nBiden has been a one-term president and Trump has been re-elected. This week in his final address to the nation, President Biden admitted ‚ÄúAmericans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power‚Äù.\n\nAttacking what he called ‚Äúthe tech-industrial complex‚Äù, he warned, ‚Äúan oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme, wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead‚Äù.\n\nTech billionaires are cosying up to the president-elect. The large donations to the Inauguration Committee by Meta‚Äôs Zuckerberg, Amazon‚Äôs Bezos, Palantir‚Äôs Thiel, OpenAI‚Äôs Altman, Uber and Google, however, are fairly routine behaviour by the biggest US corporations. Ford and General Motors are also contributing.\n\nUnlike Biden in 2021, this year Biden will be able to enjoy the full celebrations new presidents have come to expect: lunch at the Capitol, a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, and no less than five official inauguration balls in the evening.\n\nIn the past, Democratic presidents have often been welcomed with star-studded concerts, free to the public. This year Village People, Trump‚Äôs favourite dance band, are performing. But no major events are planned.\n\nBeyond a few country and western performers and a handful of maverick actors, most celebrities are against Trump. Spirits have also been dashed by the fires in Los Angeles, the home of US showbusiness.\n\nThere is physical carnage in California, war in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan, and bitter disunity at home in the US.\n\nThe whole world will be listening with apprehension on Monday to what Donald Trump has to say when he is inaugurated as the American president for the second time.","summary":"Presidential inaugurations are the American equivalent of the UK&#8217;s coronation and State Opening of Parliament combined.

Everyone was being quietly optimistic as she'd seemed so cheerful. \n'Then at 3.30am on Tuesday, we got the dreaded call, 'Get to the hospital asap'.'\nLinda was first diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer in 2005 before getting the all-clear in 2006 - but in 2017 she was diagnosed with a form of incurable secondary cancer in her hip, which spread to her liver in 2020.\nThree years later she shared the news that the cancer had spread to her brain, with two tumours discovered on the left side of her brain which left her struggling with her speech and balance.\nAnd she issued an update last August that the tumours - which were thought to be stable - had grown.\nThe Irish star was part of family group the Nolans, alongside her sisters Coleen, Maureen, Denise, Anne and Bernie - who died of breast cancer in 2013 aged 52.\nIt comes just days after the star shared her fears about dying of breast cancer like her sister Bernie as she battled a 'bad case of flu' in the weeks before she died at the age of 65.\nIn a newspaper column published just days ago, Linda described how a debilitating bout of sickness for 11 days over Christmas made the festive period 'a complete wipe out'.\n\nLinda was first diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer in 2005 before getting the all-clear in 2006 - but in 2017 she was diagnosed with a form of incurable secondary cancer in her hip, which spread to her liver in 2020\n\nThe Nolans are pictured here performing in November 1981 - left to right: Coleen, Maureen, Bernie and Linda - Linda said last week she feared she was nearing the end like tragic Bernie\nIn what would be her final column for the Mirror, she wrote: 'The doctors say it's been a bad case of flu. I'd walk a few steps and struggle to catch my breath.\n'My legs were even more wobbly than usual and, although I try not to, I thought of how Bernie was at the end. You think, 'Oh my God, is this it?'\n'It was only on Monday I felt well enough to venture out. It feels like a whole new world out there. There's nothing like the sensation of starting to feel better after an illness.\n'You've forgotten what it feels like to feel normal (well, I say normal?).'\nIn an especially poignant final line, she added: 'I'm no fan of resolutions but here's one: It'll take more than flu to finish me off.'\nLinda also described not being able to eat anything over Christmas, before she did finally enjoy indulging a surprise craving on New Year's Eve.\nShe told of tucking into chicken curry with pineapple after her sister Denise and Denise's husband Tom were ordering a curry, with Linda saying: 'Suddenly that's what I fancied.\n'Pineapple in a curry. That was the foil container to finally tempt me out of my fast. My very own Chinese New Year.\n\nLinda, pictured here at the Bold x Pink Ribbon Foundation Party at the Century Club in London last February, wrote last week about suffering a 'complete wipeout' over Christmas\n\n'I hadn't eaten for 11 days ‚Äì what a Christmas! A complete wipe out. Everyone's been so worried. The girls have been bringing me energy drinks and that's all I've been able to get down.'\nLinda's sisters have a history of cancer, with herself, Coleen and Anne all receiving diagnoses as well as Bernie passing away from the disease.\nLinda had admitted last November she 'never expected to make it to Christmas', meaning that the festive period meant all the more to her.\nShe said at the time: 'I can't wait. Not to be morbid, but I didn't think I'd make Christmas, so it's a real bonus.\n'We love Christmas as a family and we're all going to gather at Denise's. It will be great. We all have such a good time when we get together so I can't wait. I especially love seeing all the little ones and how excited they get.'\nAnd just before the festive season she admitted to OK! magazine she was afraid of death, saying: 'What scares me the most? Dying. I am sad that it is going to happen.\n'When people start talking about 'putting things in order' ‚Äì I don't want to talk about that. I don't want to think about my affairs. It's so final.\n\nThe Irish star pictured in a 1984 magazine feature entitled 'Linda Nolan at home' \n'Every birthday and every Christmas, I want to make it to the next one. This year, for instance, I will certainly raise a glass and say, 'Here's to 2025'.\n'I have to be like that, I can't be a grey cloud of doom.'\nLinda had appeared on ITV's GMB last August, revealing how she was being set on a new course of chemotherapy - and sharing the news that she could face losing her hair once again.\nShe also described the physical toll the ongoing treatment was taking on her smile, pointing to a gap in her teeth and exclaiming: 'Look, I've lost a tooth!'\nLinda said of cancer's prevalence in her family: 'I'm just like everybody else really, I just want it to go - or leave us alone for a little while at least.'\nGMB host Richard Madeley asked whether she got angry at how the disease had impacted her family, telling her: 'You would be entitled to feel a rage at the universe that your family has been cursed by the big C.'\nLinda replied: 'I asked Bernie one time - somebody said to her, 'Do you ever think , why me?', and she said, 'No, I think why not me'. It doesn't pick and choose.\n'You can't put your name down and say you're next in line. But we have had a rough time with it.'\n\nLinda was diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer in 2005, getting an all-clear in 2006\n\n Blackpool Tower lights up in pink to honour the late Linda Nolan \nLinda's death was announced on Wednesday 'with profound sadness' by her manager Dermot McNamara, who said she passed away 'surrounded by her devoted family'.\nHe said in a statement: 'Over the weekend, Linda was taken by ambulance to Blackpool Victoria Hospital and admitted with double pneumonia.\n'In the early hours of Tuesday morning, she went into a coma and into end-of-life care, surrounded by her devoted family.\n'At around 10.20am on Wednesday, she passed peacefully, with her loving siblings by her bedside, ensuring she was embraced with love and comfort during her final moments, aged 65.\n'Linda's legacy extends beyond her incredible achievements in music and entertainment. She was a beacon of hope and resilience, sharing her journey to raise awareness and inspire others.'\nLinda Nolan\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLinda Nolan's final hours were spent 'laughing and joking' as sister Denise reveals she was 'doing what she loved best'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nHenry Cavill and Natalie Viscuso are engaged!

He‚Äôs now a college freshman who towers over his 6-foot-plus (1.8-meter-plus) dad. Granddaughter Kai, who was 9 in 2017, is now an aspiring social media influencer and impressive golfer. Grandson Joseph, who posed in Trump‚Äôs lap with a Lego model of the White House last time, is 11 now.\n\nThe most prominent relatives in Trump‚Äôs political sphere, daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared, are in Florida this time around after working in his first administration.\n\nFamily members can provide presidents with a ready source of moral and sounding-board support, companionship and even relief from the world‚Äôs problems. Not to mention creating headaches for the president at times, too.\n\n‚ÄúFamily can do things that other people can‚Äôt, and they can be trusted in a way that other people also can‚Äôt,‚Äù said Tevi Troy, a former George W. Bush administration official and author of several books about the presidency. ‚ÄúEveryone needs someone they can talk to late at night when you let your hair down, so to speak.‚Äù\n\nThe president-elect has five children ‚Äî three of whom are married ‚Äî from his marriages to Ivana Trump, Marla Maples and current wife Melania Trump. He has 10 grandkids, with an 11th on the way.\n\nA look at Trump‚Äôs family circle, then and now:\n\nHis wife: Melania Trump\n\nTHEN: She spent the opening months of Trump‚Äôs term at the family‚Äôs Manhattan penthouse so that 11-year-old Barron wouldn‚Äôt have to switch schools in the middle of the year. After moving to the White House, she traveled around the United States and to other countries, alone and with Trump, partly to promote her ‚ÄúBe Best‚Äù children‚Äôs initiative while fiercely guarding her privacy.\n\nNOW: She avoided active campaigning during Trump‚Äôs 2024 run, limiting her public appearances to key moments, such as the campaign‚Äôs launch, the Republican National Convention and election night. She released a self-titled memoir late last year and will be the subject of a documentary distributed by Amazon Prime Video that is expected to be released later this year. While some doubt that Trump‚Äôs 54-year-old wife will spend much time at the White House, she said on Fox News' ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù that she has already packed and picked out the furniture she wants to take to the executive mansion.\n\nHis children: Donald Trump Jr.\n\nTHEN: Trump‚Äôs eldest son, now 46, campaigned for his father in 2016 and 2020.\n\nNOW: Trump Jr.‚Äôs influence has grown to the point that he lobbied his father to choose close friend JD Vance for vice president. He also pushed for former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president-elect‚Äôs picks for director of national intelligence and health and human services, respectively. Trump Jr. helps run the family real estate business and is an honorary chairman of Trump‚Äôs transition. He has a podcast and has said his role is to prevent ‚Äúbad actors‚Äù from getting into the administration. He recently flew on his father‚Äôs airplane to Greenland; the president-elect has expressed a desire to take control of the mineral-rich Danish territory.\n\nTrump Jr. has five children ‚Äî or ‚Äúsmurfs,‚Äù as he sometimes refers to them ‚Äî with his former wife, Vanessa Trump. They are Kai Madison, 17; Donald John III, 15; Tristan Milos, 13; Spencer Frederick, 12; and Chloe Sophia Trump, 10.\n\nTHEN: Ivanka, 43, campaigned for her father in 2016 and moved her family from New York City to Washington to work in his White House as a senior adviser. She was on the campaign trail in 2020, too, but she and her family moved to Florida and retreated from the spotlight after his loss.\n\nNOW: As Trump geared up for the 2024 run, Ivanka announced that she loved and supported him but was getting out of politics to focus on her husband and their three kids. She did, however, join her father and other family members on election night and when he rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in early December after Time magazine named him Person of the Year. She told ‚ÄúThe Skinny Confidential‚Äù podcast that this time around she just wanted to ‚Äúshow up for him as a daughter‚Äù and be there to watch a movie or a sports game.\n\nIvanka and her husband have three children: Arabella Rose, 13; Joseph Frederick, 11; and Theodore James Kushner, 8.\n\nTHEN: The 40-year-old helped run the family business and participated in his father‚Äôs campaigns.\n\nNOW: Eric is also an honorary chair of the transition and a close adviser to his father. But he continues to focus more on running the family business. In September, he and his brother started a crypto platform called World Liberty Financial, and their father helped launch it in an interview on the X social media platform.‚Äù\n\nEric and his wife, Lara, have two children: Eric Luke, 7, and Carolina Dorothy Trump, 5.\n\nTiffany Trump\n\nTHEN: Trump‚Äôs daughter with second wife Marla Maples was 23 and a recent University of Pennsylvania graduate who kept a low profile when Trump was first elected.\n\nNOW: She was more present in the 2024 campaign but still largely avoids the spotlight. Tiffany, 31, and her husband, Michael Boulos, are expecting their first child this year. Boulos is a businessman who traveled with Trump in the final stretch of the campaign. His father is Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman who helped Trump with the influential Arab American community in the swing state of Michigan. Trump has named Massad Boulos to be a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.\n\nBarron Trump\n\nTHEN: At the start of Trump‚Äôs first term, Barron and his mother stayed at the family‚Äôs Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan so he could finish his school year. When they got to Washington, his soccer net appeared in what‚Äôs known as the first lady‚Äôs garden.\n\nNOW: Barron, 18, is a freshman New York University business student. His parents and Trump campaign officials credit him for recommending podcasts popular with young men that the president-elect appeared on during the campaign. Barron will have a bedroom in the White House, Melania Trump said on ‚ÄúFox & Friends.‚Äù\n\nDonald Trump said Barron had helped introduce hm to people he had never heard of. before.\n\n‚ÄúHe was very good,‚Äù the president-elect told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the new wave. And he was very helpful.‚Äù\n\nHis mother had told ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù last year that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very proud of him, about his knowledge, even about politics and giving an advice to his father. He brought in so many young people. He knows his generation.‚Äù\n\nOther family members in the spotlight: Lara Trump\n\nTHEN: Trump‚Äôs daughter-in-law, 42, campaigned for him during all his runs. After Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, she considered running for a U.S. Senate seat from her home state of North Carolina but ultimately decided against it. She became a Fox News commentator.\n\nNOW: As Trump revved up his 2024 campaign, he installed his daughter-in-law as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, where she was a TV-ready advocate overseeing fundraising, voter outreach and the party‚Äôs ‚Äúelection integrity‚Äù initiative. She stepped down from the RNC after the election and removed her name from consideration as a possible successor to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Trump‚Äôs choice for secretary of state.\n\nLara Trump is passionate about fitness and has her own line of activewear. She also has explored a side venture as a singer and has released some songs. Daughter Carolina is named after her home state.\n\nJared Kushner\n\nTHEN: Kushner, 44, was also a key figure in Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign. He joined his wife in the White House as a senior adviser, a role that included working on U.S. policy toward Israel and the broader Middle East.\n\nNOW: Kushner has stepped out of the political spotlight ‚Äî but his father could soon step in. Trump announced after the election that he intends to nominate Charles Kushner, a real estate developer, to be U.S. ambassador to France. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after he pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign contributions.\n\nHis grandchildren: Kai Trump\n\nTHEN: Kai was in elementary school when her grandfather became president.\n\nNOW: Donald Trump Jr.‚Äòs 17-year-old granddaughter is an aspiring social media influencer. Her behind-the-scenes video from election night garnered 3.7 million views on YouTube. Other posts related to her grandfather have been watched millions more times on TikTok. Kai delivered her first public speech at the Republican convention and is an avid golfer who sometimes plays with her grandfather.\n\n‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm not on his team, he‚Äôll try to get inside of my head, and he‚Äôs always surprised that I don‚Äôt let him get to me,‚Äù she said at the convention. ‚ÄùBut I have to remind him, I‚Äôm a Trump, too.‚Äù\n\nArabella Kushner\n\nTHEN: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner‚Äôs daughter was 6 when her grandfather showed China‚Äôs Xi Jinping a video of her, in a traditional Chinese dress, belting out Chinese-language songs.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very good, right? She‚Äôs very smart,‚Äù Trump said. Xi responded that Arabella was her grandfather‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle angel‚Äù and a ‚Äúmessenger of China-U.S. relations.‚Äù\n\nNOW: Arabella is 13 and enjoys singing, playing the piano, horseback riding and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, according to a social media post from her mother.\n\nGomez Licon reported from West Palm Beach, Florida.","summary":"Trump's youngest son, Barron, was in fifth grade when Trump's first administration began.

You know, it‚Äôs appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. It‚Äôs a very big situation.‚Äù\n\nIf a reprieve is issued, Trump will most likely announce it on Monday, he told the outlet. \n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision Friday, TikTok said it would shut down in the US ‚Äúunless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement.‚Äù President Joe Biden has signaled he will not enforce the ban.\n\nIf he did, he would only be able to do so during his final day in office on Sunday. There is no precedent for a social media ban and it‚Äôs unclear how one could be enforced.\n\nTikTok is used by 170 million people in the US and seven million of those individuals make an income from the short-video platform. TikTok took in $10bn in revenue last year, according to The New York Times.\n\nLawmakers and Biden‚Äôs administration have raised concerns over potential risks associated with the app. Among them are beliefs that the platform might be owned or controlled by the Chinese government. The company has said it is not.\n\nStill, US officials have claimed Chinese officials could use the platform to spy on Americans or influence Americans by surreptitiously harvesting users‚Äô data, and amplifying or suppressing certain content. It‚Äôs a position the Supreme Court sided with, determining that national security threats overrode concerns about the First Amendment.\n\n‚ÄúCongress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok‚Äôs data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,‚Äù the court wrote in its ruling.\n\nIn April, Biden signed legislation requiring TikTok to be sold by its owner, Chinese company ByteDance, or face a ban. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, gave the company 270 days. The clock runs out Sunday.\n\nTikTok and its parent company sued the Biden administration in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in May over the law, claiming it violated the First Amendment. \n\nBut, that legal effort failed when the Supreme Court issued its ruling. Ultimately, enforcing such a ban will fall to the Trump administration.\n\nThe law does allow for the president to grant a one-time 90-day extension from January 19.\n\nTrump, who has 14.7 million followers on the platform, reportedly made TikTok one of his key discussion topics with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week. He‚Äôd previously asked the Supreme Court to stay a ban so he could work out a deal to sell the app to American buyers.\n\nIn comments made after the call, Trump said the two leaders had ‚Äúa great talk about TikTok.‚Äù\n\nUpon signaling his readiness to stop a ban, the company‚Äôs CEO Shou Zi Chew issued a video statement on the platform.\n\n‚ÄúOn behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the US. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,‚Äù Chew said. \n\n‚ÄúWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a President who truly understands our platform.‚Äù\n\nTrump could only grant the extension on Monday after he‚Äôs sworn in, meaning the app could still turn off Sunday. Service providers like Google and Apple could face financial and legal penalties for allowing users to continue accessing the platform.\n\nEven if the incoming president does grant the reprieve, it‚Äôs unclear if he‚Äôd have any recourse once the extension expires.\n\nAlready, TikTok users are discussing how to bypass a federal ban, including through the use of virtual private networks which are often used in China to get through the country‚Äôs Great Firewall. Experts have said the app won‚Äôt disappear from users‚Äô phones but new users won‚Äôt be able to download it and updates won‚Äôt be available for existing users.\n\nThe platform allows users to go through hundreds of short, seconds-long, videos in about half an hour and is considered highly addictive. In October, more than a dozen states and the District of Colombia sued TikTok claiming it harms the mental health of children on the platform.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference after filing the suit, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the app‚Äôs leaders have ‚Äúchosen profit over the health and safety, well-being and future of our children... And that is not something we can accept. So we‚Äôve sued.‚Äù\n\nAt the time, TikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud of and remain deeply committed to the work we‚Äôve done to protect teens and we will continue to update and improve our product.","summary":"The app‚Äôs owners had 270 days to sell it or face ban","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tiktok-ban-trump-reprieve-b2682176.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/18/18/TRUMP-TIKTOK_11845.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rcCZqoO3-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-19 00:23:07","author":"Michelle Del Rey","authors":["Michelle Del Rey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":281513438,"title":"As Trump II arrives","text":"Tomorrow at noon, the 45th President of the United States will do the improbable. He will put up his hand and be sworn in as the 47th President.\n\nFor the 20th day of January 2025, this was not his plan: continuing in office in 2021, was. But he lost the election to Joe Biden, the opponent for whom he had shown so much disdain.\n\nSo, Trump resorted to an old strategy of his: deny, deny, deny. Biden, he screamed into every microphone and in front of every camera that was switched on, had not won the 2020 election.\n\nHe screamed the same message in many a courtroom in the United States‚Äîat least 60 of them‚Äîas well. But he could provide no proof of anything that would have meaningfully changed the outcome of the election.\n\nSo, he moved to the next phase. He invited his most ardent supporters to Washington, DC. The task: to march on the Capitol and disrupt the constitutional certification of the election results.\n\nThe violence that ensued saw as much as $2.7m in destruction at the capitol. One policeman died, at least 140 were injured, and four died by suicide soon afterwards. Over time, at least 950 defendants of the rioters were arrested and charged.\n\nAnd yes, Congress did reconvene on the night to certify the election, and Biden took office two weeks later.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Trump faced a bleak legal and political future. Many top Republicans castigated him for what became known as a conspiracy and an insurrection.\n\nIt was also discovered that on his way out the door, he had illegally taken a large cache of classified documents.\n\nSoon, he faced formidable personal peril as the list of legal cases against him grew. He needed lawyers, fast. He had already become the first president to be impeached twice. If he was not to become the first former president to be put in jail, he needed a lot of lawyers.\n\nAnd yet that same man, three months ago, remarkably won the 2023 presidential election. Deploying a determined strategy of deny and denounce and delay, helped by a Department of Justice that was eager not to be seen to be unjust or unfair, and a conservative Supreme Court he had enshrined in his first term, only his cases in New York made headway: his federal cases were pinned to the ground while he pinned his opponents to the wall.\n\nThe inauguration will see frigid arctic tomorrow, the coldest in decades, with temperatures expected to be in the low- to mid-20s, and wind chill factors, at noon, between 12¬∫F and 14¬∫F.\n\nIt is safe to say that while the guests at the ceremony may require extra measures to stay warm, Trump will not.\n\nHe has beaten all the odds already, and he will now taste his gravy.\n\nBut what will that gravy be like? He made a lot of promises that appeared to resonate with an American electorate hungry for drama and tumult.\n\nNews reports say there will be plenty, beginning right after the inauguration with a slew of executive orders.\n\nOne of them concerns Trump‚Äôs deportation plan. Given that this involves his desired elements of shock and drama, it is expected to start immediately in some of America‚Äôs largest cities.\n\nTrump‚Äôs cherished tariffs are also on their way, as is a deeper list of Muslim and ‚Äúshithole‚Äù nations, among policies that are certain to inflict a deep mark on such nations as Nigeria.\n\nThe question is whether we are ready. Should hundreds of Nigerians be deported into Abuja, is the Bola Tinubu APC government‚Äîwhich appears to harbour a ravenous appetite for repeated, consumption by its top officials‚Äîready?\n\nLet us remember: the last time we had Nigerians return home in a hurry, each of the 1,100 returnees received only $100.00 from a budget of $8.5m for 5000 people. And then we forgot all about them.\n\nThere are a lot of Nigerians in the United States, but even during this problematic period, we do not have an ambassador, thanks to Tinubu‚Äôs collapse on the diplomatic front in September 2023.\n\nPrior to that, his predecessor had suffered deep, self-inflicted injuries in the US. Within weeks of his ascension to the presidency in 2015, Buhari was received in Washington, DC by the US government. Deceived by Buhari as most had been, President Barak Obama treated him like a cult hero, describing him as assuming office ‚Äúwith a reputation for integrity and a very clear agenda and that is to make sure that he is bringing safety and security and peace to his country.‚Äù\n\nHe would be proved wrong.\n\nStill, later that year at the United Nations in New York, Obama took a meeting with the Nigerian leader again. He spoke of ‚Äúa sense of urgency to make sure that we‚Äôve done everything we can to put in place the framework for cooperation and partnership for many years to come.‚Äù\n\nObama left office a few months later, with Buhari unable to summon the will to take advantage of that and other pledges of support.\n\nWorse still, in January 2017, a Nigerian Air Force fighter jet supposedly trying to fight Boko Haram in the northeast bombed a refugee camp, killing over 100 refugees and aid workers. It was another in a series of such ‚Äúmistakes,‚Äù and it led the US to reconsider plans to sell 12 Super Tucano jets to us.\n\nIn April 2018, Donald Trump (I) came face to face with Buhari during another state visit. It was one year after Buhari had appointed a fragile 83-year-old to be his ambassador in Washington, and after the US decided to sell the Super Tucano aircraft to Nigeria.\n\nAt home, it would emerge that the Buhari government had arbitrarily withdrawn $1bn from the Excess Crude Account for the transaction, unknown to the National Assembly or the National Security Adviser.\n\nThe Nigerian leader embarrassingly arrived at the White House with little more than a sense of worship, calling Trump ‚ÄúExcellency‚Äù ad nauseam. Despite the US leader affirming that he enjoyed hearing it very much, it was confirmed that he loathed Buhari‚Äôs presence, affirming that he never wanted to meet such a ‚Äúlifeless‚Äù person again.\n\nThis is the background to the re-enthronement tomorrow of Trump II. As everyone knows, he has a very specific view of China, one of the sources from which Nigeria continues to obtain dubious loans, including $254.76m last week, and the $2.25b ‚Äúclosest to a free lunch‚Äù from the World Bank six months ago.\n\nLast September, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Tinubu declared that they had elevated the relationship between their countries to a ‚Äúcomprehensive strategic partnership,‚Äù which could become important in the near future.\n\nI do not necessarily object to such a relationship, but the previous APC government, on which Tinubu‚Äôs models itself, was comprehensively weak and dishonest.\n\nBut this point in time is exactly where opportunity meets temptation. Is a nation which does not believe in history or in institutions, and where we are scrubbing out character good for its citizens, or better for Trump II?","summary":"Tomorrow at noon, the 45th President of the United States will do the improbable.¬† He will put up his hand and be sworn in as the 47th President.

Liquefied natural gas is in great demand by our allies. Why would you do that?'\n\nBiden was surprised and said he didn't, leaving Johnson stunned. \n\n'He genuinely didn‚Äôt know what he had signed and I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, ‚ÄòWe are in serious trouble - who is running the country?‚Äô Like, I don‚Äôt know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn‚Äôt know.' \n\nJohnson's comments follow a New York Times expose that cites more than two dozen Biden allies, from aides to fellow lawmakers to donors, about how they planned to 'manage his decline.'\n\nBiden aides would reschedule meetings to suit the president's mood and would delay sharing negative information with him until they could figure out how to spin it to his liking.\n\nHe would also typically be surrounded by staffers as he walked to the South Lawn to take the presidential chopper in order not to look frail on camera. \n\nPerhaps most shockingly, Biden had to use a teleprompter for small fund-raisers in private homes, while donors were forced to submit questions before he spoke.\n\nThey also made the president's stairway to get onto Air Force One shorter to avoid Biden potentially stumbling on camera. \n\nAll the while, they would publicly get angry at any member of the press who suggested Biden wasn't coherent. \n\nThose who best enabled the president were said to be First Lady Jill Biden, troubled son Hunter Biden, strategist Mike Donilon, counselor Steve Ricchetti, deputy chief of Staff Annie Tomasini and Jill Biden senior aide Anthony Bernal. \n\nThe half-dozen trusted confidants managed Biden's schedule so that no one could see too much of the president's senior moments. \n\nBiden was fully aware of the perception, refusing an orthopedic boot when he fractured his foot four years ago, leading to a permanent gait in his walking. \n\nDespite all of the evidence to the contrary, Biden has remained defiant in his final days.\n\nThe president told USA Today that he would have won reelection in a rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, 82, acknowledged his age was an issue, and even admitted he's not so sure how the four years would go after he won this hypothetical second term.\n\n'So far, so good,' he said. 'But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?'\n\nIn late July, Biden reluctantly ended his reelection bid and endorsed his No. 2 to take Democrats over the finish line in November. \n\nBut Harris, who never won a primary election, failed to garner support and lost in historic fashion to Trump ‚Äì including all seven swing states.\n\nBiden said in his exit interview about his single term as president that if he stayed in the race, he likely would have beat Trump again.\n\n'It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,' Biden claimed, citing polling he reviewed.\n\nAsked whether he had the vigor to serve another four years in office, though, he was less confident.\n\n'I don't know,' he replied. 'Who the hell knows?'\n\nDays later, he bizarrely repeated that both he and Kamala Harris could've beaten Trump.\n\n'I think I would have beaten Trump ‚Äì could have beaten Trump,' he said, days before Trump is set to return to power. 'And I think that Kamala could have beaten Trump, would have beaten Trump. It wasn't about ‚Äì I thought it was important to unify the party,' he said.\n\nHe failed to specify why, if Harris might have beaten Trump, she didn't actually come out victorious. But he did admit that he feared a divided party might lose if he stayed on.\n\nThe party fractured after his July debate disaster over whether he would be able to prevail while facing record low approval numbers.\n\n'I thought I could win again, thought it was better to unify the party, and I was the greatest honor in my life to be president United States, but I didn't want to be one who caused a party that wasn't unified to lose an election,' he said. 'That's why I stepped aside. But I was confident she could win.' \n\nAs it turned out, Trump beat Harris in all seven swing states and won the popular vote, as he reminded a New York judge Friday on a day he was sentenced of 34 felony counts in his hush money case.","summary":"Everyone from Mike Johnson to members of Joe Biden's own staff are commenting on the 82-year-old president's decline in the last days of his presidency.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14300707/Biden-staffers-cognitive-decline-unforgivable-lapse.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/19/00/94250411-0-image-a-7_1737244971202.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/10/7855871374371896891/1024x576_MP4_7855871374371896891.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-19 00:18:35","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Removing all the animosity around these drugs, the Tesla CEO has openly talked about his weight issues and the medications he has used over the years. Regardless, his transformation caught the eyes of his followers. \n\nIn a previous post shared on X, his platform, the SpaceX founder shared a picture of himself dressed up as Santa with the caption ‚ÄúOzempic Santa.‚Äù However, this is not the drug he used to put his weight issue to rest.

That‚Äôs like trusting an anorexic chef.‚Äù Another person tweeted, ‚ÄúGonna need to know that cut routine lol‚Äù Another X user said, ‚ÄúI need to try Mounjaro as Saxenda isn‚Äôt working on me‚Äù\n\nMusk further goes on to explain that at a point in time, he did try ozempic but it did not suit him. He wrote, ‚ÄúHigh doses of Ozempic made me fart & burp like Barney from the Simpson‚Äôs.

While the world was mocking him for his bent-out-of-shape physique, his father Errol Musk was concerned and he was the one who advised Musk to lean on supplements. Talking on ‚ÄòKylie and Jackie O‚Äô, Errol said, ‚ÄúElon is very strongly built, but he‚Äôs been eating badly.‚Äù Instead of turning down this criticism, Elon Musk took on the responsibility to try new ventures for his weight loss. \n\nReflecting on the remarks made about his father, Musk became honest about his workout plans on the ‚ÄòFull Send Podcast‚Äô. He explains how his worst habit was to check his phone right after waking up which would send his brain into overdrive and make him work. This is why he would never get regular with his workouts which he anyway despised. He says, ‚Äú I got to work out and be in better shape. I actually don‚Äôt really like working out, but I got to do it.‚Äù Over the years, Musk has indulged in a healthier lifestyle which includes yoga and dieting. \n\nIn a series of tweets, he explained how he followed the advice of a good friend and focused on intermittent fasting using the Zero fasting app. This, in turn, helped him lose 20 lbs and turn away from the unhealthy lifestyle that he was leading. For the unknown, Mounjaro is an injectable prescription medicine commonly used as a supplement in a weight loss journey alongside exercise and dieting. It is used to improve blood sugar (glucose). Elon Musk is now living the life and focusing on his health alongside his work. Moreover, he is also appointed to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency under the newly elected President Donald Trump.","summary":"Elon Musk is one such celebrity who has confessed to combating his weight issues with the help of drugs.

Some states will keep flags at half-staff through the full 30 days of mourning. \n\nStates are allowed to raise their flags when they choose, as Biden‚Äôs order applies only to flags on federal property, such as the White House and at national parks.\n\nHere‚Äôs a state-by-state look of who plans to raise flags to full-staff on Jan. 20 for Trump‚Äôs second presidential inauguration. \n\nGov.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders ordered flags to return to full staff in honor of Trump‚Äôs inauguration on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025.\n\n‚ÄúAmerica is the greatest country in the world and the peaceful transfer of power that will soon occur from one administration to the next is a hallmark of our democracy,‚Äù Sanders said. ‚ÄúThe inauguration is an opportunity to celebrate the new president, his administration, and the millions of Americans who united around his message and voted to elect him.‚Äù\n\nThe flags will raise at sunrise Monday and be lowered again to half-staff at sunrise Tuesday, Jan. 21. \n\nGov.

Brad Little ordered flags to be temporarily raised to full staff on Inauguration Day before returning them to half-staff in honor of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\n‚ÄúIdaho will recognize the swearing in of our 47th president, Donald Trump, by raising our flags on this momentous day,‚Äù Little said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis is a historic transition in our nation‚Äôs leadership, and we will celebrate it.‚Äù\n\nAccording to the governor‚Äôs office, U.S. and Idaho state flags will fly at full staff from sunrise to sunset on Monday, January 20, to mark the presidential inauguration. The flags will then be lowered again until January 28.\n\nGov.

Curran was among the agents who protected Trump when a gunman attempted to assassinate him during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump has faced several assassination attempts during his 2024 reelection campaign. The USSS leadership has come under scrutiny and criticism over security lapses following the attempt on Trump‚Äôs life in Butler, which culminated in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle.\n\n‚ÄúPresident Trump will be naming Sean Curran, who heads his personal detail, to be Secret Service Director,‚Äù Donald Trump Jr. said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday. ‚ÄúSean is a great patriot and will stop all the insanity once and for all. There‚Äôs not a better person for this position!‚Äù he added.\n\nIn July of last year, in Butler, the gunman managed to get within 150 meters and fired several shots before being killed, grazing Trump‚Äôs ear, killing a member of the audience, and wounding two others. Another gunman was arrested in September after he set up an ambush at a golf course owned by Trump in Florida.\n\nOne of the main criticisms directed at the USSS, local police, and federal law enforcement agencies following the first assassination attempt was their ineffective communication, which allowed the gunman to breach security and get within 150 meters of Trump with a rifle. A USSS counter-sniper killed the would-be assassin, identified as Thomas Crooks, after he had already fired several shots.\n\n‚ÄúTrump wanted someone he could trust, and they clearly have developed a bond after Pennsylvania,‚Äù Bill Gage, a former USSS agent under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told Fox News in an article published Saturday.\n\nDespite mistakes made by the advance team, Gage noted that the agents assigned to Trump, including Curran, performed exactly as trained.\n\nMeanwhile, CNN criticized Trump‚Äôs pick, citing anonymous sources who claimed that Curran lacks the managerial experience required to run a large and complex agency. Although he supervises around 85 people on Trump‚Äôs security detail, Curran has never managed a budget or operations on the scale of the thousands-strong US Secret Service, they said.\n\nCurran would replace Ron Rowe, who took over after Cheatle‚Äôs resignation in July due to intense scrutiny of the agency's lapses in the aftermath of the first assassination attempt on Trump.","summary":"Donald Trump will be naming Sean Curran, head of his Secret Service security detail, as the agency‚Äôs next director \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/611153-trump-bodyguard-head-usss/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/678c3ef520302728636d3ea5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-19 00:08:25","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":281510328,"title":"Report: Chicago may face mass deportation raids starting Tuesday","text":"CHICAGO ‚Äì Mass deportation raids threatened in Chicago could start as soon as Tuesday, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe soon-to-be President, Donald Trump, along with his appointed border czar, Tom Homan, have issued a warning about commencing raids in Chicago as the new administration takes office.\n\nReports from the Wall Street Journal reveal that sources familiar with the strategy have disclosed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to deploy ‚Äú100 to 200 officers‚Äù for the initiative on the day after Trump‚Äôs inauguration.\n\nIllinois Gov.

In his place, Vice President Han Zheng will attend. The foreign ministry says China is ‚Äúready to work with the new U.S. government.‚Äù\n\nWhile foreign diplomats such as ambassadors have traditionally attended U.S. presidential inaugurations, no foreign head of state has ever done so in an official capacity, according to the Associated Press. However, true to his style, Trump appears eager to break with precedent‚Äîalthough this time, his approach is particularly selective.\n\nXi‚Äôs refusal to attend in person seems to have ignited interest from other foreign leaders‚Äîsome from Africa‚Äîeager to secure a seat at the U.S. 60th swearing-in ceremony, which happens to be Trump‚Äôs. This is despite reports indicating that Trump‚Äôs invitation list heavily focuses on leaders who share his ideology or policy goals.\n\nAmong those invited are right-wing populists from Europe and Latin America, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Argentine President Javier Milei, and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, India‚Äôs External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and Japan‚Äôs Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya have also received invitations from Washington.\n\nAccording to a Hindustan Times report, Nigeria is among several countries whose leaders have expressed interest in attending Trump‚Äôs swearing-in on January 20. However, there is little evidence to suggest that African leaders, such as President Bola Tinubu, have actually been invited.\n\nSources in Washington D.C. say that several foreign leaders‚Äîparticularly those from Mozambique, Peru, Chile, and Nigeria‚Äîare reportedly ‚Äúburning up the phone lines‚Äù to secure a spot at the inauguration.\n\nOne registered foreign agent told The New York Post, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre Costa Rica, there is just no way you get invited to this inauguration. What is the value add?‚Äù By that logic, unless a leader offers notable trade or diplomatic advantages, they may be overlooked.\n\nSo, where does that leave Nigeria or South Africa? The South African presidency states that none of its previous leaders has attended or received an invitation to a U.S. presidential inauguration‚Äînot even Nelson Mandela at Bill Clinton‚Äôs second inauguration on January 20, 1997. Therefore, Tinubu‚Äôs apparent exclusion is not unique. South Africa, for instance, opted to send its ambassador to the U.S., Ebrahim Rasool. This may have been a preemptive move, given how rarely African leaders appear at inaugurations in Washington. \n\nStill, at least South Africa has a sitting ambassador in the U.S. Nigeria, however, has been without one since Tinubu recalled the last envoy 16 months ago and has yet to appoint a replacement.\n\nDiplomatic insiders say the absence of a U.S. ambassador complicates any efforts to arrange participation in such significant events. Even if President Tinubu wanted to attend, he would lack the direct diplomatic channel that usually coordinates such high-level visits. To complicate matters further, Trump‚Äôs foreign policy approach during his previous term (2017‚Äì2021) left many African nations feeling sidelined or even dismissed.\n\nFor Tinubu, not attending Trump‚Äôs inauguration is hardly a diplomatic crisis. After all, no Nigerian president has publicly attended a U.S. swearing-in. Yet, appearing at the Capitol Rotunda on Monday would have made Tinubu the first, placing him at the forefront of African leaders fostering stronger ties with the new White House‚Äîespecially given his drive to strengthen Nigeria‚Äôs influence on the global stage.\n\nHowever, with his recent visits to Ghana and the United Arab Emirates this January, most Nigerians would prefer that he remain home to focus on pressing domestic issues before embarking on further travels. Additionally, given Trump‚Äôs controversial record‚Äîparticularly his remarks about Africa and the looming threat of massive deportations‚Äîmany Nigerians view his inauguration with skepticism. In the end, there are more ways to gauge an alliance than through invitations to inaugurations.\n\nThe paint job\n\nAfter enjoying seven-star hospitality in Abu Dhabi over the past week, President Tinubu returned to a Villa undergoing extensive maintenance.\n\nAround 20 months ago, the State House management began renovating parts of the Presidential Villa. These improvements ranged from basic paint jobs to the renovation of the concrete perimeter fence that encloses the President‚Äôs office, residence, Council Chamber, press gallery, and other administrative offices. There were also routine upgrades to card readers. Since then, surface maintenance has continued, extending to the security lobby stations outside.\n\nThis time, the changes have taken on a digital dimension. Anyone familiar with the Villa would know the Aso Wall of Fame‚Äînotice boards displaying pictures of the president‚Äôs most recent activities. Those boards have now been replaced with modular LED displays showcasing a slideshow of Tinubu‚Äôs engagements.\n\nSources suggest that the State House may eventually phase out paper documents in favour of an all-electronic system. While this may seem a challenging shift in a paper-reliant system like ours, only time will tell. Meanwhile, with vandals causing blackouts in the Villa, the State House administration may need to accelerate its planned switch to solar power, as was revealed last November.","summary":"As the world watches preparations for Donald Trump‚Äôs second inauguration tomorrow, the big question is who will‚Äîand will not‚Äîattend.

The three of them turned around at the top of the stairs, and Trump waved before heading inside the plane. The ritualistic changing of power will get underway as Washington's solemn pomp is paired with Trump's brand of party: a fireworks showcase at one of his luxury golf properties, guests including tech industry titans, friends from the business world and conservative media stars, and thousands of his supporters streaming in from around the country.With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation's capital facing frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day organizers were also scrambling to move inside most of Monday's outdoor events, including the swearing-in ceremony.\"There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way...Therefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda, as was used by Ronald Reagan in 1985, also because of very cold weather.\"Country music stars Carrie Underwood, Billy Ray Cyrus and Jason Aldean, disco band the Village People, rapper Nelly and musician Kid Rock are all scheduled to perform at inauguration-related ceremonies and events. Actor Jon Voight and wrestler Hulk Hogan are also expected to make appearances, as are a crew of Trump-embracing business executives: Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.The only public event on Trump's schedule is an evening reception and fireworks show at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, outside the city.While Trump holds court at his club, Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington.On Sunday, the eve of his inauguration, Trump is scheduled to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally will be followed by a private dinner.On Inauguration Day, Trump will start with the traditional prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady.Trump then heads to the Capitol, where his ceremony has been moved indoors as temperatures are set to plummet and make it the coldest Inauguration Day in 40 years. It's not quite clear how the ceremony will be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, which holds only 600 people. More than 250,000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around the Capitol grounds.The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, which is responsible for planning the event, said in a statement that \"the vast majority of ticketed guests will not be able to attend the ceremonies in person.\"Eight years ago, Trump's critics were wrestling with whether to attend his inauguration, contemplating whether to buck long-standing practice and send a signal to the divisive new president. This year, much outspoken resistance to Trump has faded away, though there will be two notable absences: former first lady Michelle Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Neither gave an explanation as to why she was skipping the ceremony.After Trump takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural address, there will be a ceremonial farewell to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As the new Republican government takes power, Trump will head to a signing ceremony at the Capitol to approve some of his first official acts, followed by a congressional luncheon and review of U.S. troops.The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed into an indoor event because of the cold, with Trump again planning to speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will follow in the evening, punctuated by musical performances.Trump's arrival in Washington will once again be accompanied by protests and vigils on issues such as abortion, immigration rights and, this time, the Israel-Hamas war, but the feel and the force of those demonstrations were different from the outset of his first term.The Women's March, spurred by women outraged over Trump's win in 2017, drew more than 500,000 people to Washington and millions more in cities around the country, marking one of the largest single-day demonstrations in U.S. history.The march returned Saturday, rebranded as the People's March, with organizers saying their focus will be less on Trump and more on broader goals around women's and reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, immigration, climate and democracy. It drew far fewer than eight years ago.","summary":"Trump boarded his plane from Palm Beach, Florida to head to the nation's capital.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-washington-d-c-inaugural-celebrations-begin/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/18/b90e815a-d712-4c23-972d-44bbe312aab0/thumbnail/1200x630/998567dc0c50d1643dd9efae32f256eb/gettyimages-2194252611.jpg?v=b37f0cace52a6645c18f53563f47da2c","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3475742_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-01-19 00:03:00","author":"Kathryn Watson","authors":["Kathryn Watson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.084},{"id":281513532,"title":"Donald Trump says he will ‚Äòmost likely‚Äô grant TikTok 90-day extension to avoid US ban","text":"Washington, Jan 19 (IANS) President-elect Donald Trump has said that he ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù would give TikTok 90 more days to work out a deal that would allow the popular video-sharing platform to avoid a US ban.\n\nIn an NBC News interview, Trump said on Saturday that he hadn‚Äôt made a decision yet but was considering giving TikTok a reprieve after his inauguration on Monday.\n\nA law banning mobile app stores and internet hosting services from offering TikTok to US users will come into effect on Sunday.\n\nThe law, passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year, gave TikTok‚Äôs China-based parent company nine months to sell its US operations to an approved buyer.

They take place regularly every four years, 10 or 11 weeks following a presidential election. The only constitutional significance is that the newly elected president takes the oath of office solemnly swearing to \"support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies\". He (so far all 45 presidents have been men) then goes straight to the White House and starts governing. Unless a sitting president has been re-elected, inaugurations usually mark a fresh start for the United States with a new head of state. Not this time. Donald Trump is only the second president to be elected for a second time, having lost an election in between, making him both the 45th and 47th POTUS (President Of The United States). The last two inaugurations, of Trump in January 2017 and of Joe Biden in 2021, were of more than constitutional significance. They both broke with the usual ceremonial niceties in ways which foretold and exemplified the extraordinary disruptions which have struck the US over the past decade. I reported on both of them from Washington DC for Sky News. Trump's first inauguration is remembered for two things. The aggressive rhetoric of his speech and the refusal of the new president and his staff to accept the truth of their own eyes. In their first address to the nation as president, the new man usually tries to be inspirational while humbly acknowledging the challenge of leading the greatest country in the world. Not Donald Trump. He had campaigned on the promise to make America great again, and he tore into the state of the nation he was taking over as \"American carnage\". He complained: \"We've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry... subsidised the armies of other countries... America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay... millions and millions of workers left behind.\" Instead, he promised \"from this moment on it's going to be 'America First'‚Ä¶ America will start winning, winning like never before\". Bush: 'That was some weird s***!' The speech was a shock to the VIP guests assembled; as he left the dais outside the US Capitol, Trump's predecessor as a Republican president, George W Bush, was heard remarking: \"That was some weird s***\" The day only got stranger. The District of Columbia is a strongly Democratic area which had voted for Hillary Clinton. Aerial photography, helped by white ground protection in the Mall, suggested that the turnout by the public to witness the event was less than usual. The Washington Metro reported fewer passengers than on a normal Friday. Official estimates later confirmed that both live and TV audiences for Trump's inauguration had been significantly smaller than they had been for Barack Obama's and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations. But that day Sean Spicer, President Trump's first official spokesman, informed the White House press corps that there had been \"the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration. Period.\" Trump's close aide Kellyanne Conway backed him up on network TV and provided one of the iconic quotes of the first Trump administration by explaining that Spicer had presented \"alternative facts\". The size of the crowd was not an issue for Joe Biden's inauguration in 2021 because Washington DC was effectively in a state of lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 6 January assault on the US Congress. Barricades, barbed wire and troops guarded the grassy areas where spectators usually stand. In place of people, there was a \"field of flags\" of the 50 United States. The main swearing-in still took place outside the Capitol, albeit with health measures in force, including face masks and social distancing, and a more limited guest list than usual. Trump shuns Biden inauguration Trump had survived his second impeachment trial days earlier and continued to promote the \"big lie\" that he had won the 2020 election. He became the first living president since 1869 not to greet or attend the inauguration of his successor. He staged his own rival, and near simultaneous, departure ceremony from the White House, and told those waving him off at Andrews Airforce Base: \"Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form.\" Trump's absence from the inauguration was pointed, as is Michelle Obama's no-show at his second inauguration on Monday. Her husband and the other living former presidents will be there.

No British prime minister has attended an inauguration; foreign presidents and prime ministers are usually represented by their ambassadors. There is speculation that Netanyahu of Israel and Milei of Argentina might attend in person this year. Compared to Trump four years earlier, Biden's inaugural speech was a traditional celebration of \"the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy\". He looked forward to a return to normality and unity after the turmoil of the Trump years: \"So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.\" \"Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path,\" Biden assured the American people, \"every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured\". The next four years did not turn out as he had hoped. Biden 'abuse of power' warning Biden has been a one-term president and Trump has been re-elected. This week in his final address to the nation, President Biden admitted \"Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power\". Attacking what he called \"the tech-industrial complex\", he warned, \"an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme, wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead\". Tech billionaires are cosying up to the president-elect. The large donations to the Inauguration Committee by Meta's Zuckerberg, Amazon's Bezos, Palantir's Thiel, OpenAI's Altman, Uber and Google, however, are fairly routine behaviour by the biggest US corporations. Ford and General Motors are also contributing. Unlike Biden in 2021, this year Biden will be able to enjoy the full celebrations new presidents have come to expect: lunch at the Capitol, a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, and no less than five official inauguration balls in the evening. üëâ Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app üëà In the past, Democratic presidents have often been welcomed with star-studded concerts, free to the public. This year Village People, Trump's favourite dance band, are performing. But no major events are planned. Beyond a few country and western performers and a handful of maverick actors, most celebrities are against Trump. Spirits have also been dashed by the fires in Los Angeles, the home of US showbusiness. There is physical carnage in California, war in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan, and bitter disunity at home in the US. The whole world will be listening with apprehension on Monday to what Donald Trump has to say when he is inaugurated as the American president for the second time.","summary":"Presidential inaugurations are the American equivalent of the UK's coronation and State Opening of Parliament combined.

His threats of massive tariffs on the Brics bloc, to which both belong, raise questions about whether these two Asian giants can set aside their differences to confront a common economic challenge.\nLast month, the incoming US president said that he would impose 100 per cent tariffs on Brics members if they went ahead with a long-standing plan to create a rival currency to the US dollar. He has also threatened lower tariffs of 10 to 20 per cent on all imports to the United States, and 60 per cent on goods from China.\n‚ÄúThis time Trump‚Äôs rhetoric has been really shrill,‚Äù said economist Biswajit Dhar of the Council for Social Development in New Delhi. ‚ÄúThat could potentially bring India and China closer together if he goes after both the countries. All this could come around in the Brics framework and prompt them to take a common position.‚Äù\n\nBrics ‚Äì a loose alliance of nations that most recently added Indonesia as a full member ‚Äì has long been billed as a potential counterweight to Western economic dominance. Internal divisions have hampered its cohesion, however.\nIncluding China‚Äôs ally Pakistan in the bloc, for example, is likely to face stiff resistance from India, which accuses Islamabad of supporting cross-border militancy in the disputed Kashmir region. Analysts warn that such disputes could undermine Brics‚Äô ability to present a united front, especially as Trump‚Äôs trade policies threaten to disrupt global markets.\n‚ÄúThese kinds of irritants [such as the dam and admission of Pakistan to Brics] will remain and have always been there. The border problem never disappeared even prior to Doklam and Galwan,‚Äù Dhar said, referring to a 2020 border clash and earlier troop stand-off that deeply scarred relations between Delhi and Beijing.\n‚ÄúAll these issues were not highlighted by either government because at the political level there is an understanding that we have to move on and put the past behind us.‚Äù\nBoth nations appear to recognise that they have more to gain through cooperation than confrontation ‚Äì at least for now. With the global economy in flux and the US taking an increasingly protectionist stance, India and China might have little choice but to find common ground on issues such as trade and climate change.\n‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be surprised if Brics starts talking in one voice on issues like climate change or global trade and they try to rally developing countries around a common position and say ‚Äòlet America go to hell‚Äô,‚Äù Dhar said bluntly.\n\n‚ÄòRivals and competitors‚Äô\nStill, potential areas of conflict remain. Beijing‚Äôs ambitions to internationalise the yuan and Delhi‚Äôs desire to promote the rupee had so far stymied efforts to create a common Brics currency, Dhar said ‚Äì though Trump‚Äôs return to the world stage could galvanise the bloc should he decide to weaponise the US dollar.\nAnd while Brics has made incremental progress towards economic synergy ‚Äì such as with the creation of the New Development Bank in 2014 to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations ‚Äì analysts say frosty India-China ties have hampered its effectiveness.\nBoth countries have been vying for leadership of the Global South and may now coalesce around a shared threat amid Trump‚Äôs focus on prioritising US interests over those of other nations.\nDhar said that the incoming president‚Äôs tariff threats, especially against Brics, appeared to be a pre-emptive strategy aimed at curbing any emerging rivals to US power, reflecting his campaign slogan: ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù.\n\nWhile China is likely the primary target, punishing tariffs could also prompt Beijing to strengthen its trade relations with larger countries such as India to soften the economic blow.\nIndia, meanwhile, seems more interested in promoting economic cooperation with its neighbours and other developing countries than leveraging Brics to counter the West, according to geopolitical analyst and author Priyajit Debsarkar.\n‚ÄúThere is no reason or interest for any of the parties to escalate,‚Äù agreed Cedomir Nestorovic, a geopolitics professor at the ESSEC Business School Asia-Pacific in Singapore. ‚ÄúThey have much more to gain through the process of peace.‚Äù\nOther Brics members, such as Indonesia, are expected to continue balancing their ties with both China and the US ‚Äì wary of Beijing‚Äôs territorial ambitions and the potential fallout from angering a major trading partner, according to Nestorovic.\nBrics‚Äô future is in Trump‚Äôs hands\nChris Blackburn, political analyst\nHowever, if the Trump administration adopted an increasingly aggressive trade stance, it could prompt Brics members to cooperate more closely, as they might lack ‚Äúany other solution or alternative‚Äù to secure their economic interests, he said.\nThe de-escalation and troop disengagement at the China-India border last year could pave the way for more unified leadership within Brics, ‚Äúbut there has to be a real leadership push at senior levels‚Äù, said UK-based political analyst Chris Blackburn, who specialises in international relations and security.\n‚ÄúChina and India are rivals and competitors. They aren‚Äôt partners,‚Äù he told This Week in Asia, stressing that the true nature of Trump‚Äôs foreign-policy strategy remained to be seen.\n‚ÄúHe had a hard stance against China in his last term. He hasn‚Äôt been as forthcoming with his China strategy. India and the rest of the world are waiting,‚Äù Blackburn said. ‚ÄúBrics‚Äô future is in Trump‚Äôs hands.‚Äù","summary":"A shared economic adversary could drive the two Asian giants to strengthen their Brics ties, but the way forward is far from clear.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3295260/closer-india-china-ties-unintended-consequence-trumps-tariffs-threats","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/17/c8b813c6-12ff-4408-8d30-fb715103c2cf_aaa39be5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-19 00:00:08","author":"Biman Mukherji","authors":["Biman Mukherji"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":281511884,"title":"'Now is not the time to be tired.' Demonstrators gather in a show of unity against President-elect Donald Trump in downtown Pittsfield ahead of inauguration","text":"PITTSFIELD ‚Äî Eight years ago, Dianne Heckman was one of the hundreds of thousands who flooded the streets of Washington D.C. for the 2017 Women's March.\n\nThe energy was palpable as protesters gathered in a show of unity against Donald Trump's policies and platform ahead of his first term in office.\n\nOn Saturday, Heckman joined another march ‚Äî this time, in downtown Pittsfield, where one of a series of local demonstrations under the banner of the People's March unfolded late in the morning, two days before Trump's second inauguration.\n\nAs a throng of sign-wielding protesters marched up North Street, Heckman said she knows some people have been tuning out politics. \n\nShe cautioned against that. \n\n\"Now is not the time to be tired,\" she said. \"We've got to keep it going.\" \n\nThe People's March is a reprisal of the Women's March, but under a more inclusive banner, local march organizer Meg Arvin with Western MA 4 The Future said. Arvin and others expressed a range of concerns, including their fear that the Trump administration will prioritize the needs of the powerful over everyday Americans, hoarding political might and capital in the process. \n\n\"The incoming administration is focused on more of an oligarchy than actually protecting the humans that they represent,\" Arvin said. \"And I think it's important that we show that we're not going to let them take over.\" \n\nLast November, Trump picked up votes in Berkshire County, following a national rightward shift. Arvin said she believed concerns about high costs of living and immigration contributed it, and a misconception among voters that a limited pool of resources will run out before it gets to them. \n\n\"I think people get so scared about what's being taken from them that they don't really understand that it can be given to all,\" Arvin said. \n\nAround her, attendees held signs that said things like \"protect abortion rights,\" \"stop Project 2025,\" and \"save Social Security.\" Kassandra Cardot, 18, held a sign that asked, \"take America back from whom?\" a reference to Trump's campaign slogan. \n\nCardot, who is queer and has a disability, described the incoming administration's political rhetoric as threatening, and stressed the importance of organizing youth at the local level. They said the country \"doesn't belong to anybody; it belongs to everybody.\" And part of the work is showing up at the local level. \n\n\"We're just Pittsfield, we're a random place in Massachusetts,\" Cardot said. \"But the more that things are happening like this, the more things will actually change.\" \n\nA contingent of about two-dozen Berkshire County residents made the trip to Washington, D.C. for the national People's March, said state Rep.

Companies most often said they were using the tools to boost revenue by increasing sales volumes, and they are used both online and in-store, the FTC said.\n\nThe FTC released initial findings of the study on Friday, the final working day of the Biden administration.

[+] during the first half of an NBA basketball game Thursday, Jan. 16, 2025, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Duane Burleson)\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\nDETROIT ‚Äî Entering Thursday, 76 days had passed since Aaron Nesmith last played for the Indiana Pacers. On November 1 of last year, the fifth-year forward rolled his ankle on the foot of New Orleans Pelicans head coach Willie Green, and he suffered a unique ankle injury that kept him out for 35 games. The Pacers were missing a starter from last year‚Äôs group that reached the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe team found a way to get by ‚Äî Bennedict Mathurin has filled in well as Indiana‚Äôs fifth starter, and that opening five has been pummeling opponents. But as Nesmith returned to the hardwood on Thursday night in Detroit, the Pacers were reminded what they were missing without the 25-year old.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a strong, athletic wing that shoots the ball and moves and runs and can defend. He rebounds pretty well at his position. It‚Äôll be great to have him back out there. I know he‚Äôs excited,‚Äù Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said of Nesmith‚Äôs return before the game. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs worked extremely hard. His build up to this moment, behind the scenes, has been very gradual, very arduous. It had to be taken in very small steps. So it‚Äôs great news that he‚Äôs out there tonight and I know he‚Äôs looking forward to it.‚Äù\n\nNesmith couldn‚Äôt wait to play. He never anticipated he‚Äôd be out for this long with his injury but had to trust the Pacers medical staff. It was the longest time he‚Äôd missed in the NBA due to injury, which made Nesmith appreciate playing even more.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a journey. Longer than I think anybody would have wanted,‚Äù Nesmith said of the rehab process. He made sure to listen to Indiana‚Äôs training staff every step of the way. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time. I‚Äôm excited to finally play in an NBA game again.‚Äù\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nTikTok Ban: Trump Suggests He‚Äôll Delay Ban‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Everything We Know\n\nWhat Time Will The TikTok Ban Start In The U.S.? Here‚Äôs What Could Happen\n\nDonald Trump Launches $TRUMP Meme Coin‚ÄîToken Nears $6 Billion Market Cap\n\nSuch a lengthy absence meant that Nesmith was going to be limited in terms of the number of minutes he could play against the Pistons. With Mathurin out due to a suspension, though, the Pacers opted to start the Vanderbilt product. Their opening five from much of last season was reunited, but what exactly Nesmith was going to provide after missing nearly half of a season was unclear.\n\nWhat did Aaron Nesmith‚Äôs return for the Pacers look like?\n\nHe was the last starter announced for the blue and gold in Little Caesars Arena. Indiana needed the former lottery pick to be impactful ‚Äî their game against the Pistons was important. The two teams are close in the standings and are still working to determine their head-to-head tiebreaker for the season.\n\nPlus, going against a team that starts games with Ausar Thompson, Cade Cunningham, and Tobias Harris on the court meant Nesmith was going to be covering a top-three option on Detroit‚Äôs roster. There was no time for the three-and-D wing to ease into things.\n\nFortunately for the Pacers, he didn‚Äôt. Nemsith grabbed a rebound 54 seconds into the game, then took his first shot about two minutes into the action. He was starting plays in the corner but found ways to get involved. That‚Äôs what Nesmith has always done in a potent Pacers offense.\n\nWith 8:15 on the clock in the first quarter, Nesmith took his second shot attempt ‚Äî a 27-foot three-point jumper. He drilled it, his first points this season since the second quarter of that fateful game in New Orleans. 1:08 later, the wing drove around a screen from Pascal Siakam and hit a tough layup. Nesmith was back and doing his job.\n\n‚ÄúIt was good to get a couple shots to fall in early and get my rhythm back quickly,‚Äù Nesmith said after the game.\n\nHis first stint lasted for about six minutes and ended with the Pacers up by one. It was a dreamy start for the ascending wing, who already had five points and had held his matchup, Tobias Harris, scoreless.\n\nNesmith re-entered early in the second quarter, this time with a bench-filled lineup. His only box score contribution during this stint was a free throw generated by a technical foul, but the Pacers lead was six when Nesmith left the floor. One again, he made the blue and gold better.\n\nDetroit Pistons forward Simone Fontecchio, center, tries to drive the lane against Indiana Pacers ... [+] guard T.J.

All rights reserved.\n\nThat was it for Nesmith. He played 9:18 in total, and the Pacers won those minutes by four points. From the start of the second quarter onward, Indiana never trailed as they rolled to an 11-point win.\n\nNesmith‚Äôs final stat line showed nine points and one rebound. The Pacers won his minutes by four, and the NBA‚Äôs matchup data says that Pistons players being defended by Nesmith shot 2/5 from the field. The South Carolina native did everything that he‚Äôs shown for the Pacers the last few years without missing a beat.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Aaron Nesmith. He‚Äôs going to defend at a high level, make open shots, play the right way,‚Äù Pacers star guard Tyrese Haliburton said postgame. ‚ÄúJust glad to get him back... he can fit anywhere.‚Äù\n\nIndiana knows Nesmith can defend and hit outside shots. He‚Äôs done that ever since the team acquired him via trade in 2022. He played well enough for the blue and gold to receive a contract extension last summer, and he has since become a reliable starter ‚Äî and a reliable three-and-D wing in the Circle City.\n\nThursday served as a reminder of those facts. A 35-game absence forced the Pacers to change their play style slightly, both because they didn‚Äôt have Nesmith‚Äôs abilities and because his replacement in the starting five, Mathurin, has different skills. Determining which of those two players should start going forward will be a major question for the Pacers, but with Nesmith back and available, the Pacers will be more malleable. There‚Äôs more lineups Carlisle can put on the floor that will make sense.\n\nThat was already clear in Detroit. Nesmith was a part of three different five-man combinations, and all three outscored the Pistons. His skills fit with anyone and make units complete.\n\n‚ÄúI felt good out there,‚Äù Nesmith said. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was a step behind, I felt like I was able to find my rhythm pretty easily.‚Äù\n\nThe Pacers will have some lineup questions to figure out in the immediate future. Finding answers to those questions will be easier with Nesmith back in the fold, and the young wing reminded everyone of that on Thursday night.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

All 170 million U.S. users will be questioning what happens next, and what they can expect when they wake up Sunday morning.\n\nWhile we originally expected the app to continue working for existing users post a ban coming into effect, that now seems not to be the case.

Although for all 100-million-plus users to do that all at once might stretch the ecosystem, so be ready for some chaos and delays. There‚Äôs no confirmation on timing. It could be midnight or some time shortly afterwards. There‚Äôs still a chance a last minute deal will let it run until the change of administration next week.\n\nMany users have asked whether a VPN will resolve the issue ‚Äî as has been the case with state-wide porn shut-outs across the U.S., where users turn to VPNs to pretend they‚Äôre somewhere else.

That could still mean 24-72 hours of darkness though, so just make sure you‚Äôre prepared. With unfortunate timing, TikTok is now under fire in Europe, with a new privacy lawsuit claiming it unlawfully sends data to China. TikTok tells me it strongly denies the claim and I don‚Äôt expect it to make any difference in the U.S.\n\nYour app won‚Äôt disappear from your phone tomorrow and you don‚Äôt need to delete it. But it won‚Äôt work if the platform goes dark until it is restored and it won‚Äôt be available in any of the app stores. The risk of an app with no access to security updates running on 170 million phones does seem to have passed with the latest turn of events, which is good, but for millions of users this new ‚Äúdark‚Äù reality could be worse.\n\nAbove all, don‚Äôt do anything rash.

Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs of up to 60 percent against Beijing, which economists predict will hurt both countries‚Äô economies and, consequently, the wider world economy.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, ABC News senior political correspondent Rachel Scott tweeted: ‚ÄúPresident-elect Donald Trump me tells me the three themes of his inauguration speech will be ‚Äúunity, strength and fairness.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe revealed the focus of his executive actions on Day One‚Äî telling me to expect a large focus on immigration and a rollback of Biden‚Äôs electric mandates.‚Äù\n\nShe added: ‚ÄúTrump confirms he will ‚Äòlikely‚Äô do a 90-day extension for TikTok and he plans to travel to California on Friday or sometime early next week.‚Äù\n\nThe reported themes of his speech would provide a stark contrast with his inaugural address on January 20, 2017, when he was sworn in for his first term.\n\nThat speech, which came to be known as ‚ÄúAmerican Carnage,‚Äù painted a dystopian vision of the US as a land of economic decline, rampant crime and political corruption.\n\nIn it, Trump said: ‚ÄúPoliticians prospered ‚Äî but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation‚Äôs capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. ... The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.‚Äù\n\nElsewhere in the speech he said: ‚ÄúMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.‚Äù\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Trump has told advisers he wants to make a trip to China, possibly during his first 100 days in office. It would be his second trip there following his first in 2017.\n\nTrump‚Äôs relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping have been mixed, going from an apparently burgeoning friendship in the first years of his first term, to attacking him over Beijing‚Äôs handling of the Covid pandemic, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan and which Trump repeatedly referred to as the ‚ÄúChina virus‚Äù or ‚ÄúKung Flu.‚Äù\n\nThe two leaders spoke by telephone on Friday. Xi had previously been invited to Monday‚Äôs inauguration but is sending his vice-president instead.","summary":"President-elect will reportedly focus on ‚Äòunity, strength and fairness,‚Äô a contrast from his ‚ÄòAmerican carnage‚Äô message to the nation in 2017","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-speech-themes-inauguration-china-california-b2682203.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/18/22/SEI236468580.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/13QrLaaI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-18 23:50:56","author":"Phil Thomas","authors":["Phil Thomas"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":281509748,"title":"Snoop Dogg and Nelly Face Fan Backlash Over Trump Inauguration Shows","text":"Rappers Snoop Dogg and Nelly are performing at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration events, with Snoop popping up at the first-ever \"Crypto Ball\" on Friday night and Nelly scheduled for the official Inaugural Liberty Ball on Monday.The performances mark a significant shift, particularly for Snoop Dogg, who previously criticized Trump and his MAGA supporters.Newsweek reached out to press contacts for both Snoop Dogg and Nelly via email on Saturday for comment.What To KnowThe Crypto Ball, hosted by incoming White House AI and \"Crypto Czar\" David Sacks, took place at the Andrew W.

However, his stance shifted after Trump commuted the prison sentence of Death Row Records founder Michael \"Harry-O\" Harris.Harris had been serving time for attempted murder and cocaine trafficking at Lompoc Federal Correctional Institution when he received clemency on Trump's last day in office. This came after Snoop worked with activist Alice Johnson and producer Weldon Angelos to advocate for Harris's release. The Daily Beast reported that despite their previous conflicts, Snoop was \"appreciative\" of Trump's decision.In a January 2024 interview with The Sunday Times, Snoop said that Trump, \"Ain't done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me. He pardoned Michael Harris. So, I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump.\"What People Are Saying\"This is culturally embarrassing and disrespectful asf [as f***],\" wrote one Instagram user, while another referenced late rap icons: \"Nipsey and Pac would never!!!\"Podcast host Ryan Snead expressed strong criticism on X: \"Yo @SnoopDogg What made you go from this to simping for a felon, business fraud, rapist, and accused pedophile who failed to deliver the first time around?\"Combat veteran and fan Travis Matthew echoed the disappointment on X: \"I never thought I'd have Snoop Dogg being a Trump supporter on my bingo card....
