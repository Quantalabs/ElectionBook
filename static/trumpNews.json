The White House later says she was referring to all the files related to Epstein's crimes.\n\n28 February\n\nBondi says federal investigators are withholding thousands of documents about Epstein, and asks the FBI to release all the information.\n\nVirginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault, dies by suicide aged 41, her family says. The prince has long denied any wrongdoing.\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk posts on X that Trump is “in the Epstein files”, referring to court documents and evidence thought to have been collected by investigators. The White House dismisses the post, which Musk deletes.\n\nThe US Department of Justice and FBI conclude in a report that Epstein did not have a so-called client list that could implicate high-profile associates, and that he did take his own life - contradicting long-held conspiracy theories.\n\nTrump asks Bondi to release \"any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony\" on Jeffrey Epstein, after what he calls a \"ridiculous amount of publicity\".\n\nTrump sues Wall Street Journal owner Rupert Murdoch, its parent company and two reporters after the newspaper reported that his name appeared on a \"bawdy\" 2003 birthday card to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. US officials ask New York federal court to unseal transcripts from the grand jury involved in the government's 2019 sex trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n24 and 25 July\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche meets with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is moved to a new federal prison in Texas known to have better living conditions.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cpwywe5ee84t","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/d2b6/live/c674f0d0-884c-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 01:06:03","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":356863888,"title":"I would feel more worried' - Chicagoans on Trump's plan to deploy troops","text":"US President Donald Trump has doubled down on plans to send the National Guard to Chicago, Illinois to address crime.

The Department of Justice is offering a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro and have accused the Venezuelan president of violating U.S. narcotics laws.\n\n“We just, over the last few minutes, literally shot out a boat, a drug-carrying boat, a lot of drugs in that boat,” he told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, per Reuters. “And there’s more where that came from. We have a lot of drugs pouring into our country, coming in for a long time … These came out of Venezuela.”\n\nMaduro previously warned that he would respond to any U.S. military action with an “armed fight” and claimed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was attempting to pull Trump into a war in the Caribbean. “Mr. President, Donald Trump,” the Venezuelan president said on Monday, per the New York Times, “watch out, because Mr. Rubio wants to stain your hands with blood.”\n\nTrending Stories\n\nFirst Look at ‘28 Years Later: The Bone Temple’ Promises ‘Bonkers, Off-the-Wall Energy’\n\nFour Best Friends Made an Album as Kids. 25 Years Later, It's a Cult Classic\n\nSee Cyndi Lauper Bring Out Joni Mitchell, Cher, SZA at Final Show of Farewell Tour\n\nBurning Man Homicide: Police Seek Help Identifying Victim\n\nThe U.S. government is increasing its maritime force in the waters off Venezuela to combat what it says are threats from drug cartels, the Associated Press reported.

Remarking that in the world of semiconductors, it is often said, 'Oil was black gold, but chips are digital diamonds', the Prime Minister stated that oil shaped the previous century, and the fate of the world was determined by oil wells. The global economy fluctuated based on how much petroleum was extracted from these wells. However, he emphasized that the power of the 21st century is now concentrated in the small chip. Though tiny in size, these chips possess the potential to accelerate global progress significantly. Also Read | 'Smiling Manifestation of a Troika': US Media Blames Donald Trump for 'Show of Unity' at SCO Summit 2025.\nPM Modi highlighted that the global semiconductor market has already reached $600 billion, and in the coming years, it is expected to surpass $1 trillion. He expressed confidence that, given the pace at which India is advancing in the semiconductor sector, India will hold a significant share in this $1 trillion market.\nPM Modi recalled that in 2021, the Semicon India programme was launched, by 2023, India's first semiconductor plant had been approved, in 2024, several more plants received approval, and in 2025, five additional projects were cleared. He said ten semiconductor projects are now underway, involving an investment of over eighteen billion dollars --more than ₹1.5 lakh crore. The Prime Minister emphasised that this reflects the growing global trust in India.\nAlso Read | North Korea's Kim Jong-un Arrives in Beijing Ahead of China's Victory Day Military Parade.\nEmphasising that in the semiconductor sector, speed matters, PM Modi said, \"the shorter the time from file to factory, and the lesser the paperwork, the sooner wafer work can begin\". He stressed that the government is working with this very approach. The National Single Window System has been implemented, enabling all approvals from both the Centre and States to be accessed on a single platform. As a result, investors have been freed from extensive paperwork, he noted. Prime Minister highlighted that semiconductor parks are being developed across the country under a plug-and-play infrastructure model, which offer facilities such as land, power supply, port and airport connectivity, and access to a skilled worker pool. He remarked that when such infrastructure is combined with incentives, industrial growth is inevitable. Whether through PLI incentives or Design Linked Grants, India is offering end-to-end capabilities. This is why investment continues to flow in, he emphasised. Affirming that India is moving beyond backend operations and progressing towards becoming a full-stack semiconductor nation, PM Modi reiterated that the day is not far when India's smallest chip will drive the world's biggest change. \"Our journey began late... but nothing can stop us now.\"\nPrime Minister informed that CG Power's pilot plant commenced operations on August 28, just 4-5 days ago. He added that the pilot plant of Kaynes is also about to begin. Test chips from Micron and Tata are already in production. He reiterated that commercial chip production will begin this year, underscoring the rapid progress India is making in the semiconductor sector.\nEmphasizing that India's semiconductor success story is not confined to a single vertical or a single technology, PM Modi stated that India is building a comprehensive ecosystem--one that encompasses designing, manufacturing, packaging, and high-tech devices, all within the country. He clarified that the Semiconductor Mission is not limited to establishing a single fab or producing a single chip. Rather, India is creating a robust semiconductor ecosystem that will make the nation self-reliant and globally competitive.\nPM Modi said that the country is advancing in this sector alongside the world's most advanced technologies. He noted that design centers being developed in Noida and Bengaluru are working on some of the world's most advanced chips--capable of storing billions of transistors. He emphasized that these chips will power the immersive technologies of the 21st century. Addressing the challenges faced by the global semiconductor sector, the Prime Minister affirmed that India is actively working to overcome them. He remarked that while towering buildings and impressive physical infrastructure are visible in cities, their foundation lies in steel. Similarly, the foundation of India's digital infrastructure is built on critical minerals. PM Modi stated that India is currently working on the National Critical Mineral Mission and is committed to meeting its demand for rare minerals domestically. He added that over the past four years, significant progress has been made on critical minerals projects.\nUnderscoring that the government envisions a significant role for start-ups and MSMEs in the growth of the semiconductor sector, the Prime Minister highlighted that India contributes 20 percent of the world's semiconductor design talent, and that the country's youth represent the largest human capital factory for the semiconductor industry. Addressing young entrepreneurs, innovators, and start-ups, PM Modi urged them to come forward, assuring that the government stands shoulder to shoulder with them. He emphasized that the Design Linked Incentive Scheme and the Chips-to-Startup Programme are specifically designed for them. He announced that the Design Linked Incentive Scheme is being restructured to better serve its objectives. The Prime Minister stated that the government is committed to developing Indian intellectual property (IP) in this sector. He called upon all states to engage in healthy competition with one another to build semiconductor ecosystems and enhance the investment climate within their regions.\n\"India has reached this stage by following the mantra of Reform, Perform, and Transform. A new phase of next-generation reforms will soon be initiated,\" PM Modi said, noting that work is underway on the next phase of the India Semiconductor Mission.\n\"Design is ready. Mask is aligned. Now is the time for precision execution and delivery at scale,\" he told the investors. He emphasised that India's policies are not short-term signals but long-term commitments and assured that every investor's needs will be met. \"The day is not far when the world will say: Designed in India, Made in India, Trusted by the World,\" he said. The first set of Made-in-India chips from a pilot line was presented to PM Modi by Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw. Vaishnaw emphasized that India's semiconductor mission is built on trust respecting intellectual property rights, supporting supply chain development, and promoting co-development models with global partners. \"India has always gone to the world as a partner, fostering mutual growth and win-win collaborations,\" he said, adding that this trusted position is one of India's strongest advantages in the global value chain.\n12 Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were announced during Semicon India 2025. These agreements focus on enhancing product development, expanding service capabilities, and strengthening the skill development sector, with the aim of building a self-reliant and future-ready semiconductor ecosystem in the country.\nTo further strengthen innovation, Vaishnaw announced the formation of the Deep Tech Alliance, with close to a billion dollars already committed. Initially focusing on semiconductors, the Alliance will expand to other frontier sectors such as clean energy, biotechnology, quantum technologies, and space. The Minister said this would provide much-needed venture capital support for emerging deep tech industries.\nThe Union Minister stated that the Semiconductor Laboratory, Mohali modernization programme is progressing well, aimed at increasing production levels, enabling new product tape-outs, and strengthening India's high-value, mid-volume manufacturing capacity. Building on the success of ISM 1.0, the Government is also preparing to launch ISM 2.0, which will broaden support for fabs, OSAT units, capital equipment, and materials to cover the entire semiconductor value chain.\nThe Union Minister stated that exports will be an integral part of the ten approved projects, ensuring that chips made in India will serve both domestic and global markets. Independent studies indicate that semiconductor production in India is already 15-30% more cost-competitive compared to global benchmarks. Shri Vaishnaw underlined that India never rushed through project approvals but ensured professional assessment for sustainable progress. With two fabs already in place and more in the pipeline, India is building momentum in an industry where, once the foundation is set, growth accelerates exponentially.

Reportedly dating Scooter Braun","text":"It’s been a busy summer for Sydney Sweeney, stirring up controversy and schadenfreude while enduring movie flops.\n\nThe 27-year-old “Euphoria” star, knowingly or not, triggered a seismic cultural debate over the perceived, pro-white-supremacy messaging in her American Eagle denim ad campaign, while delighting Donald Trump and his supporters who loved learning she was a registered Republican and seeing her cause a “leftist meltdown.” Sweeney also paraded around in Venice at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez’s oligarchic wedding, despite only being there to secure a business investment. More recently, she left 92-year-old Kim Novak worried that her new movie project would sensationalize the “Vertigo” legend’s real-life, forbidden love affair with Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nBut Sweeney is now poised to incite the wrath of another significant population of people who live online — Taylor Swift fans.\n\nAfter weeks of rumors, TMZ confirmed that Sweeney is dating one of Swift’s biggest enemies, Scooter Braun. Sources told TMZ that Sweeney and the record executive met at the Bezos-Sanchez wedding and have been on multiple dates, though they are keeping things “casual” for now. As one source said, “Sydney has just ended a relationship and she’s doing what women in their 20’s do — she’s dating.”\n\nIt’s expected that Sweeney wouldn’t be put off by her 17-year age difference with the 44-year-old Braun, given that she was previously engaged to businessman Jonathan Davino, who was 42 when they split in January.\n\nBut by being publicly linked to Braun, Sweeney is sure to stir up more interest in her private life, as well as potential controversy, at a time when her publicists might prefer she focus on promoting her third movie to come out this summer, “Christy,” a biopic about pioneering lesbian boxer Christy Martin. Sweeney could be in the Oscar conversation for best actress if the film and her performance as Martin is well received at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nInstead, her choice to date Braun could be what people are talking about. Among other things, Braun reportedly made Swift’s life miserable by engaging in a bitter, historical feud with her, starting in 2019, when he acquired ownership of her first six albums by purchasing Big Machine Records, according to Billboard. \n\nSwift was devastated to learn about Braun’s purchase, especially since she had been trying to buy back her own masters for years and this sale, she said, occurred without her knowledge. Swifties may not forget how Swift accused the music manager of being a “bully” and a “tyrant” and of wanting her music for “nefarious reasons,” according to Billboard. The feud sparked ongoing conversations about artists’ rights, private equity and the value of re-releasing music.\n\nSwift vowed to get artistic control of her own work by re-recording the six albums, under the title “Taylor’s version.” Speaking to Time magazine when she was named its Person of the Year in 2023, she described the situation with Braun as “having my life’s work taken away from me by someone who hates me.”\n\n“My response to anything that happens, good or bad, is to keep making things,” she added. “Keep making art … But I’ve also learned there’s no point in actively trying to quote unquote defeat your enemies. Trash takes itself out every single time.”\n\nThe feud more or less ended in May, when Swift announced she had been able to buy back her masters from those six albums, Billboard reported. She wrote on her website that she had been dreaming about owning her masters for years. “I almost stopped thinking I could ever happy, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away. But that’s all in the past now.”\n\nFor Swift fans, Braun’s actions with regard to her music may not remain in the past. They and other Braun critics may turn their attention to Sweeney and question her taste in men, her motives for dating the former talent manager and what this choice says about her character. It appears that some Braun critics have already rendered their verdict on Sweeney in the comments section of the TMZ story.\n\n“What a step down!!!” one person said. “But he does have contacts and is super rich so I see what she is doing here…..”\n\n“Both are gross. They deserve each other,” another person said, to which yet another replied: “Agreed!”","summary":"After her American Eagle ad campaign and other controversies, Sweeney could attract more negative attention by dating one of Taylor Swift's biggest enemies.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/02/sydney-sweeneys-latest-outrage-reportedly-dating-scooter-braun/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sweeney-2-jpg.jpeg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 00:16:34","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.438},{"id":356861258,"title":"Veterans speak out against proposed deployment of National Guard in Chicago","text":"Aaron Hughes went to the Kedzie Armory in 2000 to enlist in the Illinois National Guard hoping to serve by helping place sandbags after catastrophic flooding along the Mississippi River..\n\nThree years later, he was running transportation missions between Kuwait and Iraq in a 1953 truck with no radio and no maps. He never helped clean up flooding or provided assistance after any natural disaster.\n\n“People don’t join the military to patrol the streets of major cities of the United States,” said Hughes, 43, who joined fellow members of About Face: Veterans Against the War on Tuesday in Federal Plaza to call on National Guard members to resist President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy troops to Chicago to combat crime.\n\nThe vets specifically suggested that National Guard members invoke their duty to disobey unlawful orders, while pointing to a federal judge’s ruling in California that found Trump’s use of the military in Los Angeles this year violated federal law.\n\nLike Hughes, the reality of Daniel Lakemacher’s service was vastly different from the expectations he had when he enlisted.\n\nLakemacher was a psychiatric technician specialist for the Navy’s Hospital Corps from 2005 to 2009, serving at the Guantanamo Bay prison for two of those years. He was discharged from the military as a conscientious objector after undergoing “a lot of reflection, introspection, learning.\n\n“I saw and I experienced so much how the military can work to stifle one’s individual conscience,” said Lakemacher, 42, who grew up in Woodstock and now lives in Oak Park. It “can cause great harm, moral injury to those who are in the military by ordering them to do things that are wrong, regardless of legality, that violate people’s conscience of what they know to be right.\n\n“And so it created in me a passion and a commitment to be able to support those who are in uniform in following their conscience in doing what they know to be right, regardless of the legality of an order.”\n\nThe veterans also emphasized that National Guard members aren’t trained in city deployments, constitutional law, human rights or provided any training that would be relevant to addressing local law enforcement.\n\n“What are service members trained to do? That is what everyone needs to be asking themselves,” Hughes said, adding that military members are first trained in “how to kill people.” \n\n“What are the unit’s technical proficiencies and how does that relate to anything that these people are talking about? It doesn’t,” Hughes said.\n\nCalls for Pritzker to reject Trump’s order\n\nThe veterans also called on Gov. JB Pritzker, as commander in chief of the Illinois National Guard, to formally reject orders from Trump to send National Guard members to Chicago, which the president has described as a “killing field.”\n\nPritzker, along with Mayor Brandon Johnson and other elected officials, last week called Trump’s plan “unwarranted” and “illegal,” declaring there was no federal emergency that would require a National Guard presence.\n\n“Back up your words with actions by directing the Illinois National Guard not to report. To refuse these orders,” Lakemacher said. “You have so much more power than just words and tweets. Use the resources of the state to support, at the individual level, any guardsperson that refuses.”\n\nPritzker has also said that he and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul have been exploring legal options in the event that Trump sends guard members.\n\nJoey Mogul, a lawyer with the People’s Law Office, on Tuesday reiterated comments from other legal experts that “there is no legal, factual or moral justification for President Trump to deploy any military troops or National Guard units here in Chicago.”\n\nShe detailed two scenarios in which Trump could send troops to the city — by invoking the federal Insurrection Act or through a federal statute. Both situations would be in response to domestic rebellions that are preventing local governments from enforcing the law, which Mogul said Chicago was “not witnessing.”\n\nPritzker’s office did not respond to a request for comment about calls for him to formally deny Trump’s order to deploy troops to Chicago.\n\n‘Who’s talking about the guardsmen?’\n\nHughes, the National Guard veteran, said he would have been more careful about his decision to enlist in the military had he known the full extent of the National Guard’s responsibilities.\n\nHe encourages active members to call the National Lawyers Guild Military Law Task Force to learn about their rights or to reach out to the Veterans Against the War.\n\nWhen possible, community members should reach out to active guard members in their communities “so they know they’re not alone, because no one’s talking about them. Who’s talking about the guardsmen? It’s just like a political game,” Hughes said.\n\n“This has ramifications for service members, for the people who are actually in uniform on the ground. I feel like we have forgotten about them in this back-and-forth spectacle.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/02/veterans-speak-out-against-proposed-deployment-of-national-guard-in-chicago","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f996249/2147483647/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3b%2Fc9%2Fb8bdfd67437f9eef6a30c4dfcf1c%2Fvetgua","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 00:13:58","author":"Kade Heather","authors":["Kade Heather"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":356860256,"title":"World News | Herzlich Willkommen: German FM Wadephul Arrives in Delhi, to Meet Piyush Goyal, EAM Jaishankar","text":"New Delhi [India], September 3 (ANI): German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Johann David Wadephul arrived in New Delhi following his engagement in Bengaluru as part of his two-day official visit to the country.

And Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, thanked Mr. Trump for “restoring Space Command to its rightful home.”\n\n“The Biden administration chose to make this political,” she said. “What we want to do is put the safety and security of Americans first. We want to make sure our American war fighter is put first.”\n\nThe Associated Press reported earlier Tuesday (September 2, 2025) that the President would announce the move at the White House after a Pentagon website set up to livestream the remarks described the event hours in advance as a “U.S. Space Command HQ Announcement.”\n\nU.S. Space Command said in a statement on X after the announcement that it “stands ready to carry out the direction of the President following today’s announcement of Huntsville, Alabama as the command’s permanent headquarters location.”\n\nIts functions include conducting operations like enabling satellite-based navigation and troop communication and providing warning of missile launches.\n\nHuntsville, Alabama, nicknamed Rocket City, has long been home to the Army’s Redstone Arsenal and NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Centre. The Army’s Space and Missile Defence Command is also located in Huntsville, which drew its nickname because of its role in building the first rockets for the U.S. space program.\n\nHuntsville Mayor Tommy Battle said about 1,400 Space Command jobs will transition to Redstone Arsenal over the next five years.\n\n“This decision is not about what’s best for Huntsville – it’s about being mission-focused,” said Mr. Battle. “The decision to locate U.S. Space Command at Redstone ensures our nation is prepared to meet growing challenges in space. Huntsville is ready with our experienced workforce, resilient infrastructure and deep commitment to national defence.”\n\nThe saga stretches back to 2021, when the Air Force identified Army Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville as the preferred location for the new U.S. Space Command. The city was picked after site visits to six states that compared factors such as infrastructure capacity, community support and costs to the Defence Department.\n\nThen-President Joe Biden in 2023 announced Space Command would be permanently located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which had been serving as its temporary headquarters. Mr. Biden’s Democratic administration said that keeping the command in Colorado Springs would avoid a disruption in readiness.\n\nThe announcement infuriated both Democratic and Republican officials in Colorado, which has a booming aerospace industry. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, called the relocation of Space Command to Alabama “deeply disappointing” and demanded an explanation as to how the decision was made.\n\n“This is the wrong decision, diminishing military readiness and national security and eroding the trust Americans have in our country and its leaders to do the right thing,” Mr. Polis said. “Uprooting Space Command will weaken national security and readiness, waste taxpayer dollars, and inconvenience military families.”\n\nMr. Trump on Tuesday (September 2, 2025) said his initial plans to locate the headquarters in Huntsville were “wrongfully obstructed by the Biden administration.” But he also said the fact that Colorado uses mail-in voting “played a big factor also” in moving the headquarters away from Colorado Springs.\n\n“The problem with Colorado is that they have a very corrupt voting system,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nA review by the Defence Department inspector general was inconclusive and could not determine why Colorado was chosen over Alabama. Mr. Trump, a Republican who enjoys deep support in Alabama, had long been expected to move Space Command back to Alabama.","summary":"Alabama and Colorado have long battled to claim Space Command, with elected officials from both states asserting their state is the better location","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-announces-that-space-command-is-moving-from-colorado-to-alabama/article70005834.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/6wer90/article70005841.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_Space_Command_83438.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 00:11:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.134},{"id":356860954,"title":"Breaking: First batch of Epstein files released after Trump administration push","text":"More than 33,000 pages of files on the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been released by a United States House of Representatives committee.\n\nThe case of Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019, has caused a political headache for Republican President Donald Trump, after many of his supporters embraced a slew of conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein.\n\nA July Reuters/Ipsos poll found that majorities of Americans and of Mr Trump's Republicans believed the government was hiding details on the case.\n\nThe first batch of files, released on Tuesday, local time, largely included court documents and other previously released information relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, as Republican party leadership looked to end a push by a bipartisan pair of politicians to force a vote on the matter.\n\nThe documents were being uploaded to a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform website, Republican committee chairman James Comer said.\n\n\"We're in the process of uploading those documents for full transparency so everyone in America can see those documents,\" he said.\n\n\"It's going as quick as we can get them uploaded.\n\n\"We want those to be public as soon as possible.\"\n\nMr Comer also told NBC News that there was \"nothing new in the documents\" that he ordered to be released by the panel.\n\n\"Nearly everything Republicans just supposedly 'released' … has already been released,\" said Democratic US Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts in a post on X.\n\nRepublican Representative Thomas Massie and Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, have proposed a measure that would require the Justice Department (DOJ) to release all of its unclassified Epstein records — including those held by the FBI and US attorneys' offices.\n\nMr Massie and Mr Khanna are expected to hold a press conference with Epstein victims on Wednesday morning, local time.\n\nMr Massie told the Axios news outlet on Tuesday that he would push ahead despite the latest document release.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Mr Massie's petition was \"inartfully drafted\" because it lacked language that would protect the identities of victims who were sexually abused by Epstein.\n\nMr Johnson also said the petition was \"moot\" due to the work of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which released thousands of pages of files.\n\n\"It's superfluous at this point, and I think we're achieving the desired end here,\" he said.\n\nThe materials released on Tuesday included at least eight videos of apparent police interviews with victims.

It’s not clear the extent to which the records, both visible and audible, are entirely new in the tranche released Tuesday evening.\n\nThe full government case file on Epstein is believed to contain over 300 gigabytes of data, much of it stored in the FBI’s Sentinel case management system. \n\nOversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) said the documents mark the beginning of the committee’s public disclosure effort, though the timing also blunts pressure from within Comer’s own party. On Tuesday, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) filed a long-awaited discharge petition that would force a House vote on releasing the full cache of Epstein files— an effort that could lose momentum toward the necessary 218 House supporters with the committee’s release of files provided by the DOJ.\n\nStill, critics of the committee’s work have already pointed out that many of the paper files in Tuesday evening’s release are already publicly available through court records.\n\n“I’m surprised that the Biden administration never released the documents,” Comer told the Washington Examiner when asked what was new in the files. “I appreciate the Trump administration releasing them. I guess that’s been the biggest surprise.”\n\nDeposition plans, subpoena deadlines, and internal divides\n\nComer’s investigation also targets individuals previously associated with Epstein. The committee is scheduling closed-door depositions with former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey, and former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, who negotiated Epstein’s 2008 non-prosecution agreement while serving as the top federal prosecutor in Miami.\n\nLast week, the committee also subpoenaed Epstein’s estate for records—including a so-called “birthday book” reportedly compiled by Maxwell that may contain names and notes about Epstein’s guests. Notably, the Wall Street Journal has been sued by President Donald Trump after reporting that Trump allegedly wrote Epstein a letter in honor of his 50th birthday, a claim he vehemently denied and an allegation Maxwell recently said in a DOJ interview she could not confirm to be true. The deadline for the estate to comply with the subpoena is Sept. 8.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year sentence following her 2021 federal conviction for sex trafficking and conspiracy. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial, with authorities ruling his death a suicide despite widespread public speculation that the disgraced financier did not kill himself.\n\nThe DOJ’s turning over of Epstein-related documents follows public fallout from earlier this summer, when the department announced after the July 4 weekend that it had no plans to make any further documents available, accompanied by a ten-hour videotape from a portion of Epstein’s prison cell in New York City.\n\nMuch of the fallout began after Attorney General Pam Bondi’s statement that a so-called “client list” was on her desk during a February interview on Fox News. She clarified on July 8 that she was referring to a host of files, including “the JFK, MLK files as well.”\n\nDemocrats challenge premise of oversight probe\n\nDemocrats on the committee have cast doubt on the seriousness of the GOP-led investigation.\n\nRep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) said Tuesday that the committee has not been engaged in any sustained inquiry into Epstein and framed the latest document release as an effort to undermine Massie’s discharge petition without making meaningful disclosures.\n\n“There’s really no [Epstein] investigation on the Oversight Committee,” Frost told reporters. “If one’s going to start now and we’re going to demand these documents, then I welcome it. But it is just false to say that the Oversight Committee has been engaged in some grand investigation. No, we haven’t.”\n\nOther Republicans like Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-WY) countered that the release Tuesday evening marked an “important step toward exposing the truth and holding everyone involved accountable.”\n\nThe most recent public release of Epstein-related information came on Aug. 22, when the DOJ released a full nine-hour interview of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s conversation with Maxwell in July, just before she was abruptly transferred from a low-security prison in Florida to a minimum-security facility in Texas without explanation last month.\n\nNINE TAKEAWAYS FROM DOJ INTERVIEW WITH GHISLAINE MAXWELL\n\nBlanche went on the record that Maxwell’s compliance with the government did not indicate she would benefit in any way, such as potential clemency or immunity, as her counsel has indicated she would seek if she were to be called to testify before Congress.\n\nMaxwell spoke fondly of Trump in her interview despite acknowledging she did not know him too well and saying she never saw Trump behave inappropriately with other women. Trump has shot down reporters’ questions about any potential pardons or clemency actions for Maxwell, but he has said it is his right as president to do so.\n\nLauren Green contributed to this report.","summary":"The&#160;House Oversight Committee&#160;on Tuesday released more than 33,000 pages of material related to the late convicted sex offender&#160;Jeffrey Epstein, the first large-scale publication of documents provided by the&#160;Justice Department&#160;under subpoena in the committee’s ongoing review of the Epstein case.

His comments came during a press briefing where he was asked about the potential threat posed by the strengthening alliance between the two nations and their global allies.\nTrump firmly rejected the idea that closer relations between Beijing and Moscow pose a strategic threat to the US. When asked if he believed China and its partners were attempting to form an international coalition to challenge US influence, Trump responded, “No. Not at all. China needs us.”\nHe continued, “I have a very good relationship with President Xi, as you know. But China needs us much more than we need them. I don’t see that at all.”\nThe questions come as Beijing hosts several world leaders for high-level diplomatic events. Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Beijing. The event has drawn notable attendees including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following the summit, Putin will remain in China to attend the ‘Victory Day’ military parade on Wednesday, where he will be joined by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The parade is seen as a prominent display of China’s military power on the global stage.\nPutin’s growing engagement with Xi is being closely watched by Western governments, particularly as the war in Ukraine continues without resolution. Putin has reportedly briefed some of his counterparts at the SCO summit on his August 15 meeting with President Trump in Alaska.\nEarlier in the day, during a call-in interview on The Scott Jennings Radio Show, Trump again downplayed the Russia-China dynamic, saying he is “not concerned at all” about an “axis” forming against the US.\nHe also took the opportunity to express disappointment with President Putin over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. “I am very disappointed in President Putin, I can say that, and we will be doing something to help people live,” Trump said, though he did not elaborate on any specific actions under consideration.","summary":"Putin’s growing engagement with Xi is being closely watched by Western governments, particularly as the war in Ukraine continues without resolution.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/china-needs-us-more-trump-shrugs-off-threat-from-russia-china-ties-after-xi-putin-meet-ws-l-9545189.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/Putin-Xi-2025-09-2c7434caeebbad54325725cd00e7e4a4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:55:25","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.148},{"id":356861248,"title":"Pritzker has fiery response to Trump’s planned Chicago invasion","text":"Illinois Gov.

Ro Khanna and a Kentucky Republican wrangled enough lawmakers in July to force the release of government files on the late financier and child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, House Speaker Mike Johnson halted work and sent lawmakers home early for the summer recess.\n\nWith members of the U.S. House of Representatives back in Washington, D.C., Khanna and his unlikely Republican ally are quickly resuming their crusade for Epstein-related documentation. They’re thwarting Republican President Donald Trump, who fomented and then dismissed the renewed attention on Epstein, and Trump ally House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nKhanna plans to hold a news conference on Wednesday morning outside the U.S. Capitol with 10 alleged victims of Epstein, the financier and accused child sex trafficker who died in 2019. Some of the survivors have never spoken publicly before, said a spokesperson for Khanna’s office who declined to identify them before they appear in public. The news conference is a show of support for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Massie authored and Khanna co-sponsored.\n\n“It’s about restoring trust in government,” Khanna said in an interview with Bay Area News Group. “It’s about bringing this country together — progressives, Independents, Republicans and MAGA supporters — to seek truth and justice for victims and survivors.”\n\nAnd, he said, “not allow rich and powerful men to abuse underage girls with impunity.”\n\nTrump is among many rich, powerful men, including former President Bill Clinton and England’s Prince Andrew, who socialized with Epstein. The president has said he had a falling out with Epstein before Epstein’s 2008 conviction in Florida on child prostitution charges. In 2019, during Trump’s first term in office, the federal government charged Epstein with child sex trafficking, and he died in custody a month later in what was ruled a suicide by hanging.\n\nDuring his last year’s presidential campaign, Trump said he’d have “no problem” releasing the government’s Epstein files if elected. But Trump’s Justice Department inflamed skeptics across the political spectrum this year when it said a list of Epstein’s clients didn’t exist. Then, news reports claimed that Trump’s own name appeared in the files.\n\nOn Tuesday, Massie filed a petition that would force House leadership to allow a vote on the bill. They’re confident they have the support to do so. Khanna claims that all 212 Democrats in the House plan to sign the petition, and 11 Republicans have co-sponsored the bill so far — more than enough support to push it across the finish line. The bill would compel the U.S. Department of Justice and other agencies to release within 30 days “all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his close associate, convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. That would include “individuals, including government officials,” named in connection with Epstein’s crimes or investigations.\n\nEarlier this summer, Johnson opposed the bill because he said it would compromise the privacy of Epstein’s survivors. Trump administration officials have also said the files contain child pornography. The bill would allow government officials to withhold child sex abuse materials or information that could identify victims.\n\nDemocrats have gleefully fanned the flames of the growing controversy over Epstein, his many connections to the wealthy and influential and the federal government’s investigations. Khanna has worked hard to keep the issue top of mind for voters this summer as Trump urged his supporters to instead applaud his successes and pivoted to focus on crime in cities.\n\n“I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country’s history,” Trump posted on Truth Social in July, “and all these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”\n\nIt’s a rare issue that has split Trump’s Make America Great Again base. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, an avid conspiracy theorist, is slated to appear at the press conference on Wednesday, Khanna said. She has co-sponsored the bill with Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert and other far-right lawmakers. On the other hand, so has Democratic former House Speaker and San Francisco Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\n“It’s not partisanship,” Khanna said, “it’s patriotism.”\n\nKhanna is also playing a role in another push to release Epstein-related files by House lawmakers. The House Oversight Committee, which is led by Republicans, is trying to guide an investigation into who among Epstein’s high-powered social circle may have been aware of his sexual abuse of teenage girls. They’re also examining how the federal government handled the cases against Epstein.\n\nKhanna is a member of the committee and said he helped craft a letter to Epstein’s estate. Last week, the committee subpoenaed the estate for documents including a book that was compiled with notes from friends for his 50th birthday, his last will and testament, agreements he signed with prosecutors, his contact books, and his financial transactions and holdings.\n\nAccording the Wall Street Journal, Trump was one of many Epstein associates who wrote Epstein a friendly letter for his 50th birthday in 2003, which were compiled in a book. Trump sued the news outlet for libel over the report.\n\nAs pressure mounted, the Trump administration released to the committee a trove of documents that Democrats said were mostly public already. The committee published them on Tuesday. Officials also asked judges to unseal transcripts of grand jury proceedings in Epstein’s criminal cases, but they declined, citing longstanding secrecy rules. Judge Richard Berman of the Southern District of New York said the request to release grand jury records “appears to be a ‘diversion’ from the breadth and scope of the Epstein files in the Government’s possession. The grand jury testimony is merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged conduct.”\n\nKhanna is also unsatisfied with the Trump administration’s responses.\n\n“They’ve been stonewalling,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.","summary":"Renegade Republicans and South Bay Rep.

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: Nearly 600 economists have signed an open letter expressing support for Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook and US central bank independence, as Cook battles President Donald Trump's attempt to fire her.\n\"Good economic policy requires credible monetary institutions,\" said the letter, whose 593 signatories as of Tuesday include Nobel laureates and former US government officials.\n\"Credible monetary institutions, in turn, require the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" the letter added.\nThe support came after Trump said on his Truth Social platform last week that he was immediately removing Cook over claims of mortgage fraud.\nCook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board, is challenging her ouster in court.\nOn Tuesday, her lawyers pushed back on Trump's justification in firing her and argued in a filing that she was not given a chance to meaningfully contest allegations against her.\nThe open letter signed by economists noted that: \"Recent public statements about Governor Cook - including threats of removal and a claim that she has been fired - have arrived alongside unproven accusations.\"\n\"This approach threatens the fundamental principle of central bank independence,\" the letter cautioned.\nAs of Tuesday, signatories included Nobel laureates Claudia Goldin, Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Romer.\nAlso on the list were Christina Romer, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under former president Barack Obama, and Jared Bernstein, who held the post under Joe Biden.\nThe letter was organised by Tatyana Deryugina, an associate professor of finance at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nAmong the allegations Cook faces are that she claimed two primary residences on mortgage documents in 2021 - one in Michigan and another in Georgia. A primary residence typically attracts better mortgage terms for a loan.\nBut although Trump pointed to a criminal referral in announcing Cook's removal, she has not been charged with a crime. The alleged incidents also occurred before she took office as a Fed governor in 2022.\nIn their Tuesday filing, Cook's lawyers argued that the referral letter's language signalled charges against Cook \"were nothing more than a set of cherry-picked, cut-and-paste allegations.\"\nThey charged that the aim was \"to try to give the President political cover to remove a (Fed) Board member with whom he has policy disagreements.\"\nThey also warned that allowing Trump to keep Cook out of her office even temporarily \"would amount to a crack in the foundation\" of the Fed's near-century of independence.\nThe Supreme Court suggested in a recent ruling that Fed officials can only be removed for \"cause,\" which could be interpreted to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.\nThe central bank has faced growing pressure in recent months, with Trump urging for lower interest rates.\nBut policymakers have been cautious in cutting rates as they monitor the effects of Trump's tariffs on the economy.","summary":"Nearly 600 signatories, including Nobel laureates and former US officials, call for the defence of the central bank’s independence.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/09/03/economists-back-fed-governor-cook-as-trump-attempts-ouster","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/99927996-lisa-cook.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:48:42","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":356861056,"title":"JB Pritzker responds to Trump’s plan to send federal troops to Chicago (Video)","text":"The Governor of Illinois and the mayor of Chicago said in unison Tuesday that President Donald Trump's law enforcement intervention in Chicago is unwelcome.

Satellite images taken in the days leading up to the parade showed hundreds of vehicles, aircraft and other military equipment taking formation at a base in northwest Beijing.China has touted the parade as a show of unity with other countries, and Kim's attendance will be the first time he is seen with Xi and Putin at the same event. It is only his second reported trip abroad in six years.AFP journalists captured the moment his olive-green train approached Beijing Railway Station on Tuesday afternoon, with small North Korean flags flying over one coach.He appeared to be accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, South Korea's National Intelligence Service said in a statement to reporters.Kim enjoyed a brief bout of high-profile international diplomacy from around 2018, meeting US President Donald Trump and then South Korean president Moon Jae-in multiple times.But he withdrew from the global scene after the collapse of a summit with Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2019.Kim stayed in North Korea throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, but met Putin in Russia's far east in 2023.Lam Peng Er, principal research fellow from the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, said Kim's visit \"demonstrates to the North Koreans and the world that he has powerful Russian and Chinese friends who treat him with respect\". \"China also shows that it has convening power and political influence to bring Putin and Kim Jong Un together,\" he told AFP.Asked about the meeting between Xi, Putin and Kim, Trump told a radio show: \"I'm not concerned at all, no.\"","summary":"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin are expected to flank President Xi Jinping at a massive parade in Beijing on Wednesday morning, in a historic moment capping a week of diplomatic grandstanding against the West.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/kim-putin-join-xi-massive-china-military-parade-1860353","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1888130/parade-tiananmen-square-mark-80-years-since-end-world-war-ii-will-showcase-chinas-military.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=8bc9c77b4a77f974fb835f32d35edf4f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:42:16","author":"James Edgar","authors":["James Edgar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.227},{"id":356862072,"title":"Trump's Justice Department moves to block blue state from giving financial aid to illegals","text":"President Donald Trump’s United States Attorney General Pam Bondi is moving to block a controversial Illinois law recently signed by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker extending student financial aid, including in-state tuition rates and scholarships, to illegal immigrants. In a Tuesday statement, the Justice Department announced it had filed a complaint in the Southern District of Illinois against the state, Pritzker, Attorney General Kwame Raoul, also a Democrat, as well as the boards of trustees of Illinois state universities. The DOJ is seeking to block the state from enacting its laws granting illegal immigrants financial aid, which the DOJ is claiming violates federal law by unconstitutionally discriminating against U.S. citizens. In its complaint, the DOJ states that \"federal law prohibits providing aliens not lawfully present in the United States with any post-secondary education benefit on the basis of residency unless that benefit is also available to United States citizens and nationals regardless of their residency.\" Because of this, the complaint alleges that Illinois’ law is a \"blatant and ongoing violation of federal law.\" ‘NONSENSICAL’ ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TUITION POLICY SCRAPPED IN KENTUCKY, BONDI LAWSUIT DEAL In the DOJ statement, U.S. Attorney Steven Weinhoeft for the Southern District of Illinois commented that \"Illinois has an apparent desire to win a ‘race to the bottom’ as the country’s leading sanctuary state.\" Weinhoeft said that Illinois’ \"misguided approach mandating in-state tuition, scholarships, and financial aid to illegal aliens plainly violates federal law\" and that \"this policy treats illegal aliens better than U.S. citizens living in other states and incentivizes even more illegal immigration, all on the taxpayer’s dime.\" \"Illinois citizens deserve better,\" he said. Bondi commented that \"this Department of Justice has already filed multiple lawsuits to prevent U.S. students from being treated like second-class citizens — Illinois now joins the list of states where we are relentlessly fighting to vindicate federal law.\" In response to the complaint, a spokesperson for Pritzker's office told Fox News Digital that \"this is yet another blatant attempt to strip Illinoisans of resources and opportunities.\" \"While the Trump Administration strips away federal resources from all Americans, Illinois provides consistent and inclusive educational pathways for all students – including immigrants and first-generation students – to access support and contribute to our state,\" said the spokesperson. \"All Illinoisans deserve a fair shot to obtain an education and our programs and policies are consistent with federal laws.\" DOJ CALLS FOR TIPS ON EMPLOYERS FAVORING FOREIGN WORKERS IN HIRING PRACTICES In August, Pritzker, who is a rumored 2028 Democratic presidential contender, signed a bill into law opening student financial aid to all Illinois residents, regardless of immigration status, opening a pathway for illegal immigrants residing in the state to receive educational financial benefits. The bill purports to establish \"equitable eligibility for financial aid and benefits\" for all students in the state. The bill reads that \"a student who is an Illinois resident and who is not otherwise eligible for federal financial aid, including, but not limited to, a transgender student who is disqualified for failure to register for selective service or a noncitizen student who has not obtained lawful permanent residence, shall be eligible for financial aid and benefits.\" The law has been heavily criticized by parents in the state. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Michelle Cunney, an Illinois mother and local Parents’ Rights in Education chapter leader, called the new law a \"nightmare.\" JB PRITZKER CLAIMS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLANNING AN 'INVASION' WITH US TROOPS \"To be honest, it's terrifying that not only are we having to pay for this, as you know, tax-paying citizens … But also, as parents, not knowing how it will really truly end up affecting our children and their education,\" explained Cunney. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She said that under Pritzker’s leadership, \"we know that the children who are not here legally will get … more of a chance and an opportunity to get scholarships and everything than our children, because to Pritzker, and so many others, we are not important.

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he will deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, calling the Democratic-run midwestern city a \"hellhole\" ravaged by gun crime.\n\"We're going in,\" the Republican president told reporters, while hinting that he would also send soldiers to Baltimore, another Democratic-run city.\nTrump denied charges he is strictly targeting cities run by his political opponents for his anti-crime campaign and his crackdown on undocumented migrants.\n\"I have an obligation,\" he said, citing Chicago crime statistics. \"This isn't a political thing. I have an obligation when 20 people are killed over the last two and a half weeks and 75 are shot with bullets.\"\nTrump, who already sent National Guard troops into the streets of Democratic-run Washington last month, declined to say exactly when he would send soldiers to Chicago, where the Democratic state governor and mayor strongly oppose the plan.\n\"Chicago is a hellhole right now. Baltimore is a hellhole right now,\" Trump said.\nPosting earlier on his Truth Social platform, the Republican president said he \"will solve the crime problem (in Chicago) fast, just like I did in (Washington).\"\n\"Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far,\" he said, adding that JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of the state of Illinois where Chicago is located, \"needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet.\"\nTrump followed up with a provocative, all-caps post: \"CHICAGO IS THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD!\"\nPritzker has clashed with Trump over the deployment, accusing the president of preparing \"an invasion.\"\n\"Chicago does not want troops on our streets,\" the Democratic governor said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\"Crime is down in Chicago.

Sixty people were shot, eight of them fatally, mostly in areas that have long borne the brunt of the city’s gun violence.\n\nAnd while crime has fallen significantly in recent years, Trump is primed to make an example of Chicago this week, when federal immigration agents and National Guard troops are expected to begin blanketing the streets.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker on Tuesday decried Trump’s crime-fighting promise as a partisan ploy to justify an unnecessary military presence in the Democratically-led city. And the governor, along with Illinois’ other most powerful Democrats, are urging members of the public not to fall for it.\n\n“We know before anything has happened here, that the Trump plan is to use any excuse to deploy armed military personnel to Chicago,” Pritzker said during a Loop news conference alongside Mayor Brandon Johnson, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton.\n\n“If someone flings a sandwich at an ICE agent, Trump will try and go on TV and declare an emergency in Chicago,” Pritzker said. “I’m imploring everyone: If and when that happens, do not take the bait.”\n\nPritzker said his office has reason to believe the raids are being prompted by Mexican Independence Day festivities taking place in Chicago — and that the Trump administration may have already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office reportedly denied that.\n\nRegardless of the scale of the federal presence that does arrive, local leaders called on the public to record the stepped-up ICE activities they might see in their neighborhoods this month — and to protest them. But Pritzker and company stressed the need to keep the peace as Trump paints a skewed picture of a city in crisis.\n\n“None of this is about fighting crime or making Chicago safer. None of it. For Trump, it’s about testing his power and producing a political drama to cover up for his corruption,” Pritzker said.\n\nExperts who study Chicago’s crime patterns said the plan amounts to a stunt that will likely have little impact and could be “a recipe for disaster.”\n\n“If you deploy federal troops to these hot spot neighborhoods and individuals in these neighborhoods begin to see themselves as being occupied by a military force, so to speak, the small number of federal troops would not be anywhere near enough to deal with any type of pushback or any type of conflict [with] armed gang members,” said Lance Williams, a professor at Northeastern Illinois University.\n\n‘Purely performative’\n\nPritzker said that his office had finally gotten direct word from ICE leaders that the agency would be stepping up enforcement in Chicago this week, as border czar Tom Homan said in a press conference last week.\n\nAgents with the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to be housed at Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago this month.\n\nPritzker wouldn’t identify sources who have told his office the Texas National Guard was preparing for deployment, but he called them “patriotic Americans who either work in the administration or work in the various branches of the military.”\n\nThe same goes for intelligence that immigration raids this month are being timed to exploit large Latino gatherings centered around Mexican Independence Day.\n\n“It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades,” Pritzker said. “The terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.”\n\nTrump has instituted an unprecedented law enforcement takeover with the National Guard in Washington D.C. But Trump has direct legal control in the capital that he doesn’t have in states — unless there’s threat of a foreign invasion, a domestic rebellion or if the president “is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,” according to federal law governing National Guard service.\n\n“The president’s plan is not about fighting crime. It’s purely performative,” Raoul said. “He is hoping to sow chaos by inciting out of control protests. In Chicago, we have demonstrated that we can protest peacefully.”\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Dick Durbin called Trump’s Chicago plan “yet another dangerous, illegal and unconstitutional abuse of power” by the president.\n\n“He ignores the reality that violent crime is down in the District of Columbia and in Chicago. And he ignores the fact that under our Constitution, the power to maintain law and order belongs to the states,” Durbin said.\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth called it an “unwarranted, unwanted and unjust move straight out of the authoritarian’s playbook that will only undermine our military’s readiness and ultimately weaken our national security.”\n\nCity leaders call for help – but not the National Guard\n\nJohnson reiterated that Chicago does “not want or need military occupation in our city” — but he welcomed with open arms additional federal assistance in tracking down the traffickers who funnel weapons into the city from states with more lax gun laws.\n\n“Chicago will continue to have a violence problem as long as red states continue to have a gun problem. Shootings will continue as long as this presidential administration continues to put politics over people,” Johnson said.\n\nTwo City Council members scoffed at Trump’s plan to target Chicago, but said they would welcome more federal agents who can work with the understaffed Chicago Police Department on gun and drug investigations.\n\n“Those are the type of partnerships we need and the support we need right now from the federal government,” said Ald. David Moore (17th), whose South Side ward includes Englewood, Auburn Gresham and Marquette Park.\n\n“Along with when we’re talking about fighting crime,” Moore added, “it’s financial resources that this [Trump] administration has to be willing to put up, too.”\n\nMoore said he’s not completely averse to National Guard troops coming to Chicago, but he argued they should come at the city’s request.\n\nAld. Matt Martin (47th) said it’s “not good enough” that crime has fallen as he reflected on “an incredibly painful weekend for not just the victims and their loved ones, but also the entire communities that have been touched by that horrific violence.”\n\n“People don’t live their day-to-day in stats,” said Martin, chair of the council’s Ethics Committee. “We’re still nowhere near where we need to be.”\n\nShoot-out in Pilsen kills beloved resident\n\nResidents in Pilsen say the Southwest Side neighborhood “was like a war zone” early Sunday.\n\nA gunman opened fire after being kicked out of a party in an alley in the 1900 block of West 17th Street, setting off a gunfight. More than 50 rounds were fired from four guns, and three men were struck, according to a police report.\n\nPepe, who some neighbors thought was homeless, was hit multiple times, officials said. The 46-year-old was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Hospital, but he hasn’t yet been formally identified.\n\n“He was one of the sweetest guys. He would never harm anyone,” said Gabriel, a man who often saw Pepe and was at his nearby home when the shooting erupted.\n\nGabriel said neighbors often fed Pepe and tried to look out for him, though he preferred to spend his time walking alone.\n\nTwo men who argued with the gunman, ages 41 and 43, were each shot in their legs, police said. They were taken to Mount Sinai in good condition.\n\nPolice detained a concealed carry permit holder who admitted he fired back at the gunman. He was released without being charged.\n\n“This part of the neighborhood is pretty calm, but now this makes you think twice about leaving your home,” Gabriel said. “There’s a lot of older people like my parents who like to sit outside. They should be able to do that and be safe.”\n\nTrump’s plan a political stunt, expert says\n\nWesley Skogan, a crime and policing expert and former Northwestern University professor, said about 55% of gun-related homicides happen in just 10% of the city’s neighborhoods — the same areas where violence broke out this weekend.\n\nHowever, Skogan noted that there has also been a drop in violence in those hot spots.\n\nAs of Sunday, overall crime was down 13% compared to last year, according to police data. Murders and shootings have fallen even further, 31% and 35% respectively.\n\nSkogan said Trump’s plan to send federal agents and the National Guard to Chicago amounts to a political stunt, given that the guard personnel Trump recently deployed to Washington, D.C., have been patrolling “the safest areas in the city.”\n\n“They’re in places where television cameras can find them and tourists can take their pictures,” he said. “And so I anticipate that the same thing is going to happen in Chicago.”\n\nTina Sfondeles contributed from Washington.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2025/09/02/donald-trump-national-guard-deployment-chicago-jb-pritzker-brandon-johnson-crime","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07cf606/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5998x4001+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2Fb7%2Faf7d9d2441dab019588f20931135%2Fpritz","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:36:05","author":"Anna Savchenko | Wbez,Cindy Hernandez,Mariah Woelfel | Wbez,Mitchell Armentrout,Tom Schuba","authors":["Anna Savchenko | Wbez","Cindy Hernandez","Mariah Woelfel | Wbez","Mitchell Armentrout","Tom Schuba"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":356858568,"title":"Trump ‘Very Disappointed’ With Putin, Says Russia-Ukraine War ‘Makes No Sense'","text":"US President Donald Trump, in a recent phone interview with CNN’s Scott Jennings, expressed his disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the lack of progress in resolving the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The two leaders last met during a bilateral meeting in Alaska on August 15, their first official meeting since Trump assumed the presidency in January.\nAlthough Trump praised his relationship with Putin, he did not hide his dissatisfaction with the situation on the ground. “Very disappointed. Thousands of people are dying. They’re not Americans that are dying, but they’re Russians and they’re Ukrainians, and there’s thousands, and it’s a war that makes no sense,” Trump said during the conversation.\nTrump again reiterated his long-standing claim that the conflict could have been prevented entirely had he been in office in 2022. “And it would have never started if I were president, and that’s what bothers me even more, because the election was totally rigged,” he stated.\nAsked about the latest meeting between Putin and Xi during the show, Trump shrugged off the idea of a threatening alliance, stating he wasn’t concerned about an “axis” targeting the US.\n\n??TRUMP tells me he is “disappointed” in PUTIN and that he will be “doing something to help people live.”\nWatch the full interview on THE SCOTT JENNINGS RADIO SHOW at 2-3PM eastern on SALEM and streaming right here on X ? pic.twitter.com/BTtLJzq9ox\n— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY) September 2, 2025\n\nIn August, Trump publicly extended a deadline for Putin, allowing him “a couple of weeks” to initiate talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “We’ll see what happens,” Trump said at the time. “I think in two weeks, we’ll know which way I’m going, because I’m going to go one way or the other, and they’ll learn which way.”\nHowever, Trump did not elaborate on what specific actions he might take against Russia for missing the deadline to hold peace talks with Zelenskyy. The agreed timeframe expired on Monday without any indication of progress.\nFollowing the August 15 Alaska summit, Trump invited President Zelenskyy and European Union leaders to the White House for further discussions. During the meeting on August 18, it was agreed that Putin would meet with Zelenskyy within the next two weeks, an expectation that now remains unfulfilled.\nMeanwhile, President Putin is currently in China, attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit and the China Military Parade. During his visit, he held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, in which he reportedly briefed him on his discussions with Trump during their Alaska meeting.","summary":"In August, Trump publicly extended a deadline for Putin, allowing him “a couple of weeks” to initiate talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-very-disappointed-with-putin-says-russia-ukraine-war-makes-no-sense-ws-l-9545187.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/putin-trump-2025-08-e14b1980d8f7cc991f48df034db01fdd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:35:33","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.536},{"id":356862726,"title":"Countries will not come to the table if the President doesn't have authority to create trade deals, says former deputy US trade representative","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nKudlow September 02, 2025 06:01 \n\n Countries will not come to the table if the President doesn't have authority to create trade deals, says former deputy US trade representative \n Former deputy US trade representative Jeff Gerrish weighs in on the federal appeals court blocking President Donald Trump's tariffs on 'Kudlow.'\n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSKUDLOWKUDLOW | LATEST EPISODESV-VIDEOSPOLITICS","summary":"Former deputy US trade representative Jeff Gerrish weighs in on the federal appeals court blocking President Donald Trump&apos;s tariffs on &apos;Kudlow.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6378219608112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/a951b333-375a-4efa-9e20-ac23f3576fd9/7235305f-fe76-4da2-832e-5552161277dc/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:35:31","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":356862688,"title":"Bill to sanction Chinese officials who avoid action on fentanyl passes US House","text":"A bipartisan bill that would impose sanctions on Chinese officials who intentionally avoid taking action to prevent the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids passed the US House of Representatives on Tuesday.\nThe proposed Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act passed 407-4 on lawmakers’ first day back in Washington following a month-long recess, with only a few Democrats opposing it. This comes as the two countries are preparing for their next round of trade talks, to be held before November 10 when a 90-day tariff truce expires and likely before a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nThe legislation, sponsored by Representative Andy Barr of Kentucky with seven other Republicans and one Democrat, would also make it easier to impose sanctions on Chinese manufacturers and distributors of fentanyl that fail to take “credible steps” to prevent or detect opioid trafficking. These steps include implementing “know-your-customer” procedures and cooperation with US counter-narcotics efforts.\n“We must attack the production of fentanyl by targeting the source of precursors in China: Chinese producers of synthetic opioids and opioid precursors and senior government and Chinese political officials,” Barr said on the House floor on Tuesday.\nRepresentative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed support for the bill on Tuesday while saying that the US “cannot sanction our way out of the fentanyl crisis”.\n“We need the active partnership of law enforcement in nations like China and Mexico,” he said, adding that while “tough talk has its place”, effective diplomacy was “indispensable”.\nTo become law, the bill would have to pass the Republican-controlled Senate and get Trump’s signature. In 2023, during Democratic control of the Senate and the presidency, the House cleared a similar bill that ultimately failed to become law.\nIn June, Beijing took a series of steps on counter-narcotics after Washington’s demands for stronger action on fentanyl, a long-standing irritant in the bilateral relationship that Trump has discussed directly with Xi.\n\nStarting in February, Trump imposed two rounds of tariff increases on Chinese imports over Beijing’s alleged failure to curb the flow of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of the synthetic opioid, which has caused hundreds of thousands of US deaths. Those tariffs, which amounted to 20 per cent, remained in effect despite a trade truce reached in Geneva in May that was extended last month.\nBeijing has defended its drug control record and accused Washington of using the fentanyl issue as leverage, saying the matter could only be addressed on the basis of mutual respect.\nTrump said in July that China was taking “big steps” in controlling fentanyl. Yet last week, his administration called on American banks and other financial institutions to step up monitoring of suspected Chinese money-laundering networks it says fuel US fentanyl addiction.\nThe House on Tuesday also passed multiple other bills related to countering Chinese competition and influence, including one to curb the flow of goods and technologies capable of supporting the construction of undersea cables to foreign adversaries.\nAnother, which passed by voice vote, would authorise US$250,000 per year for three years for the State Department to support human rights advocates working on behalf of Uygurs and other minorities in China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.\nVersions of both bills had cleared the House in a previous congressional session but failed to become law.\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"A bipartisan bill that would impose sanctions on Chinese officials who intentionally avoid taking action to prevent the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids passed the US House of Representatives on Tuesday.\nThe proposed Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act passed 407-4 on lawmakers’ first day back in Washington following a month-long recess, with only a few Democrats opposing it.

Both Rachel and Brendyn felt there was no way forward for them.\n'Rachel recently took herself to Marbella with her two daughters to get some much-needed headspace, and Brendyn and his young son have now moved out of the family home into a flat.\n'There is still a lot of affection there, and no regrets. But it isn't easy trying to make a blended family run seamlessly and in the end, tensions between Rachel and Brendyn got too much and they don't ever want to row in front of their kids who remain their priority.'\nThe Daily Mail has contacted Rachel and Brendyn's representatives for comment. \nIn January, Rachel called Brendyn her 'soulmate and love' in a rare Instagram post featuring pictures of the pair.\nRachel added a caption reading: 'Celebrating my ❤️ @brendynhatfield today.

And everything is new, and it all just kind of happens.'\nShe added: 'It all just evolves and it's not black and white, it's just an amazing growth experience.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRachel Stevens SPLITS from Dancing On Ice boyfriend Brendyn Hatfield after three years of dating\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

For one thing, voting for redistricting is almost as critical as voting for a president. It impacts the entire nation, not just Californians.\n\nDonald Trump’s control of Congress inflicts incredible horrors upon the values of rational citizens. It is not just any off-year election, but the difference between another two years of unfettered Trump rule and the hope of lessening his influence to protect our freedoms.\n\nThe most rational threat to the passage of redistricting is the moral question of supporting gerrymandering to achieve neutrality in the congressional districts after the Texas redistricting debacle.\n\nSupport the redistricting because it is a prime e-xample of the ends justifying the means. Vote “yes” as a big step toward controlling Trump.\n\nMinority representation\nis a lie in this state\n\nRe: “Political ads over map fight heating up” (Page A1, Aug. 29).\n\nThose on the left in California who support Gov.

Hypocrisy.\n\nNick Waranoff\n\nNewsom’s theatrics\na sign of desperation\n\nI think Gavin Newsom is acting desperate, seeing his lifelong dream of the presidency being vaporized by President Trump.\n\nBeing a Democrat politician in California is easy. Being a lifelong California Democrat politician running for president is much more difficult because the lifelong Democrat politician must now run on their record of accomplishments to lure the small percentage of swing and independent voters who will decide who will become our next president to vote for them. It seems to me that this is why Newsom is acting out with his arm-waving, ranting speeches and Trump-like tweets because he doesn’t have much in the way of accomplishments to sell.\n\nIt seems to me Newsom would be better served by keeping his hands in his pockets, keeping his mouth shut and spending the next 12 months actually building a résumé of real California accomplishments to sell to the rest of the country.\n\nGender care for youth\nneeds further study\n\nRe: “Handmade cards from classmates comfort a girl wounded in Minneapolis church shooting, aunt says” (Aug. 30).\n\nI am really concerned about school shootings, especially after the latest one in Minneapolis. I am also concerned about the shooter identifying as trans and receiving gender-affirming care as a minor.\n\nI have no problem with adults receiving gender-affirming care. In fact, I know transgender people, and some are my friends. However, I worry about underage people with developing bodies receiving hormone blockers and other gender-affirming drugs.\n\nI feel we should study the effects of those drugs more before giving them to underage people.\n\nMarianne Haas\n\nStop Trump’s attacks on\nUS Indigenous students\n\nIt is shameful when Donald Trump’s Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, threatens to strip the state of New York’s school funding over its ban on mascots that are degrading toward American Indian students.

It has subsidized education and health care while we have neither and are shouldering a debt of over $37 trillion. Yet, we continue to unquestionably fund its unrelenting slaughter of innocent women and children — a disgraceful crime against humanity. At the same time, we are stripping ourselves of our First Amendment rights at the behest of this rogue nation.\n\nIsrael is not a valuable ally; it is an albatross around our neck. We need more honest public discussion.\n\nForrest Cioppa","summary":"Also: Minority representation &#124; Desperation &#124; Further study &#124; Indigenous students &#124; Re-evaluate ally.

Kennedy Jr. get all the credit for undermining the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and rendering everyone utterly confused as to who still qualifies for the shot, President Donald Trump decided to weigh in on the hot-button issue. \n\nYou will not be surprised to learn that this did not make things any better. On Sunday, over on Truth Social, Trump lamented that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is being “ripped apart” over the question of COVID vaccine safety. Sort of an odd complaint coming from the person who appointed Kennedy, whose entire reason for existence is based on getting rid of vaccines based on unhinged conspiracy theories. What, exactly, did Trump expect?\n\nThe genius in the Oval Office claims the real problem is that drug companies have never shown the public that the vaccines are safe. \n\n“I have been shown information from Pfizer, and others, that is extraordinary, but they never seem to show those results to the public. Why not???” he blathered. “They go off to the next ‘hunt’ and let everyone rip themselves apart, including Bobby Kennedy Jr. and CDC, trying to figure out the success or failure of the Drug Companies Covid work.”\n\nRelated | RFK Jr. is so mad that real doctors don’t have to listen to him\n\nThere’s an awful lot to unpack here. Trump seems to be saying that he, and he alone, has been shown information from Pfizer about the safety of the vaccine. Couldn’t Trump just show it to the rest of us? And as far as the complaint that Kennedy and the CDC can’t figure out if the vaccine was a success, have they considered looking at literally any scientific data?\n\nPerhaps poor beleaguered Bobby Kennedy Jr. could start with, say, looking at data published over at the National Library of Medicine. That would be pretty convenient, given that it is hosted on the website of the National Institutes of Health, an agency that just happens to be part of HHS, overseen by one Bobby Kennedy. \n\nHere’s a comprehensive review of the side effects and efficacy of four different COVID vaccines. Here’s a CDC page about vaccine reactions and adverse events for Pfizer’s vaccine. Here’s one on evaluating booster doses. Here’s a lengthy page on the CDC’s website discussing 13 different vaccine safety studies and helpfully summarizing the level of vaccine effectiveness in tables so that Trump wouldn’t have to actually read anything. \n\nBut wait, you might say. Those are just studies, not something directly from Pfizer. Doesn’t Pfizer owe us all an explanation, hmm? Well, for the layperson, Pfizer’s website has extensive debunking of misinformation regarding the safety of its COVID-19 vaccine, a thing they would not need to do if people like Kennedy were not currently overseeing the CDC. Or head on over to Pfizer’s clinical trials page and search by “Comirnaty,” the name of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. You’ll get a list of all their trials with links where you can download all the study data … links that are also helpfully available on, you guessed it, the government’s own clinical trials website. Here are Moderna’s clinical trials, some of which are still active. \n\nThe problem for Trump is that he was president for most of Operation Warp Speed, the massive public-private effort that led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines far quicker than expected. Trump ate that up, bragging in December 2020 that “Before Operation Warp Speed, the typical timeframe for development and approval, as you know, could be infinity. And we were very, very happy that we were able to get things done at a level that nobody has ever seen before. The gold standard vaccine has been done in less than nine months.”\n\nSince Trump likes the legacy of being the fastest and bestest, he can’t really throw out the whole idea of COVID-19 vaccines the way true anti-vax conspiracists like Kennedy can. So, it has to be the fault of nefarious pharma companies that lied to the government or hid all their bad vaccine results.\n\n“They show me GREAT numbers and results, but they don’t seem to be showing them to many others,” he claimed. “I want them to show them NOW, to CDC and the public, and clear up this MESS, one way or the other!!! I hope OPERATION WARP SPEED was as ‘BRILLIANT’ as many say it was.”\n\nTrump can’t have it both ways, but he is certainly going to try. Even he knows that things are not looking good for Kennedy or the CDC right now. The firing of Susan Monarez, who Trump himself nominated for CDC director but who Kennedy later found insufficiently unhinged regarding vaccine conspiracies, was a haphazard mess. Actual medical professionals keep coming forward to explain that people do actually still need to get the COVID-19 vaccine, leading Kennedy to declare that pediatricians are all in the pocket of Big Pharma. \n\nSomehow, it doesn’t seem like this will be fixed by Pfizer sending Trump clinical trial results, given that the man won’t even read a one-page memo. At least we’ll get to watch both Trump and Kennedy step on rake after rake, but that’s cold comfort without widespread access to lifesaving, necessary vaccines.","summary":"Not content to let Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

What, exactly, did Trump expect?\n\n\n\nThe genius in the Oval Office claims the real problem is that drug companies have never shown the public that the vaccines are safe. \n\n\n\n“I have been shown information from Pfizer, and others, that is extraordinary, but they never seem to show those resul","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/9/2/2341512/-Trump-manages-to-make-COVID-vaccine-rhetoric-even-stupider?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1474074/story_image/AP21077115552583.jpg?1756850034","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:30:09","author":"Lisa Needham","authors":["Lisa Needham"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.511},{"id":356854860,"title":"Vinyl, CDs and Cassettes safe from new US Tariffs – US customs confirms","text":"Physical music formats such as vinyl records, CDs and cassettes are exempt from the new US tariffs that took effect on Friday, August 29, United States Customs and Border Protection confirmed.\n\nThe agency said these items qualify as “information materials” and are therefore excluded from the trade restrictions, providing relief to record collectors, independent sellers and music retailers.\n\nThe exemption comes as part of wider changes to the so called ‘de minimis’ rule, which previously allowed low value packages to enter the United States duty free.\n\nUnder the old standard, packages valued at $800 or less were not subject to taxes or tariffs.\n\nThat threshold was raised from $200 to $800 by Congress in 2016, and critics said the higher limit had become a conduit for illicit shipments.\n\nCustoms says ‘de minimis’ shipments ballooned to 1.36 billion packages in 2024, up from 134 million in 2015.\n\nThe agency added that last year these shipments accounted for 98 percent of narcotics seizures by case count, 97 percent of counterfeit goods seized, and 77 percent of health and safety related seizures.\n\nIn July, President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending duty free treatment for de minimis shipments, and the new rules took effect at the end of August.\n\nStill, Customs clarifies that physical music media fall under 50 U.S.C. section 1702(b), which exempts certain donations and informational materials from trade restrictions.\n\nThe United States Harmonized Tariff Schedule also lists “phonograph records, tapes, compact disks, CD ROMs” among the categories considered informational materials.\n\nIndustry platforms reacted quickly. Discogs said, “Simply put, music and informational media have always been exempt from tariffs and continue to be so at this time.\n\nThis means neither sellers nor collectors on Discogs should be charged additional customs fees.” The marketplace warned, however, that implementation may vary, and it advised sellers to describe items precisely on customs forms.\n\nDiscogs suggested using descriptions such as Informational Materials: phonograph (vinyl) record rather than simply saying vinyl.\n\nBandcamp issued guidance of its own. Because the platform sells both music and non-music merchandise, it added features that let sellers limit or block shipping to the United States to avoid customs headaches.\n\nBoth Bandcamp and Discogs urged sellers to use the correct Harmonized System codes when completing paperwork.\n\nNot all consequences of the tariff changes are neutral.\n\nCNBC reported that trade lawyer Marianne Rowden estimates the added costs to small and medium sized businesses could exceed $71 billion.\n\nSeveral international postal services and couriers have already paused certain shipments bound for the US, including Swiss Post, Japan Post, Australia Post, India Post, New Zealand Post, Royal Mail in the UK, and DHL operations in Germany.\n\nAndrew Williams, CEO for DHL Express Americas, told CNBC, “For shippers, this brings increased costs, complexity, and the need to adapt shipping setups to comply with new customs requirements.\n\nThey may also face longer processing times and additional administrative steps when importing lower value goods.”\n\nThe timing of the waiver for physical music is critical for the recorded music market. Vinyl remains the dominant physical format.\n\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America, vinyl sales rose for an 18th consecutive year in 2024, generating $1.4 billion and accounting for nearly three quarters of physical music revenue.\n\nVinyl unit sales outpaced CDs for the third year in a row, with 44 million vinyl albums sold versus 33 million CDs, while total physical revenues hit $2 billion.\n\nThe legal landscape is shifting too. On Friday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled against the administration’s earlier emergency tariff declarations.\n\nPresident Trump reacted on Truth Social, writing, “Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end.\n\nIf these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong.”\n\nMarket analysts observed that the impact on streaming and digital music will likely be limited.\n\nTD Cowen said digital goods are unaffected by the tariffs, and that subscription streaming revenues at major labels and platforms would probably not see major disruption even if consumer spending softens.\n\nFor collectors and indie sellers the bottom line is cautious relief. Music Business Worldwide reported that physical music formats retain protection as informational materials, but it also noted continued uncertainty about how customs and carriers will apply the rules in practice.\n\nSellers are being urged to label shipments carefully, preserve clear product descriptions, and stay alert to carrier updates as the new de minimis regime rolls out.","summary":"Physical music formats such as vinyl records, CDs and cassettes are exempt from the new US tariffs that took effect on Friday, August 29, United States Customs and Border Protection confirmed.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/vinyl-cds-and-cassettes-safe-from-new-us-tariffs-us-customs-confirms/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250828_us_tariff_changes_2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:28:35","author":"Napoleon Ato Kittoe,Sarah Djosu","authors":["Napoleon Ato Kittoe","Sarah Djosu"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":356861242,"title":"Not even Fox News can spin Trump’s biggest grift yet","text":"The hosts of Fox Business had a lot on their plate Tuesday, discussing a Wall Street Journal report about the Trump family’s new World Liberty Financial crypto scheme—which is now their most valuable asset, outpacing all of their property interests.\n\n“He is the crypto president,” Fox Business reporter Lauren Simonetti said. “The first one ever.

The total sign-ups fell approximately 116,000 short of last year's sign-ups, and 106,000 below Amazon's target goal for the year, marking an approximately 2 percent decline in both. \n\nDuring the four-day Prime Day period, Amazon signed up 1.6 million Prime users, which exceeded the company's internal target by 6 percent, according to Reuters. \n\nBut it failed to hit its targets in the three weeks leading up to the Prime Day event, according to the same data. \n\nThe analysis provides a rare look into Amazon's generally closely guarded Prime data. \n\nDespite Reuter's analysis, Amazon still celebrated its \"record breaking\" number of enrollments. \n\n\"Prime membership continues to show strong growth and customer engagement in the U.S. and internationally,\" the company said in a statement to the outlet. \n\nPrime Day is typically considered Amazon's biggest event outside of the holiday shopping season. Sources who spoke to Reuters said that subscriptions typically dwindle after the discounted deals disappear. Those sources chose not to be identified as they aren't authorized to discuss Amazon's business data.\n\nPart of what may be drawing customers away from Prime is the growing number of competitors in the retail space that also offer fast, cheap shipping via online marketplaces. Walmart is chief among those competitors, which has its own membership program also offering deals, perks, and fast delivery. \n\nThe other factor likely dissuading Americans from signing up for Prime is the growing cost of staples caused by inflation and President Donald Trump's tariffs. \n\nAccording to Reuters, Wall Street analysts expected that Prime Day would experience a lull this year due to the pressure on Americans' wallets, but Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy told analysts in July that Prime Day was the company's \"biggest ever.\" \n\nHe said the company had record sales, record items sold, and record sign-ups, and insisted that Amazon's customers saved \"billions of dollars\" by using Prime. \n\nOne method Amazon is taking in an attempt to drive up Prime subscriptions is by limiting the sharing of Prime accounts outside households. According to a company statement on Monday, beginning in October, Prime users will have to live in the same household in order to share accounts.","summary":"Total sign-ups fell approximately 116,000 short of last year's sign-ups, and 106,000 below Amazon's target goal for the year","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/amazon-prime-day-us-customers-b2818870.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/15/Earns_Amazon_95703.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/RNubgMR0-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:21:53","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":356862628,"title":"US House Committee Releases Batch Of 'Epstein Files'","text":"A US House of Representatives committee released a first batch of documents on Tuesday from the investigation into notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.More than 33,000 pages of records related to Epstein were uploaded to a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform website after being handed over by the Justice Department.\"We're in the process of uploading those documents for full transparency so everyone in America can see those documents,\" committee chairman James Comer said.\"It's going as quick as we can get them uploaded,\" Comer told reporters. \"We want those to be public as soon as possible.\"Comer's committee had subpoenaed the Justice Department for the documents and a first batch of records was turned over last month.It was not immediately clear what is new in the batch of documents released on Tuesday.

(Donald Trump/Truth Social)\nWASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said that US forces had attacked a boat carrying drugs to the United States Tuesday, killing 11 \"narcoterrorists\" from a gang he alleged was controlled by leftist Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\nTrump posted a video online of an open-topped speedboat carrying a number of people travelling on a body of water before it exploded in a ball of flames.\nThe move is a potentially significant escalation in the standoff between Caracas and Washington, after the US deployed eight warships to Latin America in what it bills as a war on drug trafficking.\nTrump initially announced at the White House that US forces had \"shot out a boat... a drug carrying boat, lots of drugs in that boat\" without giving details.\nThe Republican later posted a statement about the strike on his Truth Social network, along with the black and white video of the exploding boat.\n\"Earlier this morning, on my Orders, US Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists,\" Trump said, without specifying the weapon used.\n\"The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States.
