If you can't find waste in Washington, there can only be one reason: you didn't look,\" Ernst wrote, according to Fox News.Senator Joni Ernst utilised X platform to outline 22 straightforward measures to eliminate over \"$2 trillion of waste\" in Washington. She additionally highlighted that the Pentagon squanders $125 billion through administrative inefficiencies.— SenJoniErnst (@SenJoniErnst) According to Wall Street Journal, the fiscal year ending September 30, the US federal government's expenditure reached $6.75 trillion, as the Congressional Budget Office reported. To contextualise this figure, distributing $20,000 to each of the 337 million U.S. residents would approximate this spending amount.Whilst Congress traditionally controls federal spending, Trump has indicated interest in altering this arrangement. A significant portion of US government expenditure is classified as mandatory, comprising benefits distributed without annual congressional approval.The largest expenditures involve healthcare provision and retirement benefits. According to recent CBO estimates, Social Security payments totalled $1.45 trillion in the last fiscal year, whilst Medicare and Medicaid combined reached $1.49 trillion.Trump has committed to maintaining Social Security and Medicare benefits. Although Medicaid might face reductions, such changes could prove politically challenging. CBO projections for fiscal 2024 indicate 56% of Medicaid benefits will support aged, blind and disabled recipients. Numerous nursing facilities rely substantially on this programme.Mandatory spending has consistently increased, driven by healthcare cost inflation and demographic shifts towards an ageing population. These expenditures represented nearly 15% of US GDP last year, compared to approximately 10% twenty years prior. This upward trajectory is expected to continue.Additional mandatory expenditures include military and federal employee pensions, alongside state support for foster care and adoption services.Beyond mandatory spending, interest payments on national debt reached approximately $950 billion last year. Combined mandatory spending and interest payments constitute roughly three-quarters of federal expenditure.The remaining discretionary spending, subject to annual congressional approval, comprises two main categories. Defence spending, covering equipment maintenance, procurement, and personnel costs for 1.4 million service members, totalled about $850 billion according to June CBO estimates, as per WSJ.Nondefence discretionary spending, encompassing various programmes including Nasa, agricultural support, and housing assistance, amounted to approximately $950 billion.Spending reduction efforts typically target nondefence discretionary categories, which represent roughly 14% of total federal expenditure.Musk and Ramaswamy suggest potential savings through federal workforce reduction. However, total federal employee compensation, including benefits, amounted to $384 billion last year, reaching $584 billion when including military personnel.Earlier, Ramaswamy called the expenditure on programs which is going to expire or are no longer authorized but still receive appropriations \"nuts.\"— VivekGRamaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) \"We shouldn’t let the government spend money on programs that have expired. Yet that’s exactly what happens today: half a *trillion* dollars of taxpayer funds ($516 B+) goes each year to programs which Congress has allowed to expire. There are 1,200+ programs that are no longer authorized but still receive appropriations. This is totally nuts. We can & should save hundreds of billions each year by defunding government programs that Congress no longer authorizes. We’ll challenge any politician who disagrees to defend the other side,\" he said in a tweet on X. The executive branch employs approximately 2.3 million civilian workers, excluding postal service employees, with Veterans Affairs accounting for about one-fifth of this workforce.A substantial portion of federal spending provides benefits directly or indirectly to Americans, funded partly through worker contributions. Monthly, about 73 million people receive various Social Security benefits, while approximately 68 million use Medicare and 72 million access Medicaid.Government procurement significantly impacts various sectors, from defence contractors to housing assistance providers and research institutions.Tax revenue, totalling $4.92 trillion, fell short of expenditure, resulting in a $1.83 trillion deficit, equivalent to 6.4% of GDP.Historically, larger deficit-to-GDP ratios occurred primarily during extraordinary circumstances, such as World War II or the 2020 pandemic, when it reached nearly 15%. CBO projections indicate mandatory spending will increase by over $2 trillion in the next decade, with interest payments expected to double.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senator-ernst-sends-letters-to-musk-ramaswamy-pitching-1-trillion-in-spending-cuts/articleshow/115712877.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115713421/115713421.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 01:15:59","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":267896462,"title":"Us Largest Trade Partners Mexico Canada And China Respond To Trumps Tariff Threat","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, drawing swift condemnation from all three countries. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he will implement a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports immediately after taking office on January 20.Trump claims that the tariffs aim to curb the flow of fentanyl, illegal drugs, and migrants into the United States. However, critics argue the plan risks violating the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a trade deal Trump himself negotiated and signed into law in 2020. Trump’s post said: \"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long-simmering problem\"\"It is time for them to pay a very big price!\" He also claimed in another post that China has not stopped the smuggling of fentanyl into the US.Trump often uses trade threats to gain an upper hand in negotiations, but experts warn this strategy could backfire. It might increase inflation and disrupt supply chains in markets that are closely connected, as reported by USA Today.China: 'No one wins a trade war'China was quick to respond to Trump’s tariff plan. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, dismissed Trump’s accusation that Beijing has failed to curb the smuggling of fentanyl precursors. \"The idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality,\" Liu said. \"No one will win a trade war or a tariff war,\" he added.Trump has often targeted China with trade policies, imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods during his first term. Experts believe his new plan could restart tensions and hurt the economy. While the tariffs focus on migration and drugs, some think the real goal is to limit China’s influence in North America.Andrew Law, founder of The Mexico Brief, said, “Trump sees an opening to push China further out of America’s backyard. This is less a policy declaration than a move to stir up trouble among bickering allies.”Canada: 'Devastating for workers'Canada, one of the United States' largest trading partners, also raised concerns. Ontario Premier Doug Ford warned the tariffs would harm jobs and workers in both countries.Oil is Canada’s top export to the United States, while the US heavily relies on Canadian-produced goods like auto parts. Trump’s proposed tariffs risk straining an economic relationship that, in 2022, saw trade between the two countries top $790 billion.Ford added that industries like automobile manufacturing, which depend on seamless cross-border supply chains, would be particularly hard hit. For instance, components for cars assembled in the US often cross the border multiple times during production.Experts warn that disrupting these ties could raise prices for consumers and put thousands of jobs at risk. Trump, however, seems firm, claiming tariffs will push Canada to tackle migration and drug issues.Mexico: 'Response to one tariff will be another'Mexico, a key US trading partner with over $855 billion in annual trade, may be hit hardest by Trump’s tariffs. President Claudia Sheinbaum criticised the plan, saying it would harm both economies.\"The response to one tariff will be another until we put at risk companies that we share,\" Sheinbaum said. She brought attention to the potential fallout for US firms like General Motors and Ford, which operate assembly plants in Mexico.Sheinbaum emphasised her country’s efforts to address migration, citing a “holistic approach” that has reduced US border encounters by over 75% since last December. She also suggested that US drug issues, particularly the fentanyl crisis, are public health problems requiring domestic solutions.Despite her criticism, Sheinbaum expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with the incoming Trump administration. \"Why put a tax on them that will put them at risk? It’s not acceptable,\" she said, calling for a collective approach to tackle shared challenges.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-largest-trade-partners-mexico-canada-and-china-respond-to-trumps-tariff-threat/articleshow/115712859.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115713601/115713601.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 01:15:59","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.134},{"id":267896382,"title":"Canada Bc Need To Show Americans That Tariffs Are A Bad Idea Ubc Analyst 7672544","text":"Keep calm and make the case for trading on.\n\nThat's the advice from one B.C. analyst after U.S. president-elect Donald Trump threatened Canada and Mexico with 25 per cent tariffs starting on Jan. 20 unless both countries make changes to their respective border security. \n\nBut other analysts are less optimistic about Canada's ability to influence American behaviour and all voices broadly agree tariffs would hurt British Columbia.\n\nUniversity of B.C. political scientist Stewart Prest, who studies U.S.-Canada relations, warns against panic.\n\n\"We have been down this road before,\" he said. \"The story is playing out differently, but the sort of underlying tune is familiar — unpredictability, sudden proclamations, requiring rapid actions.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s commitment to a “reset” in UK-EU relations aims to foster closer cooperation on trade, security, and border policies while maintaining the integrity of Brexit. This strategic move offers a fresh opportunity to address lingering issues from the post-Brexit landscape and sets the stage for a more pragmatic and interest-driven approach to international cooperation.\n\nBeyond Brexit: Redefining cooperation\n\nWhile Starmer’s administration has ruled out reversing Brexit, the emphasis on a “reset” reflects a growing recognition that constructive engagement with the EU is vital for the UK’s economic and geopolitical interests. The new negotiator, tasked with overseeing key agreements such as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and the Windsor Framework, will play a crucial role in navigating the complexities of this relationship. This role, described as “high-profile” and “subject to significant public scrutiny,” underscores the importance of diplomacy in shaping the future of UK-EU interactions.\n\nUnlike the confrontational stance often associated with the early post-Brexit years, Starmer’s approach signals a shift toward a more cooperative, results-oriented diplomacy. His visit to Brussels and warm reception by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlight the potential for renewed dialogue and mutual understanding. By focusing on shared challenges such as climate change, defence, and migration, both parties can foster a relationship that goes beyond mere transactionalism, creating a framework for sustainable cooperation.\n\nEconomic dimensions: Toward a balanced model\n\nTrade remains central to the reset. The UK seeks a better deal than the one negotiated by Boris Johnson in 2020, with a focus on strengthening economic ties while safeguarding sovereignty. The negotiator’s role will involve navigating the digital Entry and Exit Scheme and other border policies, reflecting the practical challenges of post-Brexit trade. Effective management of these issues can enhance supply chain efficiency and reduce friction for businesses, fostering a more dynamic economic relationship.\n\nThe UK also faces broader strategic choices. US President-elect Donald Trump’s senior economic advisor, Stephen Moore, recently highlighted the UK’s position between the European economic model—characterized by social welfare and regulation—and the American model of free enterprise. While Moore suggested that aligning more closely with the US could boost economic growth, Starmer’s focus on European cooperation indicates a more balanced approach, seeking to leverage the UK’s unique position as a bridge between two economic powerhouses.\n\nMoreover, strengthening economic ties with the EU could bring significant benefits to the UK’s financial services sector, which has faced challenges since Brexit. The EU remains one of the UK’s largest trading partners, and any improvements in trade relations could boost exports, stabilize supply chains, and attract foreign investment. In a global economy increasingly defined by regional blocs, a pragmatic relationship with the EU could enhance the UK’s competitiveness and economic resilience.\n\nSecurity and border policy: Shared responsibilities\n\nBeyond trade, security and border policy are key components of the reset. The UK and EU face common threats, from terrorism to cyberattacks, making cooperation in these areas essential. Starmer’s emphasis on closer collaboration in defence and security signals an understanding that national security is inherently interconnected. A shared approach to border management, including the upcoming digital border schemes, will require sophisticated coordination to ensure both security and efficiency.\n\nMoreover, tackling irregular migration—a priority for both the UK and EU—necessitates joint efforts. Effective solutions will depend on policies that balance humanitarian responsibilities with the need for border security, reflecting a new form of pragmatic, interest-driven cooperation. The UK’s participation in Europol and other security frameworks, for instance, could be revisited to enhance information-sharing and joint operations. Such collaboration would demonstrate the practical benefits of working together on common challenges, moving beyond political rhetoric to deliver tangible results.\n\nDiplomacy in the spotlight: The role of the “Sherpa”\n\nThe new negotiator will serve as a “sherpa,” acting as the prime minister’s personal representative at international summits. This role involves not just managing negotiations but also shaping the broader diplomatic narrative. The UK’s approach to EU relations will be scrutinized globally, serving as a test case for how nations can redefine partnerships in an era of shifting alliances. \n\nThis high-profile position reflects the growing importance of bilateral and regional diplomacy in addressing global challenges. The negotiator’s success will depend on balancing domestic interests with the need for international collaboration, offering a model for other countries seeking to recalibrate their foreign policies.\n\nThe “sherpa” will also play a crucial role in ensuring that the UK’s voice is heard in EU policy making, even from outside the bloc. Engaging with EU leaders on issues such as climate policy, digital regulation, and energy security will require a nuanced understanding of European politics and a willingness to engage in dialogue. The UK’s ability to influence EU decisions from the outside could set a precedent for other non-EU countries seeking to maintain close ties with the bloc.\n\nA new model for international cooperation?\n\nThe UK’s reset with the EU symbolises a broader trend in global diplomacy: the move toward flexible, interest-based alliances. Traditional multilateral institutions have faced criticism for their inefficiency and inability to adapt to modern challenges. By prioritizing pragmatic cooperation, the UK-EU reset offers a blueprint for how nations can engage in more dynamic, responsive diplomacy.\n\nStarmer’s vision reflects the evolving nature of international cooperation—one that emphasizes shared interests, practical solutions, and national sovereignty. The success of this reset will depend on the ability to navigate complex issues, from trade to security, while fostering a spirit of partnership. If successful, it could mark the beginning of a new era in international relations, where cooperation is driven by mutual benefit rather than rigid institutional frameworks.\n\nLessons for global diplomacy\n\nThe UK’s approach to resetting its relationship with the EU offers valuable lessons for other nations navigating complex geopolitical landscapes. In an era where global institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization face growing skepticism, the emphasis on bilateral and regional cooperation highlights the potential for more flexible, results-oriented diplomacy.\n\nCountries facing similar challenges—such as Canada’s evolving relationship with the US or Japan’s strategic partnership with ASEAN—could look to the UK-EU reset as a model for balancing national interests with international engagement. The focus on pragmatic cooperation, rather than ideological alignment, reflects a broader trend in global politics, where nations are increasingly prioritizing strategic partnerships that deliver tangible benefits.\n\nConclusion: Shaping the future of cooperation\n\nThe UK’s reset with the EU is more than a diplomatic maneuver; it is a statement of intent about the future of international cooperation. By focusing on shared interests, pragmatic solutions, and flexible alliances, the UK can foster a relationship with the EU that benefits both parties. This reset offers a blueprint for other nations seeking to navigate the complexities of a multipolar world, where traditional alliances are being reshaped by new geopolitical realities.\n\nIf successful, the UK-EU reset could mark the beginning of a new era in global diplomacy—one where cooperation is driven by mutual interests, practical solutions, and a shared commitment to addressing common challenges. As the world watches, the UK’s approach to its relationship with the EU will serve as a test case for the future of international cooperation in the 21st century.\n\nDr Brian Reuben, the Executive Chairman of the Sixteenth Council and the Founder, Africa Economic Summit is an international business consultant","summary":"The United Kingdom’s decision to hire a new senior negotiator signals a pivotal moment in its relationship with the European\n\n\nread more The UK’s EU reset: A new chapter in international cooperation?","url":"https://businessday.ng/opinion/article/the-uks-eu-reset-a-new-chapter-in-international-cooperation/","image":"https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-7-2.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 01:10:17","author":"Brian Reuben","authors":["Brian Reuben"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.574},{"id":267896254,"title":"Gangster Disciples leader Larry Hoover's motion to disqualify judge based on 'frivolous' arguments, feds say","text":"Federal prosecutors say Gangster Disciples co-founder Larry Hoover’s effort to disqualify a judge from Hoover’s bid for a sentencing break is based on “frivolous” arguments and “factual inaccuracies.”\n\nAlthough they don’t take a position on the motion to disqualify filed by Hoover’s attorneys, prosecutors also said the motion contains “unsupported suggestions,” according to a response to the motion filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nThe motion to disqualify was filed after a court hearing in September. Defense attorneys Jennifer Bonjean and Justin Moore argued that U.S. District Judge John Blakey showed “actual bias” toward Hoover by asking the defense to consider “how many murders is he responsible for?”\n\nThey also called the question “wildly out of bounds” and pointed to news reports about it. They specifically highlighted the Sept. 27 front page of the Chicago Sun-Times, which quoted the judge over a photo of Hoover.\n\nAccording to the response filed Tuesday by prosecutors, the judge prefaced the question by noting that one of the government’s “key” arguments is that Hoover “decimated and destroyed tens of thousands of lives with violence, addiction and murder,” the document states.\n\nBy asking the question the judge was merely attempting to give the defense a chance to respond to the “tens of thousands” estimate that was put forth by the government, according to the document.\n\n“The court repeatedly made clear that it was not crediting the government’s argument, but was giving defense counsel the opportunity to respond,” the document states. Prosecutors said the question was “wholly appropriate.”\n\nThe defense attorneys also noted in their motion that Blakey, in asking his question, stressed that Bonjean should answer it “as an officer of the court” — a reminder of her duty to tell the truth. They also said that Blakey suggested Bonjean ask Hoover for the answer, noting that “he probably has the most knowledge of all.”\n\nIn the response, prosecutors said “there is nothing insulting or controversial” about the phrase “officer of the court,” adding that “defendant’s attempt to read something into this phrase that does not exist should be rejected.”\n\nBlakey, a former prosecutor, has spent a decade on the bench since his 2014 nomination by President Barack Obama. He also presides over the corruption case against former Illinois House Speaker Michael J. Madigan.\n\nHoover’s attorneys argue he should get a new sentencing hearing under the First Step Act, a 2018 law signed by President Donald Trump. That prompted the rare public video appearance by Hoover in Blakey’s courtroom in September.\n\nThe former gang leader has spent decades serving a life sentence in the so-called supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.\n\nHoover was convicted of murder after a trial in December 1973, and a judge sentenced him to 150 to 200 years in state prison. That didn’t stop Hoover from running the gang, though. U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber handed the gang leader his life sentence in 1998 following his conviction for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.\n\nContributing: Jon Seidel","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/11/26/gang-leader-larry-hoovers-motion-to-disqualify-judge-john-blakey-based-on-unsupported-suggestions-prosecutors-say","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9995cfd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/650x371+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F75%2F88%2F400439391913038ebcc7914bd065%2Fhoover1.","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 01:08:27","author":"Emmanuel Camarillo","authors":["Emmanuel Camarillo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.281},{"id":267895338,"title":"Bolsonaro Directly Involved In Coup Plot Brazil Police","text":"Brazil&apos;s federal police have presented evidence to the Supreme Court that former president Jair Bolsonaro was directly involved in plotting a coup to overturn the outcome of the 2022 election he lost. According to a final 884-page report unsealed on Tuesday - the result of a nearly two-year investigation - evidence gathered from search warrants, wire taps, financial records and plea bargain testimony point to a criminal conspiracy with Bolsonaro at the helm. \"Bolsonaro effectively planned, directed and executed, in coordination with other officials since at least 2019, concrete acts that aimed at the abolition of the democratic rule of law, with him remaining as president,\" the report said. Police also found that Bolsonaro had \"full knowledge\" of a plan to assassinate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, then president-elect, and his running mate, based on dialogue captured between conspirators and meetings at the presidential residence. The report cites eight main pieces of evidence to back up the formal accusation against Bolsonaro in the alleged coup attempt, including a meeting he called in December 2022 with top commanders of the armed forces, presenting them with a proposed coup d&apos;état and asking them to join the conspiracy. The army and air force commanders refused, according to police, while the navy commander, now retired Admiral Almir Garnier Santos, expressed support, according to investigators. Garnier Santos was one of the 37 people, most retired and some active duty military officers, including Bolsonaro whom police formally accused last week of a role in the planned coup. The country&apos;s prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, will now decide whether to press charges against Bolsonaro and his alleged co-conspirators. Bolsonaro, who was formally accused for the attempted coup, violent abolition of the democratic rule of law and criminal organisation, has denied committing any crime. On Monday, he told journalists in Brasilia that he had never discussed a coup. His lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comments on the full report on Tuesday. A representative for Garnier did not immediately respond to request for comment. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday lifted the seal on the police report regarding the alleged coup plot. Bolsonaro&apos;s Defence Minister, now retired General Walter Braga Netto, also played an important role in planning the alleged coup, the police investigation found. Not only did he encourage Bolsonaro&apos;s allies to attack the armed forces commanders on social media for not joining the coup plot, he held a meeting at his house where the assassination of Lula and his Vice President-elect Geraldo Alckmin was discussed and approved, the report said. Braga Netto, who was Bolsonaro&apos;s running mate in the 2022 election, has denied this. \"It was never a coup, much less a plan to murder someone,\" he said in a social media post following last week official accusation. Bolsonaro never recognised his defeat by Lula, who was sworn in as president on January 1, 2023. The formal police accusations against Bolsonaro are a fresh blow to his plan to run for president in 2026. US President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s recent victory had buoyed Bolsonaro allies trying to overturn a court decision that has blocked him from public office for attacking the legitimacy of the 2022 vote. Federal police finished two separate criminal probes of Bolsonaro and his associates earlier this year formally accusing them of tampering with COVID-19 vaccination cards while in office and of embezzling jewellery gifted by the Saudi government. Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Gonet is planning to merge the three investigations into Bolsonaro&apos;s actions against Brazil&apos;s democratic system and produce one single global indictment against him. Because of that, Brazil&apos;s top public prosecutor is not likely to issue any indictments until next year for Bolsonaro, members of his government and military officers who allegedly planned the coup, they said.

In contrast, the 50-stock index has made an immediate base at 24,200. The Choice Broking expert said Dalal Street bias would improve once the frontline index decisively breaks above 24,350. Bagadia advised investors to maintain a stock-specific approach and look at stocks that look strong on the technical chart. He said that looking at breakout stocks can be a good bet for intraday trading.Speaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Sumeet Bagadia said, \"Overall, the Indian stock market bias is cautious as the Nifty 50 index has been facing hurdles at the 24,350 mark and oscillating around a new base of 24,200.

Announcing the deal on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden hailed the accord as a crucial step towards stability in the region.The hours leading up to the ceasefire saw an escalation in Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon, drawing sharp criticism from Lebanese authorities and international observers.The agreement, which Israel’s cabinet approved in a 10-1 vote, outlines a 60-day cessation of hostilities. However, tensions remain high, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cautioning that any breach by Hezbollah could lead to renewed military action. Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire: Coordinated Withdrawal Under the agreement, Israeli troops will begin a phased withdrawal from southern Lebanon over the next two months. Simultaneously, the Lebanese army will deploy south of the Litani River to reassert state sovereignty and ensure that Hezbollah militants do not re-establish their positions.A senior Biden administration official clarified that Israeli forces would initially maintain their positions to prevent a security vacuum. “The Lebanese military and security forces will begin their deployment in the south, and as they take up positions, the Israeli military will gradually withdraw,” the official stated.The US and France will assist in monitoring the implementation of the deal through an existing verification mission, which was originally established following the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war but has been largely ineffective. This mission will not involve the deployment of US troops in Lebanon but will focus on enhancing the Lebanese army’s operational capacity.Netanyahu’s Warning and Hezbollah’s ResponseIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s warning about potential retaliation underscores the fragility of the ceasefire. “If Hezbollah violates this agreement, Israel will not hesitate to respond,” he said during a press briefing. Conversely, concerns remain about how Hezbollah might perceive any perceived Israeli provocations.When questioned about potential violations by either side, a US administration official admitted that Lebanon’s sovereignty would be pivotal in addressing any such scenarios. “The aim is to empower Lebanese forces to repel any aggression while ensuring compliance with the ceasefire terms,” the official noted.Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire: Evacuations and Escalation Ahead of the CeasefireIn the lead-up to the ceasefire, Israel intensified its bombing campaign across Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah strongholds, including Beirut’s southern suburbs. Evacuation notices were issued in several areas, with Lebanon’s public health ministry reporting multiple casualties and injuries. The escalation has raised questions about whether Israel’s actions were intended as a final show of strength before the cessation of hostilities.Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire: Role of International MediatorsThe negotiations, facilitated by the United States, involved no discussion of additional military aid for Israel, according to US officials. Instead, efforts focused on ensuring a balanced withdrawal process and preventing a resurgence of Hezbollah’s military infrastructure.France’s involvement in the verification process signals a renewed international effort to stabilise southern Lebanon. The phased withdrawal plan aims to avoid creating a vacuum that could lead to further unrest.Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire: Future UncertaintiesAlthough the agreement marks a pause in hostilities, its durability remains uncertain. The involvement of international observers and the Lebanese army’s role in securing the south will be critical in determining whether the ceasefire can transition into a long-term resolution.President Joe Biden’s administration has briefed President-elect Donald Trump’s team on the terms of the deal, ensuring continuity in US engagement on the issue.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/israelhezbollahlebanon-cease-fire-deal-joe-biden-netanyahu-hamas-palestine-gaza-11732667801478.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/11/27/1600x900/APTOPIX-Lebanon-Israel-0_1732667865025_1732667886471.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 01:07:42","author":"Sayantani","authors":["Sayantani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.152},{"id":267895012,"title":"Pnp Tightlipped Strategy Oust Jlps Williams Clarendon Municipal Corporation","text":"Latest News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nInternational\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nLatest News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nInternational\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nPresident of the People’s National Party (PNP) Mark Golding addresses comrades at the PNP annual conference on Sunday, September 15, 2024. (Photo: Garfield Robinson) \n\r\n Latest News, News \r\n\nNovember 26, 2024\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n PNP tightlipped on strategy to oust JLP’s Williams from Clarendon Municipal Corporation \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica— The leadership of the People’s National Party (PNP) is tight-lipped on its next step to have the mayor of May Pen, the Jamaica Labour Party’s (JLP) Joel Williams hand over leadership of the Clarendon Municipal Corporation.\n\nThe mayor is also chairman of the corporation.\n\nQuestions have been raised as to who should be in charge of the local authority following last Friday’s by-election in the Aenon Town division in Clarendon Northern, which was won by PNP candidate Delroy Dawson.\n\nDawson polled 1,646 votes, while Suzette Barton of the governing JLP received 1,592 votes, in a narrow win for the PNP.\n\nThe by-election became necessary following the death in September of JLP councillor Marjorie McLeod-McFarlane. She had created history in the February 26 Local Government Elections when she defeated Dawson by 92 votes. It marked the first time the JLP was winning the division.\n\nFebruary’s election saw the JLP winning 12 divisions while the PNP won 10.\n\nFriday’s victory by Dawson means the Clarendon Municipal Corporation is now tied 11-11. The PNP also won the popular vote and the party believes it should be put it in charge of the corporation similar to what obtains in the Kingston and St Andrew Municipal Corporation which ended in a 20-20 tie in February, but saw the PNP appoint the mayor, and the JLP the deputy mayor, having won the popular vote.\n\nIn the case of Clarendon, Mayor Williams has suggested that he can only be removed if a vote of no-confidence is moved against him or if a JLP councillor crosses the floor.\n\nOn Tuesday, Opposition Leader Mark Golding said “our position is, with an equality in the number of councillors …in the municipal corporation and the PNP having won the popular vote in the parish in the February elections but also even more so with this by-election, the right and principled thing is for the existing mayor to step down and to allow democracy to prevail and to have the PNP councillors choose a mayor. That is the position that we believe is correct”.\n\n“In terms of what we will do in terms of our legal strategy, I’m not going to disclose that today,” Golding added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\r\n\n\r\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Golding says desperate members of JLP playing race card against him \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nNovember 26, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— Opposition Leader Mark Golding has responded to the increasing racial rhetoric from members of the governing Jamaica Labour Party (... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nLatest News, News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n JDF soldier arrested in $47-m phishing scam \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nNovember 26, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— A Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) soldier was arrested Tuesday morning for his alleged involvement in a phishing scam that has defraude... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Novel-T’s ‘Survivor’ tops chart in Jamaica \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nNovember 26, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n A dominant figure in South Florida reggae, Novel-T wanted to make an impact outside of that region with Survivor , her second album, which was release... \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Moses I switches it up with ‘Di Glama’ \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nNovember 26, 2024 \r\n\n\r\n As a budding artiste in Papine, St Andrew, Moses I was introduced to roots-reggae through that area’s large Rastafarian community.

LeBlanc said Canadian agencies work collaboratively with their U.S. counterparts.\n\n“For decades, this collaborative work happening literally daily with American authorities and Canadian authorities has allowed us to keep both countries safe, including dealing with some of the real challenges around the opioid crisis,” LeBlanc said.\n\nImmigration Minister Marc Miller was asked on Tuesday about deploying more officers to oversee the New York-Vermont border area, which sees the highest rates of illegal crossings from Canada into the United States.\n\nHe cautioned that there is no comparison to the flow of migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico.\n\n“It’s the equivalent on a yearly basis with a significant weekend at the Mexico border. At the same time, it’s not something I want to not take seriously, because it is serious,” Miller said.\n\n“We have a job to not make our problems the Americans’ problems and they have a job not to make their problems ours.”\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows its officers recorded nearly 200,000 encounters at the northern border between October 2023 and September 2024. The same period in 2022 saw more than 109,000 encounters and there were around 32,000 in 2020.\n\nThe term “encounters” includes apprehensions, people who are deemed inadmissible and those who are expelled from the U.S.\n\nBetween October 2023 and September 2024, U.S. officials recorded more than two million encounters at the Mexican border. The two prior years also saw more than 2 million encounters each at the southern border.\n\nChief border patrol agent Robert Garcia said last month on X that agents in the Swanton Sector, which covers Vermont’s border with Quebec, apprehended more than 19,000 people from 97 countries in the last year — more than the last 17 years combined.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said it also seized nearly 5,000 kilograms of illegal drugs at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. That included 19.5 kilograms of fentanyl.\n\nComparatively, border agents seized nearly 125,000 kilograms of narcotics at the border with Mexico, including almost 10,000 kilograms of fentanyl.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, two milligrams of fentanyl is a potentially fatal dose.\n\nCannabis is by far the most commonly seized drug coming from Canada, accounting for almost 60 per cent of total seizures. From Mexico it’s methamphetamine, accounting for about 57 per cent of seizures at the southern border.\n\nDrug seizures coming from Canada to the U.S. are down significantly from the prior two years, according to border patrol data: about 25,000 kilograms of narcotics were seized between October 2022 and September 2023, down from about 27,200 kilograms in the year before.\n\nBoth Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet called on the Trudeau government to ensure the border is secure on Tuesday.\n\nPoilievre focused on government data that was raised at the immigration committee on Monday that said 4.9 million people will have their Canadian visas expire by the end of December 2025.\n\nIn question period Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the “overwhelming majority” of people leave when their visas expire and there are measures in the immigration system to deal with cases where that does not happen.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she is open to talks with the Trump administration on the tariff issue, but said drugs were a “public health and consumption” issue in the U.S. She added most of the weapons entering Mexico are smuggled in through the U.S.\n\nIn recent months the RCMP have announced two significant operations with ties to Mexican drug cartels.\n\nThis includes the arrest of three men in Surrey, B.C., earlier this month, who police say are connected to an organized crime group with ties to Mexican drug cartels.\n\nPolice seized “multiple kilos” of illicit drugs, and said the accused were allegedly “planning large-scale distribution” of drugs out of Surrey.\n\nIn October, the RCMP, FBI and other policing partners arrested nine Canadians in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe accused are alleged to have ties to a Mexico cartel-linked criminal network. Charges include murder, conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking.","url":"https://www.agassizharrisonobserver.com/national-news/canada-considering-drones-helicopter-patrols-for-us-border-7672465","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/11/web1_20241126151136-2024112615118-722e97b2c9e3a39972c49cc36c1b1ff233a15054b8681bbf4c39e9e78ced1f26.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 01:04:53","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.293},{"id":267894774,"title":"Canada Bc Need To Show Americans That Tariffs Are A Bad Idea Ubc Analyst 7672544","text":"Keep calm and make the case for trading on.\n\nThat's the advice from one B.C. analyst after U.S. president-elect Donald Trump threatened Canada and Mexico with 25 per cent tariffs starting on Jan. 20 unless both countries make changes to their respective border security. \n\nBut other analysts are less optimistic about Canada's ability to influence American behaviour and all voices broadly agree tariffs would hurt British Columbia.\n\nUniversity of B.C. political scientist Stewart Prest, who studies U.S.-Canada relations, warns against panic.\n\n\"We have been down this road before,\" he said. \"The story is playing out differently, but the sort of underlying tune is familiar — unpredictability, sudden proclamations, requiring rapid actions. But we have months to go before this announcement is to take effect....so Canada has time to respond here.\"\n\nPrest said the \"best thing\" Canada can do is to explain the detrimental effects of Trump's proposed tariffs on U.S. consumers.\n\n\"If the administration went ahead with that policy, everything in the United States, would get more expensive,\" he said in pointing out that U.S. tariffs on Canadian energy would for example amount to Americans paying a tax. \n\nWhile Canada may need to respond with its own tariffs in the short turn, the \"much stronger argument\" is to show that this policy would \"impose on American consumers\" with one person — Donald Trump — ultimately responsible for it. \n\nSo how much influence does Canada have these days in the United States? Prest said initial reactions to Trump's threat suggest \"an overwhelming sense\" that Canada is \"helpless\" in the face of the American threat.\n\n\"It's certainly true that our Prime Minister (Justin Trudeau) does not have the ear of (Trump), but that is by no means the only line of communication here,\" Prest said. \"There are strong lines of communication between provincial premiers and state governors and between legislatures north and south of the border.\" \n\nPremier David Eby made comparable points Tuesday, but also implicitly called for unity among Canada's leaders in pointing to the potential of Trump using a divide-and-conquer strategy to play provinces off against each other. \n\n\"It's a significant risk right now and this goes back to the one underlying problem, which is that Prime Minister Trudeau is extraordinarily unpopular and premiers may be less willing to do what would otherwise be a good idea, simply because they don't want to be associated with somebody who is a political dead weight at the moment,\" he said.\n\nTorsten Jaccard, assistant professor at UBC's Vancouver School of Economics, said tariffs would Canada in what he called a \"very tricky\" situation. \"For every dollar of income earned in Canda, 20 cents of that is generated by an export to the United States,\" he said. \"In the United States, of every dollar consumers spend, only two cents is going to Canadian exports. Those two numbers is basically everything you need to know about this. The United States does have considerable power economically over us.\" \n\nIf Trump goes ahead with these tariffs, they would lead to a recession in Canada, Jaccard added, pointing to estimates from the University of Calgary that would cost the average family about $2,000 per year. Ontario's automobile-manufacturing industry and Alberta's oil-and-gas industry would especially feel the recessionary effects, he added. \n\n\"On the income side, British Columbians would be slightly less affected...but it's still going to be a remarkably significant cost to British Columbians, if it (the threatened tariff) comes into effect,\" he said. \n\nLike Prest, Jaccard pointed out that Trump had imposed tariffs during his first time, only to back off after Canada had responded \"very targeted tariffs\" aimed at specific regions of the United States. \"But this does seem to be something of a different beast,\" Jaccard said. \n\nHe added that Canada's best course of action would be work with Mexico and potentially with China, as well as European allies to send a strong signal to Trump that his decision to renege on existing trade arrangements would have consequences.\n\nMore to come....\n\nMore to come...","url":"https://www.agassizharrisonobserver.com/news/canada-bc-need-to-show-americans-that-tariffs-are-a-bad-idea-ubc-analyst-7672544","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/hope/import/2018-07/12682656_web1_180614-RDA-Canada-US-relations-at-a-low-after-Trudeau-Trump-trade-tiff_1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 01:04:53","author":"Wolf Depner","authors":["Wolf Depner"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":267894908,"title":"The Trump administration claims credit for the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire brokered by Biden.","text":"WASHINGTON – The Biden administration kept President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration closely apprised of its efforts to broker the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah that is slated to go into effect early Wednesday, according to the outgoing Democratic administration.\n\nTrump’s team, meanwhile, was quick to spike the football and claim credit for the rare spot of good news for a Democratic administration that’s been dragged down by the grinding Mideast conflict.\n\n“Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,” Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, Trump’s choice for his national security adviser, said in a post on X on Tuesday, shortly before the Israel Cabinet signed off on the agreement. “His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. I’m glad to see concrete steps towards deescalation in the Middle East.”\n\nThe Biden administration’s reported coordination with Trump’s team on its efforts to forge the ceasefire in Lebanon is perhaps the highest-profile example of cooperation in what’s been a sometimes choppy transition period.\n\nTrump’s transition team just on Tuesday reached a required agreement with President Joe Biden’s White House that will allow transition staff to coordinate with the existing federal workforce before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. There has been some coordination on high levels between the outgoing Biden and incoming Trump teams, including talks between Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Waltz.\n\nBiden in Rose Garden remarks on Tuesday cheered the ceasefire agreement as a critical step that he hoped could be the catalyst for a broader peace in the Mideast, which has been shaken by nearly 14 months of war following Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\n“This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,” Biden said. “What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed — I emphasize, will not be allowed — to threaten the security of Israel again.”\n\nWhite House officials are now hopeful that a calm in Lebanon will reinvigorate a multi-country effort at finding an endgame to the devastating war in Gaza, where Hamas is still holding dozens of hostages and the conflict is more intractable.\n\nBiden said the U.S., as well as Israel, will engage in talks in the coming days with officials from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey to try to get Gaza talks back on track.\n\nBut during Biden’s moment of success in a conflict that has roiled his reputation at home and abroad, the specter of the incoming Trump administration loomed large.\n\nTrump’s senior national security team was briefed by the Biden administration as negotiations unfolded and finally came to a conclusion on Tuesday, according to a senior Biden administration official. The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity on a call organized by the White House, added that the incoming Trump administration officials were not directly involved in the talks, but that it was important that they knew “what we were negotiating and what the commitments were.”\n\nTrump’s team and allies, meanwhile, said there was no doubt that the prospect of the Republican president returning to power pushed both sides to get the agreement done.\n\nWaltz, in addition to giving Trump credit for the ceasefire deal coming together, added a warning to Iran, Hezbollah’s chief financial backer.\n\n“But let’s be clear: The Iran Regime is the root cause of the chaos & terror that has been unleashed across the region. We will not tolerate the status quo of their support for terrorism,” Waltz said in his post.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, also gave a shoutout to the incoming administration, while giving a nod to Biden’s team.\n\n“I appreciate the hard work of the Biden Administration, supported by President Trump, to make this ceasefire a reality,” Graham said in a statement.\n\nRichard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Washington group Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said the moment magnifies that Iran — which he said would have needed to approve of Hezbollah agreeing to the ceasefire — is carefully weighing what lays ahead with Trump.\n\n“There’s zero doubt that Iran is pulling back to regroup ahead of Trump coming into office,” said Goldberg, a National Security Council official in Trump’s first administration. “It’s a combination of Israeli military success and Trump’s election — the ayatollah has no clothes and he knows we know.”\n\nThe Biden White House is also holding on to a sliver of hope that the Lebanon ceasefire deal could help reinvigorate a long sought after Israel-Saudi normalization deal.\n\nThe official said a “lot of work has been done” to get such an agreement on track “but clearly where we are in Gaza is holding us back.”\n\nBiden has said his administration was tantalizingly close to reaching a deal between the Middle East’s two most important powers shortly before the Hamas attack sent tremors throughout the region. He has speculated that the emerging normalization deal was part of Hamas’ motivation in carrying out its attack on Israel when it did.\n\nJust weeks before the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat beside Biden on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly and marveled that a “historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia” seemed within reach — a diplomatic advance that the Israeli leader predicted could lead to lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe so-called normalization push, which began during Trump’s first administration and was branded the Abraham Accords, is an ambitious effort to reshape the region and boost Israel’s standing.\n\nThe Biden White House plans to keep the incoming Trump administration looped in on its efforts and “anything that we will do on this … we won’t do this unless they know what we’re doing,” the Biden administration official said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Fatima Hussein in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Zeke Miller and Chris Megerian contributed reporting.","summary":"WASHINGTON – The Biden administration kept President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s incoming administration closely&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/the-trump-administration-claims-credit-for-the-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-brokered-by-biden/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Trump-team-says-Israel-Hezbollah-ceasefire-deal-brokered-700x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 01:03:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":267896070,"title":"Don’t Be a Turkey on Thanksgiving","text":"“My Mom Voted for Trump.

If I try to protect my mother from vitriol, would I be betraying myself, or my wife and her family, in order to preserve harmony and child care?”\n\nThat poor woman. She left her home to be near her son and help raise his children, only to discover that she raised a jellyfish.\n\nThe Ethicist sagely responded that family members have a right to ask the mother probing questions but are not entitled to cudgel her with them.\n\nI have some thoughts on this myself.\n\nFirst, shame on the wife’s family for being so intolerant that they are poised to pounce on a family member for supporting the Republican nominee.\n\nSecond, shame on them for not being curious as to why the mother voted for Trump—or why half of the electorate went for the former president. They have no interest in understanding why Trump won more votes than Harris.\n\nThird, this is what happens when people on one side of the aisle decide that folks on the other side are stupid or evil. Or racist. The laws of civility get tossed out the window, even by people who think they are noble and good.\n\nAnd they’re sore losers.\n\nMSNBC host Joy Reid took this act further when she told her supporters on X that people were alarmed at the Trump victory and “if you would vote for that, people may not feel all that confident that they’re safe with you.”\n\nYes, she went there with the bogus safety argument.\n\nThen Reid declared: If you think that you can vote for Trump and expect Kamala Harris voters to “have Thanksgiving with you, I think you’re kind of misinformed.”\n\nPut another way: If you think the far Left is tolerant, you’re very misinformed.\n\nThis writer’s family and Reid are living in a bubble—and bubbles are feedback loops that block out contrary voices. If they hardly know any Trump voters, they should make a point of making new friends.\n\nThose of us who have been steeped in politics over the years have found ourselves inside bubbles from time to time—and when that happens, we are never at our best.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS.COM","summary":"“My Mom Voted for Trump.

However, no concrete results were achieved in denuclearizing North Korea through the talks.\n\nThe subsequent administration of President Joe Biden has not engaged directly with North Korea, while Pyongyang has further advanced its nuclear and missile arsenal.\n\nTrump's reelection has reignited prospects for his summit diplomacy with Kim, especially after the president-elect named former State Department official Alex Wong as deputy national security adviser, noting that Wong \"helped negotiate my summit with\" Kim.\n\nReuters reported that an initial goal for Trump would be to \"reestablish basic engagement,\" but further policy aims or a precise timetable have not been determined.\n\nDuring his second presidential campaign, Trump hinted at a policy of pursuing direct engagement with Kim, boasting about his personal ties with him.\n\n\"I got along with Kim Jong-un of North Korea,\" Trump said during a campaign rally in August. \"We also looked at his nuclear capability. It's very substantial. ... You know, getting along is a good thing. It's not a bad thing,\" he added.\n\nNearly three weeks after Trump's reelection, Kim Jong-un has not mentioned his presidential win.\n\nLast week, Kim said during his speech at an arms exhibition in Pyongyang that North Korea had gone as far as possible in negotiations with the US, but it only confirmed the unchanging invasive and hostile policy toward North Korea.\n\nHe added there will never be an occasion for his country to relinquish the \"pendulum of the military balance\" on its own.\n\nSome have voiced skepticism about the prospects of resuming summitry between Trump and Kim, citing North Korea's significantly advanced nuclear and missile programs, its close alignment with Russia, and more pressing security concerns for the US, such as the Russia-Ukraine war.

LeBlanc said Canadian agencies work collaboratively with their U.S. counterparts.\n\n“For decades, this collaborative work happening literally daily with American authorities and Canadian authorities has allowed us to keep both countries safe, including dealing with some of the real challenges around the opioid crisis,” LeBlanc said.\n\nImmigration Minister Marc Miller was asked on Tuesday about deploying more officers to oversee the New York-Vermont border area, which sees the highest rates of illegal crossings from Canada into the United States.\n\nHe cautioned that there is no comparison to the flow of migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico.\n\n“It’s the equivalent on a yearly basis with a significant weekend at the Mexico border. At the same time, it’s not something I want to not take seriously, because it is serious,” Miller said.\n\n“We have a job to not make our problems the Americans’ problems and they have a job not to make their problems ours.”\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows its officers recorded nearly 200,000 encounters at the northern border between October 2023 and September 2024. The same period in 2022 saw more than 109,000 encounters and there were around 32,000 in 2020.\n\nThe term “encounters” includes apprehensions, people who are deemed inadmissible and those who are expelled from the U.S.\n\nBetween October 2023 and September 2024, U.S. officials recorded more than two million encounters at the Mexican border. The two prior years also saw more than 2 million encounters each at the southern border.\n\nChief border patrol agent Robert Garcia said last month on X that agents in the Swanton Sector, which covers Vermont’s border with Quebec, apprehended more than 19,000 people from 97 countries in the last year — more than the last 17 years combined.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said it also seized nearly 5,000 kilograms of illegal drugs at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. That included 19.5 kilograms of fentanyl.\n\nComparatively, border agents seized nearly 125,000 kilograms of narcotics at the border with Mexico, including almost 10,000 kilograms of fentanyl.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, two milligrams of fentanyl is a potentially fatal dose.\n\nCannabis is by far the most commonly seized drug coming from Canada, accounting for almost 60 per cent of total seizures.

Bush administration, has made recommendations to Trump advisers on fentanyl policy. He and others say sanctions on Chinese banks for backing money launderers and chemical sellers will accomplish what diplomacy to date has not.\n\n“When you don’t do those things, then you’re a doormat,” Yates told Reuters.\n\nDavid Asher, a top former U.S. anti-money laundering official who helped target the finances of the Islamic State terrorist group, said this mechanism has been used against designated foreign adversaries like Iran but never Mexican or Canadian banks.\n\n“You need to hit all the bankers. It’s sort of basic,” said Asher, who has recommended criminal indictments against Chinese and Mexican financial institutions, bounties on traffickers, and other measures.\n\nTrump, who had campaigned on stopping the opioid crisis, formed a commission to combat the issue in March 2017 and declared a public health emergency in October that year.\n\nExperts and officials have determined that precursor chemicals—which can be hard to ban if they have benign, legal applications—are shipped from China to Mexico, where local labs finish the process to create illicit fentanyl and analogs.\n\nFormer DEA official Derek Maltz told The Epoch Times that tariffs only address one aspect of a vast and complex problem, but they certainly help and, more importantly, signal that the incoming administration will show strong leadership on the issue.\n\n“We have to be more aggressive to get [Beijing] to cooperate more than they have in the past,” he told The Epoch Times.\n\nMaltz is the former special agent in charge of the Special Operations Division of the Justice Department and former chief of the New York Drug Enforcement Task Force, the nation’s oldest and largest of its kind.\n\nMaltz, who has tracked the opioid crisis since 2008, has seen the need for interagency cooperation to treat the issue as one of national strategic importance because it is no longer just a “drug issue.”\n\nHe said the United States needs a comprehensive plan to repair the damage done, including a defense strategy, mental illness treatment, rehabilitation, and much more.\n\n“It’s not just a supply issue,” Maltz said. “You can’t just throw money at it and expect it to go away.”\n\nThe easily editable nature of the drug also means that Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturers’ efforts far outpace regulators, officials say, with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimating that there could be potentially thousands of synthetic fentanyl analogs.\n\nFentanyl-related deaths again rose steeply in 2020, with experts warning that a prolonged drug crisis could follow the mental health crisis caused in part by extended COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.\n\nThen, in 2022, the CCP stopped cooperating entirely, stating it was in response to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) visit to Taiwan.\n\nThe United States took additional unilateral steps in the meantime, sanctioning dozens of Chinese nationals and companies for exporting illicit fentanyl and related drugs. In September 2023, President Joe Biden put China on the U.S. list of major illicit drug transit or producing countries.\n\nTalks between Washington and Beijing resumed in November 2023. Xi agreed to resume counternarcotics cooperation in exchange for the Chinese Ministry of Public Security’s Institute of Foreign Science, which was implicated in human rights abuses in Xinjiang, being taken off the U.S. sanctions list.\n\nChinese regime spokespersons have, over the years, repeatedly rejected U.S. reports that name China as the primary source of illicit fentanyl, saying instead the cause of the drug problem is the United States.\n\nChinese manufacturers and suppliers aren’t stopping at fentanyl either, Maltz said. They’ve realized that the United States doesn’t strictly regulate marijuana production, he said, and are increasingly investing in the marijuana market.","summary":"The United States says China is the primary source of illicit fentanyl making its way onto American streets.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/chinas-role-in-fentanyl-crisis-back-in-spotlight-as-tariffs-loom-5766484","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/27/id5766943-EpochImages-2075210600-xl-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 00:58:01","author":"Catherine Yang","authors":["Catherine Yang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":267893002,"title":"Canada Considering Drones Helicopter Patrols For Us Border 7672465","text":"Canada is considering supplying the RCMP and border agency with more resources including drones, helicopters and personnel in case of a “surge” at the border, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Tuesday in response to Donald Trump’s threat to impose steep tariffs on Canadian imports into the U.S. \n\nThe president-elect threatened to impose 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports unless action is taken to stem the flow of both migrants and illegal drugs crossing the border.\n\n“As everyone is aware, thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,” Trump said on Truth Social on Monday night.\n\nLeBlanc said his office has been working with finance officials, the RCMP and the Canada Border Services Agency “for months” to see what is needed and feasible.\n\nThe minister added that Canada shares many of the same concerns as the Americans when it comes to illegal migration, and drugs and other contraband making its way across the border.

Prest said initial reactions to Trump's threat suggest \"an overwhelming sense\" that Canada is \"helpless\" in the face of the American threat.\n\n\"It's certainly true that our Prime Minister (Justin Trudeau) does not have the ear of (Trump), but that is by no means the only line of communication here,\" Prest said. \"There are strong lines of communication between provincial premiers and state governors and between legislatures north and south of the border.\" \n\nPremier David Eby made comparable points Tuesday, but also implicitly called for unity among Canada's leaders in pointing to the potential of Trump using a divide-and-conquer strategy to play provinces off against each other. \n\n\"It's a significant risk right now and this goes back to the one underlying problem, which is that Prime Minister Trudeau is extraordinarily unpopular and premiers may be less willing to do what would otherwise be a good idea, simply because they don't want to be associated with somebody who is a political dead weight at the moment,\" he said.\n\nMore to come...","url":"https://www.vicnews.com/news/canada-bc-need-to-show-americans-that-tariffs-are-a-bad-idea-ubc-analyst-7672544","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/hope/import/2018-07/12682656_web1_180614-RDA-Canada-US-relations-at-a-low-after-Trudeau-Trump-trade-tiff_1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 00:55:54","author":"Wolf Depner","authors":["Wolf Depner"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":267893976,"title":"Leaders of Ireland’s main parties clash in final debate","text":"The leaders of Ireland’s three main political parties clashed on housing, healthcare and financial management in their final televised debate before the general election.\n\nThe tetchy debate, which was marked by several interruptions, featured Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald, Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris, and Ireland’s deputy premier and Fianna Leader Micheal Martin.\n\nThe parties set out their stalls in a broadcast that commentators said did little to move the dial before polling day on November 29, which is likely to set the scene of Irish politics for the next five years.\n\nMs McDonald took aim at current coalition partners Mr Martin and Mr Harris for their respective parties’ roles in handling the financial crash and its aftermath.\n\nIn the more than 90-minute debate on Irish national broadcaster RTE, Ms McDonald said the financial crash was instigated and driven by Fianna Fail, while austerity was brought by Fine Gael.\n\nEchoing words spoken earlier in the debate by Mr Harris: “There are people watching this programme who still bear the scars of your crash and of your austerity.”\n\nHe had said that lessons had to be learned from the financial crash, adding that Fine Gael had “never crashed the economy” and was now proposing the least amount of spending when compared to the other two parties.\n\nMr Martin said he “learned from” his time in Government during the financial crash.\n\nMs McDonald retorted: “I know you did, sure you authored it.”\n\nMr Martin said he kept with public service and would always put the country before his party.\n\nHe also said Sinn Fein’s “enormous” tax increases would destroy Ireland’s enterprise economy.\n\nThe exchanges came amid the backdrop of the US presidential election, with compounding anxieties that the next administration’s proposals around corporation tax and tariffs would significantly impact Ireland.\n\nMr Harris warned that “the risk of a trade shock is real” while Ms McDonald argued it was not smart to “paint up a doomsday scenario” around US President-elect Donald Trump’s next term.\n\nDuring the debate, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael’s leader again ruled out entering into a coalition with Sinn Fein after the election.\n\nMs McDonald said “Tweedledum and Tweedledee” seemed to believe they were the only ones who should really be in Government.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the broadcast, he said such a question was a “scare tactic” to “frighten the middle ground”.\n\nElsewhere, Mr Martin said Fianna Fail had taken “radical action” while holding the housing portfolio.\n\nIt came after Ireland’s Housing Commission called for a radical reset in housing policy.\n\nMr Harris argued that housing is the “number one priority”, as he sought to contextualise comments from a former Fine Gael housing minister, Eoghan Murphy, who has said the party had not made the policy area its focus.

Instead, Tuesday’s memorandum established that Trump and his team are required to publish their own ethics plan and abide by it.\n\nAmong the stipulations were that Trump team members would avoid conflicts of interest and protect non-public information.\n\nOrdinarily, FBI clearance is required for access to classified materials. But Tuesday’s memorandum also indicates that Trump may avoid that process as well.\n\nIn her statement, Wiles framed Trump’s avoidance of the GSA and Justice Department agreements as a way of avoiding “taxpayer funding for costs related to the transition”.\n\nShe celebrated the Trump transition team’s decision as a symbol of “organizational autonomy” and self-sufficiency.\n\n“The transition already has existing security and information protections built in, which means we will not require additional government and bureaucratic oversight,” she wrote.\n\nSharma, the White House spokesperson, said the Biden administration did not agree with the decision to discard some of the usual protocols. But Sharma signalled that Biden officials would forge ahead, to avoid further delays in the transition process.","summary":"US President-elect Trump sidestepped agreements that would require donor disclosures and vetting for government picks.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/27/breaking-norms-trump-signs-transition-memorandum-with-biden-white-house?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-25T221230Z_728068652_RC2M8BAN1SZJ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TRANSITION-PROCESS-1732666727.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 00:54:37","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":267893064,"title":"Leaders of Ireland’s main parties clash in final debate","text":"The leaders of Ireland’s three main political parties clashed on housing, healthcare and financial management in their final televised debate before the general election.\n\nThe tetchy debate, which was marked by several interruptions, featured Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald, Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris, and Ireland’s deputy premier and Fianna Leader Micheal Martin.\n\nThe parties set out their stalls in a broadcast that commentators said did little to move the dial before polling day on November 29, which is likely to set the scene of Irish politics for the next five years.\n\nThe latest opinion poll put the parties in a tight grouping with Fianna Fail slightly ahead of Sinn Fein, and Fine Gael in a close third after a significant slide in a campaign marked with several hiccups for that party.\n\nMs McDonald took aim at current coalition partners Mr Martin and Mr Harris for their respective parties’ roles in handling the financial crash and its aftermath.\n\nIn the more than 90-minute debate on Irish national broadcaster RTE, Ms McDonald said the financial crash was instigated and driven by Fianna Fail, while austerity was brought by Fine Gael.\n\nEchoing words spoken earlier in the debate by Mr Harris: “There are people watching this programme who still bear the scars of your crash and of your austerity.”\n\nHe had said that lessons had to be learned from the financial crash, adding that Fine Gael had “never crashed the economy” and was now proposing the least amount of spending when compared to the other two parties.\n\nMr Martin said he “learned from” his time in Government during the financial crash.\n\nMs McDonald retorted: “I know you did, sure you authored it.”\n\nMr Martin said he kept with public service and would always put the country before his party.\n\nHe also said Sinn Fein’s “enormous” tax increases would destroy Ireland’s enterprise economy.\n\nThe exchanges came amid the backdrop of the US presidential election, with compounding anxieties that the next administration’s proposals around corporation tax and tariffs would significantly impact Ireland.\n\nMr Harris warned that “the risk of a trade shock is real” while Ms McDonald argued it was not smart to “paint up a doomsday scenario” around US President-elect Donald Trump’s next term.\n\nDuring the debate, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael’s leader again ruled out entering into a coalition with Sinn Fein after the election.\n\nMs McDonald said “Tweedledum and Tweedledee” seemed to believe they were the only ones who should really be in Government.\n\nAsked why the public should believe Mr Martin’s pledge on Sinn Fein having previously u-turned on ruling out a coalition with Fine Gael, he said there are “fundamental differences” between his party and Ms McDonald’s.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the broadcast, he said such a question was a “scare tactic” to “frighten the middle ground”.\n\nElsewhere, Mr Martin said Fianna Fail had taken “radical action” while holding the housing portfolio.\n\nIt came after Ireland’s Housing Commission called for a radical reset in housing policy.\n\nMr Harris argued that housing is the “number one priority”, as he sought to contextualise comments from a former Fine Gael housing minister, Eoghan Murphy, who has said the party had not made the policy area its focus.

He was convicted of all 34 charges earlier this year, but his sentencing has been indefinitely postponed.And the president-elect and several of his allies were indicted in Fulton County, Georgia, on racketeering charges, but that case has been placed on hold amid a legal challenge to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' role in the case.During his MSNBC interview on Tuesday, Schiff, who recently won his Senate race in California, mentioned special counsel John Durham, who was tapped to investigate the Justice Department's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Durham did not secure convictions in any of the cases.\"You can very well see a lot of prosecutors, like Durham, who spend millions of taxpayer dollars to come up with nothing,\" Schiff told MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace. \"Pam Bondi follows through with what she's pledged to do, which is to investigate nonexistent voter fraud, for example, or to go after the prosecutors.\"Schiff, a Democrat and former federal prosecutor, frequently drew Trump's ire during his first term in the Oval Office, largely because he spearheaded the House of Representatives' impeachment proceedings against Trump over the White House's Ukraine scandal in 2019.Trump repeatedly suggested arresting Schiff for \"treason,\" though there was no evidence that Schiff had engaged in any wrongdoing.In one post to X, formerly Twitter, Trump demanded that Schiff be \"questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\" claiming his \"lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber.\"\"Rep.

By the time it was phased out in 2023, it provided over 66,000 rebates to low-income consumers at a cost of more than $354 million. \n\n💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸\n\nAccording to data from the California Air Resources Board, the program helped fund the purchase of over 594,000 vehicles, saved more than 456 million gallons of fuel, and helped remove more than 3.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) from the air.\n\n\"Consumers continue to prove the skeptics wrong – zero-emission vehicles are here to stay,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"We will intervene if the Trump Administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California. We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future — we’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute.\"\n\nMusk and Newsom clash over exclusions\n\nIn a report from Bloomberg shortly after Newsom's announcement was published, the Governor's office told the publication that the current proposal includes what it calls \"market-share limitations\" that would render Tesla (TSLA) brand EVs illegible for said rebates; though it wasn't made clear if other large automakers like Ford (F) or General Motors (GM) would also be excluded on similar grounds.\n\n\"It’s about creating the market conditions for more of these car makers to take root,\" Gov. Newsom's office told Bloomberg.\n\nIn response to this development, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter (now known as X) to decry Newsom's announcement as a political stunt, calling it “insane,” going on to point out that “Tesla is the only company who manufacturers their EVs in California.”\n\nAnother prominent politician weighs in\n\nIn a separate post on X, Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna (CA-17) echoed Musk's sentiment, saying that intentionally excluding Tesla from a potential EV incentive would be \"foolish.\" \n\nGiven that Newsom is shortlisted as a Democratic Party contender in 2028, he also noted that a move like this is a mistake made again by party leaders, echoing the Biden administration’s exclusion of Tesla from a 2021 EV summit. \n\n“Tesla makes over 550,000 vehicles in Fremont in my district & employs over 20,000. Let’s not play politics with keeping manufacturing in California. It would be foolish to exclude Tesla. Have we learned nothing from snubbing Elon Musk at the Biden EV summit?” the Congressman wrote.\n\nTesla bull says Newsom proposal can spark 'Game of Thrones' battle against Tesla\n\nThe political nature of this move has watchful analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives turning another page in the storybook. \n\nIn an analyst note published on November 26, Ives reiterates Wedbush's \"Outperform\" rating and $400 price target on Tesla stock. The Tesla bull said that the Newsom office's messaging to Bloomberg could set off a \"Game of Thrones Battle vs. Musk,\" as it is \"clearly a political move of Newsom and California towards\" the Tesla CEO.\n\nMore Business of EVs:\n\nBentley's first foray into EVs will debut in 2026Trump’s EPA pick Lee Zeldin is the EV industry’s worst nightmareToyota exec slams \"impossible\" EV mandate amidst political chaos\n\n\"With the majority of EVs sold in California being Teslas, this would be a risky political move in our view as ultimately the only EV actually produced in California is Tesla, and we could see Musk moving more jobs from Fremont to Austin if Newsom goes ahead and excludes Tesla from these tax credits,\" Ives wrote.\n\n\"We note that Tesla [vehicles] accounted for 55% of all new EVs registered in California so far in 2024 and represent the vast majority of EVs sold to date over the last 5 years.\"\n\nHowever, Ives notes that despite his concern about this move, he is still betting on Tesla fully adopting a pathway of autonomy and robotics. He expects this to be Tesla's \"golden goose\" for as long as Newsom does not intervene. \n\n\"We could also see Newsome trying to head down this path next on the FSD/autonomous front given its the path Trump/Musk are heading down.\"\n\nEnding Fed. EV tax credits will severely gut EV sales, economist says\n\nPolitics aside, experts believe that sales of electric cars will severely plummet if the Trump administration follows through on eliminating the Biden Administration EV tax credits.\n\nIn a new report dubbed “The Effects of ‘Buy American’: Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act, UC Berkeley professor Joseph Shapiro, Stanford professor Hunt Allcott, and Duke University professor Felix Tintelnot noted that sales of new EVs would fall 27% in a situation similar to what Trump's transition team had proposed.\n\nTheir simulations found that electric vehicle registrations would drop from 1.184 million down to 867,000, reflecting a loss of 317,000 EVs from America's roads. \n\n\"It's a rapidly growing market and relatively new technology, but [eliminating the federal EV tax credit] is not trivial.

From left Peter Neal, Little Hunter, Baby Beau, Hunter Biden, President Biden, Maisy Biden, Naomi Biden, Ashley Biden, Finnegan Biden and Natalie Biden \n\nThe Bidens have been going to Nantucket for 49 years, dating back to when Biden was a U.S. senator. \n\nIn his 2017 memoir 'Promise me Dad,' Biden wrote that Thanksgiving in 1975 was the first holiday he and his now-wife Jill spent together, going to Nantucket with his young sons Beau and Hunter for a little bonding time.\n\nThey rarely have missed a holiday on Nantucket since. \n\nOne of the few Thanksgivings the Bidens missed there was in 2015, which took place about six months after Beau Biden died. \n\nThe family went to Rome instead. They also skipped going in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe island became a spot of many memories for the family. Beau proposed to his future wife Hallie at the town's 2001 Christmas Tree lighting and married her at a downtown church. \n\n'We had some great years in that span, and we had some lousy years, but whatever was happening, whatever bumps and bruises we were suffering, we put it all aside and celebrated Thanksgiving in Nantucket,' the president wrote in his memoir. \n\n'The holiday trip was a constant in our grandchildren's lives from the time they were aware, and they made it clear how much it meant to them.'\n\nWhile on the island, the Bidens stay at Rubenstein's $34 million 13-acre compound on Nantucket Harbor. \n\nIt's a sprawling property that sits on the island's secluded inner harbor with gorgeous views of the water as the sun sets in the background. \n\nRubenstein bought the waterfront property in 2000 for his now ex-wife Alice and their three children. He tore down the existing house and put up a 13,000-square-foot home which features a tennis court, swimming pool, hot tub and private dock.\n\nZillow estimates it would cost $30,000 a month to rent. \n\nThe house is located on historic Abrams Point off of Polpis Road - named after one of the last surviving Native Americans of the Wampanoag people, Abram Quary.\n\nBiden started Thanksgiving celebration son Monday when he pardoned two turkeys - Peach and Blossom - in his final turkey pardoning as president. \n\nThe commander-in-chief filled his speech with cringeworthy one-liners about 'fowl' play that was at one point interrupted by Peach's gurgle.\n\n'Yeah I hear you. Peach wants to speak a little bit,' Biden responded. \n\n'They tell me 2500 people are here… looking for a pardon!' Biden joked as he addressed the crowd on the South Lawn.\n\n'Keep calm and gobble on' he added before turning to a more serious note to reflect on the 'honor of a lifetime' serving as president.\n\nThe lame duck President Joe Biden gave Thanksgiving pardons to turkeys Blossom and Peach on Monday to save them from an American family feast\n\nBeau Biden examines one of the turkeys\n\n82-year-old President Joe Biden joked about his age - and getting 'fired' - as he served up Brussels sprouts at a Coast Guard 'Friendsgiving' Monday night on Staten Island\n\nThe topic of pardons has been constant in the White House with Hunter Biden facing sentencing for tax crimes next months. \n\nThe president has said repeatedly he won't pardon or commute his son's sentence.\n\nBut Biden does have the power to give a reprieve to anyone he wants, including his son, those people worried about retribution from Donald Trump, and even turkeys.\n\n'I hereby pardon Peach and Blossom!,' he declared. While he did the pardoning, Hunter's son Baby Beau watched from the sidelines. \n\nBlossom and Peach weight 40 and 41 pounds, respectively, and were raised on a farm in Northfield, Minnesota.\n\nThey were raised by John Zimmerman, chairman of the National Turkey Federation, and his 9-year-old son, Grant.\n\nAfter being pardoned by, the turkeys will return to live at Farmamerica, an agricultural interpretive center in Waseca, Minnesota.\n\nAfter the pardoning, he and first lady Jill Biden went to Staten Island, to celebrate a 'Friendsgiving' with Coast Guard members and their families.\n\nHunter BidenJoe BidenPoliticsJill Biden\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nHunter and Baby Beau join lame duck Joe for Thanksgiving vacation in mega-wealthy enclave\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Hunter Biden, wife Melissa Cohen and son Baby Beau joined lame duck President Joe Biden for the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14130341/Hunter-baby-beau-joe-biden-thanksgiving.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/27/00/92523821-0-image-m-14_1732668002243.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/11/25/3658119081698542476/1024x576_MP4_3658119081698542476.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-27 00:47:53","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.413},{"id":267890496,"title":"Australia’s Emissions Reduction Forecast Improves to Nearly 43 Percent: Climate Change Minister","text":"Australia’s emissions reduction forecast has improved to 42.6 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, up from 37 percent last year.\n\nClimate Change Minister Chris Bowen is set to table the Department of Climate Change and Energy’s latest annual emissions scorecard before Parliament on Nov. 28.\n\nA day before, Bowen highlighted in a series of media interviews that the government’s policies are on track to achieve the emissions targets.\n\n“We’ve seen more investment in renewable energy than we did in all of last year,” he said.\n\nHe added that the investment pipeline in renewable energy is now massive, equivalent to two-thirds of the existing National Energy Market.\n\nBowen also addressed the upcoming 2035 emissions targets, confirming that the government will rely on independent advice from the Climate Change Authority.\n\nHe noted that Australia is well-positioned to take advantage of global shifts in the energy market.\n\n“Every challenge is an opportunity.

Or cause, as the examples above show. \n\nMacKenzie Scott, conversely, is proof that negative adages don’t always apply to people who are handed a silver spoon. She is far from a boastful billionaire a la Musk and his buddy, President-elect Donald Trump. Nor is she an interfering presence like her ex-husband Bezos. Scott, and her “trust-based” philanthropy are, instead, a soothing balm to nonprofits across the country, including here in Chicago.\n\nJust this week, Community Investment Corp. announced it received a record-breaking $15 million donation from Scott, who stands out from other megadonors by handing out unrestricted, no-strings-attached grants.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time Scott gave to CIC, a lender that helps acquire, rehab and preserve affordable rental housing. Scott gifted the organization $8 million in 2020, an unprecedented moment of “great need” CIC’s CEO and president said then. \n\nStacie Young, the nonprofit’s current head, called Scott’s latest contribution “transformational.” \n\nMany of the 2,300 nonprofits Scott has given $17.3 billion in the last five years would probably agree. Recipients experienced “profound effects” as a result of Scott’s generosity, according to a second year of a three-year study released by the Center for Effective Philanthropy in late 2023.\n\n“These large sums of unrestricted money have allowed organizations to fulfill basic, unmet needs — from expanding programs to strengthening financial sustainability to improving operations,” the study found in its first year.\n\nSome other findings from the latest research: \n\n• Eighty-eight percent of interviewees said Scott’s grant’s improved morale, feelings of empowerment, or capacity to think creatively.\n\n• Two-thirds of the nonprofits’ leaders of color said the funding from Scott was such a boost, they found themselves to be more assertive in their decision-making and more vocal in their advocacy for their communities within and outside their workplaces.\n\n• And nearly 90% of nonprofit leaders said Scott’s contributions changed their approach to fundraising, as many of them frequently were able to cite the grants to bolster their organizations’ credibility.\n\nWhile these statistics only capture the short-term impact of Scott’s goodwill, they carry a sense of hope and promise for the years to come. \n\nScott’s “Yield Giving” venture often benefits groups that focus on equity and justice, economic security, health, environmental justice, child development and legal aid.\n\nGiving without asking for anything in return is always a welcoming breath of fresh air. But at a moment when companies are rolling back diversity initiatives and there’s a looming threat hampering many of the causes Scott is backing, her style of altruism is a necessary lifeline. \n\n“Something greater rises up every time we give,” Scott wrote in 2019. “My approach to philanthropy will continue to be thoughtful. It will take time and effort and care. But I won’t wait. And I will keep at it until the safe is empty.”\n\nWe are thankful that no matter how much money she gives away, the woman worth $37.1 billion appears to have a heart that is full. \n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com\n\nThe Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds.

Al Sharpton has been “ricocheting around the halls” of 30 Rock with his colleagues calling it a “bridge too far” for them, Fox News Digital has learned. \n\nOn Tuesday, MSNBC said it was “unaware” that Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign paid $500,000 to Sharpton’s National Action Network nonprofit ahead of a friendly interview with the Democratic nominee just weeks before the election. \n\n“MSNBC was unaware of the donations made to the National Action Network,” an MSNBC spokesperson told the Washington Free Beacon, which first broke the story.\n\nHarris sat down for a friendly interview on Oct. 20 with Sharpton, an open supporter of Harris and the Democratic Party. Following Harris’ defeat to President-elect Donald Trump, FEC filings revealed the Harris campaign gave two $250,000 donations to Sharpton’s nonprofit organization in September and October. \n\nHowever, the MSNBC weekend host did not disclose to viewers the apparent conflict of interest before or after the interview. Neither did he disclose the donations to his bosses at the network, according to the Free Beacon.\n\n“No one’s surprised that anybody at MSNBC was rooting for Harris. This feels like another level of nonsense. Like, you’re kidding me, right? This is weird,” the current MSNBC employee reacted to Fox News Digital. “Harris could have given Al Sharpton an interview, and it would have gone the same way. But what are you paying for?… There’s no way that this can’t seem weird.”\n\n“Everybody knows who Al Sharpton is… but this feels like a bridge too far. A big bridge too far… This is not landing well,” they continued. “This has a bit of a dirty feel to it… These things happen and they don’t bounce around MSNBC all that much. Like people just don’t care. This one feels, I’d say, there’s a deeper disappointment. There’s a sense of like, ugh, we don’t need this. This feels kind of grifty and gross.”\n\nThe insider says everyone at MSNBC knows Sharpton is given a “wide berth” and that he’s “not held to the same journalistic standard” as others at MSNBC since he’s far more known outside the network for his high-profile political and social activism. That said, the controversy reeks of a “pay-to-play” scheme. \n\n“There is a sense among the people I’ve spoken to that this feels like something wrong and that something should be done about it,” the MSNBC employee said. “I don’t know what that something is… That’s a lot of money! That’s not a small matter… It just doesn’t sit well with people.”\n\nThey, however, cast doubt that Sharpton will face any consequences, telling Fox News Digital “Generally speaking, people do things and they kind of get away with them at MSNBC, I mean, other than in the Me Too era.” \n\n“I don’t care whether somebody does something to Al. I’m more interested in where does this fit into who we are,” the MSNBC insider said. “How does this s— happen? How does half a million dollars change hands?… How can you possibly think you’re holding somebody to account in an interview when they donate money to you? We’re told not to take tickets to a ballgame!” \n\n“It’s got a real bulls— feel to it. People who like Al and respect him and understand what his value is… it ranges from disappointment to disgust. \n\n“Not a whole ton of surprise, I will tell you that,” they continued. “There are some organizational rules – I understand he has different rules, but they can’t be that, that you donate money and then you get an interview. That can’t be acceptable… I think a three-year-old would see a potential conflict in this.” \n\nThe MSNBC staffer was taken aback by the network being caught flat-footed by the controversy. \n\n“For MSNBC to start by saying they weren’t aware of it to start with, like, wow. That’s something… Everything about this stinks,” they said. \n\n“Like, why did the campaign not think that this would come out and be a really bad look for them? I mean, if Kamala Harris had become president, it’d be a scandal!… You’re not gonna sway my opinion for tickets to a ballgame but for half a million dollars? You might!” \n\n“That kind of money should not be changing hands to people who are cosplaying being a journalist. Maybe that’s not a fair term because I don’t know, is he a journalist? I don’t know. \n\n“But that just feels a little bit like pay to play and it doesn’t feel right In an organization that we’re all still part of. I understand that not everyone is held to the same standard, but there should be a set of common rules. \n\n“And my understanding of this is that this would be breaking a rule… it feels like I couldn’t get away with that,” the employee added. \n\nMSNBC did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. \n\nFox News’ Brian Flood contributed to this report.","summary":"\"Everybody knows who Al Sharpton is… but this feels like a bridge too far,\" an MSNBC employee said. \"This has a bit of a dirty feel to it.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/media/al-sharptons-acceptance-of-kamala-harris-campaigns-500k-donation-a-bridge-too-far-for-msnbc-colleagues/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/msnbc-al-sharpton.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1732646932&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 00:44:25","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.766},{"id":267896072,"title":"Walmart Abandons ‘Transgender’ Products for Kids, DEI Policies","text":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is scaling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion—or DEI—policies, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe retailer confirmed that it would not renew a five-year commitment for a racial equity center created after the death of George Floyd in 2020, it would withdraw from a gay rights index from the LGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign measuring workplace “inclusion,” and it would begin tracking third-party retailers to cease the sale of “transgender” items for minors, according to The AP. Walmart will also stop giving priority treatment to suppliers based on DEI factors such as race or gender, the AP reported.\n\nWalmart said it will be monitoring its third-party marketplace items more closely to ensure they do not feature sexual and transgender products marketed toward minors, including chest binders intended for youth, according to the AP.\n\n“Our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today,” Walmart said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. “We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging; to open doors to opportunities for all our associates customers, and suppliers; and to be a Walmart for everyone.”\n\nVarious corporations have been quietly backpedaling their DEI practices amid intense public and legal pressure from consumers and shareholders. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized DEI practices and promised to uproot “woke” ideology. Dozens of investment advisors sent letters on Nov. 15 warning several of America’s largest corporations that their diversity programs will become a liability when Trump returns to the White House.\n\nSeveral companies have faced backlash for supporting DEI and LGBTQ initiatives, including Target, which reported in August 2023 that it was lowering its sales and profit expectations for the rest of the year after it faced criticism over the release of LGBTQ products for children. \n\nTarget announced in May that it would only sell its LGBTQ “Pride” collection online and at select stores after boycotts cost the retailer nearly $13 billion in market value the summer prior, according to Bloomberg. The retailer’s stock prices also dropped in 2016 amid boycotts after it introduced a policy allowing customers to choose the dressing room or restroom that aligned with their gender identity.\n\nBud Light’s pours reportedly declined in thousands of bars and restaurants across the U.S. after the brand partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023. The company lost $1.4 billion in U.S. beer sales in 2023 due to boycotts over the marketing decision, according to Forbes.\n\nOther major companies have also recently backtracked DEI-related policies, including Lowe’s, Ford, and Stanley Black & Decker.

Democrat leaders know that. They created Harris and they will break her. She never won any general or primary election for president in 2020 or 2024. Kamala is done.\n\nNo candidate other than Donald Trump and two others in U.S. history ever won a presidential election after losing one – and he continues to show how special he is. Trump won despite a billion dollars given to Harris, 45-plus legal actions by Democrat prosecutors against him (including two impeachments, the Mueller investigation, FBI illegal FISA warrants, FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago, Jan. 6 committee), media bias, false polls, China interference, Barack, Michelle, Oprah and cheating by Democrats. \n\nAfter being shot in the ear by an assassin, Trump jumped up with his fist in the air and shouted to his MAGA troops to “fight, fight, fight!” Even Mark Zuckerberg agreed that Trump is special. \n\nOn Trump’s coattails, Republicans won the House, the Senate, a majority of governorships and state legislatures, while six of the nine Supreme Court justices have now been appointed by Republican presidents. \n\nTrump beat the establishment Republicans and RINOs like Liz Cheney, Barbara Comstock, Nikki Haley, John Bolton, Mitt Romney, Gen. Kelly, et al. who campaigned against him. They are all gone, and Trump still reigns over the Republican Party. MAGA thrives as the establishment dies. \n\nTrump is the first Republican presidential candidate to win the Hispanic vote. He won the white female vote, the Catholic vote, the Christian vote, the under-30 vote and a fourth of the black male vote.\n\nAnd now Trump is mentoring a whole slew of young replacements for when he is gone, just as any good business CEO does. Just as he did with sons Don Jr. and Eric. Just as his father did with him. Trump is mentoring J.D. Vance, Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard and others in the Trump Cabinet.\n\nUnderstandably, Democrat leaders are worried. Trump is building a legacy of young replacements and new voters who will choose Republicans in the future, support that did not exist prior to now. And he is preventing illegal aliens from being new Democrat voters.\n\nWokeness is dead. DEI is dead. Race-based politics is dead. Gender-based politics is dying. The deep state is critically wounded, and globalists are on the run. China sees more tariffs coming. George Soros, Bill Gates and their friends were beaten by Elon Musk and his friends. Woke military leaders are about to retire en mass. Pharma companies, CDC, WHO and Tony Fauci see RFK Jr. coming for them wearing a big white hat on a big white horse with his silver bullets, as he yells, “Hi ho Silver, away!” \n\nWhat does that leave Democrats? Agnostic/atheist voters, government employees (including public-school teachers), Jews, feminists, Hollywood and black women. Democrat leaders are worried.\n\nThink for a second …\n\nWhat if the next Republican presidential candidate is Marco Rubio (Hispanic, Catholic, speaks Spanish fluently and is a retired military officer with a law degree from the University of Miami) with Tulsi Gabbard (female Democrat converted to Republican) as his running mate?\n\nOr how about J.D. Vance (middle-class rust belt, ex-Marine Catholic with a law degree from Yale) with Rubio or Gabbard as his running mate?\n\nOr how about Gabbard with Rubio as her running mate?\n\nAny of those tickets solidify MAGA voters, military voters, average working-class Americans in the battleground states, disgruntled Democrat voters, Hispanics, Catholics, Christians and white women for Republicans.\n\nIt is now entirely possible that Republicans will control the White House for the next 12 years. That could mean that all nine of the Supreme Court justices in 2036 will have been appointed by Republican presidents. No constitutional amendments will have been ratified by three-fourths of the states to codify abortion or to make D.C. a state. The right to freedom of religion anytime and anywhere and the right to bear arms will carry on for at least two more decades, since no far-left politician could be elected president.\n\nNo politician who does not pledge to put America first will be elected president for the next couple of decades.\n\nThis loss by Harris to Trump is much bigger than the media, Democrats, establishment politicians and deep state are admitting. Democrat leaders are very worried. Rich Democrat donors who own the Democratic Party are even more worried.","summary":"'No politician who's not America First will be elected president for the next couple of decades'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2024/11/trumps-win-is-bigger-than-you-think-and-dems-are-worried/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/republicans-democrats-symbols.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-27 00:42:22","author":"Michael Master","authors":["Michael Master"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":267888510,"title":"Seoul shares open lower on tech slump","text":"South Korean stocks opened lower Wednesday, led by chipmakers, amid uncertainties surrounding the US semiconductor policy under the new Donald Trump administration.\n\nThe benchmark Kospi fell 6.59 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,513.77 in the first 15 minutes of trading.\n\nOvernight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.28 percent to a new record, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite added 0.63 percent.
