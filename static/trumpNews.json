Japan can be more important in Iran's energy, oil, and economy section,\" the former ambassador to Japan told Kyodo News, giving his first exclusive interview after being approved by the Iranian parliament on Wednesday to serve as foreign minister for the next four years. Iran will welcome Japanese companies interested in working in the oil and energy sector, the minister said, adding that Japan can return to Iran's oil fields and contribute to expanding its oil production. Due to hundreds of unilateral sanctions on Iran's economy, including banking and trade, imposed by the U.S. government in the past decade to curb Iran's nuclear activities, Japan had to abandon the Iranian market. Araghchi believes that Iran and Japan, with their distinct yet complementary capabilities, hold immense potential for forging a mutually beneficial and stabilizing partnership across Asia. \"In this light, expanding economic and trade ties between Iran and Japan emerges as a natural and logical choice,\" he said. \"We anticipate that this collaboration will continue to flourish on a path of fruitful cooperation.\" On Iran's foreign policy priorities going forward, Araghchi said the new government has designated cultivating relations with East Asia a pivotal objective, and emphasized \"Japan's prominent position\" in this context. Explaining his strategy to boost ties with Japan while U.S. sanctions impede Iran's ability to have normal relations with the world, the foreign minister said that in the face of global uncertainties and rapid transformations, it is imperative to unlock new avenues for economic and trade cooperation between Iran and Japan. \"We must transcend obstacles hindering our mutual interests and prioritize our vital needs. By comprehensively evaluating the current landscape, we can forge a constructive partnership to drive both nations' progress and prosperity,\" he said. Regarding Japan's initiatives to address the hostility between Tehran and Washington in 2019, Araghchi said that Iran and Japan have nurtured a bond characterized by friendship, mutual understanding, respect and trust. The leadership of both nations appreciates this unwavering foundation. \"It enables Iran and Japan to jointly address global and regional challenges with a shared spirit of constructiveness and optimism. I would say there is always a space for contributing initiatives,\" he said. Araghchi, known for his friendly ties with Japan, was ambassador to the country from 2008 to 2011. He played a significant role when the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Tehran in 2019 to mediate between the United States and Iran, conveying a message from then U.S. President Donald Trump to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The foreign minister explained that as a crucial step toward lifting the sanctions on Iran's economy and returning it to normal trade relations in the international community, Iran's Foreign Ministry will seek to manage tensions with Washington and rebuild ties with European countries, but only if they abandon their \"hostile approach\" while aiming to revive the 2015 nuclear deal and lift sanctions. \"In my foreign policy address to the Islamic Consultative Assembly, I highlighted the crucial objective of lifting sanctions, particularly unilateral ones, through earnest, focused, and time-bound negotiations while upholding the nation's fundamental principles,\" the foreign minister said. Iran struck a landmark nuclear pact in 2015 with six major powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. However, Trump criticized the deal as flawed and pulled the United States out of it in May 2018. Iran countered the U.S. move by increasing its nuclear activities beyond the limits set in the deal. Araghchi, a veteran diplomat who has also served as ambassador to Finland and Estonia, played a vital role in finalizing the 2015 nuclear deal as Iran's deputy foreign minister and senior negotiator. In 2021, then President Hassan Rouhani appointed him as Iran's chief negotiator to run talks aimed at reviving the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but the effort remains incomplete due to the presidential election and government change in Iran.

Its result is preordained, the narrative is scripted, and the enthusiasm is performative. While it’s impossible to actually knock a political convention from being the lead story in most news publications, former President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy have a unique opportunity to do so Friday, shifting the spotlight from Chicago to an unorthodox political alliance that may give Trump back some of the momentum he had before Vice President Kamala Harris took the top spot on the 2024 ticket. Kennedy running mate Nicole Shanahan raised the prospect of an alliance between the GOP nominee and the independent candidate. “There’s two options that we’re looking at, and one is staying in, forming that new party, but we run the risk of a Kamala Harris and [Tim] Walz presidency because we draw votes from Trump,” she said on the Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu podcast. Once a third-party campaign starts floating these kinds of scenarios, the game is about over. Kennedy recently made news for a conversation with Trump that included talk of a role in a future Republican administration if he endorsed the GOP nominee, followed by a failed attempt to talk to Harris about a job should she be elected. So the trial balloon shouldn’t be surprising, especially since Kennedy has long since lost much of his initial voter interest in surveys. But polls also give us a positive. Even a diminished Kennedy, rendered grotesque by stories of dropping off bear corpses in Central Park and eating remarkably canine-looking goats, is a valuable asset given he still has appeal in the handful of battleground states that will decide who wins in November. If Kennedy is serious about being an boon to Trump and running-mate J.D. Vance, it would be political malpractice not to allow him to be part of the package. This is despite some polling, such as a Cygnal survey of Pennsylvania, saying he as a spoiler candidate helps Trump win but voters go to Harris if he leaves the race. After all, trends are showing those voters are going somewhere anyway, and it may as well happen now, when more battleground state polls than not show Kennedy support larger than the gap between Trump and Harris. Other national polling shows Kennedy is most popular among Republicans at this point. An Economist/YouGov Poll conducted August 17 to 20 finds him above 50% with the GOP, another reason this makes sense. One caveat: It’s not as if the Kennedy side isn’t seeking assurances if they fall in line, though. As Shanahan went on to say: “Do we trust Trump and his personal sincerity to really do the right thing for our country, end chronic disease, balance the budget, end these forever wars? Is he somebody that’s going to continue to invite people like Bobby and [me] into the conversation? Or is he going to fall victim again to the things he fell victim to in his first administration?” Kennedy has said he will “talk with leaders of any political party to further the goals I have served for 40 years in my career and in this campaign,” such as “reversing the chronic disease epidemic, ending the war machine, cleaning corporate influence out of government and toxic pollution out of the environment, protecting freedom of speech and ending politicization of enforcement agencies.” Is that a place Donald Trump’s Republican Party really wants to go? Alternatively, is Kennedy willing to take victories in a couple of areas and concede on the rest? The question of whether the juice is worth the squeeze should be central to both sides’ thinking. But in terms of narrative, it’s a winner. This season has been a breakneck campaign, and Team Trump has looked low energy in contrast with the pop culture push of the Harris spectacle. A Kennedy pick can reset the narrative and jump start the electorate. Especially in the battleground states.","summary":"There are a couple of days left of the&nbsp;Democratic National Convention.

The former president later denied that he ever floated Dimon's name.Dimon also appears to be an option for Harris' cabinet.A source familiar with the matter told CNBC that among names floated, Harris' orbit has mentioned Dimon for the same role in conversations that took place during the Democratic National Convention this week in Chicago.A spokesperson for the Harris campaign and a spokesperson for JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment.Dimon has previously tried to tame speculation about a potential White House role amid discussions around his retirement and an August op-ed in The Washington Post in which he called for unity but stopped short of endorsing a 2024 candidate.When the CEO was asked in August if he would take up the Treasury Secretary role during an interview on CNBC's \"The Exchange,\" Dimon avoided giving a direct answer but seemed to suggest that he was focused on his current role at JPMorgan.\"I am very happy with what I'm doing,\" he said in the interview. \"I say it over and over, but I'm very happy with what I'm doing.\"CNBC's Leslie Picker followed up: \"So that would be a no to President Trump if you were called — \"\"I'm very happy with what I'm doing,\" Dimon interrupted.Dimon also has hinted at an impending retirement.For years, Dimon has teased that he would retire in the next five years, but the CEO said in May at an annual investor meeting that the timeline was \"not five years anymore\" and that a plan to announce a successor was \"well on its way.\"\"Well, eventually, I have to leave,\" Dimon told CNBC, adding: \"But even if I'm done as CEO, I might be chairman for a year or two.

Then, forget the smooth sailing. \"We have been in this environment where there has just been much distrust sewn into the system,\" Ottawa County Clerk Justin Roebuck told CBS News. Roebuck, a Republican who runs the county's elections, is no stranger to this skepticism. He said he talks to residents \"who do still have really serious concerns\" that the 2020 election was stolen. That distrust was on display during the Michigan primaries earlier this month. \"It's hard to trust sometimes. It's hard to trust,\" one skeptical voter told CBS News. But Roebuck is trying to convince these people that the data doesn't lie.\"We conduct post-election audits where we have a 100% accuracy rate on the equipment itself,\" Roebuck said, adding that \"it's a 100% accuracy rate. It's not even 99. And we would tell you if it was 99.\"The distrust helped push Teresa DeGraaf, former clerk for Ottawa County's Port Sheldon Township, to retire.\"It's really hard to do a job where you know you are doing everything right and be attacked,\" DeGraaf told CBS News. \"… And I just want to say that everyone that works (in elections), those are your friends, your family, your neighbors.

That's just under half of Democratic respondents, 56% of whom said they are very confident. The poll also found that 32% of Republicans were \"not confident\" in their state's voting system, as opposed to only 8% of Democrats. So far this year, former President Donald Trump has publicly said the election system is rigged more than 140 times, despite dozens of audits and lawsuits that found no fraud in 2020. \"If we cannot trust the way that we choose our government, we are in a bad situation as a country,\" Roebuck said. That's why Roebuck is working on restoring that trust. He's conducted demonstrations for residents about how voting machines work. He has also confronted local officials who have alleged fraud. And with the presidential election less than three months away, clerks like Roebuck are rebuilding that trust one conversation at a time. \"We live in this community too,\" Roebuck said. \"We shop here, kids go to school here, we go to church together, and we need to be able to build those bridges.\"","summary":"According to a new CBS News poll, Republicans are about half as likely as Democrats to say they're very confident in their state's voting system.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justin-roebuck-republican-official-michigan-build-trust-election-process-ottawa-county-clerk/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/21/fc9d6e1b-8339-4b9f-9bd5-8c6c656b6238/thumbnail/1200x630/ad4ab802a752ab6928aed6319e27b575/1724283050128.png?v=fd6e213336f58b575c9e836e95546d26","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3138310_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-08-22 00:04:37","author":"Adriana Diaz","authors":["Adriana Diaz"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":254639358,"title":"United States’ Divisive Politics","text":"The assassination attempt against former US president and current presidential candidate, Donald Trump, while he was addressing a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday, July 13, has deeply shaken the US and is set to define everything until the November 5 elections, which are the most crucial elections in the history of mankind and concern every person on the planet. This assassination attempt, the first since that of former Republican Presi-dent Ronald Reagan in 1981, marks yet another new chapter in the dark histo-ry of political violence in the US. After all, the history of the United States is marked by the assassination of four presidents during their term of office. Specifically, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865 in his gallery at Ford’s Theater in Washing-ton by an actor, John Wilkes Booth. The second president to be assassinated was James Garfield, 20th President of the United States, who died after being attacked on July 2, 1881, at a Washing-ton, D.C. train station by Charles Guite-au, a lawyer who was desperately look-ing for a job as a civil servant. William McKinley, 25th President of the United States, while receiving dignitaries at the Pan-American Exposition in Buf-falo on September 6, 1901, was wound-ed by an anarchist who fired several bullets. He died a few days later from his injuries. Finally, in more recent history, many remember November 22, 1963, when John Fitzgerald Kennedy, JFK, was assassinated in Dallas. That day, around 12:30 p.m., as the presidential limousine drove through the crowds that had gathered in the streets of Dal-las, gunshots rang out. John Fitzger-ald Kennedy immediately collapsed, with his wife Jackie at his side. The 35th American President was then pronounced dead at 1:00 PM at the hospital. The attack, therefore, is an event, which without a doubt is going to bring about changes in the political developments of the already turbu-lent pre-election period. A period that has already gone through forty waves after Joe Biden’s self-destructive ap-pearance in the debate, which raised serious questions about his age, his intellectual clarity, but also about his ability to conduct a dynamic election campaign, and which ultimately led to his resignation from the candidacy for the upcoming presidential elections. The targeting of the former pres-ident at a rally just days before the acceptance of the anointing by the Re-publican National Convention in Mil-waukee, which was carried out on July 15-18, is an attack on Democracy and the right of every American citizen to choose their leaders. The violence that infects and affects American political life is clearly antithetical to Democracy. It was August 31, 2023, when the mil-itant journalist and former Fox News host, Tucker Carlson, estimated that Donald Trump might be assassinated after impeachment campaigns, accu-sations and smears failed miserably to dent his popularity. The ruthless 20-year-old perpetrator, Thomas Matthew Crooks and ruthless because his shots killed at least one American citizen and seriously injured two others, one very seriously, was a member of the international far-left or-ganization “ANTIFA” and an extreme supporter of Joe Biden and the Dem-ocrats. He had even donated $15 to a political action committee that raised money for Democratic politicians. However, he had after also reg-istered with the Republicans (or at least “appeared” a “convenient” reg-istration) in order to be able to be at Trump’s speech and be able to get close enough to fire his killer shots. The American Republic in recent years has suffered the most brutal interventions of the “deep state”, i.e. the military-industrial complex and the security and intelligence services. This period is the most dangerous in US history, because the “deep state” along with its political operatives and complicit media demonized the former president, not caring that they were di-viding American society and cultivat-ing the climate for the assassination attempt on Trump. So, many American citizens became addicted to hate Trump to death, since every day the complicit media propa-gated with countless vulgarities that the former president was a “disgust-ing traitor”, a “Russian agent”, a “new Hitler”, or a “psychopathic tyrant”. The entangled media with the “deep state” which give no reason, are not controlled, but they have enormous powers to destroy the rights and liber-ties of the American people as defined by the Constitution. And today we again see some com-plicit media, in order to avoid the pos-sible ‘heroization’ of Trump, rushing to completely deconstruct the fact of the attempted political assassination, spreading with disinformation tactics rumors that the near-assassin had no political activity or extreme ideology, but simply he had psychological prob-lems. The specific former president, there-fore, is considered an independent per-sonality who is not influenced by the so-called “deep state” and is inspired by a patriotic political mentality. Don-ald Trump is pro-America, anti-world government, and pro-ending the war in Ukraine, the continuation of which poses a very serious risk of nuclear war and thus the total destruction of humanity. Trump is the second leader of the anti-woke agenda after Slova-kia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico that they attempted to assassinate within two months, and while Trump is run-ning dynamically for the presidency of the United States. A woke agenda that wants to abol-ish religions, nations, the institution of the family, genders and traditional rela-tionships and in general any tradition-al value that exists since the time when people began to consciously perceive themselves. A woke agenda that wants to create states that will be inhabited by mobs without national consciousness and identity, so populations that can be easily managed and controlled by the rulers of the planet. The internationalist class that has imposed this woke agenda through the media, education and every national criminal and civil code considers as “red flags” those leaders who react vigorously and resist and has put them in its sights. The assassination attempt on Don-ald Trump, then, could propel him to a landslide victory in the November elec-tion as his image as a fighter constant-ly under attack from his enemies will now be even more deeply entrenched in conjunction with a given wave of sympathy. The prospect of his victory, after all, was already established in ev-eryone’s minds, but what may change now is its potential size. In closing, I would like to emphasize that the American people will have to fight stubbornly and with great perse-verance to free themselves from the federal “deep state”. “Fight!” was the phrase of a bloodied and battered at right ear Donald Trump seconds after his assassination attempt, simultane-ously raising his fist in the air, encour-aging the large crowd of his supporters and ultimately creating an iconic im-age that will go down in history. • Karderinis is a journalist, novelist and poet","summary":"The assassination attempt against former US president and current presidential candidate, Donald Trump, while he was addressing a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday, July 13, has deeply shaken the US and is set to define everything until the November 5 elections, which are the most crucial elections in the history of mankind and concern [&#8230;]","url":"https://independent.ng/united-states-divisive-politics/","image":"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/images-17.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 00:04:00","author":"Isidoros Karderinis","authors":["Isidoros Karderinis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.12},{"id":254639656,"title":"Trump leaves bulletproof glass to help woman at first outdoor rally since assassination attempt","text":"Former President Donald Trump stepped out from behind his newly added bulletproof glass surrounding his podium to go help a rally attendee who was in need of medical attention.

He paused to turn to look at commotion taking place to the left side of his podium.

It is very hot. A lot of the people waited for days to get here. I understand it,” the former president said.

In the offending clip, which was posted to Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung‘s X account, “Freedom” plays over footage of the Republican presidential candidate stepping off a plane. The video arrived long after the song had become the official theme song for the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, with Vice President Harris playing the song at her first presidential campaign rally earlier this summer after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her candidacy. The Harris-Walz campaign’s use of the track, including in multiple campaign ads and at the Democratic National Convention, has been done with Beyoncé’s permission. As of this writing, the Trump video using “Freedom” remains on Cheung’s X account. This is far from the first time Trump has run afoul of an artist for using their song at campaign events and elsewhere without permission.

John Legend and Stevie Wonder also are expected to perform. Morris' scheduled appearance has resurfaced comments the singer has previously made about Trump and comes as Vice President Kamala Harris is poised to officially accept the Democratic party's nomination for the presidential election on Thursday.Newsweek reached out to the DNC, the Trump campaign and representatives for Morris by email for comment.In September 2023, Morris said she was moving away from country music because of the biases associated with the genre. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Morris opened up about her reasons behind distancing herself from country music.\"After the Trump years, people's biases were on full display. It just revealed who people really were and that they were proud to be misogynistic and racist and homophobic and transphobic,\" she said at the time. \"All these things were being celebrated, and it was weirdly dovetailing with this hyper-masculine branch of country music. I call it butt rock.\"Morris also spoke openly about her struggles as a woman in country music, and about her feud with Brittany and Jason Aldean, which escalated following Jason Aldean's controversial track \"Try That in a Small Town.\" Aldean has previously voiced his support for Trump, admitting that he has \"nothing but good things to say about\" the former president, and telling the Los Angeles Times that it \"wouldn't hurt my feelings\" if Trump landed the 2024 Republican nomination earlier this year, Newsweek previously reported.Morris, however, holds different political views. Earlier this month in an interview with USA Today, Morris vowed to support Kamala Harris in the November election.\"I campaigned for Biden and have met Kamala and she's a badass,\" Morris told USA Today. \"I feel invigorated to vote. Living in Tennessee, it feels more impactful to have that say.\"Last year, Morris pushed back against the country music genre, telling the Los Angeles Times that the way country music is sold \"feels like indoctrination\" and that some people are streaming country songs—such as Aldean's \"Try That in a Small Town\"—out of spite.\"It's not out of true joy or love of the music. It's to own the libs,\" she told the Los Angeles Times. \"And that's so not what music is intended for. Music is supposed to be the voice of the oppressed—the actual oppressed.

Melinda Arons, a former Nightline senior producer, Participant Media executive and Hillary Clinton campaign official, and former ABC News chief James Goldston produced the two shorts. One is meant to remind viewers of the horrific images of Jan. 6, 2021, and the other will make the case that Republican nominee Donald Trump is ready to repeat the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election was stolen. The two videos are part of a theme of “A Fight for Our Freedoms” on the third night of the convention. Goldston and Arons were tasked with helping make the House Select Committee on January 6’s case in a series of televised hearings in 2022. They and their team essentially built a TV operation within the halls of Congress, working with the committee’s investigators and lawyers to cull thousands of hours of footage from the Capitol riots to craft a compelling case that Trump and others in his administration had committed crimes that day. Wednesday’s video won’t be building a legal argument but instead will serve to remind viewers and voters what that day was like. “We wanted to bring people back to the gut punch we all felt watching it unfold,” Arons told The Hollywood Reporter. The second video will lay out the case that Trump is ready to repeat his “Stop the Steal” efforts from 2020 election, where he argued — unsuccessfully in all court challenges — that he lost only because of fraud. The short will serve as a call to action for get-out-the-vote efforts. It will reinforce a message that’s been repeated numerous times during the convention, that a potentially close election needs overwhelming turnout by Democrats.","summary":"The third night of the Democratic National Convention will feature a pair of videos produced by TV news veterans who also helped shape the narrative of the Jan. 6 committee hearings.

Kellyanne is a former advisor to Donald Trump while her ex-husband, George, is one of the founders behind the vehemently anti-Trump Lincoln Project. Claudia, the couple's daughter, moderated the debate between her parents. Pitting a divorced couple against each other in a political debate was about as measured and productive as one might expect. “This is why I divorced you,” Kellyanne said to her ex-husband at one point during the livestream. Claudia made clear during the debate that she wouldn't tolerate any of her mother's infamous \"alternative facts,\" telling her that she knows that \"Fox News [hosts] don't correct you, but I do.\" The 19-year-old is a content creator for the DNC, according to notus.org. Her mother called the comment \"just rude.\" George and his daughter went viral on night one of the DNC when Claudia posted a photo of the pair in the audience at the Chicago event. \"MAGA's most-hated,\" Claudia wrote on the post. She and her father have been vocally opposed to Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign season. During the family debate, the former spouses discussed abortion, the war in Ukraine, economic issues, presidential polling, and their opinions on both the Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns. Kellyanne suggested that Trump should be focusing more on policy differences and less on Harris's gender and race, though she stopped short of actually criticizing her former boss. “I’m always for more insights, fewer insults. I’m for policy contrast. That’s how he’s gonna win,\" she said. The Republican political guru also revealed that she still talks \"frequently\" with Trump. At one point, George tried to move the chat towards Trump’s 34 felony convictions but his ex-wife retorted: “That’s how everyone knows you. Kellyanne’s husband who doesn’t like Trump.” George and Kellyanne announced last year that they were divorcing. The couple married in 2001. “We married more than two decades ago, cherish the many happy years (and four corgis) we’ve shared, and above all else, our four incredible children, who remain the heartbeat of our family and our top priority,” they couple wrote in a joint post at the time.","summary":"The debate was moderated by their daughter, Claudia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/george-kellyanne-conway-debate-instagram-divorce-b2599856.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/05/20/00/Conways.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/X1A2DAMs-kPrKkZNL.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-21 23:46:16","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.191},{"id":254638380,"title":"New book shows none of our presidents were perfect — even George Washington","text":"An elective trivia round Chicago.

Kennedy Jr.’s anticipated exit from the presidential race and rumored endorsement of former President Donald Trump might help Trump in the race by a tiny margin, according to some analyses, but his single-digit polling average isn’t likely to boost Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris enough to tip the scales in either candidate’s favor. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during the Freedom Fest at the ... [+] Caesars Forum Conference Center, on Friday, July 12, 2024, in Las Vegas. (Daniel Jacobi II/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) TNS Key Facts RealClearPolitics’ polling average shows Harris with a 1.6-point advantage over Trump in a five-way race with Kennedy, independent Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein on the ballot, but her lead only narrows to 1.5 points in a two-way matchup—indicating Kennedy would barely help Trump if he’s not on the ballot. Similarly, an Emerson College poll released Thursday found Kennedy’s exit from the race is a wash: Trump and Harris both gained two points in a head-to-head matchup, compared to their margins in a six-way race. A Washington Post analysis, however, found that Kennedy has been hurting Trump more than Harris since President Joe Biden left the race, citing six reputable surveys that found Trump loses points when third-party candidates are in the mix. Equal shares (2%) of Republicans and Democrats and those who lean toward either party backed Kennedy in an Aug. 11-13 Economist/YouGov poll, while Kennedy netted 8% of support from voters who identified as independent or leaning independent. An Aug. 1-4 NPR/PBS/Marist poll also found 2% of Democrats, 3% of Republicans and 12% of independents would support Kennedy. Since the Kennedy voters who identify as Republican or Democrat would likely vote for their party’s preferred candidate in a two-way race, most of the votes up for grabs are from independents who prefer Kennedy. Generally, independent voters tend to prefer Harris over Trump (48% to 37% in the NPR/PBS/Marist poll and 33% to 20% in the Economist/YouGov poll when voters who lean independent are factored in), suggesting she’s more likely to pick up a larger share of the independent voters who say they’d back Kennedy. Big Number 4.5%. That’s the share of voters who back Kennedy as of Wednesday, according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average, compared to 16.7% who supported him in November, a month after he dropped his Democratic primary bid to run as an independent. Tangent Harris gains ground in the crucial swing states of Michigan (0.4 points) and Wisconsin (0.7 points) with Kennedy in the mix, but Trump benefits with him on the ballot in Nevada (1 point) and Georgia (0.7 points), according to a RealClearPolitics analysis. Harris also makes gains in Arizona and Pennsylvania with Kennedy on the ballot—enough, in fact, to take the lead away from Trump given his narrow advantage in the two key swing states, according to RealClearPolitics. Key Background Kennedy announced Wednesday he will speak Friday about his “path forward” in the presidential race, and multiple outlets reported he will drop out and endorse Trump. His running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said in an interview on Tuesday he was considering ending his presidential campaign to endorse Trump, amid a decline in polls and a struggle to fundraise. Trump has been angling for Kennedy’s endorsement, and met with him in July to discuss the prospect. Trump has also said he’s open to giving Kennedy a role in his administration if he’s elected to a second term.

The former president will hold events each day this week in key swing states, and his running mate Sen. J.D. Vance also plans to hit battleground states with events on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday – and it all culminates in a rally on Friday. Meanwhile, Trump’s allies will run daily press conferences at Trump Hotel in Chicago, Illinois each day of the DNC. Republican surrogates coming to town for the Convention include Sens. Rick Scott (Fla.) and Ron Johnson (Wisc.) and Florida Reps. Byron Donalds and Mike Waltz. The Thursday press conference will include a ‘surprise special guest.’ During a call with reporters, the Trump campaign noted they are ‘making sure we are accessible’ to the press while Harris goes nearly a month without a press conference or sit-down interview since announcing her candidacy. As Democrats descend on Chicago for their Convention to nominate for their 2024 ticket Vice President Kamala Harris as president and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as VP, Trump and Vance will hit all seven of the swing states that will determine the outcome in November. ‘At the DNC, Kamala Harris will hide behind celebrities because everyday families know that she has been an absolute disaster for our nation, and real Americans are worse off now than four years ago,’ Trump Campaign Senior Advisors Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a statement on the counterprogramming. ‘Harris has failed to answer media questions for 28 days because she can’t explain away her record of supporting policies that cause inflation, bans on private health insurance, destroying American energy, and higher taxes,’ they added. ‘As they meet Americans where they are in battleground states across the country, President Trump and Senator Vance will remind voters that under their leadership, we can end inflation, protect our communities from violent criminals, secure the border, and Make America Great Again.’ Trump will first head to York, Pennsylvania on Monday to focus on economic issues at an intimate event with about 150 people at a manufacturing warehouse. Sen. Vance will also be in Pennsylvania on the first day of the DNC with about 200 factory workers and business owners in Philadelphia. On the same day, President Joe Biden is the keynote speaker for the DNC after delegates officially nominate Harris and Walz. On Tuesday, Trump will go to Detroit, Michigan for an event with 100 law enforcement officers and their families to discuss rising crime under Democratic leadership. Vance will also focus on crime and safety during an event with victims of crime in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Tuesday. In Chicago, former President Barack Obama will headline remarks after his wife and former first lady Michelle Obama speaks. Trump and Vance will appear together on Wednesday for a national security-focused event at the North Carolina Aviation Museum and Hall of Fame in Asheboro. It comes the same month as the third anniversary of Biden’s botched troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members. Rep. Donalds will also attend the event with approximately 3,000 veterans, gold star families and elected officials for remarks focused on keeping American sovereignty and military strength. Walz will keep with tradition by speaking and formally accepting his nomination as the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate on the penultimate day of the Convention. And Harris will speak on Thursday. Trump will head to the border on Thursday – the last day of the Convention – for an immigration event in Montezuma Pass, Arizona, while his running mate will be in Valdosta, Georgia to also focus on immigration issues at a local sheriff’s office. Trump’s campaign says their themes for the week purposefully line-up with speakers at the Convention. When Biden and Hillary Clinton speak on Monday, the Trump campaign will focus on economic policies with ‘Make America Wealthy Again.’ As the Obamas speak on Tuesday, the theme for Republicans is ‘Make America Safe Again.’ And when Walz talks on Wednesday the Trump team is focusing on national security and military strength with ‘Make America Strong Again.’ When Harris wraps on Thursday, Trump and Vance will go after the VP for her role as ‘border czar’, where she was meant to lead Biden administration efforts to address migrant issues and secure the southern border. After the DNC wraps on Thursday, Trump is continuing his programming with a stop in Las Vegas, Nevada highlighting his proposal for no tax on tips on Friday morning and will head back to Arizona for a rally in Glendale in the evening. On the road, Trump and Vance will hold opportunities for reporters to ask them questions as the Republican ticket continues to bring to the forefront the juxtaposition of their press strategy compared to the Harris-Walz ticket. Since taking over Biden’s campaign on July 21, Harris has not sat down for an interview or held a press conference with reporters. The Trump team has blamed the media for giving Harris a ‘free pass’ and providing her with favorable coverage without having to sit for an interview and therefore prolonging the ‘honeymoon phase.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump plans to flood the airwaves with rallies, press conferences and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump&#8217;s strategy to grab attention away from Kamala Harris at the DNC first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/donald-trumps-strategy-to-grab-attention-away-from-kamala-harris-at-the-dnc/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/18/19/88656581-13755147-image-a-15_1724006989928.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 23:37:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.072},{"id":254638148,"title":"'Dystopia and retribution': Ex-RNC chair says Trump’s new 'hope' rhetoric is 'not believable'","text":"Sixteen years after former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign around the message of \"hope,\" former First Lady Michelle Obama declared on the Democratic National Convention stage Tuesday that \"hope is making a comeback.\" Following her moving speech, MSNBC reported Wednesday that 2024 GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance is now saying that ex-President Donald Trump represents \"hope\" for America.

President Joe Biden’s son faces nine tax-related counts, including three felony counts and six misdemeanor counts of failure to pay taxes. Hunter Biden, 54, of Malibu, “spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills,” the indictment alleges. Evidence of the younger Biden’s partying during a period when he was admittedly using crack cocaine and allegedly willfully failing to pay more than $1.4 million in taxes may become part of the trial, attorneys said. A pretrial hearing in the case Wednesday in L.A. federal court dealt with motions and questions of evidence to be resolved before jury selection is expected to begin Sept. 5. Hunter Biden did not attend the hearing. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, a Donald Trump appointee who is presiding over the trial, rejected the defendant’s bid to toss the case after the president’s son sought to argue that David C. Weiss, the special counsel overseeing the prosecution, was improperly appointed. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals previously rejected the younger Biden’s request to revive a bid to have the charges against him dismissed. Hunter Biden’s lawyers wrote in legal filings that they believe the case was brought “in direct response to political pressure.” His attorneys say the defendant has since paid the government $2 million in back taxes and penalties. Regarding the tax charges, the 56-page indictment alleges that between 2016 and Oct. 15, 2020, “the defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes.” Hunter Biden’s lead defense attorney, veteran Los Angeles criminal lawyer Mark J. Geragos, has said the trial could last as long as 10 days. In June, the president’s son was convicted of three felony charges in a separate federal case brought in Delaware stemming from the purchase of a gun in 2018. Hunter Biden was found guilty of having lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs —when, in fact, he later admitted to having been addicted to illegal narcotics at the time. Court papers show Hunter Biden is scheduled to be sentenced in the Delaware gun case on Nov. 13, in the week after the presidential election. Described in the indictment as a Georgetown- and Yale-educated lawyer, lobbyist, consultant and businessperson, Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian industrial conglomerate and a Chinese private equity fund during the time of the tax allegations. “He negotiated and executed contracts and agreements for business and legal services that paid millions of dollars of compensation to him and/or his domestic corporations, Owasco PC and Owasco LLC,” according to the indictment for tax evasion. In addition to his business interests, the defendant was an employee of a multinational law firm, the document states. Hunter Biden has said he had forgotten to pay his taxes during a period when he was in the grip of drug addiction.","summary":"Hunter Biden's lead defense attorney, veteran Los Angeles criminal lawyer Mark J.

A mayor in a battleground state, a former Trump voter, and a former Trump White House official have already addressed the convention to explain why they cannot support the former president’s return to the White House as they seek to appeal to those in the middle of the political spectrum. More high-profile Republicans will take the stage on Wednesday. On the sidelines, there are a number of Republicans sitting in the stands of the United Center who are actively working to get Harris elected. Joe Walsh, a former GOP congressman from Illinois, said he reached over 70,000 people over Zoom in his Republicans for Harris effort, along with former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), who was part of the House committee that was in charge of investigating the former president’s actions during the Jan. 6 attack. “It continues to grow and more high-profile national people join me and Adam Kinzinger and others. And you know this election is going to come down to 12 people in four states, and if we can just help give enough courage to some local Republicans in the battleground states, it’ll help,” Walsh told the Washington Examiner at the Democratic National Convention. Craig Snyder is the director of Haley Voters for Harris, a PAC of like-minded Republicans who voted for former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley in this year’s Republican primaries. He believes there’s a sizable number of Republicans who could be swayed, pointing to the tens of thousands of primary voters who chose Haley even after she dropped out of the primary race. “There could easily be a third of registered Republicans who really want to move on from Donald Trump,” Snyder explained in an interview with the Washington Examiner ahead of a planned happy hour with Republicans attending the DNC on Wednesday. “The only way to move on from Donald Trump is to defeat him.” In the weeks following Harris’s rise to the top of the ticket, the Trump campaign has struggled to define Harris. In their most recent attack ads airing in swing states, they call her a “soft-on-crime radical who is too dangerous for the White House.” Snyder doesn’t think that branding is effective. “Look, she’s going to be labeled as Mao Zedong by the Trump campaign but the truth is they would say that about any Democrat, that’s the playbook,” he said. “The reality is that she was a tough prosecutor, tough on crime, for most of her career, the political criticism from the Left. “When she ran for president in 2019, she took a bunch of positions that were, in fact, pretty far left. She is renouncing those positions in this campaign. I think people can criticize that, I think it’s a sign of growth,” he added. Stephanie Sharp is also working to court a similar group of voters as the co-founder of Women4U.S., an organization of center-right women working to defeat Trump. Sharp describes herself as a lifelong Republican who served in the Kansas legislature. “We’ve talked to three different state party people this week that have said, ‘we have women walking through the doors of the Georgia Democratic Party and saying, ‘I’m a lifelong Republican, but you have to activate me’,” she said. Renee Lafair, a co-founder of the group, said there are a lot of Republicans who are helping them organize behind the scenes, specifically targeting women in swing states. “There’s a real cost for people to publicly say they’re not supporting the top of the ticket on the Republican side,” Lafair said. “There are a lot of people who are helping us quietly organize, and we’ve been happy with the response. The Trump campaign said they continue to make inroads with disaffected Democrats and Independents, pointing to speculation that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Trump. “President Trump continues to build a historic and unified political movement to make America strong, wealthy, and safe again,” said Karoline Leavitt, Trump campaign national press secretary, in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Comrade Kamala Harris is the most unpopular Vice President in history and our campaign will spend every day until Nov. 5 ensuring every voter understands how dangerously liberal Kamala is.” On Tuesday, GOP Mayor John Giles, of Mesa, Arizona, pleaded with fellow Republicans to “put country first” in a prime-time speech at the convention and commended the Biden-Harris administration for “reaching across the aisle” to get things done. “I’m going to ribbon cuttings every single week all because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris reached across the aisle and they delivered for my conservative community,” Giles said in a speech on Tuesday night. Giles invoked the name of the late Sen. John McCain in his speech and the Arizona senator’s famous motto of “country over party.” “John McCain’s party is gone, and we don’t owe a damn thing to what’s been left behind,” he said. Democratic delegates on the convention floor gave former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham a standing ovation as she shared what it was like to work for the former president. “I saw him when the cameras were off, behind closed doors. Trump mocks his supporters. He calls them basement dwellers,” she said. After serving as Trump’s press secretary for nine months, Grisham was named first lady Melania Trump’s chief of staff. She said the last straw for her was the Jan. 6 insurrection when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, seeking to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s electoral win. “On Jan. 6, I asked Melania if we could at least tweet that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, there’s no place for lawlessness and violence. She replied with one word: ‘No,’” Grisham said, as a picture of the alleged text chain appeared on the jumbotron. Cross-party endorsements are not new in U.S. politics and Republicans have played prominent roles in previous Democratic conventions in the past. In 2020, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich endorsed Biden in a recorded speech. Democrats were not regularly featured at last month’s Republican convention, although Trump counts on support and advice from former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, who once served as a congresswoman from Hawaii. Harris’s campaign is seeking to court disaffected Republicans and recently unveiled a GOP task force for the vice president across the country through outreach to current and former GOP voters in the state “who feel marginalized by the MAGA movement.” The group is working to poach an existing network of anti-Trump Republicans who have opposed the former president’s bid for a third presidential cycle. Democrats appear to understand the benefits of courting conservative and moderate voters outweigh the risks of offending their progressive flank. Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), the former House majority whip and one of the most influential voices in Congress, praised Republicans who are at the DNC and those who are taking the stage. “I really applaud [Republicans] for doing this for the American people and letting them know what is at stake here is in fact our democracy and not Democrats or Republicans or Independents – but it’s for everybody,” Clyburn said, speaking to reporters Monday night after he took the stage. “So many Republicans in my home state, believe it or not, of South Carolina, are now speaking out.” “I think it’s good for us to give a platform to these people while they are tuning in and trying to find out who Kamala Harris is, so I think this is a good time to do that,” he said. Before Republicans took to the stage this week, Gov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) contended that Republicans and “everybody else” are welcome in the Harris campaign and “space” in a potential administration that Harris “would put together.” “So many people feel that they’ve been left out and left behind by the extremism that is Donald Trump,” Beshear told reporters Tuesday after addressing the Democratic National Committee’s Rural Council. “We can be a party that works with everyone, that believes that our job is to create a better life for every single American, not to spend our time on vengeance or retribution, but to spend time moving our country forward.” “At the end of the day, people care most about how their family is doing, how their neighbors are doing, and yes, their neighbors may be of a different party, but you still care about your neighbor and you want them to do well,” he said. When asked about prickly issues such as immigration, Beshear predicted the public will “get thoughtful answers from her, answers that are based on policy, and answers that recognize the complexity that yes, we need strong borders, and border security is national security, but we’re still talking about human beings”. “You can believe in both, and then we can get real immigration reform that they were working on until Donald Trump killed it,” he added. “So yes, she’s going to be able to talk to all voters.” For former North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Republican outreach cannot be patronizing. “No one likes to be told that they made a mistake when they voted, right?” Heitkamp told the Washington Examiner after the same Rural Council meeting. “What you will hear from so many people in rural America is, ‘I don’t like the guy, I don’t like how he talks to people, I don’t like how he represents, you know, himself, but I like his ideas.’ And that’s an opening to talk about what those ideas are and how our ideas are better.” The day before, Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) agreed about drawing a contrast for Republicans between Harris and Trump. “I think what Pennsylvanians want to know is how is the next president going to impact their lives and Donald Trump has a history of bringing chaos into people’s lives, less jobs, less freedom,” Shapiro told reporters after addressing the Labor Council. “Kamala Harris has been on the side of the people, and I think Pennsylvanians are less concerned about where she grew up, as opposed to what direction she wants to take the country in the future, and what she’s talking about, bringing down costs, increasing job opportunities, particularly in the energy sector.” Democrats are aggressively courting rank-and-file union members who had drifted over to Trump in the 2016 election, believing he’d be a champion for the working class. While the former president led with union voters in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania 50% to 45% in July, Pennsylvania likely voters in unions are now breaking for Harris by 15 points, according to an Emerson College poll released last week. “Unions are a critical element of any kind of electoral coalition. We care deeply as Democrats about unions and the right to collectively bargain,” said Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), speaking with reporters on Tuesday. “Kamala Harris is part of the Biden Harris administration that was, without question, the most pro-union administration we have seen in the presidency,” Peters said. In former President Barack Obama’s speech to the convention on Tuesday night, he urged Democrats to appeal to a large swath of voters, which includes outreach to Republicans and independents alike.

While DNC Rolls on in Chicago","text":"Hollywood is home to many experts on counter-programming but insiders behind the new film Reagan, which had its world premiere Tuesday at the town’s most iconic theater, insist that it was merely a coincidence that the event bumped up against the Democratic National Convention. “It wasn’t intended but what the heck, that’s awesome,” offered filmmaker Sean McNamara with a smile, adding that despite missing the night’s program that featured onetime White House residents Barack and Michelle Obama, he would be watching clips once he got home. “I always watch it all day if I’m not working to try and get a sense of what everybody is saying, both Republicans and Democrats.” McNamara, who pointed out that he’s a registered Democrat, said people are sometimes too quick to link politics to movies when sometimes those ties don’t tell the full story. “Look at the movie Lincoln,” he continued. “[Abraham Lincoln] was a Republican and that didn’t matter. It doesn’t matter what [political party] someone belongs to as long as you agree with their agenda and policies. With Reagan, our film has everything. It’s not only about his presidency. It’s also about him as a little boy, how he grew up, how he fell in love with Nancy and their love story. It goes on to detail how he became governor then president through to when he retired and when he got Alzheimer’s. It’s the full length of his life story.” The film — written by Howard Klausner, produced by MJM Entertainment and distributed by Showbiz Direct — casts Dennis Quaid as the late Ronald Reagan. The 40th president of the United States, who served from 1981-89 as a Republican, appeared in 53 films as an actor before segueing to politics. He served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild and later shifted from liberal to conservative in becoming the governor of California in 1966. He was reelected in 1970. When Quaid hit the red carpet in front of The Hollywood Reporter last night, he surveyed the scene and looked up at the gigantic banner featuring his face as Reagan hanging from the side of the TCL Chinese Theatre. “This feels like one of those old Hollywood premieres,” exclaimed the veteran actor. “It really is.” It looked like one. There was the requisite crush of press and photographers, well-heeled guests (including more men decked out in tuxedos than typically seen outside of award shows), and movie costumes, memorabilia and even a White House podium with blue drapes displayed inside the TCL Chinese Theatre lobby. There were other accoutrements not commonly found at Hollywood premieres. There were plenty of red, white and blue ensembles. Reagan actor Jon Voight, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, wore a silk tie that featured text from the Pledge of Allegiance. Conservative actor Nick Searcy, who participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection and has been one of Trump’s most outspoken supporters, strolled the red carpet to chat up his role in Reagan. One of the reporters on the press line hailed from a Christian media company. The mix made sense to Penelope Ann Miller, who stars opposite Quaid as Nancy Reagan. “There are a lot of Democrats in the film, and a lot of Democrats are here to support our film because they are interested in finding out more about Reagan. We all need to be able to talk to each other,” she says. “It’s so divisive in our country, and if you shut down one side over another, it’s harmful. We’re all a part of the same country and it’s important that we all can be seen and heard. One of the great things about Reagan was that he was such an effective communicator. He was able to cross party lines.” Quaid said he voted for Reagan in 1980. “I went home and my roommate said, ‘Who’d you vote for?’ I said, ‘Reagan.’ He said, ‘You’re kicked out of the hippies,’ so I turned in my card. I think I still have it somewhere. I can still rejoin,” quipped Quaid, who has the distinction now of playing Reagan, former President Bill Clinton (in The Special Relationship) and a George W. Bush-type character (in American Dreamz). “I had a tinge of fear grow up my spine, and that’s usually a sign that I should do [a role] because it takes me out of my comfort zone,” Quaid said as to why he eventually signed on for the film. “Fear is really very valuable. But I didn’t say yes right away because I wanted to make sure I could feel him and as a person instead of doing it impersonation. I went to the Reagan ranch and I could feel him up there. It was really quite something.” Back to the DNC. Klausner said he was “very glad” to be missing the broadcast in favor of his film’s premiere. “I’m exhausted and I think I speak for a lot of Americans. We’re just exhausted. Can we all just get along? Let’s find a way to reach one another. Whoever the leader is, that’s the leader. But can we stop it with all the fighting? Can we just stop it?” asked Klausner, whose other credits include God’s Not Dead: A Light in the Darkness. “That was Reagan’s message, too. That guy got along with people who didn’t like him at all.” Klausner is one of those insiders who insisted the timing of the premiere was merely coincidental. “I signed on for this movie in 2010, and there were probably four or five times that we thought everything was lining up to shoot,” he explained. A pandemic and an actor’s strike caused further disruptions in getting it across the finish line, not to mention finding a distributor that could release the finished product. “It seems like something a little divine happened because now I think we need healing in this country more than anything. I hope it lands [with audiences] because I’m more interested in the cultural impact right now than an election.” Clint Black, a longtime friend of Quaid, also walked the carpet to chat up his work on the film’s soundtrack, performing a John Denver song. “I don’t navigate [politics],” said the legendary country music star who added that he was honored to be a part of the film for his “pal” Quaid and perform a track that he grew up singing in bars. “I don’t feel like I have any influence. I just kind of think I know what I know, and I’m not about to get involved in all of it. It’s like owning a shoe store and telling half your customers what to do.” As for Voight, he told THR that while he considered tuning into the DNC for “a little bit,” he might not. “I have other things to do,” continued the actor, who revealed that he often takes some heat for his support of Trump and his conservative views. “We have freedom of speech but we should also have freedom of intolerance. It’s foolish. I want to know what people really think. I don’t want to know some form of something they think is appealing to me. I want to know what people really think. You can’t have a friendship if you can’t have some kind of honesty in it.”","summary":"Hollywood is home to many experts on counter-programming but insiders behind the new film Reagan, which had its world premiere Tuesday at the town&#8217;s most iconic theater, insist that it was merely a coincidence that the event bumped up against the Democratic National Convention. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t intended but what the heck, that&#8217;s awesome,&#8221; offered filmmaker [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/reagan-movie-dennis-quaid-politics-trump-1235980174/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2167671763-e1724281718887.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 23:27:43","author":"Chris Gardner","authors":["Chris Gardner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":254637880,"title":"At DNC, my party is shining a hopeful spotlight on America.

The DNC Convention is bursting with a sense of hope and joy that is part grassroots movement, part family reunion. And the contrast with last month’s GOP convention couldn’t be clearer. On Day One of the Republican Convention, MAGA darling Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene attacked LGBTQ Americans and immigrants, spewed misinformation and called Donald Trump a \"founding father,\" while the audience hissed and booed at any hint of diversity. Compare that to Day One of the Democratic Convention this week where Rep. Jasmine Crockett took the presidential job applications of both Trump and Harris line by line, correctly noting that, \"Kamala Harris has a resume. Donald Trump has a rap sheet.\" But Crockett didn’t stop there. DNC ATTENDEES REJECT POPULAR GOP ACCUSATION OF CONVENTION HYPOCRISY: 'APPLES AND ORANGES Crockett talked about Harris, not just as a transformational leader, but as a person, a product of the American Dream and a woman who takes the time out of her relentless schedule to listen to a freshman congresswoman’s concerns and remind her that she is exactly where God wants her to be. She talked about Harris as a beacon of hope and freedom that shines our way to the future and, most importantly, she reminded all of us how important it is for all of us to engage in this election. She asked America to vote. Greene and the Republicans never bothered to do that because, as far as they’re concerned, they don’t need to do it. Greene and the Republicans think they’re entitled to the White House. Crockett and the Democrats are working to earn it. Now, that’s just one example. But it has repeated itself over and over again this week in Chicago. CNN’S VAN JONES FAWNS OVER BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA'S DNC SPEECHES: LIKE 'OASIS' IN 'SPIRITUAL DESERT' While Republicans cheered Gregg Abbot, the 66-year-old governor of Texas who signed that state’s near-total abortion ban in 2021, Democrats embraced Amanda and Josh Zurawski, the young couple who were turned away from the hospital in Texas while Amanda was enduring a painful and deadly miscarriage because Abbot’s ban wouldn’t let the doctors care for her. Where Republicans had Peter Navarro, a former Trump adviser and fellow old white guy who spoke just hours after being released from federal prison, the Democrats had Ana Navarro, a former Nicaraguan refugee whose bold vision and courage exemplifies a new generation of Democratic leadership. She’s never been in prison, by the way. FLASHBACK: OBAMA WAS ONE OF EARLIEST BIG-NAME DEMS TO ENDORSE WALZ AT DAWN OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER Watching the Republican convention, you saw Reps. Nancy Mace and Matt Gaetz, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Watch the Democratic Convention and you see Sens. Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer, sure, but you also see DNC Chair Jaime Harrison and Convention Committee Chair Minyon Moore, the historic team that put the DNC convention together. You see Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Raphael G. Warnock, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Angela Alsobrooks and more. We’ve seen labor leaders like AFL-CIO President Elizabeth H. Shuler and UAW President Shawn Fain speaking at the Democratic convention. We see trailblazers like Reps. Maxine Waters and Jim Clyburn. We even see former Trump supporters like Rich Logis and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.

You see, when I watched the Republican Convention, I couldn’t see myself on stage or in the audience because people like me are not who MAGA and Trump’s Project 2025 are built for. But we’re welcome at the Democratic Convention because the Democrats know that diversity is what makes us strong. That’s where the hope and joy come from. That’s the vibe that’s different. So, when you turn on the TV to see what’s going on in Chicago or tune in to the speeches from Gov. Tim Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris, look at the stage and the audience and you’ll see America. You’ll see men and women working together for better jobs, higher wages, reproductive freedom and equal justice. You’ll see Black voters for affordable housing, Latinos for infrastructure improving education, Asian-Americans for infrastructure and even white folks for justice reform. You’ll see young voters fighting to expand student debt relief and end climate change stand hand-in-hand with senior citizens supporting Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and President Biden’s $35 cap on the cost of insulin. You’ll see LGBTQ Americans fighting Project 2025 and straight Americans fighting right alongside them.

Lindell is one of several Republican social media influencers, also including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and Daily Wire columnist Matt Walsh, to observe the DNC. “Mike Lindell finally did it,” he posted on X. “It’s been 30 years since Mike has shaved his mustache. But in order to go undercover at the DNC and deliver FrankSpeech viewers undercover footage, he finally allowed a barber to take a razor to his iconic ‘stache.” Lindell is also known for his hard-line support for Trump’s unproven claim that he won the 2020 election and that there was significant election interference. Voting machine company Dominion sued Lindell after he promoted a theory that the company conspired with foreign powers to rig voting machines to steal the election from Trump. Democratic content creator Knowa spotted Lindell. Lindell was seen arguing with Knowa about recent Georgia voting news. He was heard saying, “They found 257,000 votes in Georgia that are missing from the 2020 election,” repeating claims of 2020 election fraud. Walsh and Kirk have been spotted around the DNC floor as well. Walsh is taking a similar path to Lindell, disguising himself with a “Kamala Harris for President” hat and “White Dudes for Harris” shirt, while changing up his hair and glasses.

Kirk is not in disguise. He openly treaded the DNC floor and argued with Young Democrats of Georgia President Parker Short, who appeared upset at Kirk’s appearance there. The DNC is continuing for its third day Wednesday, and Harris will accept the Democratic nomination Thursday, the last day of the convention.","summary":"MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ardent supporter of former President Donald Trump, shaved his 30-year-old mustache to go undercover at the Democratic National Convention.

They planned this.Barack and Michelle Obama's electrically brilliant speeches to the Democratic convention Tuesday night were a coordinated jab–cross that perfectly met Democrats' needs and – if the party is paying close enough attention – laid the groundwork for the strategic transition that Kamala Harris absolutely must pull off in order to win.They ended the first phase of the Harris campaign and launched the second.Former President Barack Obama greets former first lady Michelle Obama as he arrives to speak on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on Aug. 20.Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesMichelle was the star of the night among giddy Democrats for her eloquent mix of rhetorical flourishes, pointed critiques of former president Donald Trump's silver spoon privilege and golden parachute business life (\"most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward\"), and gruesome knife twists, including the night's most excruciatingly dank line: \"who's going to tell [Trump] that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs.\"The result was a full on face-slap to the man who Democrats see as the spawn of Satan – and they were predictably rapturous. And why such a whiplash-inducing departure from her 2016 \"when they go low we go high\" mantra? Because that's what her party needed. Michelle's mission was to complete the great Democratic consolidation of 2024.When President Joe Biden dropped out exactly one month ago, polling averages showed Trump leading Harris 45.6% to 41.0%. As of Tuesday night, Trump had dropped by about one percentage point. Harris had risen six. So clearly, Harris' growing support is mostly not coming from persuading Trump voters. Rather, it's coming almost entirely at the expense of third-party candidate Robert F Kennedy, Jr. who has fallen four points in that time. In other words, it's coming from consolidation: Harris has been clawing back Democratic-leaning voters who were previously drifting away from Biden.Reclaiming the vast majority of your base—in 4 weeks, during August when voters are paying less attention, and with limited paid communications—is a minor miracle. And it was enough to give Harris the slightest of edges in election forecast models and betting markets.The problem is that consolidation only takes you so far. In key swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Georgia, there's not much more that Harris can eke out of bringing wayward Democrats home. Kennedy's support has already fallen to 4% or below. That's about what Gary Johnson and Jill Stein got combined in 2016, the last time big name third party candidates were on the ballot. There's probably not that much further for Kennedy to fall. The other problem is that RFK is now openly mulling dropping out and throwing his support to Trump, which caused betting markets to swing back in Trump's favor yesterday.Firing up your base is critical—and Michelle gave it the greatest energy injection that anyone could muster—but it only gets Democrats halfway there, no better than a 50-50 shot.Enter Barack Obama.The former president was perfectly aware that not only was he following a supremely talented orator (\"I am the only person stupid enough to speak after Michelle Obama\") but also that he had a harder job than his spouse. Because his mission last night was to begin the transition away from base motivation—i.e., firing up the folks who deep down probably wanted to be with Harris—to persuading swing voters. These are voters who pollsters have shown to be highly disengaged, badly turned off by the nastiness of today's politics, and facing the unfamiliar prospect of supporting the first Black woman for president to boot.Fortunately for Democrats, there is literally no one in history more accomplished at reassuring voters that the unfamiliar is unscary, that politics is not all anger and division, and that the Party is open-invite. That was the core of Obama's exhilarating 2004 convention keynote, and that was the theme he sounded over and over again last night: \"Together, Kamala and Tim have kept faith with America's central story: a story that says, 'We are all created equal.' All of us endowed with certain inalienable rights. That everyone deserves a chance. That even when we don't agree with each other, we can find a way to live with each other.\"Indeed, his most important message on this theme was part plea to the uncommitted, part warning to his own side: \"Our politics have become so polarized these days that all of us across the political spectrum seem so quick to assume the worst in others unless they agree with us on every single issue. We start thinking that the only way to win is to scold and shame and out-yell the other side. And after a while, regular folks just tune out, or they don't bother to vote... we need to remember that we've all got our blind spots and contradictions and prejudices. After all, if a parent or grandparent occasionally says something that makes us cringe, we don't automatically assume they're bad people. Our fellow citizens deserve the same grace we hope they'll extend to us.\"Translation to Democrats: we can't beat deplorables by being insufferables. Cancel the \"callout\" culture and keep welcoming back the white non-college-educated working voters who put Trump in the White House in the first place (Trump won them by 36 points in 2016). Translation to swing voters: we see you starting to creep back our way. So keep coming, because we will welcome you, not judge you.The normal arc of a presidential campaign has predictable stages played out on the leisurely cadence of a baseball season: candidate intros, selecting a nominee, drawing back in the supporters of the also-rans, firing up that base, and finally, pivoting to the center for the stretch run appeal swing voters.Last night, the Obamas hit the fast forward button, accomplishing every single step toward the end. The final sprint begins now.Matt Robison is a writer, podcast host, and former congressional staffer.The views in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"Barack and Michelle Obama's electrically brilliant speeches to the Democratic convention Tuesday night were a coordinated jab–cross that perfectly met Democrats' needs.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/obamas-showed-democrats-its-time-reach-out-opinion-1942708","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2455417/simply-dems-best.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 23:23:04","author":"Matt Robison","authors":["Matt Robison"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.359},{"id":254638302,"title":"Planned Parenthood president speaks on electing Harris to protect reproductive rights","text":"IE 11 is not supported.

Tim Walz (D-MN) is guilty of “stolen valor” are falling flat to the group of people attending the Democratic National Convention who are closest to the situation: veterans.Multiple military veterans expressed discontentment while speaking to the Washington Examiner about the attacks against Walz’s military service, calling accusations that the Minnesota governor is stealing valor a “nonstarter” and a “made-up political junky term,” among other things.Walz is expected to lean into his military service at his vice presidential acceptance speech Wednesday night. Walz’s military service has been under a microscope since he was tapped to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate. Criticism about his service includes what rank Walz held when he retired, as Walz and his allies have inaccurately claimed he retired as a command sergeant major. In a video set to introduce Walz Wednesday that is narrated by his wife, Gwen, she recounts Walz’s military service, saying he “served 24 years in in the National Guard, rising to command sergeant major.”Walz held the rank of command sergeant major before retiring; however, he did not complete the necessary requirements needed for the position and was reverted back to master sergeant for benefits purposes upon his departure. Harris’s campaign website once described Walz as a “retired command sergeant major” but has since been updated.Walz’s Republican rival, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), has accused the Democratic vice presidential nominee of lying about his military record and abandoning his unit before it was deployed to Iraq when he retired to run for Congress.“Kamala Harris, she gets really mad when I bring up the stolen valor of her running mate, but let me tell you why it matters; every single person here understands why this matters,” Vance said during a campaign stop recently. “Here’s the record on Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota; he dropped out of the military and allowed his unit to go to Iraq without him. He knew they were going to Iraq, he lied about it, but he knew they were going to Iraq.”Vance continued, “What won’t ‘stolen valor’ Tim Walz fib about?” Retired National Guard Maj. Gen. Randy Manner, who oversaw overseas deployments for the National Guard, called the attacks against Walz just “political crap” with “no facts behind it.”Retired Marine Sgt. Maj. John Estrada expressed disappointment in Vance for attacking Walz’s military record, explaining that “less than 1% of Americans serve.” Estrada continued, “And we go wherever our nation wants us at that time, and he went wherever our nation sent him. He did support our operation, enduring freedom. l am disappointed that J.D. Vance would come after Gov. Walz like he did. I do not feel that he should have.”Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005 just months before his unit got the official order it would be deploying to Iraq. Republicans have accused him of abandoning his unit, and a few members of his unit have publicly expressed resentment that Walz retired when he did.Walz also came under fire for a comment he made in a video from 2018 circulating on social media in which he spoke out against gun violence, saying, “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.”Critics say the comment implies Walz served in an active war zone; however, the Minnesota governor was never deployed to a combat zone during his military career. He did deploy to Italy in 2003 to support active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Vance jabbed at Walz for the comment during a campaign stop earlier this month.“I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?” Vance said. “What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq.”A spokesperson for Harris’s campaign said in a statement earlier this month that Walz “misspoke” in the video.Army Reserve Maj. Michael Bell, who also served 15 years in the Army National Guard, said Walz’s comment was a “misquote” and that he “made a mistake.”“We all do it,” said Bell. “I don’t think that’s stolen valor. Plenty of other people make similar comments about their service. No one is going to yell at them or argue with them or accuse them of stolen valor, of trying to take something away from other veterans. They both served. They’re both veterans and I thank them both for their service, but J.D. Vance is wrong in this.”Retired Navy Rear Adm. Mike Smith called Vance’s attacks against Walz “absolutely disgraceful.” “I think that if anything, we should be honoring Tim Walz. We’ve been through this whole thing,” Smith said, referring to criticism John Kerry weathered during his presidential campaign known as “swift boating.”Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), who was one of the Democratic lawmakers on Harris’s short list to be her running mate, called claims that Walz was guilty of stolen valor “ridiculous” while speaking with reporters outside the DNC’s Veterans and Military Families Council meeting Tuesday. “I spent 25 years in the United States Navy, I retired at 25 years. Gov. Walz retired from the Army at 24 years, when you serve over 20 years in the military, you’ve earned over a career the opportunity to retire,” Kelly said. Kelly continued, “The contrast could not be more clear between patriots and veterans like Tim Walz and Donald Trump, who has a total and complete disregard for our veterans and our service members.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Congressional military veterans have been divided over the issue, with 50 Republican lawmakers condemning Walz for committing “egregious misrepresentations” of his military record in a letter sent to the Minnesota governor on Wednesday. The letter, which was sent on a Trump-Vance letterhead, followed a previous statement signed by 18 Democratic lawmakers defending Walz and his service.","summary":"CHICAGO – Accusations that Gov.

Kennedy Jr. wants a deal with Donald Trump in which he endorses the Republican rival in exchange for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy told Reuters today. Kennedy’s campaign said today he would address the nation on Friday in Arizona, where he will talk about “the present historical moment and his path forward.” Kennedy is planning to drop out of the election and endorse Trump, but that hinges on whether the Republican offers Kennedy “and others” a position in the White House if elected, Larry Sharpe, outreach director with American Values 2024, told Reuters. Trump told CNN this week he would “certainly be open” to Kennedy playing a role in his administration if the independent candidate drops out of the race and endorses him. Kennedy also wants Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states, Sharpe said. ABC News reported earlier today, citing unnamed sources, that Kennedy plans to drop out of the race by the end of the week and endorse Trump. Super PACs, or political action committees, can raise unlimited amounts of money for candidates but are prohibited from coordinating directly with the campaign. American Values has raised over $50 million in support of Kennedy, according to Federal Election Commission filings through June 30. The Kennedy campaign did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Kennedy’s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, told Los Angeles media company Impact Theory on Tuesday that he was considering ending his campaign to join forces with Trump. Trump has previously sought Kennedy’s support, a phone call leaked to Reuters and other outlets in July showed. Shanahan in the interview released on Tuesday said Trump had taken an interest in their healthcare policies, making it worth exploring “a unity party.” Kennedy, 70, the son of late Democratic politician Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy, started his presidential campaign as a Democrat, challenging President Joe Biden for the nomination. An environmental advocate who has spread vaccine misinformation, Kennedy has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states. Kennedy’s support stood at 4% in an Ipsos poll taken this month, down from 10% the month before.","summary":"CHICAGO >> Independent presidential candidate Robert F.

Maxwell Frost is the youngest US congressman—and every headline and article about him (including ours!) never fails to mention it. Hailed as the first and only (for now) Gen Z Representative, Frost rose from the ranks of activism as the national organizing director for March for Our Lives to Congress, when he was elected to represent central Florida nearly two years ago. He instantly aligned with several big progressive causes, especially ending gun violence, and joined the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He also became an outspoken defender of and campaigner for President Joe Biden. That’s come at a cost. More recently, critics singled him out for having betrayed his activist roots, accusing him of not being outspoken enough about the war in Gaza. Having just won his primary this week, Frost is facing reelection in November and I had the chance to catch up with him in one of the DNC’s fancy “creator” spaces on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. During our sit-down interview, we talked about what he’s learned in his short time in Congress (it’s dysfunctional!), how to navigate big, contentious issues (it’s hard!), and what he wants to see from the Harris campaign in terms of policy (he’s very excited about housing! Not surprising when you recall his apartment-hunting headaches when he arrived in DC.) Watch the video, and below there’s a lightly edited transcript of the conversation. Okay, so what have you learned? What has been most surprising for you as a Congressman? And, I wanna know how you’ve changed. Honestly, what’s been really surprising for me, is we know there’s so much dysfunction in Congress. And oftentimes, we just blame the people there for that dysfunction, so I’m gonna give them 60 percent of the blame. Forty percent, or a good chunk, actually has to do with the institution itself. I’ll give you a very small example. Orientation, when the new members first get to know each other, before we start arguing, we’re just all humans, new people to Congress. You don’t really get a lot of time to spend time with the other side of the aisle. The only time I’m with the Republicans is during the classes, and what are you supposed to do in class? Listen. The last half of the day, the social aspect, is all separated by party. So it makes sense why there’s so much dysfunction here. Here at the DNC, we are looking forward. We have about 75, or so, days until the election. What is it that you wanna see? What kind of policies? What do you want the Harris campaign to bring forward? I’m really excited about the housing platform that Vice President Harris has put forth. Honestly, it’s one of the first times, I think, the Democratic party has put together a housing platform that’s really exciting. What else? I’m excited to see the Vice President continue to talk about her plans around preventing the climate crisis. Obviously, the Biden-Harris administration made history and dedicated the most resources and money towards defeating the climate crisis. Not in the history of our country, but the history of the world. The Vice President has been very vocal on gun control—an issue that’s very near and dear to you and your work. What are you hoping to see around that? And what role would you play? I’m proud that the first bill I introduced in Congress was to create a federal office of gun violence prevention. The President took that legislation with Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and used it as the foundation for an executive order. And he created the White House Office of Violence Prevention. Who’s its leader? Vice President Kamala Harris. So, I’m excited to see her expand that office, and what I wanna see is for us to put more money toward CVI, Community Violence Intervention. These are programs, community-based, that work at identifying people most likely to be shot, and the people most likely to shoot someone. And then, they intervene at the community level. We had this program in Orlando, and gun violence has gone down in the blocks it’s operating in. And how did we get the program started? Federal money. First from the American Rescue Plan, and then from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. So, let’s get a personal question in here. How do you grow as a politician and a leader with all of the complex issues here that we face in this country. Yeah, there’s so much to learn. I have 10 meetings in a day about completely different subjects. I’m gonna be honest, number one, it’s a team effort. I have a great staff that really helps educate me. There’s a lot of resources that are available to us. There’s actually something called the Congressional Research Service. I can go to my staff and say, “I want an in-depth briefing on the situation in the Congo.” And they will get our government experts to come in and give me an in-depth briefing. That information, is always the basis for me to do more research, and speak to other outside groups, as well. So we have a lot of resources we can take advantage of to educate ourselves. We’re not gonna be experts on every issue. But we should definitely try our best to educate ourselves on every issue. That way we can legislate in a better way. We have so many issues like, why is this important? What makes it more important than something else? And it all leads us to, why is this election important? This election is important because if we elect Donald Trump again, it’s not a pause in progress, it’s a rollback. And there are communities that won’t survive. That word “survival” means something different for everyone. More people will die of gun violence. He wants mass deportations of certain communities. Nothing will be done about the climate crisis. People will literally die. We’re experiencing extreme heat right now that’s killing more people than ever before. So, lives are at stake. And from the gun violence movement, my work, and my organizing has always been about saving lives. So, we gotta make sure we don’t let that guy anywhere near the White House. Kamala Harris is gonna save lives. Congressman Frost, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it man.","summary":"Rep.

As with Monday, the measurements were taken from 12 TV networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, Scripps News, CNN, CNNe, FOX Business, FOX News Channel, MSNBC, Newsmax, NewsNation and PBS. Tuesday’s convention featured speeches from Barack and Michelle Obama. During the former president’s address, according to Nielsen, viewership jumped above the night’s average, to reach 21.6 million. The first night of the DNC averaged 20 million viewers across 13 networks, and surpassing the audience for the first three days of the Republican National Convention (RNC) last month in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The first three days of the RNC reached 18.1 million, 14.8 million and 18 million viewers, respectively, according to Nielsen. Donald Trump headlined the final night of the convention, which averaged 25.4 million viewers and peaked with 28.4 million. According to Michael Mulvihill, TV analyst and president of insights and analytics at FOX Sports, FOX Entertainment, and Tubi, the DNC also had significantly more viewers percentage-wise. DNC had 11.9 percent of sampled households watching in 44 major metro areas across seven networks on Tuesday, compared with the RNC’s 7.7 percent rating, a difference of over 50 percent, Mulvihill posted on X. He pointed out that on night one, the DNC beat the RNC by 21 percent in the overnight figures, then 10 percent in the full nationals. “Expect some narrowing of this gap when the whole country is in,” Mulvihill wrote. Wednesday night’s schedule in Chicago will include speeches from former president Bill Clinton and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The headliner is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who will officially accept the Democratic nomination for vice president. Award-winning musicians Stevie Wonder and John Legend are among the performers. The fourth and final night of the DNC will see Kamala Harris take the stage, accept the party’s nomination for president and officially close the convention.","summary":"During former president Barack Obama’s speech on Tuesday, viewership jumped above the night’s average, to reach 21.6 million","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/dnc-ratings-night-two-rnc-trump-b2599876.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/21/18/SEI218078832.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/sltzmnoN-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-21 23:08:30","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":254637264,"title":"Taylor Swift calls cancellation of Vienna shows 'devastating,' explains silence","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories 'Intimate partner violence' led to triple homicide in McCreary: Manitoba RCMP A 'horrific act of intimate partner violence' is what led to a triple homicide in McCreary, Man. last week according to RCMP.

In a thinly veiled criticism of Government budgetary policy the employers’ group said that after five years of “remarkable expansion” the economy was now at “an inflection point” which hinged on the delivery of “large-scale” infrastructural projects. “As we approach the budget announcement the Government faces two choices: to use the budget as an opportunity to outline a vision for the country we aim to build over the next five years, or to use the surplus to put as much money as possible in people’s pockets,” Ibec’s chief economist Gerard Brady said. The last two budgets have been framed around generous cost-of-living supports. “Budget 2025 should prioritise global competitiveness by enhancing investment offerings, fostering innovation and investing in critical skills and infrastructure to drive our economy forward,” Mr Brady said. “This can only be achieved by addressing strategic priorities rather than diluting resources with widespread handouts.” In its report Ibec claimed the potential for further growth was being undermined by the “under-delivery” of critical infrastructure in water, energy, transport and skills. “Ireland has clear potential to compete in the years ahead, driven by a skilled and growing workforce, energy resources and significant improvements in national infrastructure,” Mr Brady said. “Successfully delivering on these priorities would be economically transformative for the country. We are now at an inflection point where achieving this vision hinges on our ability to deliver. To reach our potential we must begin delivering today. “Too often the focus is on cost efficiency in large-scale projects, but the greater and more immediate risk to economic growth, social cohesion and fiscal stability lies in our failure to complete these projects,” he said. In terms of the outlook Ibec said that while the Irish economy was experiencing some moderation in growth after five years of expansion, the outlook remained positive. It predicted the economy would expand by 2 per cent this year in gross domestic product (GDP) terms and by 2.7 per cent in 2025. Ibec’s report highlights a number of global uncertainties that have the potential to derail Ireland’s growth prospects, including global trade protectionism, rising geopolitical uncertainty and growing competition for foreign direct investment. US presidential hopeful Donald Trump has made no secret of the fact that he plans to build a wall of tariffs around the US economy if elected Ibec said it expected Irish exports to grow by 5 per cent this year. “The longer-term outlook for Irish trade is, however, heavily reliant on global political developments,” it said.

How Harris had supercharged Democratic fundraising By Ben Kamisar The latest campaign finance reports underscore just how much the Joe Biden-to-Kamala Harris switcheroo has supercharged Democratic enthusiasm and fundraising. The party’s presidential campaign reported raising an eye-popping $204 million in July. Biden was the candidate at the top of the ticket until July 21, when he dropped out and backed his running mate. By comparison, Donald Trump’s campaign raised $47.5 million in July. A dive into digital fundraising numbers from ActBlue — a platform that effectively serves as the Democratic credit-card processor for online donations — shows how Harris opened the floodgates. Across the first 20 days of July, with Biden facing a steady drumbeat of Democratic calls to exit the race in the wake of his shaky debate performance, his campaign raised about $30 million through ActBlue, an average of about $1.5 million per day. But from when he ended his candidacy through the end of the month, Harris raised more than $183 million — including $39.5 million the day Biden dropped out and almost $43 million the following day — an average of about $16.7 million per day. The trend is clear. While the campaign never hit $3 million in daily ActBlue fundraising in Biden’s final 20 days as a candidate, it never brought in less than $7 million daily in the final 11 days of July with Harris as the Democratic standard-bearer. What to expect on Night 3 of the Democratic convention Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will deliver tonight’s headlining address, presenting his biggest opportunity since Harris selected him as a running mate to introduce himself to the nation. Other notable speakers include: Former President Bill Clinton; former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries; and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Follow along with tonight’s speeches on our live blog → RFK Jr. is planning to drop out of the 2024 presidential race and endorse Trump Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to end his independent presidential campaign and endorse Trump, according to two sources familiar with the plans, Vaughn Hillyard, Dasha Burns, Katherine Koretski and Alec Hernández report. The sources cautioned that talks are ongoing, but there will be clarity by the end of the week. One of the sources said the campaigns are working toward a joint appearance. The decision to drop out will end the most prominent third-party candidacy in the 2024 race. Kennedy announced Wednesday that he will give a campaign speech addressing “his path forward,” days after his running mate said the campaign faced a choice about staying in the 2024 election or dropping out to back Trump. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, told NBC News in an interview Wednesday that “there’s been a lot of communication back and forth” between Kennedy and his campaign. Vance also said Trump wouldn’t promise a Cabinet position for Kennedy’s endorsement. The potential fallout: As Mark Murray notes, polls show that a Kennedy withdrawal would likely help Trump more than it hurts him. National NBC News polling finds that Republicans like Kennedy more than Democrats do. In January, Kennedy held net-positive ratings from Republicans (+18) and independents (+4), while Democrats viewed him mostly negatively (-25). The spread has only gotten starker since then. Fast-forward to July’s NBC News poll — conducted before Biden’s exit — when Kennedy was in positive territory with only Republican voters (+11), while he was negative among independents (-18) and Democrats (-38). The July poll also shows that in a multicandidate field, Trump kept 87% of the voters who backed him in a head-to-head contest with Biden, while 10% of his voters went to Kennedy, 1% went to Jill Stein and 1% went to Cornel West. By contrast, Biden kept 85% of his two-way support, while 6% went to Kennedy, 3% to Stein, 2% to Chase Oliver and 1% to West. And since Biden’s departure from the race, the total share of voters supporting Kennedy and third-party candidates in general has declined, according to national and battleground polls. More voters have been choosing Harris or Trump instead. While the potential share of Kennedy backers is smaller than it used to be, those voters could still be decisive in a close election.

It was his third counterprogramming event of the week against the Democratic National Convention, continuing with the series of events in battleground states focused on key election issues this year. In Asheboro, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump focused on national security, attacking the Biden-Harris administration on ongoing foreign conflicts, the Afghanistan withdrawal, American hostage deals and other issues. Contrary to his intimate and small counterprogramming events in Pennsylvania and Michigan earlier this week, this was his biggest campaign event so far this week. Trump – with the American flag in the backdrop just like in Butler – speaking in an open field in front of thousands of supporters, including some who told ABC News they were at the Butler rally and said the set up in Asheboro reminded them of the Butler rally. As ABC News previously reported, the U.S. Secret Service has ordered multiple sets of bulletproof glass panels to be stored around the country so it can be trucked to wherever it's needed, sources said. While the measure is typically reserved exclusively for sitting presidents, the Secret Service has made an exception following the attempt on Trump's life. The Secret Service had recommended that Trump stop holding outdoor rallies last month after a gunman in Butler fired at him from a rooftop 400 feet from the stage, nicking his ear and killing a spectator in the crowd. Since July 13, Trump has held nearly a dozen campaign events, all of them indoors. Claiming the United States was respected during his administration, Trump repeatedly painted a grim picture of a possible Kamala Harris presidency, saying, \"If Comrade Kamala wins this November, World War three is virtually guaranteed to happen. Everything she touches, she destroys.\" Escalating his attacks on the sitting vice president, Trump began to directly blame Harris for the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, even falsely claiming that Harris met with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before the Russia-Ukraine war broke out. \"Remember when Biden sent Kamala to Europe to stop the war in Ukraine? She met with Putin, and then three days later, he attacked,\" Trump falsely claimed. \"How did she do it? Think she did a good job. She met with Putin to tell him, don't do it. And three days later he attacked. That's when the attack started.\" In reality, there's no public record of Harris meeting with Putin. Instead, she met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a security conference in Munich five days before the war broke out. Trump also suggested Harris was responsible for the way U.S. troops left Afghanistan, saying \"she was the last person in the room with Biden when the two of them decided to pull the troops out of Afghanistan.\" \"She had the final vote; she had the final say, and she was all for it,\" Trump said, later promising to hold the Biden-Harris administration accountable by asking for the resignations of \"every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster.\" Trump also claimed he would have handled the Afghanistan withdrawal better, claiming he has had conversations with the head of Taliban and that he \"respected\" him. \"Our adversaries knew that America was not to be trifled with when I was your commander in chief,\" Trump said. \"... But since the Afghanistan catastrophe, it's been open season on America and our allies.\" Trump also railed against \"woke\" military generals throughout his speech, claiming, \"I know the good ones, the weak ones,\" praising his former military officials like Gen. Keith Kellogg. Offering a glimpse of what his second term would look like, Trump declared \"the days of blank checks for the weapons systems\" are over and said he will build \"a great Iron Dome\" and give it to other countries like Israel. \"We will increase funding, but at the same time, the days of blank checks for the weapons systems over the past are over. I tell you what we will build, we're going to build a great Iron Dome over our country so that we don't have to get hit. We give it to other countries, we help Israel and other countries,\" Trump said. Trump also said he would \"aggressively\" shift funding to \"keep American on the cutting edge, investing in drones and other technology, saying he wants to invest \"heavily\" in \"drones and robotics and artificial intelligence and hypersonics.\" Even as he focused on policies, Trump dismissed the idea of stopping personal attacks on Harris – at one point, mocking his advisers for suggesting he should stick to policy and stray away from personal attacks. He then said that many speakers at the Democratic National Convention personally attacked him, referencing Barack and Michelle Obamas speeches last night. Trump then polled the crowd to see if he should \"get personal,\" followed by many in the crowd cheering. Prior to Obama's speech last night, Trump spoke highly of the former president, but quickly shifted his tone saying he was \"nasty.\" \"Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night? He was taking shots at your president. And so is Michelle. They always say, please stick to policy, don't get personal. Yet they are getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?\" \"I try and be nice to people, you know, but it's a little tough when they get personal,\" Trump said. \"He was very nasty last night. I try and be nice,\" Trump said about former Obama's speech at the DNC Tuesday night. \"Should I not get personal? he asked the crowd. After few agreed, Trump quipped, \"I don't know -- my advisers are fired.\" \"","summary":"Donald Trump spoke behind bulletproof glass at his first outdoor rally since the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania last month.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-speaks-bulletproof-glass-1st-outdoor-rally-butler/story?id=113030425","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/52918e8d-2d33-4b93-b3c1-47f7f85e23c6/trump-rally-rt-jef-240821_1724265879091_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 22:53:41","author":"Alexandra Hutzler","authors":["Alexandra Hutzler"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.041},{"id":254636336,"title":"Trump ventures outside of new bulletproof encasement to embrace supporter overcome by heat at North Carolina rally","text":"ASHEBORO, N.C. – Former President Donald Trump ventured outside a bulletproof enclosure set up by the Secret Service Wednesday to embrace a North Carolina rally-goer who needed medical attention.

Secret Service agents surrounded the former president as he ventured out from behind the safety of the glass and toward the crowd. “You know, they come two days, three days early, and it’s a lot. It’s a lot of stress,” Trump said after returning to the podium. The Secret Service had reportedly encouraged Trump to no longer hold outdoor events in the wake of the assassination attempt.

Unlike a majority of Black American, Tillman says people of color should support the Republican nominee for president and his running mate despite Trump’s continued questioning of Vice President Kamala Harris’ ethnicity and intelligence, along with a barrage of personal attacks. “I think he’s a genuine guy,” Tillman said. “I don’t think there’s a racist bone in his body… and I know he’s going to work hard to do right by the Black community.” Meanwhile, Trump allies traveled to Chicago for a third day Wednesday to continue their criticisms of Harris. They called her a weak and failed Vice President. “She’s been in the White House for almost four years. She hasn’t been an outside observers in the community doing social work,” Trump campaign senior advisor Brian Hughes said. “She’s been in the meeting, side by side with Joe Biden.” Black conservatives like Tillman added that Democrats have made, what he calls, empty promises to African Americans for years. He is convinced people of color will be better off with Trump. ‘We’re going to bring back the Freedmen’s Bureau,” Tillman said. “We’re going to bring back the bureau for the native descendants of native Black Americans and make sure we get our rights that the government has entitled for us that have been ignored.” While Tillman said he and his membership don’t have details about how a pro-Black agenda by a future Trump administration will be addressed, he’s optimistic about the promise of a new deal for Black America. “People got two choices, they can either stay home, which I think they should do, or vote for trump,” Tillman said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; Local Republicans are keeping an eye on this week&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chicago-area Republicans show solidarity with Donald Trump during day 3 of Democratic National Convention first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/chicago-area-republicans-show-solidarity-with-donald-trump-during-day-3-of-democratic-national-convention/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 22:51:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.43},{"id":254636158,"title":"The Obamas criticize Trump harshly","text":"Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama went for Donald Trump ‘s jugular in back-to-back speeches at the Democratic National Convention despite the Republican ex-president finally showing a moment of decency toward them. The one-two punch by the powerful former first couple Tuesday night in Chicago came just hours after the GOP nominee unexpectedly praised his predecessor after years of attempting to delegitimize him. ‘I happen to like him. I respect him, and I respect his wife,’ Trump said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday just hours before their remarks. He also called Obama a ‘nice gentleman.’ It was a sharp turn from Trump who spent years attacking Obama and promoting the birtherism conspiracy theory questioning whether the country’s first black president was born in the United States. Neither Barack or Michelle Obama held back as they unleashed a series of brutal takedowns of the former president with the former first lady delivering what could be one of the most devastating one lines of the entire convention. ‘Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those “black jobs?”‘ she said to thunderous applause in the United Center. Former President Obama also sent the internet into a frenzy with his hand gesture suggesting he was making a crude joke about his successor as he joked about the Republican presidential nominee’s ‘weird obsession with crowd sizes.’ This was not the former first couple who welcomed the Trumps graciously into the White House after the 2016 election despite Trump’s attacks on them. But their scathing response to the Republican ex-president’s attempt for a second term in the White House was met with thunderous approval from Democrats. The former first lady blasted the ex-president saying for years Trump ‘ did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.’ ‘His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be black,’ she said. She accused him of being the ‘same old con’ and blasted his ‘ ugly, misogynistic, racist lies.’ In his remarks moments later, Obama slammed Trump for ‘ whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.’ ‘We don’t need four more years of bluster and chaos. We’ve seen that movie – and we all know that the sequel is usually worse,’ Obama said. The 44th president compared Trump to a neighbor running a lief blower every day: ‘f rom a neighbor, that’s exhausting. From a president, it’s just dangerous.’ The gloves were off and neither Obama was embracing the words of the first lady at the convention in 2016 when she said ‘when they go low, we go high.’ Michelle Obama warned that Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman of color nominated for the top of a major party presidential ticket was about to face the same criticism, she and her husband faced. ‘Now, unfortunately, we know what comes next. We know folks are going to do everything they can to distort her truth,’ she said before torching Trump. She urged Democrats on Tuesday night to work ‘like our lives depend on it’ ahead of Election Day and heaped praise on ‘my girl’ Harris. Her speech came just one day after President Biden spoke at the convention after his dramatic exit from the presidential race just one month ago, but the former first lady did not mention him. She was solely focused on moving forward. President Obama did mention Biden, calling his decision to choose the current president to serve as his vice president back in 2008 was one of his best decisions. ‘History will remember Joe Biden as an outstanding President who defended democracy at a moment of great danger,’ he said. ‘And I am proud to call him my President, but I am even prouder to call him my friend.’ From there Obama turned his wrath on the ex-president. ‘It has been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that’s actually been getting worse now that he is afraid of losing to Kamala,’ he said. ‘There’s the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes.’ Obama accused Trump of seeing power as ‘ nothing more than a means to his ends.’ Before claiming he respected Obama on Tuesday, Trump over the years has called his predecessor everything from a ‘disaster’ and ‘catastrophe’ to falsely claiming Obama was not born in the United States. He also spent his four years in office attempting to undo some of Obama’s biggest legislative achievements – most prominently efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. Trump responded to the blistering criticism of him at the convention in a conservative radio interview on Wednesday morning. ‘I was mentioned at the Democrats’ little party that they have going on in Chicago, and it’s pretty sad,’ Trump said on The Hugh Hewitt Show in response to a question about the ‘rhetoric’ being used against him and the recent assassination attempt. ‘These people are out of control, and they’re ruining our nation. Our nation is going to [expletive],’ he claimed. Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The use of the song, which also features Kendrick Lamar, instantly caught attention online, as Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has used it at several campaign events. While Beyoncé, 42, has not commented on the video, Rolling Stone reported on Wednesday, Aug. 21, that the Trump campaign did not have permission to use the track and that the singer has threatened to send the Republican presidential nominee's camp a cease-and-desist. PEOPLE has reached out to a representative for Beyoncé for comment. The Harris campaign most recently used the track in a new ad unveiled on Monday, Aug. 19, during the first day of the Democratic National Convention. Although Beyoncé has not officially endorsed Harris, she's voiced her support for the Democratic party on various occasions, including in 2013, when she sang the national anthem at former President Barack Obama's inauguration. In 2020, she posted a social media clip encouraging voters for current President Joe Biden. However, Harris has officially been endorsed by Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles. The fashion designer, 70, posted a photo next to Harris in late July on Instagram, writing, \"New, Youthful, Sharp , , energy !!!!

The Republican presidential nominee’s focused on his national security policies in his Asheboro, NC – his second visit to the state in a week. He gave his remarks from behind bulletproof glass, which the Department of Defense and Secret Service ordered for all his outdoor events after hi July 13 near-assassination in Butler, Pa. Trump, 78, touched on issues related to Afghanistan, the war in Ukraine, Iran, “woke-ism” in the military and recruitment crisis facing the US armed services. Afghanistan The former president laid blame on both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the botched US exit from Afghanistan, arguing that it has been “open season on America and our allies” since the “Afghanistan disaster.” “It was the most humiliating event in the history of our country,” Trump said of the nation’s “catastrophic retreat” from the now Taliban-run country. . Biden, 81, has not fired anyone related to the Afghanistan withdrawal, but Trump vowed to hold the government and military officials responsible for it accountable. “I will ask for the resignations of every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster,” he announced. “I want their resignations immediately.” Trump said he expected to see resignation letters on his “desk in the Oval Office” on Inauguration Day. He also criticized the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to leave behind equipment in Kabul, though the military said most were destroyed or made inoperable. “In fact, Afghanistan is now one of the largest arms merchants in the entire world,” he added, highlighting the eye-popping tally of equipment – “70,000 armored trucks” and “700,000 rifles and guns” – abandoned during the August 2021 withdrawal. “All left by the Biden-Harris administration. Who bought all that stuff in the first place?” Trump said. “This calamity is on comrade Kamala Harris’ shoulders,” he argued. “She was the last person in the room with Biden when the two of them decided to pull out of Afghanistan.” Event attendee Craig Garner, a 55-year-old lineman, told The Post that he thinks Trump would handle the military better than the Biden-Harris administration did. “[The military is] very poorly equipped. I don’t think we are prepared at all,” he said. “Trump is going to do a better job with it. He says he is pro military, and our son is a marine, so we are a military family also.” Ukraine Trump predicted that under a Harris administration, Russia’s war against Ukraine would continue raging on. “This war is going to escalate and escalate,” he said. The GOP nominee also suggested he could negotiate peace in the region even before assuming office, if elected. “I’ll get it settled as president-elect. I’ll get that war stopped. It will be done before I get into office,” Trump pledged. He touted former President Ronald Reagan’s “peace through strength” doctrine, arguing that he’d be able to prevent future Russian incursions into the Ukraine, or other parts of Europe, and other world conflicts through tough diplomacy. “If you go to war with another country that’s friendly to us – or even not friendly to us – you’re not going to do business in the United States, and we’re going to charge you a 100% tariff,” he said of what he would tell world leaders seeking conflict. “I’ve talked this world out of a lot of wars with telephone calls,” he boasted. “We don’t have to send in the troops.” Woke Military Trump lamented that the nation’s armed forces have become too “woke” – pledging to end focus on gender identity and race in the military upon taking office. “At the top, they are woke,” he said of the military. “We don’t want woke generals; we want generals who know how to win.” “On Day One, I will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our US armed forces,” Trump promised. “We’re taking it out.” “Our warriors should be focused on defeating America’s enemies, not figuring out their genders.” Trump added, “Marxist ideologies have no place in combat.” “If you want to have a sex change or social justice seminar then you can do it somewhere else, but you’re not going to do it in the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, Space Force or the United States Marines.” The proposal played well with attendees including retired parametic Marlina Straughn, 64, whose husband served in the Army. “The military is not the same. They are losing people mainly because they’re just – I don’t know how to say it – just don’t have the will that they used to have. They’ve lost it. It’s just become so woke,” she said. “They have people who are serving in the military just to get [gender reassignment] surgeries. I’m not trying to be rude, or mean or ugly – but that’s not a reason to join the military,” the Guilford County resident added. Recruiting and Rebuilding the Military Trump promised to rehire service members fired for refusing COVID vaccines under Biden with “an apology and back pay.” In the Army alone, 1,903 soldiers were discharged for opting against getting the shots. Last year, the military welcomed those troops back once the vaccine mandate was rescinded, but did not offer them back pay or an apology. Trump also pledged to hold the “largest peacetime recruitment drive in the history of the armed forces.” Under Biden, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard have fallen short of their recruitment goals. “There‘s no spirit [in the military] now,” Trump argued. “The sense of spirit, pride and prestige will soon come roaring back and reach levels never seen before.” “We’re going to make it so hot – I’m going to want to resign and join the military.” Trump was ruled medically ineligible to serve in the military during the Vietnam War. Enhanced Security Measures for Trump The former president’s podium was placed behind a large pane of ballistics glass and three more plates of the bulletproof material shielded Trump’s back and sides as spoke to his supporters. The Security Service reportedly encouraged the Trump campaign to no longer hold outdoor rallies in the wake of the Butler shooting, and the bulletproof glass is part of the additional measures being deployed by the embattled agency to protect the GOP nominee. At one point, Trump ventured outside the perimeter of the glass – mid-speech – to embrace a woman who required medical attention, seemingly overcome by the North Carolina heat. The glass was fairly reflective and somewhat obscured the crowd’s view of Trump. “Put the signs down,” someone apparently unable to see the former president because of the reflections yelled at one point.","summary":"ASHEBORO, N.C. &#8212; Former President Donald Trump pledged to demand mass resignations of top military officials behind the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal and give “back pay” to service members fired for refusing COVID-19 vaccines should he return to the White House in January.

Harris, according to an Economist/YouGov poll of more than 1,300 registered voters released on Wednesday, leads Trump nationally by three points. The VP is up from a two-point lead the same pollsters found in a survey released last week. While the same pollsters found President Joe Biden was trailing the former president by two points in the days just before he announced he would not seek the party nomination, when they asked “who do you plan to vote for in the presidential election” last week, 46% of voters picked Harris, compared to 43% who prefer Trump. A further 3% said they are backing independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr, while independent candidate Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein both polled at 0%. That result is in line with a Morning Consult survey of more than 11,500 registered voters released on Monday, which shows the 45th President behind by a full four points in a two-way race, up from three points compared to a poll conducted the week prior. “Ahead of this week’s Democratic National Convention, Harris leads Trump, 48% to 44%, up 1 percentage point over the past week and tying a record high set earlier this month. Harris has not trailed Trump in a single daily tracking survey since we first updated this page with their head-to-head matchup in late July,” those pollsters noted. Both polls showed Harris with a nearly split approval rating while a majority of voters express negative sentiments regarding the former president. Trump, according to the Economist/YouGov survey, is viewed as very or somewhat unfavorable by 53% of polled voters, compared to 43% who see him favorably. Harris, on the other hand, sees a ratio of 45% to 46% The three-time Republican nominee has seen his net-negative rating improve week over week in Morning Consult’s survey, but he’s still way behind the new kid on the ballot. “More voters than not hold favorable opinions about Harris (50% to 45%), a record-high net favorability rating that keeps her above water for the fourth week running. Meanwhile, Trump’s net favorability improved to 5 points underwater, continuing an upward trend over the past two weeks,” those pollsters wrote. Where before the VP’s political fate seemed tethered to her boss’ sinking numbers, Harris seems to have broken away from the rest of the political world when it comes to popularity, according to Morning Consult. “Since securing presumptive status as the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris has become significantly more popular than Biden, Trump and her partisan compatriots in Congress,” pollsters said. National polling averages maintained by RealClearPolitics and 538 show Harris leading Trump by 1.6 points and 3.3 points, respectively.","summary":"The newest polling shows former President Donald Trump’s years-old presidential campaign is falling behind Vice President Kamala Harris' historic and sudden ascent to the top of Democratic politics.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/21/trump-continues-to-fall-behind-harris-in-national-polls-surveys-taken-ahead-of-dnc-show/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Election_2024_Joy_and_Gloom_78777.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 22:42:57","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":254636438,"title":"Trump mocks Democrats for personal attacks at first outdoor rally since assassination attempt","text":"Trump mocks Democrats for personal attacks at first outdoor rally since assassination attempt Former President Donald Trump spoke to supporters in North Carolina Wednesday in his first outdoor rally since last month's assassination attempt.

The current President Joe Biden has stepped down, leading to Vice President Kamala Harris taking over, and former President Donald Trump surviving an assassination attempt and showing significant agitation since his defeat in the 2020 re-election. The Democratic National Convention, now adjusted to current circumstances, is taking place in Chicago. It is not unfolding as anticipated some weeks back when talks of an open convention to remove Biden were in the air. Instead, Biden graciously resigned, and Democrats are praising him all around. While all this is going on, there is little mention of the guilty plea of George Santos – a cautionary tale for everything that is wrong, misleading and impossible to understand about modern American politics. Santos, whose trial on 23 felony charges was scheduled to begin on Sept. 9, entered a guilty plea on Monday. He pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, and admitted he committed other crimes that could land him in prison for about seven years under the terms of a plea agreement, ABC News reported. When Santos flipped New York’s Third Congressional District in 2022, he became the first openly gay non-incumbent Republican elected to Congress. Although his campaign biography said he lived in Long Island with his husband and four dogs, his husband never campaigned with Santos and there was no marriage license on record for a marriage to a man. There was a marriage license to a woman in 2012 and a divorce in 2019. That was only the beginning of the lies that Santos apparently told. He created a bio out of whole cloth. He was running for Congress, for the second time, in New York City. NYC may have one of the greatest newspapers in the world, The New York Times, and Santos’ deceit wasn’t exposed to the voters. It wasn’t as though Santos had a sophisticated cover story that insulated him when he told mistruths. Santos apparently lied about everything. He lied about where he went to high school, where he went to college and where he worked. This is the 21st Century — I can do a search to find out what Donald Trump had for breakfast this morning. Santos said his mom was at the World Trade Center on 9/11. She was not. He said his grandmother died during the Holocaust. She didn’t. He said four of his employees died as a result of the Pulse Nightclub mass shooting. Not true. Don’t forget this guy got elected to Congress! Then he used campaign money for Botox, travel and clothes. He deposited campaign contributions into private accounts. He used donor credit card information to make unauthorized charges. He lied to Congress, and became only the sixth member of the House of Representatives to be expelled — although 114 members of Congress voted not to expel him. He showed up for Biden’s State of the Union this year and announced he would be running for Congress in 2024, but that did not happen — and now he is more than likely headed to prison. In Santos’ wake of lies and crimes, we are reminded of a couple important failures. As newspapers struggle to sustain their important role in American politics — remember Watergate? — failure to vet candidates opens the door to charlatans like Santos. Social media has blurred the line between truth and fiction. Trump has reminded us, time and time again, that it does not matter what the media says about you as long as they keep talking about you. Voters need to demand answers. There are red flags when things seem too good to be true. In the case of Santos, the red flags were revealed long before his election — but simply ignored. As former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters in January 2023, “I always had a few questions” about Santos’ resume. However, McCarthy needed every vote he could get to become Speaker of the House, including Santos’ vote. McCarthy was apparently willing to overlook, downplay or hide the truth about Santos – and in politics, acts of omission can be as dangerous as the commission of mistruth, lies or deceit. Voters — as the 2024 election approaches, keep up your guard. Matthew T. Mangino is of counsel with Luxenberg, Garbett, Kelly and George P.C.

Tim Walz will have his big moment at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, where he will deliver the keynote speech and accept the party's nomination for vice president. Walz has been in the national spotlight for just two weeks since Vice President Kamala Harris announced him as her running mate pick earlier this month. With his prime-time speech at the DNC, Walz plans to introduce himself to America, according to the Harris-Walz campaign. In his remarks, the Midwesterner plans to share his biography -- from growing up in a small town in Nebraska to working as a high school social studies teacher and football coach before he was elected to Congress in 2006. The convention plans to showcase his impact as an educator in a video earlier in the night featuring five of his former students, according to the campaign. Another former student of his, Ben Ingman, will nominate Walz along with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, according to the campaign. Walz coached Ingman in basketball and track in the seventh grade, the campaign said. Walz's time as a football coach has become a major part of the image the Harris campaign is painting of him, handing out signs that read \"COACH!\" at rallies since he joined the ticket. Walz will also talk about his military service, which has come under scrutiny following his selection at Harris' running mate. Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at the age of 17 and retired 24 years later, prior to running for Congress. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance has alleged Walz is guilty of \"stolen valor\" for the way the Democrat has referred to his service. On the campaign trail, Walz has fiercely defended his service, saying at a rally last week that he is \"damn proud\" of his military record. Earlier in Wednesday's programming, the DNC will play a short video highlighting his service in the National Guard and his commitment to improving the lives of veterans, according to the campaign. The video will include remarks from Sgt. Al Bonnifield, who served with Walz in the Minnesota National Guard, and Cpl. Mike McLaughlin, an Iraq war veteran who worked with Walz when he was in Congress on the \"Forever GI\" bill, which expanded veterans' education benefits, according to the campaign. In his DNC speech, Walz also plans to address what he will bring to the White House and what Harris will do for working families, according to the campaign. It is unclear if Walz will bring up reproductive rights. The father of two has often talked on the campaign trail about his and his wife Gwen's fertility struggle. He has connected their experience to the bans on in vitro fertilization (IVF) put in place this past spring in Alabama and attacking Republicans over reproductive rights restrictions. He has frequently talked about their fertility journey generally, referring to IVF and treatments \"like it.\" In new comments this week, Gwen Walz revealed for the first time publicly that the fertility treatment they used was intrauterine insemination, or IUI -- not IVF, as had been broadly assumed. The detail that Gwen Walz did not use IVF, but rather a different treatment, quickly led to another attack from Vance, who said that the governor \"lied\" and should know the difference, having been involved in the process. In response, the Harris campaign called Vance's attack \"just another example of how cruel and out of touch Donald Trump and JD Vance are when it comes to women's healthcare.\" Gwen Walz did address their fertility journey in a biographical video released by the Harris-Walz campaign earlier Wednesday. \"Of all the things he's done, Tim loves being a dad,\" she said. \"We struggled to have kids and fertility treatments made it possible. There's a reason our daughter is named Hope.\" Gwen Walz also highlighted the governor's time in the military. \"His dad served during the Korean War and that meant a lot to Tim,\" she said. \"And so he enlisted right after his 17th birthday and served 24 years in the National Guard, rising to command sergeant major.\" The video also touched on his years as a public school teacher, coach and founding faculty adviser to a gay-straight alliance. \"His focus has always been helping working people like those he grew up with,\" she said.

The former school teacher and football coach is expected to accept the Democratic nomination Wednesday as the party makes the case that Americans’ fundamental freedoms are at risk if Donald Trump returns to the White House.Former US President Bill Clinton, former House of Representatives Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are also expected to address the convention on Wednesday.The theme for Wednesday will be “A fight for our freedoms,” with the prevailing theme of the evening focusing on retaining rights that Democrats say have been stripped away under Republican administrations, including reproductive rights and others.Democratic party supporters have gathered outside the United Center in Chicago where the Democratic National Convention which began on Monday is being held. They are holding posters which mention “For Our Future”.Siggi Shor, one of US Vice President Kamala Harris’ supporters, expressed happiness that Democratic National Convention is happening in her hometown, Chicago. Speaking to ANI, Siggy Shor said, “I’m ecstatic to be here. This is my first time voting in a presidential election. So I’m so honored that the DNC is in my hometown, the city of Chicago, the greatest city in the world, if I may say so myself. Inside, everyone just seems so excited. And one thing that’s really standing out to me is how kind everyone is. I’ve been able to go up to people, just ask, hey, what do you do? What’s your name? Just wanting to introduce myself and meet people. Everyone’s excited. Everyone’s kind. Everyone’s fired up. There’s a sound check and people were clapping and into it. It’s just an energetic environment in there.”She said that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz embrace pop culture. She stated that the embrace of pop culture and youth culture is making a shift and recalled how it happened at the time when Barack Obama contested elections in 2008. On being asked about what really is unifying the Democrats, she responded, “I definitely think Harris and Walz embrace of pop culture, at least for the youth vote. I’ve never seen my peers so fired up to go out and vote. I remember in the midterms two years ago, people just weren’t really interested. And now people are excited, people are interested. And I do, again, really think it’s that embrace of pop culture and the embrace of youth culture that’s really making a shift. We saw this in 2008 with Obama and I think that’s the last time you really saw this excited of a Democrat party that really wanted to come together and mobilize and I mean, that’s what works with Joe Biden…I think another thing is our country isn’t I mean I don’t say it’s never been so divided because that would be a false statement, I think.“However, I do think this is a very contentious time in our country because under a Republican administration, there are so many rights that will be stripped away, especially for Southerners and my fellow Midwesterners,” he added. She expressed gratitude to be living in a state that has a Democratic governor. She praised Kamala Harris on how she has talked about supporting women and people of colour in the US. Shor said, “I’m so grateful to live in a state where we have a Democratic governor and a mostly Democratic House and Senate. However, that’s not the case for most of the Midwest and the most of the south, even if they have democratic governors, they have legislatures that are blocking their rights. And so I do think having a president that has shown, or a candidate at least like Harris, who has shown that she’s going to stand behind women in the country, she’s going to stand behind people of colour in the country, she’s going to stand behind people of every religion, that is so important to people now.”Harris is the first Asian American woman and woman of colour to head a significant party ticket. Earlier last month, a virtual vote officially recognised the vice president as the Democratic party nominee. After Biden withdrew from the contest and backed her, the party came together in support of her.Former US president Barack Obama took centre stage on the second night of Democratic National Convention, urging Americans to back Kamala Harris in her presidential bid against Republican candidate Donald Trump.Speaking after his wife Michelle Obama on Tuesday (local time), the former US president recalled that Harris, in her capacity as the attorney general of California, had stood up for children who had been victims of sexual abuse.“Kamala Harris is ready for the job,” Obama said, noting that she fought big banks and for-profit colleges, “securing billions of dollars for the people they have scammed”.Taking a swipe at Donald Trump Obama said that the US didn’t “need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos.”“Here’s a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped talking about his problems since he rode down on his golden escalator nine years ago,” Obama said of Trump.“We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse,” Obama said adding that “America is ready for a new chapter. America is ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.”In addition to big speeches from The Obamas, Illinois Gov JB Pritzker also spoke Tuesday, along with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Trump’s former press secretary Stephanie Grisham.Stephanie Grisham, addressed the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday (local time) to show her support for Kamala Harris. She highlighted that the former US President Donald Trump has no empathy, morals and fidelity to the truth, according to CNN.In her address on the second night of the DNC, Stephanie Grisham said Trump mocked his supporters and called them “basement dwellers.”“The Trump family became my family. I spent Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years, all at Mar-a-Lago. I saw him when the cameras were off, behind closed doors, Trump mocks his supporters–he calls them basement dwellers,” Grisham said.“He has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth,” she said. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump has slammed Democrats for focusing on him at their convention, The Hill reported. During an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on “The Hugh Hewitt Show,” Trump slammed Democratic party leaders for being “out of control,” The Hill reported. He made the statement after Hewitt asked whether “rhetoric” directed against Trump could have been a factor in the assassination attempt against him in July.Trump said, “Well, it could. You know, I was mentioned at the Democrats’ little party that they have going on in Chicago, and it’s pretty sad,” according to The Hill report. His remarks came as several speakers at the Democratic National Convention, including Obama slammed Trump in their remarks on Tuesday night.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/08/us-tim-walz-to-speak-at-democratic-national-conventions-third-night-with-partys-rising-stars/","image":"https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 22:31:13","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.452}]}
