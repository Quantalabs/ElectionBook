I just left him. He is a great person. I knew him as Prince Charles originally and now as King Charles. And the people love him in this country.' \n\nIt is believed that Washington is already planning the royal visit for as early as next year. \n\nAnd according to reports, the Trump administration wants to give the UK a starring role in celebrations for the 250th anniversary of US independence in 2026. \n\nA senior White House official told The Telegraph: 'It was a really fantastic trip. The British know how to do this perfectly.' \n\n'They set the bar high for their trip to see us.' \n\nBefore flying back to the US, Mr Trump thanked his hosts and praised the 'incredible bond' between the UK and US.\n\nHe said: 'We're grateful beyond words for the spectacular honour of the state visit yesterday at Windsor Castle, hosted by His Majesty King Charles III and Her Majesty, Queen Camilla.\n\n'These are two fantastic people. We will never forget it.' \n\nMr Trump also appeared anxious to avoid controversy during one-to-one talks with Sir Keir Starmer at the Prime Minister's estate at Chequers on Thursday. \n\nBut he made plain his disapproval of Sir Keir's plan to formally recognise Palestine, saying the focus should be on pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages seized in the October 7 attacks.\n\n'I have a disagreement with the Prime Minister on that score,' he said bluntly.\n\nSir Keir, who is expected to recognise Palestine in the coming days, insisted that the move was part of a 'process' that could eventually lead to a two-state solution.\n\nHe insisted that the move was not a reward for Hamas and said the terror group could have no role in running an independent Palestinian state.\n\nIn comments that will cheer No 10, President Trump underlined his irritation at Putin for failing to engage with a serious peace process, saying he felt 'let down'.\n\nMr Trump also piled pressure on European countries, such as Hungary and Slovakia, to stop buying Russian oil and gas.\n\n'I'm willing to do other things but not when the people I'm fighting for are buying oil from Russia,' he said. 'If the oil price comes down, very simply, Russia will settle.'\n\nPredicting the end of the conflict, he said: 'That's a war that could have been a third world war, and I don't think we're going to be there now.'\n\nSir Keir acknowledged that some European states have still failed to stop buying Russian oil and gas more than two years after Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n'There are one or two countries, I think, that do need to look again at the question of energy,' he said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr Trump's Marine One helicopter made an emergency landing at a UK airport today with the US President and his wife Melania on board.\n\nThe presidential chopper suffered 'a hydraulic issue' while flying to Stansted Airport from Chequers. \n\nOfficials said the aircraft put down at Luton Airport 'out of an abundance of caution'.\n\nThe US President transferred to a 'support' helicopter which was flying in formation and resumed the journey to meet up with Air Force One plane at Stansted.\n\nNo one was injured in the drama and the President arrived at the airport 20 minutes behind schedule.\n\nThe couple then boarded Air Force One for their return journey back to the White House.\n\nPhotos from the scene show emergency vehicles and armed police on the tarmac at Luton Airport.\n\nSeparate images show both of Mr Trump's helicopters, known as Marine One and Marine Two, just off the runway.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: 'Due to a minor hydraulic issue, and out of an abundance of caution, the pilots landed at a local airfield before reaching Stansted airport.\n\n'The President and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter.\n\n'The President and first lady were later able to board Air Force One for the return journey from the UK.","summary":"Details of the proposed return invite emerged as the US president flew back to Washington on Thursday on board Air Force One.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15113171/Donald-Trump-planning-invite-King-Charles.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/19/01/102269663-0-image-a-29_1758241649031.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 01:03:31","author":"Editor,Olivia Christie","authors":["Editor","Olivia Christie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.106},{"id":361665672,"title":"Stephen Colbert goes scorched earth on 'autocrat' Trump in defense of Jimmy Kimmel cancellation: 'blatant censorship'","text":"Stephen Colbert has blasted President Donald Trump in a defiant defense of Jimmy Kimmel following the abrupt cancellation of the ABC host's late night show. \n\nThe CBS late night host - whose show will end in May after his own issues with President Trump - dedicated his Thursday monologue to free speech and Kimmel's team at ABC. \n\n'This is blatant censorship,' Colbert said of Kimmel's ouster at the taping for the show, which is set to air later Thursday night.\n\nHe then blasted Trump as an 'autocrat' saying 'you cannot give [him] an inch.'\n\n'Jimmy, I stand with you and your staff 100 percent.'\n\n'Tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel,' Colbert then declared.\n\nHe also said during a question-and-answer session ahead of his show that despite his own cancellation at CBS, the network which airs The Late Show with Stephen Colbert 'wouldn't have done this.\n\n'Now, regardless of what you think, what has already been done and how that looks, this is weak.' \n\nColbert was shockingly fired in July after he criticized CBS' parent company, Paramount, for settling a lawsuit with President Trump for $16 million amid a major merger between the company and Skydance. \n\nHe argued on his show that the settlement was a 'big, fat, bribe' to the Trump administration to approve the merger. \n\nBut Paramount executives announced at the time his show would be continuing through the end of the broadcast season.\n\nIn contrast, ABC announced Wednesday that it was suspending Kimmel's show 'indefinitely' following his controversial remarks about the man accused of shooting conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. \n\nKimmel had incorrectly claimed that Tyler Robinson, 22, was a right-wing member of the MAGA movement.\n\nInstead, investigators have said became radicalized with far-left ideologies and was dating his transgender roommate.\n\nThe erroneous claim caused ire among conservatives, and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr even said he was considering an investigation into Kimmel and ABC over the remarks.\n\n'When you look at the conduct that has taken place by Jimmy Kimmel, it appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible,' Carr told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson hours before Kimmel's ouster was revealed. \n\nAt the same time, one of the largest local television operators in the country, Nexstar Communications Group, announced it would no longer air Jimmy Kimmel Live! on its 23 ABC-affiliated stations. \n\n'Kimmel's comments about Kirk's death are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse,' said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division.\n\nExecutives at ABC are said to have then conducted an emergency meeting, in which they decided to fire Kimmel.\n\nThe cancelation was quickly praised by President Trump, who called it 'great news for America.' He also praised ABC for 'finally having the courage to do what had to be done' as he called for executives at NBC to also oust Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. \n\n'Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,' he wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'Kimmel has ZERO talent and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible.'\n\n'That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers on Fake News NBC,' the president continued. \n\n'Their ratings are also horrible,' he said. 'Do it NBC!!!'\n\nIt now remains unclear whether Fallon and Meyers will suffer the same fate as Colbert and Kimmel.\n\nBut when Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, was asked on Thursday whether his agency would target the two late night hosts, he simply said: 'We'll see how this plays out.'\n\nHe noted that the United States is now 'in the midst of a massive shift in dynamics in the media ecosystem for lots of reasons, including the permission structure that President Trump's election has provided.\n\n'And I would simply say we're not done yet with seeing the consequences of that shift,' Carr said, ominously.\n\nThe FCC chair had also previously accused networks of subsidizing the late night talk shows, as he said said that the FCC expects them 'to broadly serve the public interests.'\n\n'I'm very glad to see that America's broadcasters are standing up to serve the interest of their community,' Carr said of Kimmel's termination on Wednesday, after arguing that late night hosts are 'enforcing a very narrow political ideology.","summary":"Stephen Colbert has hit out at President Donald Trump following the abrupt cancelation of Jimmy Kimmel's show.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15113167/Stephen-Colbert-Trump-Jimmy-Kimmel.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/19/01/102269819-0-image-m-50_1758241458139.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/18/5375864251907786024/1024x576_MP4_5375864251907786024.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-19 01:01:43","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":361665708,"title":"Heartbroken family of Greek heiress who died after being bitten by an insect threaten legal action against hospitals over 'doctor's negligence'","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Sep 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeartbroken family of Greek heiress who died after being bitten by an insect threaten legal action against hospitals over 'doctor's negligence'\n\nSomalian migrant living in Epping hotel thanks Keir Starmer 'from the bottom of my heart' after winning right to stay in the UK\n\nTurning Point USA names Charlie Kirk's widow Erika as its new CEO\n\nHow Thomas Skinner's mistress turned on ME.

Email arthur.parashar@mailonline.co.uk \nBy ARTHUR PARASHAR, SENIOR REPORTER\n Published:00:49 BST, 19 September 2025 |Updated:01:54 BST, 19 September 2025 \n\nA powerful Greek family have accused the NHS of letting an heiress die on their watch after she was bitten by an insect, the Daily Mail can reveal.\nMarissa Laimou, 30, was tragically found dead in her bed by a housekeeper at the townhouse she lived in with her parents in upmarket Knightsbridge, central London, on September 11.\nIn a heartbreaking twist, Ms Laimou - also known as Lemos - had overcome breast cancer and an extremely rare blood disease in the months before she died.\nIn the days before her death, her family say she voiced major concerns for her health at two well-respected London hospitals - including one she was rushed to in an ambulance - but doctors ultimately decided to discharge her.\nThe wealthy Lemos family, one of the biggest dynasties in the Greek shipping industry, are now planning to take legal action, a relative confirmed to the Mail, adding: 'They are going to go against them of course. This is 100 per cent negligence. Marissa is gone because of them.\n'It would have been nothing to keep her one night. They could have monitored her, given her antibiotics, they would have saved her. She went to the right place for treatment. They should not have let her go.'\nThe relative, who has spoken to Ms Laimou's grieving parents, added: 'Marissa was saved from cancer and now this has happened. She lost her life in a few hours. No mother should have to bury their baby girl.' \nThe Mail can today reveal the full timeline of Ms Laimou's death which has plunged her parents, twin brothers and wider family into mourning - including the harrowing texts she sent to a friend in hospital where she complained: 'Nobody is checking up on me, nobody is coming.'\n\nView gallery\n\nMarissa Laimou (pictured) - also known as Lemos - was found lifeless in her bed by her housekeeper on September 11\n\nView gallery\n\nPictured: Marissa with her twin brothers, mother Bessy and father Diamantis before her tragic death\n\nTrump just humiliated Harry and Meghan with two brutal words\n\n4.5k viewing now\n\nTruth about TikTok Liverpool gangster Sam Walker\n\n64.9k viewing now\n\nSomalian migrant living in Epping hotel thanks Keir Starmer\n\n1.1k viewing now\n\nMs Laimou, a theatre actress, had recently returned to London after a summer holiday with her family on the Greek resort island of Porto Cheli, where she was 'perfectly alright'. \nShe began feeling unwell on September 9, developing dizziness, itching, a high temperature and other signs of an infection, which proceeded to get worse in the night. \nThe family say Ms Laimou called an ambulance and a doctor recorded a high fever of 39C but she decided to stay at home and said she would seek further medical attention if she did not feel well the next day.\nBut by the next morning, she had deteriorated so she took herself to the Leaders in Oncology Care (LOC), on London's famous Harley Street, where she felt 'very safe' as she had previously been treated there for chemotherapy.\nMedics carried out blood tests, gave her an antibiotics drip and antihistamine medicine. But due to the seriousness of her condition, they made the decision to call an ambulance to take her to University College London Hospital (UCLH).\nIt was here that nurses, rather than doctors, carried out tests on her and concluded that she did not need to be kept in hospital. \nA family friend explained: 'Marissa goes there and it was a nurse. They took the blood tests again, they gave her a drip with fluids. She was just waiting there. She went there at 2.30pm and at around 3pm they took the blood tests.\n'She was waiting, she sent some messages to her friend saying: \"Nobody is checking up on me, nobody is coming, I don't know where they are, I'm still itching, I feel dizzy, I don't feel well\".'\nAfter her tests, Ms Laimou's family say she was discharged at 6.30pm and given antibiotics to take home with her, but she still felt seriously unwell and could not eat anything.\nShe would tragically go to sleep that night and never wake up again, with the family housekeeper finding her in her bed in the morning of September 11. \nThe family claim they have seen the official diagnosis given by doctors, which was a 'toxic affect of venom' caused by an 'animal or insect bite'. \nIn an emotional interview, the relative said: 'It is negligence. No doctor examined Marissa. Only the nurses saw her and did the blood tests and passed the test to the doctor and the doctor said you can be discharged, that's all.\n'Marissa's mother, Bessy, believes her daughter has gone because of them. They should not have let her go, definitely. If it was not so urgent, her oncologist would not have sent her in an ambulance, they would have said go in an Uber or go later.\n'It was urgent. They didn't address it with the serious way they should have done.'\n\nView gallery\n\nMarissa is pictured with her mother Bessy and her father Diamantis, who is a part of the wealthy Lemos family\n\nView gallery\n\nMs Laimou (pictured) had staged a production of Romeo and Juliet in London and was preparing another theatre project\n\n Heiress is found dead in her apartment 'after she was turned away by medics following insect bite' \nIn an emotional tribute, the relative said: 'Marissa was the most amazing girl with an amazing heart. \n'Her passion, since she was a little girl, was musical theatre. She must have watched everything.\n'She was the most amazing girl and there are no words to describe her, a good, gentle, amazing heart, focused, ambitious, to do well.\n'She was in the US studying musical theatre. She came back to London, she worked at several art schools and a lot of theatre. Last February, she directed and produced and was the leading role of Romeo and Juliet.\n'She came back from Greece in the summer and started preparing another play, Oliver, and she found the cast and they had started some rehearsals every Friday.\n'Marissa passed away Thursday and she had scheduled to do more rehearsals on Friday.'\nAlthough Ms Laimou's wealthy family are from Athens, Greece, she was born and raised in the UK, growing up in a Knightsbridge townhouse with her two twin brothers, who are 26.\nHer family were abroad at the time of her death and rushed straight to London when they were informed of the devastating news.\nA relative said: 'They are all shattered, we are a very close family. We cannot find why and how this could happen nowadays in 2025.\n'If she was in a village, you could understand it maybe. But she did it by the book. She did everything right.'\nHer father, Diamantis, is part of the wealthy Lemos family who are one of the best known names in Greek shipping, with business roots stretching back to the early 20th century.\nMs Laimou lived in Knightsbridge with her parents, while her uncle, George Lemos, and his family spent decades living in a block of luxury flats in Mayfair, where the average property is worth £4.5million.\n\nView gallery\n\nMarissa is pictured with her two twin brothers who she grew up with in Knightsbridge. They are 'shattered' by her death\n\nView gallery\n\nMarissa is pictured with her mother Bessy as a young girl. Her mother is heartbroken by her daughter's death\nDespite being born into astonishing wealth, Ms Laimou was keen to carve her own life, working in nurseries and as a receptionist at the Holiday Inn Bloomsbury while also juggling her real passion, theatre.\nShe had recently starred as Juliet in her production of Romeo and Juliet in London and was preparing for her latest Oliver performance.\nAlthough she was born and raised in the capital, she studied musical theatre in New York before going to the University of Arizona.\nShe had moved back to London in 2018 and credited her grandmother and friends 'for always believing in her and pursuing her dreams'.\nA close relative told the Mail that Ms Laimou 'loved London and couldn't live anywhere else but England'.\nBefore her sudden death, Ms Laimou had battled through breast cancer. She was diagnosed in April 2023 and had to go through six months of 'aggressive chemotherapy'.\nBut after an operation, she was forced to spend four weeks in intensive care with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), an extremely rare condition where the body's immune system does not work normally.\n\nView gallery\n\nIn an emotional tribute, a relative of Marissa's described her as 'the most amazing girl with an amazing heart'\n She had incredibly overcome her health battles and was enjoying her life again before tragedy struck.\nThe family say they are still awaiting post-mortem results, having so far been left in the dark.\n'It keeps us in agony because we don't know what happened to her,' a relative said.\nThe Inner West London Coroner's Court said: 'The coroner is dealing with the sudden death of Marissa Lemos and investigations are ongoing.'\nThe Mail has contacted LOC and UCLH for comment.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHeartbroken family of Greek heiress who died after being bitten by an insect threaten legal action against hospitals over 'doctor's negligence'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nRevenge romance?

Relatives said he had become 'more political' in recent times.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kimmel's late night show Jimmy Kimmel Live! was suspended 'indefinitely' amid the MAGA backlash over his comments.\n\nHe was spotted for the first time in public on Thursday afternoon, wearing black sunglasses and a navy button down in the drivers seat of his Audi.\n\nWhile Kimmel put on a brave face and smiled for the cameras as he stepped out of the car, earlier pictures captured a tense moment as he put his head in his hands.\n\nIt is understood the pictures of Kimmel were taken at a Century City location where several law firms are based.\n\nThe late-night host had also poked fun at President Donald Trump's reaction to the shooting during his segment.\n\n'This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend,' he said. 'This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.'\n\nShortly after ABC announced Kimmel had been suspended, Trump said: 'The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED.\n\n'Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.' \n\nStaff of the Jimmy Kimmel Show! were seen packing up their gear from the Los Angeles studio on Wednesday, hours after the host was brutally axed. \n\nHollywood unions SAG-AFTRA and WGA showed their support for Kimmel — who is a member of both — in light of the news, as per Deadline.\n\n'SAG-AFTRA condemns the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! Our society depends on freedom of expression. Suppression of free speech and retaliation for speaking out on significant issues of public concern run counter to the fundamental rights we all rely on,' a statement from the acting guild read.\n\n'Democracy thrives when diverse points of view are expressed. The decision to suspend airing Jimmy Kimmel Live! is the type of suppression and retaliation that endangers everyone’s freedoms. SAG-AFTRA stands with all media artists and defends their right to express their diverse points of view, and everyone’s right to hear them.'\n\nThe Writers Guild of America West and Writers Guild of America East also condemned the decision.\n\n'The right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other – to disturb, even – is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people. It is not to be denied. Not by violence, not by the abuse of governmental power, nor by acts of corporate cowardice.'\n\n'As a Guild, we stand united in opposition to anyone who uses their power and influence to silence the voices of writers, or anyone who speaks in dissent. If free speech applied only to ideas we like, we needn’t have bothered to write it into the Constitution. \n\n'What we have signed on to – painful as it may be at times – is the freeing agreement to disagree. Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth. As for our employers, our words have made you rich. Silencing us impoverishes the whole world.' \n\nThe television personality's remarks had caught instant flak from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson earlier on Wednesday that he was considering an investigation into Kimmel and his network ABC for his claims. \n\n'When you look at the conduct that has taken place by Jimmy Kimmel, it appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible,' Carr told Johnson.\n\n'As you've indicated, there are avenues here for the FCC, so there... are some ways in which I need to be a little bit careful because we could be called ultimately to be a judge on some of these claims that come up,' Carr said.","summary":"Kirk was tragically shot dead while debating students at the Utah Valley University campus on September 10.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15112991/jimmy-kimmel-pictured-cancellation-charlie-kirk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/18/23/102267741-0-image-a-24_1758236032227.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/18/5375864251907786024/1024x576_MP4_5375864251907786024.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-19 00:45:13","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.1},{"id":361665676,"title":"Strictly star Balvinder Sopal suffers thigh injury on second day of rehearsals as she admits show is the 'hardest' she has ever worked","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Sep 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeartbroken family of Greek heiress who died after being bitten by an insect threaten legal action against hospitals over 'doctor's negligence'\n\nSomalian migrant living in Epping hotel thanks Keir Starmer 'from the bottom of my heart' after winning right to stay in the UK\n\nTurning Point USA names Charlie Kirk's widow Erika as its new CEO\n\nHow Thomas Skinner's mistress turned on ME.

The helicopter, which had been transporting the president, was diverted to Luton Airport due to what officials described as a “minor hydraulic issue.”\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the incident, stating that the helicopter landed at a “local airfield” out of “an abundance of caution.” The President and the First Lady later safely transferred to a support helicopter, arriving at their destination, Stansted Airport, about 20 minutes behind schedule.\nEmergency services were seen on standby on the tarmac at Luton following the unscheduled landing. Images showed both Marine One and Marine Two, the helicopters used to transport the president, parked just off the runway.\nBoth helicopters are part of the “white top” fleet, named for their distinctive paint scheme. These aircraft are equipped with advanced security systems, including missile defence, radar-jamming technology, and electromagnetic pulse resistance, designed to protect the president even in extreme scenarios.\nAs a standard security protocol, Marine One travels with a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys to obscure which aircraft carries the president. The group is typically accompanied by Osprey MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, known as “green tops.” These versatile aircrafts combine the vertical lift of helicopters with the speed of airplanes and carry support staff, special forces, and Secret Service agents trained to handle in-flight emergencies.\nThroughout the visit, President Trump had been using Marine One to travel between engagements as part of his second state visit to the UK, an unprecedented event in US-UK diplomatic history.\nTrump arrived at Stansted Airport late Tuesday evening and was flown to Winfield House, the official residence of the US ambassador in London. On Wednesday, he and the First Lady visited Windsor Castle, where they met King Charles III and Queen Camilla.\nOn Thursday, Trump traveled via Marine One to Chequers, the country retreat of UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, for diplomatic talks. After the meetings, the President and First Lady successfully boarded Air Force One for their return flight to the United States.","summary":"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the incident, stating that the helicopter landed at a “local airfield” out of “an abundance of caution.”","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trumps-marine-one-makes-emergency-landing-at-luton-before-departure-from-uk-aa-ws-l-9582233.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-4-2025-09-7ebc143d9ea603050d3c5634514bb8be.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 00:22:24","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.003},{"id":361665698,"title":"Machine Gun Kelly reveals his and Megan Fox's baby daughter 'looks exactly like' the actress","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Sep 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeartbroken family of Greek heiress who died after being bitten by an insect threaten legal action against hospitals over 'doctor's negligence'\n\nSomalian migrant living in Epping hotel thanks Keir Starmer 'from the bottom of my heart' after winning right to stay in the UK\n\nTurning Point USA names Charlie Kirk's widow Erika as its new CEO\n\nHow Thomas Skinner's mistress turned on ME.

Machine Gun Kelly announces Australia and New Zealand tour dates \nEarlier this year in March, MGK and Fox welcomed their first child together - after officially splitting in November 2024. \nAt the time, MGK jumped to social media to announce that the little one had been born and wrote, 'She's finally here!! our little celestial seed 3/27/25.' \nThe music artist also included a black and white video of the infant's tiny hand wrapping around one of his fingers. \nThe pair have since been navigating co-parenting the newborn after Fox separated from the rapper late last year.\nMGK has since given other small glimpses of Saga on his Instagram page, including a snap of him holding the little one which was taken through the reflection of a car window. \nLast month in August, the music artist revealed the parenting comment that left Fox 'fuming.' \n\nThe Bad Things hitmaker - whose real name is Colson Baker - then went on to call the Transformers star a 'phenomenal mom'\n\nHe explained, 'I had it with a person who is the greatest partner, the greatest partner to have had a child with'\n\nThe music artist is already dad to teen daughter Casie, 16, whom he welcomed with ex Emma Canon; the pair seen in June in Santa Monica \nWhile stopping by Today With Jenna And Friends, he explained, 'Someone the other day was like, 'You're such a good dad!' just because I was holding the baby. And she was fuming. Like, 'No, no, no, no.'' \nThe Rap Devil hitmaker added, 'I just play the guitar and hope and pray that the baby is happy. \n'I want to detract any congrats to me, and just move it to Megan. Because she really does all the work.' \nBack in May, a source opened up to Us Weekly about whether the former couple have a chance to getting back together while navigating their co-parenting relationship. \nThe Jennifer's Body actress 'thinks MGK has stepped up and is being a good dad but doesn't think they have a future together romantically.\n'Megan is in heaven with her baby girl and is really focused on being a mom right now.' \nThe insider further emphasized the the two stars are 'absolutely not getting back together at this point in time.' \nHowever, the source stated that Fox is 'grateful' for how MGK is helping out when it comes to raising their baby girl. \n\nAt the time, MGK jumped to social media to announce that the little one had been born and wrote, 'She's finally here!! our little celestial seed 3/27/25'\n\n'I want to detract any congrats to me, and just move it to Megan. Because she really does all the work,' MGK said; the former couple seen in 2021 in L.A. \nSaga lives with the actress and the rapper will occasionally spend the night a few times each week to assist the actress. \nAlong with embracing fatherhood, MGK recently dropped his seventh studio album Lost Americana last month on August 8. \nSome of the tracks included on the latest LP include Vampire Diaries and Miss Sunshine. \nMGK got candid about his response to the 'hate' he has received over the years during a recent interview with People. \n'The hate for me has become so pop culture that it's almost like that's automatically what you say to fit in,' the star expressed. \n\n'The hate for me has become so pop culture that it's almost like that's automatically what you say to fit in,' the star expressed; seen in June in L.A. \n\n'That s*** doesn't even mean anything to me. I've let it go completely to where I'm like, 'Oh, that's a joke.''\nMGK continued, 'I've realized they're the conformists - you don't even hate me for a reason that you can actually think of because all I do is entertain, and entertainment can't be that serious.' \nThe music artist is set to officially kick off his Lost Americana Tour later this year on November 15 in Orlando - while also having a performance on October 1 in Los Angeles. \nAlong with U.S. dates, the rapper will take to the stage in countries such as the U.K. and Australia - with concerts set to conclude on July 1, 2026 in Washington. \nMachine Gun KellyMegan Fox\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMachine Gun Kelly reveals his and Megan Fox's baby daughter 'looks exactly like' the actress\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

His young family. I know where he is now. Heaven. But still.\"\n\n “I saw what happened online with my own eyes,” the producer-star of The Queen of Versailles told NY1 host Frank DiLella. “And I had a human moment of reflection.”\n\n Seeing the response to her reaction over the death of Kirk, who repeated anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-women talking points, she continued, “I came to understand that my comment hurt some folks and that hurt me. So I would never — it's no secret that I have been, that I'm a Christian, that I'm a person of faith. It's also no secret that I am an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community.”\n\n For some fans, Chenoweth added, Christianity and LGBTQ+ advocacy don’t “go together. But for me it always has. And it always will.”\n\n Kirk died at age 31 after being shot during a campus event at Utah Valley University.

Kimmel was spotted exiting his vehicle at an office building in Los Angeles. The office building was located off Santa Monica Boulevard and near Beverly Hills. It is unclear where Kimmel was exactly heading as the office building has several businesses, like law firms at the location. Fox News Digital also obtained additional footage of multiple moving trucks and a forklift stationed outside the studio where \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was filmed. It appeared a crew was loading the trucks with boxes and equipment that were under tents in the studio's parking lot. It's unclear if the trucks were there specifically for Kimmel's show. Fox News Digital also reached out to Kimmel’s representatives, the Walt Disney Company, and ABC to inquire whether these trucks were there to transport the set and equipment from Kimmel's show, but did not receive immediate reply. JIMMY KIMMEL CANCELLATION SPARKS FIERCE CELEBRITY SPLIT IN HOLLYWOOD Disney announced Wednesday it had pulled Kimmel's late-night show \"indefinitely\" after he suggested that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old Utah man charged with the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, was part of the \"MAGA gang\" despite reports he had a left-wing ideology, which was later reaffirmed in Tuesday's indictment. \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel had said Monday. ABC’S ‘JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!’ HEMORRHAGED VIEWERS OVER PAST DECADE, LOST 72% AMONG KEY DEMO CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE There was mixed reaction to the news of Kimmel's show being pulled. The Trump administration largely celebrated the news, with President Donald Trump saying Kimmel was fired for \"lack of talent.\" FCC Chairman Brendan Carr also threatened ABC and Disney, before Kimmel's show was canceled, to remedy the situation, saying \"we can do this the easy way or the hard way.\" Meanwhile, liberals have labeled this as another incident of the Trump administration stifling free speech. \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" has seen its ratings drop significantly over the past decade. Kimmel’s 2025 average viewership of 1.6 million is down 37% compared to 2015 totals. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, not all late night hosts are struggling.

He told me many times,\" Kolvet wrote. \"He would want the episode back up.\"\n\n The episode in question is the second episode of season 27, which originally aired Aug. 6 and is titled \"Got a Nut.\"\n\n In the episode, Eric Cartman takes issue with classmate Clyde Donovan and accuses him of \"stealing my shtick\" for starting a right-wing podcast and \"masterdebating\" those who don't agree with his beliefs. Cartman adopts Kirk's real-life hairstyle and starts his own competing and successful podcast, but Clyde ultimately wins the \"Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters\" — and a vacation to Mar-a-Lago — over him.\n\n After it aired, Kirk shared a TikTok in which he called the episode \"hilarious\" and claimed it acknowledged the \"viral, cultural domination\" of the ideals he stood for.\n\n \"There's gonna be a lot said about this, but we need to have a good spirit about being made fun of,\" he said on Aug. 7. \"This is all a success. This is all a win. We, as conservatives, we have thick skin. Not thin skin. You can make fun of us. It doesn't matter. Until next time, I hope all of you become 'masterdebaters' for truth.\"\n\n Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. He was 31.\n\n Following Kirk's death, PEOPLE confirmed that Comedy Central would not air the episode as reruns in its linear rotation. However, the episode remained available to stream on Paramount+ and CC On Demand.\n\n Though Kolvet asked for the South Park episode featuring Kirk to be reinstated, he has been celebrating ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! \"indefinitely\" from the air.\n\n \"Kimmel out 'indefinitely' at ABC after falsely claiming the assassin was part of MAGA. This was a bottom up revolt from affiliates and ABC folded,\" he wrote on X shortly after the news broke on Wednesday, Sept. 17. \"Good. He's now free to start a podcast where no one can fire him for saying deranged nonsense.\"\n\n \"The firing of Jimmy Kimmel is not an attack on free speech, it's conservatives finally using ours,\" he added in another X post on Wednesday, Sept. 17.\n\n On Thursday, Sept. 18, Kolvet posted on X, writing, \"Jimmy Kimmel is not a martyr. Charlie is.\"\n\n Kolvet's post referenced broadcast companies Nexstar and Sinclair pulling Kimmel's show off the air on affiliate ABC networks following the host's recent remarks about Kirk.\n\n During the comedian's opening monologue on the Monday, Sept. 15, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he spoke of Kirk and Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old who has been charged with aggravated murder in connection with Kirk's death.\n\n \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" he said. \"In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.\"\n\n Kimmel then showed clips of President Donald Trump being asked about Kirk's death, with one reporter offering him their condolences and asking how he's holding up.\n\n \"I think very good, and by the way, right there where you see all the trucks, they just started construction of the new ballroom for the White House,\" Trump replied, adding the new ballroom at the White House will \"be a beauty.\"\n\n \"Yes,\" Kimmel said as the camera cut back to him, \"he's at the fourth stage of grief: construction.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n In the wake of Kirk's murder, Kimmel took to social media to offer condolences to Kirk's family.\n\n \"Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?\" he wrote at the time. \"On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.\"","summary":"\"He would want the episode back up,\" Andrew Kolvet, an executive producer for 'The Charlie Kirk Show' and spokesperson for Turning Point USA, wrote on X","url":"https://people.com/charlie-kirk-show-producer-says-hed-want-south-park-reruns-back-tv-11813295","image":"https://people.com/thmb/HDMctsOHju9Lbgu8el0dj-0_9oI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/southpark-charlie-kirk-1-733d004a86b2459daff0af9696991bc2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 00:08:10","author":"Carson Blackwelder","authors":["Carson Blackwelder"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.067},{"id":361665702,"title":"FRANK FUREDI: How disturbing that the Right is suddenly cancelling its political opponents with as much gusto as the Left","text":"You might never have heard, if you live in the UK, of the American comedian and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. It’s likely that the name of the US ultra-conservative Charlie Kirk was unfamiliar, too, until his assassination last week.\n\nBut in the wake of his murder – shot through the neck as he addressed an open-air audience of students at Utah Valley University – political confrontations have erupted that threaten shocking consequences for life not only in the US but in Britain, too.\n\nKirk’s supporters, in the pro-Trump Maga movement, are seizing the woke Left’s favourite methods for silencing opponents. This week, Kimmel was suspended from his own TV show on the Disney-owned ABC network, and effectively cancelled for making odious statements about Kirk’s killing.\n\nLast Monday, the 57-year-old, who has hosted the Oscars ceremony four times, sneered about the aftermath of the shooting: ‘The Maga Gang is desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.’\n\nHe seemed to be saying that, far from being a radical liberal obsessed with trans rights, the alleged murderer Tyler Robinson, 22, was a Trump supporter. It’s a squalid, cynical claim, bizarrely at odds with Kimmel’s initial reaction on social media, when he deplored the killing and sent ‘love’ to Kirk’s bereaved family.\n\nBut perhaps his real offence was to mock Donald Trump’s reaction to the death. The President, he said, seemed more interested in discussing an extension being built to the White House.\n\n‘This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish,’ mocked the comic.\n\nBy Wednesday night, Kimmel was off the air indefinitely, and Trump was gloating on social media: ‘The ratings-challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.’\n\nI despise Kimmel’s unfounded implication that Kirk’s murderer was a Right-winger. Professional broadcasters ought to respect the facts, not stir up unfounded conspiracy theories.\n\nBut it is deeply disturbing to see a popular TV personality silenced for his opposition to the government. That goes to the heart of everything I hold most valuable.\n\nWhen I was growing up under the Communist regime in Hungary, we spoke two languages – what we believed, and what we were permitted to say.\n\nAt home or among close and trusted friends, I could speak honestly, from the heart. In public, where a word out of place could see my family marked down for surveillance by the secret police, or even thrown into jail, I was much more guarded.\n\nMy father had strong principles and a big mouth, and he would often go beyond the limits of what could safely be said. That shaped not only my political beliefs but my whole personality. I will fight to my last breath to ensure my family and friends never have to submit to the oppressive rule of twin public and private languages.\n\nBut the rise of cancel culture in the West, fuelled by the dogmatic, intolerant Left, spells the end for free speech. I continue to say whatever I believe but, for the past ten years, this has been increasingly regarded as inflammatory.\n\nAt dinner parties, my wife will rap my ankle with her foot to send a message. It happened just the other day, when I worked up a head of steam about self-righteous vegans – Ann gave me a poke under the table, to let me know I was in danger of going too far.\n\nI respect her wisdom, but I also believe fervently that we should all be free to ‘go too far’, providing we are not inciting violence. Anything else is fair comment.\n\nSometimes my views are so outspoken that opponents have accused me of the crime of ‘hate speech’. I do not accept that any such crime exists. I do hate many things – political oppression and intellectual dishonesty, for instance – and if that offends other people, I don’t care. Real freedom in the West is, to me, the freedom to say whatever we believe.\n\nThe Left disavowed that freedom when they started policing our opinions, jokes and even our thoughts. Academics were hounded out of posts for stating obvious biological facts about the differences between men and women; celebrities dropped from the TV schedules for objecting to Covid vaccines or supporting Brexit.\n\nCancel culture took such hold on politics that police patrolling a Black Lives Matter demonstration went down on one knee in front of the protesters, rather than risk denunciation.\n\nUntil now, we have relied on the Right to defend the basics of free speech. But the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel marks a dangerous new trend. Cancellation is such a powerful weapon that it appears Trump and his supporters have decided to adopt it.\n\nKimmel is not the only victim. Ted Cruz, one of Trump’s foremost allies in the Republican party, has called for an Oxford student to be expelled for his comments about Kirk’s assassination.\n\nGeorge Abaraonye, the 21-year-old president-elect of the prestigious Oxford Union, texted, ‘Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s f*****g go!’ – a Gen Z cry of celebration. The fact that Abaraonye had met and debated with Kirk at the university only weeks earlier made an obnoxious sentiment more shocking still.\n\nBut if that’s genuinely how he feels, he should have the right to say so.\n\nPersonally, I don’t see how he can remain the president of the world’s foremost student debating chamber, a haven of free speech, if he appears to endorse the murder of his political opponents. But he should not be expelled – or ‘sent down’, in Oxford parlance.\n\nThe idea that a promising young man should have his education cut short at the behest of a politician thousands of miles away, is far more offensive.\n\nThe new eagerness of the Right to indulge in ‘offence archaeology’, another Left-wing invention, is also troubling. This involves trawling through years of throwaway comments on social media and in private messages to find damning evidence against political opponents.\n\nPeter Mandelson, the disgraced former ambassador to the US, is the latest victim – his career ended by ill-judged emails he sent to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein nearly 20 years ago.\n\nMake no mistake, I detest Mandelson, and there are no words strong enough to describe my loathing of that creature Epstein. But when decades-old communications are dredged up to crucify political enemies, I cannot help remembering life under Communism. And I shudder.\n\nDivisions in the culture wars are now so deep that those on both sides are unable to see their opponents as human. Jimmy Kimmel could not have mocked the death of Charlie Kirk, no matter how wide the gulf between them, if he had remembered this was a real human being, whose young widow and fatherless children now mourn him.\n\nFree speech means the right to disparage and satirise the beliefs of our enemies, while never forgetting the fact that we’re all human – all the same, under the skin. Lose that, and we lose everything.\n\nProfessor Frank Furedi is the director of the think-tank MCC Brussels","summary":"You might never have heard, if you live in the UK, of the American comedian and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel .

However, moments later, Kate approached the duo, awkwardly distracting the First Lady from the Queen.\n\nWhen Melania spotted the royal mother-of-three, she quickly turned in Kate's direction to greet her, apparently calling time on her chat with Camilla.\n\nAn animated discussion between Melania and Kate followed, with Camilla left looking blankly on as if 'left out' from the chat.\n\nNow, footage has revealed just how Camilla dealt with the uncomfortable situation, with body language expert Judi James claiming the Queen is seen 'pulling rank' and 'appearing to shoo Kate away'.\n\nIn the clip, the King's wife wafts her hand to usher Kate to move towards Prince William, 43, before resuming her own conversation with Melania.\n\nEver the polite royal, Kate appeared to dutifully follow Camilla's lead, moving away from the discussion and back to her husband's side.\n\nQueen Camilla 'pulled rank' over the Princess of Wales during their conversation with US First Lady Melania Trump, body language expert Judi James has claimed\n\nTalking to The Daily Mail, James explained: 'On the surface this was just Camilla warning Kate that her carriage was arriving, but the body language undertones look much less congenial.\n\n'Camilla had been chatting to Melania when Kate shot into view, clearly synchronised with William who had simultaneously moved to talk to his father and Trump.\n\n'Kate's energy and her enthusiastic gesticulation seemed to tune with Melania, who turned her head away from Camilla to talk, using some subtly mirrored responses as she did so.\n\n'As the Princess and the First Lady appeared to be in tune here, Camilla turned her head as though feeling slightly left out.\n\n'When she turned back to warn Kate, she seemed to break up a good conversation, and the problem came with her quick flapping of her hand that appeared to shoo Kate away.\n\n'A small smile, nudge and point might have been more acceptable as a gesture to the woman who will be queen, but the lack of a smile and the hard flapping looked rather authoritative here.'\n\nRichard Fitzwilliams, meanwhile, suggested that the perhaps 'perfectly innocent' gesture appeared 'dismissive'. \n\nHe told The Daily Mail: 'It certainly looks as though Catherine is moving away because of The Queen's gesture.\n\nThe Queen appeared to be left out as Melania seemingly checked out of their conversation to chat with Kate\n\nCamilla appeared to usher the future queen away from her conversation with America's First Lady\n\nThird wheeling? The Princess of Wales (left) is seen animatedly chatting to First Lady Melania Trump (right) as Queen Camilla (centre) looks on at Windsor Castle yesterday\n\n'We always see royals being impeccably polite to each other in public so there there may well be a perfectly innocent interpretation of a gesture that, at a distance, appears dismissive. It is unlikely ever to be explained but, as all such incidents are these days, it is being watched by vast numbers online. \n\n'Nothing, however, can alter the fact that the royal family showed that it is the ultimate soft power weapon of the British government with an unrivalled day of ceremonial brilliance.'\n\nMr Fitzwilliams also noted that the carriage pulling up to the royals was likely a horse-drawn one, which could have some bearing on the queen's gesture, saying: 'Sometimes when images are seen at a distance it is easy to misinterpret them especially when horses are involved. It seems likely that Queen Camilla was moving Catherine out of the way of a horse-drawn carriage.' \n\nA Trump spokesperson this week said the couple was 'thrilled' that Kate would be 'front and centre' during the UK trip, saying: 'The inclusion of Princess Kate in so many events during the state visit is an honour.'\n\nEarlier in the day, Prince William and Kate had previously escorted the President and First Lady to Victoria House where the King and Queen were waiting for their guests from across the Pond.\n\nCamilla, who was forced to sit the Duchess of Kent's funeral out due to ill health, wore a vibrant sapphire blue dress with a matching coat by Fiona Clare and hat by Philip Treacy, as well as a sapphire and diamond brooch.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate opted for a Emilia Wickstead dress, paired with a Jane Taylor dress and a studded diamond and emerald feather brooch, that had once belonged to Princess Diana.\n\nAnd the First Lady looked effortlessly chic in a Christian Dior Haute Couture dark grey skirt suit that flared out at the waist and fell just below her knees.\n\nShe wore her blonde tresses in a slick bun that was largely hidden by a wide-brimmed wool hat in a brighter purple hue.\n\nMelania was expertly poised in her heels as she walked alongside Donald, Prince William and Kate in the Walled Garden on the Windsor estate.\n\nLater in the evening, the group reconvened to attend a glittering state banquet alongside other senior royals, including Princess Anne.\n\nKate looked dazzling, sporting a Phillipa Lepley silk crepe gown underneath a hand-embroidered gold Chantilly lace evening coat.\n\nShe also donned the late Queen Elizabeth II's and the King's Royal Family Order and a blue sash, representing that she is a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Kate and Melania met again as they joined a group of Scouts Squirrels, the youngest part of the UK Scouting organisation, which is designed for four to five year olds who work towards their 'Go Wild' badge, in Frogmore Gardens.\n\nOn their arrival, the Princess, who has been joint president of the Scouts with the Duke of Kent since 2020, and the First Lady were met by Dwayne Fields, the Chief Scout.\n\nDwayne escorted his guests to meet two groups of Squirrels who were taking part in a variety of activities as they learned about nature.\n\nKate and Melania enjoyed the opportunity to join the children as they built a bug hotel and tried leaf printing using fallen leaves collected from the gardens.\n\nThe Princess and the First Lady then led a badge presentation for the young Squirrels, before hosting a picnic for The Squirrels in the gardens.\n\nKate had thoughtfully organised a special packed lunch for the children, with each of the children receiving sandwiches containing honey made by The Princess of Wales herself from the Wales family's hives at Anmer Hall.\n\nIn addition, the First Lady gifted a jar of White House honey to each of the children as a memento of their very special day.\n\nThe wellbeing of young children is something which is important to both The Princess and The First Lady, a spokesman explained.\n\nThe Princess has long been passionate about the power of enabling children and young people to experience the natural world.\n\nThe Scouts meet is part of a comprehensive schedule of events detailed by Buckingham Palace for the state visit, which started on Tuesday and runs until the end of today.\n\nRoyalsWindsor CastleMelania Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nQueen Camilla appears to 'pull rank' as Kate chats animatedly with Melania during State visit - and ushers Princess back towards William\n\nAdd comment","summary":"When King Charles's wife welcomed Melania to Windsor Castle for her official state visit yesterday, she found herself in a rather uncomfortable social situation.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-15111351/Queen-Camilla-pull-rank-Kate-chats-Melania-State-visit-William.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/18/15/102254299-0-image-m-78_1758206751289.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/17/1327451401036713499/1024x576_MP4_1327451401036713499.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-19 00:00:08","author":"Alanah Khosla,Editor","authors":["Alanah Khosla","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":361665664,"title":"Trump just humiliated Harry and Meghan with two brutal words... but even more embarrassing is the reason they're having to stay silent: MAUREEN CALLAHAN","text":"For once, a momentous royal week is met with the sound of silence from Montecito.\n\nWhy would Harry and Meghan suddenly — and uncharacteristically — exhibit good manners?\n\nAppropriateness? Decency, even?\n\nI'll give you one guess.\n\nAnd no — it's not because they're graceful enough to allow this historic state visit among President Trump, First Lady Melania, King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales, to be the smashing success it was.\n\nNor is it because they've been humbled by what they threw away, or Meghan's recognition of the unique role she could have played as the American princess welcoming an American president in her adopted homeland.\n\nAs for allowing Charles to revel in a highlight of his brief tenure as King — forget about it.\n\nOr for wisely keeping their mouths shut as the Western world reels from the assassination of Charlie Kirk — for we surely know what Harry and Meghan think of Donald Trump and his ilk.\n\nTo be fair, we actually don't know where Harry stands politically, but he tends to follow Meghan's lead, and while she was no doubt appalled by Kirk's killing, we all know that she hates Trump.\n\nNot that she'll even talk politics anymore. Her softball Bloomberg interview with Emily Chang a few weeks ago made that quite clear.\n\nChang showed a clip of a pre-Harry Meghan on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore from 2016, the future duchess saying what Chang called 'a few choice words' for Trump, while wearing a tight lilac dress and bold red lip.\n\n'Yes, of course, Trump is divisive,' Meghan said, adding that he was 'misogynistic… and so vocal about it.'\n\nWe well know where Meghan stands. But listen to her dodge and weave as Chang tries to get the bare minimum out of Meghan — let alone get Meghan to acknowledge that bare-knuckled earlier statement.\n\n'Are there things that you're dying to say or do right now that you feel like you can't?' Chang asked.\n\n'No,' Meghan said, ever so solicitously. 'I just make a choice. Of what matters to me and what's important to me.'\n\nWell, what seems to be important to Meghan is fame, wealth, adulation and her husband — in that order. Just my opinion.\n\nAnd with her most recent failures surely feeling raw, Meghan has been firmly boxed into one option: Play nice.\n\nThe very recent second drop of her Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, was hardly a resounding success. It didn't even make the streamer's Top 10 upon debut, and the reviews on both sides of the pond, in right and left-leaning publications, were savage.\n\n'Season 2 is as sour as the first' — The Hollywood Reporter\n\n'Like being gaslit by a multimillionaire' — The Independent\n\n'Montecito Marie Antionette' — The Telegraph\n\n'Painfully contrived' —The Guardian\n\nAnd Hilary Rose, in The Times of London, urged anyone viewing to 'start therapy now'.\n\nWise words. If only Meghan and Harry would heed them.\n\nNow, the flop of Meghan's Netflix show — and the scaling back of the Sussexes' overall deal with the streamer — is far from her only fresh humiliation.\n\nShe was a no-show at the Emmy awards. Same at New York Fashion Week — and this is a woman who clearly considers herself an influencer in fashion, if not an icon.\n\nHarry himself is at increasingly loose ends.\n\nWhat does he do all day? He seems to have no real job, no real friends in the US, no animating force or purpose.\n\nWhat he does have, it seems, is a diminishing set of options.\n\nLast week's summit with King Charles, seeing his ill father for the first time in 19 months, consisted of a meeting that ran for just 54 minutes.\n\nAn 11,000-mile journey for less than an hour of face time. How humiliating. How obvious that the King remains suspicious as to his younger son's next move.\n\nFor what do Harry and Meghan have to offer other than their connection to the British Royal Family?\n\nThe meeting has, of course, been spun as a win by Camp Sussex.\n\nWas it, really?\n\nAfter insisting to the media that the tea with Charles was 'private' (please — for how long?), Harry then gave an interview to The Guardian.\n\nThis was not a smart move. Meghan must be incensed.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted anything about his memoir Spare, in which he spilled royal secrets and betrayed his family, Harry said no.\n\n'My conscience is clear,' he said. He then went on to insist that he's happier than ever, even though the last four years have been the equivalent of a firewalk for him.\n\n'I think parts of the British press want to believe that I am miserable, but I'm not,' Harry said. 'I am very happy with who I am and I like the life that I live… I have certainly had to deal with some very stressful events over the last four years. There has been the uncertainty and stress of the litigation' — lawsuits he and his wife keep filing — 'and finding out certain things that have really, really hurt.'\n\nKnow what else must have hurt? Hearing President Trump, at that lavish state banquet, call his visit 'one of the highest honors of my life', before praising King Charles for raising a 'remarkable son' in Prince William.\n\nOf course, Harry just can't help himself. But now he's back under Meghan's influence in Montecito. Perhaps she's got him muzzled in hopes that he can somehow gain access, fresh intel and the chance to replenish those million-dollar deals.\n\nToo bad. Few people could have guided these two in business better than Donald Trump.","summary":"For once, a momentous royal week is met with the sound of silence from Montecito.

That addition, the Congressional Review Act, granted Congress the power to kill new federal regulations with a simple majority vote. Thirty years later, Republican lawmakers are wielding it to quietly upend how the country manages public lands. \n\nOne of the act’s sponsors was Ted Stevens, an irascible Republican from Alaska. Known on Capitol Hill for his temper and the Incredible Hulk tie he sometimes wore, Stevens framed the measure, known as the CRA, as a way to reclaim legislative authority from an overreaching executive branch. Stevens soon collided with scandal: He and other Alaska politicians proudly dubbed themselves the “Corrupt Bastards Club,” after a federal investigation uncovered cash bribes and secret tapes of debauchery with oil executives. The saga exposed the sway that extractive industries hold over political decision-making—a grip soon to tighten as lawmakers use Stevens’ law to wipe out federal land-use plans nationwide.\n\nThe Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn rules finalized in the previous 60 legislative days with a simple majority. This prevents federal agencies from ever creating similar regulations. In its first two decades, the oversight law was used just once. But when Donald Trump took office in 2017, a Republican-led Congress swiftly used the CRA to repeal 16 Obama-era regulations, ranging from environmental protections to labor and financial rules. (Congress also used it three times during President Joe Biden’s first term.)\n\nNow, conservatives want to use it to advance President Trump’s extraction agenda in a way that tests the bounds of the law. In July, Alaska Representative Nick Begich proposed a bill to overturn the federal management plan for 13 million acres—an area four times the size of New York—across his state’s northwest flank. The region includes land near the proposed Ambler road, which would cross 211 miles and through Gates of the Arctic National Park to mineral deposits. The plan provides environmental protections for important salmon spawning grounds, where runs have recently dwindled, and critical caribou habitat. \n\nThe move comes amid an ongoing campaign by the Trump administration to radically remake how the nation’s resources are managed. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), for example, just announced plans to rescind a Biden-era rule that placed conservation on equal footing with other uses of federal land. It also follows nationwide outcry over a proposed giveaway of public lands; Representative Ryan Zinke, who opposed the transfer of Western lands this summer, nevertheless voted in favor of the Central Yukon’s resource management plan. (Zinke did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nBegich made clear that he intends to streamline development of the region. “It is federal overreach that is ensuring that Alaska’s wealth stays in the ground, unavailable to the people of one of America’s most impoverished regions,” he said on the House floor. \n\nThe BLM finalized Central Yukon’s latest resource management plan last year after more than a decade of extensive public engagement involving tribes, local communities, and state and federal agencies. It concluded that over 3 million acres should be considered areas of critical environmental concern, and protected. Contrary to Begich’s claims, Alaskans largely supported this decision. The process cost the federal government $6.7 million. Ignoring it, said Mollie Busby, who lives in the affected area in the small town of Wiseman, ignores the voices of those directly impacted by the plan. She worries that without the plan’s protections, the natural resources her family and neighbors depend upon will disappear. “This plan should not be overturned on a whim by Congress,” she said. \n\nShould the legislation—which passed the House on September 3 and is now before the Senate—become law, resource management plans nationwide could be at risk. Republican lawmakers have introduced bills to upend plans regulating fossil fuel and mining in the Powder River Basin in Montana, and swaths of North Dakota. “We are in uncharted territory here,” Representative Sarah Elfreth, a Democrat from Maryland, said during a House Rules Committee hearing in July. “Congress has never used the Congressional Review Act to overturn a resource management plan, or any other similar land use plan in our history.” \n\nBecause the Department of the Interior has never considered these plans eligible for review under the CRA, it never submitted them to Congress. The CRA requires that before a “rule” can take effect and the 60-day look-back period begins. After the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, determined in June that the Central Yukon resource management plan qualifies as a “rule,” Congress may now rescind it. \n\nThis precedent may unravel decades of land policy. “Hundreds of resource management plans that have been finalized since 1996 will never have technically taken effect,” says Justin Meuse, government relations director for The Wilderness Society. That, he said, calls into question everything built on them—“oil and gas leases, drilling permits, rights of way, timber allotments.” \n\nThe likely result, he argued, is a cascade of uncertainty for the industries Republicans champion. “It should be scary to oil and gas companies, to anybody who farms, grazes, or uses timber on public lands,” Meuse said. A letter sent to Congress by 31 law professors concludes the move “threatens to paralyze public land management nationwide.”\n\nThis summer, the GAO also determined that the Biden’s administration’s 2022 decision to close 11 million acres of Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve to oil leases was subject to the CRA, opening it up to repeal. By pushing the CRA beyond its customary look-back window, lawmakers could begin unraveling hard-won protections long after they were thought secure.\n\nMeuse called these determinations a dangerous expansion of the Congressional Review Act’s scope, one that may have sweeping implications beyond conservation. “We’re seeing the CRA being applied much, much more broadly than we ever have before,” he said. Other federal agencies—such as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Transportation—could face challenges to long-standing regulations never previously treated as “rules,” potentially sparking litigation and halting years of carefully planned programs.\n\nAs the House passed Begich’s bill to repeal the Central Yukon plan in early September, Jack Reakoff watched in disbelief. A longtime Wiseman resident, he fears scuttling the plan will open the door to a transfer of federal land to the state. \n\nThe lands at stake are not empty wilderness, as they are often portrayed, but a vibrant network of rivers, migration corridors, and food for residents. They are managed for a variety of uses under federal rules that prioritize rural food security, and give those communities a voice through the Federal Subsistence Board. The 2024 Central Yukon plan maintained federal oversight over millions of acres, including federal subsistence protections for residents like Reakoff that are not allowed under the state constitution. \n\nThe use of the CRA is just one of many avenues the state is pursuing to seize control of millions of acres of federal land to benefit extractive industries. Bruce Westerman, a forester and the chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, explicitly cited the Ambler Industrial Access road as a reason to overturn the management plan. The unpopular road, which the Biden administration scuttled, would threaten North America’s largest protected region, disrupt caribou migration, and pollute waterways—while using state funds to subsidize a road that would primarily benefit mining companies.\n\n“It is not all about Ambler and the utility corridor, but the entire district,” Reakoff says, adding that using the CRA “throws the baby out with the bathwater.” Reakoff says the state doesn’t have the resources to appropriately manage the lands it already controls, and he fears the state will open the area to ATVs that tear up fragile tundra and non-resident rifle hunting that could decimate wildlife already threatened by climate change. He’s also concerned about additional industrial traffic, and whether the state will have the budget to maintain the road. \n\nThe Busbys, meanwhile, say using the CRA ignores the voices of many small businesses that currently have federal permits to access Gates of The Arctic and surrounding BLM land, plunging their operations into limbo.\n\nLegal experts remain uncertain about the broader implications of this unprecedented move. If the bill passes the Senate, where a vote is expected this week, it’s still unclear what will replace the 2024 plan. It could potentially revert to resource management plans approved in 1986 and 1991, over the objections of six tribal councils. It’s also uncertain what the CRA’s restriction on issuing a “substantially similar” plan may mean and could make crafting a modern replacement might never be possible.\n\nThis legal ambiguity carries serious consequences for communities across Alaska. Karma Ulvi, chief of the Native Village of Eagle, said the repeal threatens the ability of tribes to have a meaningful voice in managing the lands they rely on. “It’s going to have an impact on our culture, our food sovereignty,” she said. The central Yukon salmon populations have already crashed, she says, and mining or additional infrastructure could harm their chances of recovery. “Our Congressmen need to consult with the tribes, and ask how this could impact us,” she says. “I’m really afraid that the priorities now are just extraction and money.”","summary":"This story was originally published by&#160;Grist and is reproduced here as part of the&#160;Climate Desk&#160;collaboration.

This change comes after Democrats had repeatedly delayed votes on many of Trump’s nominees, frustrating Republicans and the president alike.\nIn response to these delays, Senate Republicans moved last week to ease the confirmation process for large groups of lower-level, non-judicial nominations. Under the previous rules, a single objection could block a nominee, requiring multiple votes that tied up the Senate floor and slowed down the confirmation process.\nThe newly adopted rules allow Republicans to confirm multiple nominees with a simple majority vote. However, this expedited process does not apply to judicial nominees or high-ranking Cabinet positions, which still require traditional procedures.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune hailed the change, stating, “Republicans have fixed a broken process.” The Senate voted 51-47 to approve the group of nominees, all of whom had previously received bipartisan committee approval. Among those confirmed were deputy secretaries for the Departments of Defense, Interior, Energy, and others.\nNotable confirmations included Jonathan Morrison as the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Kimberly Guilfoyle as US ambassador to Greece. Guilfoyle, a former California prosecutor and television personality, played a key role in fundraising for Trump’s 2020 campaign and was once engaged to Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr.\nThis move is the latest chapter in over a decade of incremental changes by both parties to weaken the filibuster and politicise the nominations process. Both Democrats and Republicans have historically obstructed their opponents’ nominees, but this is the first time in recent memory that the minority party has blocked fast-track confirmations almost entirely.\nRepublicans proposed the rule change in early August, following a monthlong Senate recess and a breakdown in bipartisan talks. The move was intensified after Trump publicly told Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to “GO TO HELL!” on social media.\nDemocrats have justified their delays by criticising Trump’s nominees as “historically bad,” with Schumer warning Republicans that they would “come to regret” the procedural changes. His remarks echoed similar warnings from GOP Leader Mitch McConnell during the 2013 rule changes under Democratic control, which Republicans later expanded for Supreme Court nominations in 2017.\nSchumer argued last week that Republicans are “chipping away at the Senate” to give Trump unchecked power to confirm nominees “no questions asked.”\nLooking ahead, Republicans plan to confirm a second batch of nominees soon, aiming to clear the backlog of more than 100 pending appointments.\n“There will be more to come,” Thune said Thursday. “And we’ll ensure that President Trump’s administration is filled at a pace that looks more like those of his predecessors.”","summary":"Democrats have justified their delays by criticising Trump’s nominees as “historically bad.”","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/senate-uses-new-procedures-to-confirm-48-trump-appointees-in-single-vote-aa-ws-l-9582224.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/Charlie-Keith-Trump-death-2025-09-4d39954bdc4c394b7a4b5d6881e65309.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 23:28:27","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":361663940,"title":"Pritzker’s office scrubs photo with Chicago 'peacekeeper' later charged in deadly robbery","text":"Democrat Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is under fire after posing for a picture alongside a Chicago-area resident involved in the city's \"peacekeeper\" program, who just days later was charged in a fatal crash-and-grab robbery that resulted in the death of a soon-to-be father. Pritzker's office confirmed to Fox News that it removed a photo within an official government press release of the governor and the man donning a \"peacekeepers program\" vest, identified as Kellen McMiller, who was charged last week in connection with the deadly burglary. The photo with Pitzker was taken as part of a week-long initiative where the governor traveled to various locations around Chicago to meet with different community leaders, such as school administrators, community violence interventionists, and local business leaders. Meanwhile, court records showed that at the time McMiller posed with his photo next to Illinois' highest ranking official, he had four outstanding arrest warrants, the Chicago-Sun Times reported. PRITZKER URGED TO AVOID PLAYING POLITICS ON CRIME ISSUE BY FORMER OBAMA ADVISOR In response to the photo faux-pas, Pritzker's office put out a statement indicating they were \"extremely troubled\" to learn of McMiller's arrest and his alleged involvement in a fatal robbery. \"The Governor meets hundreds of people in communities every week and is often asked to take photos,\" a Pritzker spokesperson said in a statement shared with the media. \"We were extremely troubled to learn that this individual was arrested for his alleged involvement in this serious crime, and we expect them to be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The Governor will keep doing everything in his power to fight crime, keep our neighborhoods safe, and support community violence intervention, which have been proven to work. For example, the Peacekeepers Program has a strong track record reducing violent crime by 41% over the past two years and providing community members with a path towards rehabilitation.\" McMiller, who is 35-years-old, was charged with murder, burglary and retail theft alongside six co-defendants for a Sept. 11 crash-and-grab theft at a Louis Vuitton store along Chicago's Miracle Mile. The photo with Pritzker took place six days prior, during an event highlighting the city's \"peacekeepers\" who work in community violence prevention to help reduce the ongoing violent crime in Chicago. McMiller wore the group’s uniform as he stood next to the governor. ICE RIPS PRITZKER FOR ‘SIDING WITH CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIEN’ AFTER OFFICER DRAGGED, SUSPECT SHOT DEAD Prosecutors alleged that McMiller was part of a team that smashed a pickup truck into the Louis Vuitton store, stealing nearly $700,000 in merchandise. As police arrived, one of the getaway cars slammed into another vehicle that was driven by 40-year-old Mark Aceta. Aceta was subsequently killed in the crash, which occurred one day before his girlfriend gave birth to their son. This incident with Pritzker comes as he and President Donald Trump continue to spar over whether the federal government should deploy National Guard troops into Chicago to help quell the city's violent crime. However, Pritzker has argued back that there is no crime emergency going on in Chicago that would call for federal troops to intervene. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Still, the president has threatened to send the National Guard even if Pritzker tries to stop him. \"If Pritzker was smart, he would say, 'Please come in,'\" Trump told reporters earlier this week. \"If they lose less than six or seven people a week with murder, they're doing a great job in their opinion. Chicago is a death trap, and I'm going to make it just like I did with D.C., just like I'll do with Memphis.\"","summary":"Illinois Gov.

Santa Rosa Junior College faced Sierra College in Rocklin weeks after multiple Santa Rosa players filed a Title IX complaint about the school's handling of a biological male teammate. Sierra won the game in straight sets. One of the protesters, local women's sports activist Beth Bourne, handed out protest signs to students who attended the game and said it was the first time she'd seen college students protest the issue in person. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"This was the first time we experienced college students spectating the game, asking us if they could also hold a sign to show their support for the women. We have been at dozens of volleyball games, track meets, cross country races and other sporting events with males, but this was the first time we saw this type of support. \"We are hopeful the tide is turning, and more people feel comfortable speaking out on this injustice to women,\" Bourne told Fox News Digital. Bourne added that Sierra's men's athletes even joined in on the protesting. \"We were unsure if the signs were allowed at the game, but we waited until a timeout was called before handing them to the young male athletes to hold. We had them out for less than a few minutes,\" she said. \"We heard one young man from Sierra College say, ‘Yes, ma’am! Yes, ma’am!’ Then this group of young men asked her if they could also hold some of our signs. \"We left the game feeling very hopeful that more people are willing to speak out on behalf of these girls and women impacted by males in their sport.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to Santa Rosa and Sierra College for a response. Santa Rosa previously provided a statement addressing the initial Title IX complaint. \"Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC) is committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment for all students and employees. The district complies with California Community College Athletic Association (3C2A) regulations, which govern student eligibility and participation in our athletic programs,\" the statement read. \"We respect the legal privacy rights of all students and cannot discuss individual circumstances. What we can affirm is that SRJC takes all reports seriously and responds through established procedures.\" Two of the female Santa Rosa athletes that signed the complaint, Madison Shaw and Gracie Shaw, told Fox News Digital about alleged physical harm caused by the trans teammate. INSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS Madison alleged she saw the trans athlete spike a ball in her teammate's face so hard, that it caused a concussion last spring. \"It had so much force and so much impact with my teammate's head that it resulted in a concussion. She was out for two weeks of her sophomore year, and she was upset. And, obviously, injuries happen, it's inevitable, especially in a contact sport, but this one particularly could have been prevented by not having this male athlete on the team,\" Madison said. \"She was telling me how infuriating (it was) because she didn't believe this athlete belonged on our team and now that she's suffering the consequences, it really bothered her. But a majority of our team, unfortunately, doesn't see it the way we see it. They support the male athlete being on the team.\" Gracie alleged she was struck in the head by one of the trans athlete's spikes. \"I myself got hit in the face by this male athlete in practice in August. I was ready. I knew this male athlete was about to hit the ball, and I couldn't move out of the way. And the ball spiked me in the face, and it was way harder than any other hit that I'd gotten from the other female athletes on our team,\" Gracie said. \"It did hurt pretty bad. … It came at my face so fast I didn't even have time to react.\" The two women, alongside teammate Brielle Galli, filed their Title IX complaint against the school to the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights earlier this month in consultation with the Independent Council for Women's Sports (ICONS). Their complaint alleged the school administrators retaliated against them when they spoke up internally in opposition to letting the trans athlete on the team. \"We've told our coach, our athletic director and our Title IX coordinator from the get-go that we want to play, we want to be part of this team, but we're not willing to take the court while a male athlete is on the team,\" Madison said. She added that the school administrators gave her a delayed response whether they would honor her request and declined it. Then, when Madison prepared a speech to tell her teammates that she would be stepping away from the team because of the trans athlete, her coach told her she \"can't.\" \"Our coach sends me a text saying, 'No, you cannot tell the team your reasons for not taking the court, and we really need to respect the male athlete’s privacy,\" Madison said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP California has become a hotbed of national controversies involving trans athletes, specifically volleyball players, dating back to last year. The state's Department of Education is already being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice for its continued policies that allow biological males to compete in the girls and women's categories in sports. At the NCAA Division I level, San Jose State University's women's volleyball team faced a controversy involving trans athlete Blaire Fleming last fall, which prompted a federal Title IX investigation into the school after President Donald Trump returned to office earlier this year. At the high school level, a trans athlete for the Jurupa Valley High School girls' volleyball team has prompted two other players to step away from the team and file a lawsuit against the school district, while at least four opponents have forfeited games to the team.

He also repeated his plea for Nato allies to impose tariffs on countries purchasing Russian oil, saying that if the oil price drops, Putin will pull out of the war. \n\nSir Keir did not disagree, saying: ‘There are a number of European countries which are too reliant on energy from Russia, the UK actually, obviously, has almost got nothing at all, but we do need to bear down and work with our European counterparts here.’\n\nFREE SPEECH\n\nThe killing of US conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week was ‘shocking’ to everyone who believes in free speech, Sir Keir said, adding the fatal shooting ‘sent shockwaves through the world’. \n\nThe Prime Minister revealed he contacted Mr Trump immediately afterwards to offer his sympathies. ‘I reached out straight away to the President, because I understood how impactful it would be on him and his family.’\n\nDespite US tech firms claiming they face censorship under Britain’s Online Safety Act, Sir Keir insisted: ‘Free speech is one of the founding values of the United Kingdom, and we protect it jealously and fiercely and always will.’ \n\nBut he added: ‘I draw a limit between free speech and the speech of those that want to peddle paedophilia and suicide [on] social media to children.’\n\nSir Keir suggested he is a Christian despite previously calling himself an atheist. Asked if Britain is still a Christian country, the Prime Minister replied: ‘I was christened, so that is my church, has been all my life. \n\nAnd that is wired into our informal constitution.’ He went on: ‘Of course, we celebrate many other faiths as well and I’m really proud that we’re able to do so as a country.’ \n\nHowever, in a 2021 interview he admitted: ‘I am not of faith, I don’t believe in God – but I can see the power of faith and the way it brings people together.’ \n\nHis wife Lady Starmer is Jewish and he has previously spoken about how they keep Jewish traditions in their family home but their two children are not being brought up in the faith.\n\nSTATE VISIT\n\nThe President lavished praise on the Royal Family and the Prime Minister as he hailed the ‘exquisite honour’ of a second state visit. \n\nDescribing the ties between the US and Britain as ‘priceless’, Mr Trump said the countries were now ‘closer than ever before’. He referred to King Charles and Queen Camilla as ‘two fantastic people’, and called the British Isles ‘beautiful’ and ‘magnificent’. \n\nThe UK and US were ‘forever friends and will always be friends’, he added, going on to say: ‘This enduring connection is why I was thrilled that the UK was the very first country with which we made an historic trade deal.’\n\nReferring to Sir Keir, he added: ‘He’s a tough negotiator.’\n\nThe transatlantic trade deal agreed earlier this year was better for the US than the UK, Mr Trump claimed. \n\nIn his opening remarks at the Chequers press conference, he praised Sir Keir, saying: ‘He is a great negotiator who will extend our unparalleled security alliance into the realm of economic security for the first time, and I look forward to finalising it very soon. \n\nHe added that he was ‘thrilled’ that the UK was the first country his administration did a trade deal with, after imposing hefty tariffs on most of the world. The Prime Minister said the new tech agreement signed during Mr Trump’s state visit ‘has the power to change lives’. \n\nAs Mr Trump put his name on the deal, he joked with his treasury secretary Scott Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, asking: ‘Should I sign this Howard? Scott? If the deal’s no good I’m blaming you.’\n\nThe defence relationship between the UK and America is the ‘deepest’ in the world, Sir Keir claimed. \n\n‘Our warriors train together, and they fight together,’ he said. The Prime Minister told how everything from fast jets to Orka-class submarines were built by the two countries’ industries, and pledged to remove barriers to close working on new technologies. \n\nMr Trump praised Sir Keir for having committed to increasing the UK’s defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP, up from just 2.3 per cent last year.\n\n‘I want to congratulate the United Kingdom on making the vital commitment to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence at the Nato summit this year. We’ve worked together very closely in so many ways,’ the President said.\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\nThe US wants to regain possession of a major military base in Afghanistan, Mr Trump revealed. He suggested he was negotiating over the return of Bagram Airfield with the Taliban, which seized the base as Joe Biden pulled US forces out of the country in 2021.\n\n‘One of the biggest air bases in the world. We gave it to them for nothing. We’re trying to get it back, by the way,’ Mr Trump told reporters. \n\n‘We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us. We want that base back. But one of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.’","summary":"It was the highest-risk moment of a meticulously stage managed state visit, but Donald Trump and Sir Keir Starmer presented an almost united front during a lengthy press conference yesterday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15113005/Starmer-Trump-wrestle-key-issues-divide-them.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/18/23/102267779-0-image-m-33_1758235731822.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 23:17:58","author":"Editor,Harriet Line,Martin Beckford","authors":["Editor","Harriet Line","Martin Beckford"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":361655522,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Makes First Public Appearance Following Show’s Surprise Cancellation","text":"Jimmy Kimmel appeared visibly stressed as he was seen publicly for the first time after his show was canceled following criticism over his remarks about the assassination of Charlie Kirk.\n\nKirk was tragically shot dead while debating students at the Utah Valley University campus on September 10.\n\nDuring his program the subsequent Monday, Kimmel commented that the ‘MAGA crew is fervently attempting to depict the young man who killed Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of their own, leveraging any opportunity to gain political advantage from it.’\n\nThe accused assailant has been named as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who grew up in a staunchly Republican family and was living with his transgender partner at the time of the incident. Family members noted his increasing political engagement recently.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kimmel’s late night show Jimmy Kimmel Live! was suspended ‘indefinitely’ amid the MAGA backlash over his comments.\n\nHe was spotted for the first time in public on Thursday afternoon, wearing black sunglasses and a navy button down in the drivers seat of his Audi.\n\nDespite Kimmel’s effort to appear calm and smiling while exiting a vehicle, earlier images showed him in a tense moment with his head in his hands.\n\nIt is understood the pictures of Kimmel were taken at a Century City location where several law firms are based.\n\nThe late-night host had also poked fun at President Donald Trump’s reaction to the shooting during his segment.\n\n‘This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend,’ he said. ‘This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.’\n\nShortly after ABC announced Kimmel had been suspended, Trump said: ‘The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED.\n\n‘Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.’ \n\nStaff of the Jimmy Kimmel Show! were seen packing up their gear from the Los Angeles studio on Wednesday, hours after the host was brutally axed. \n\nHollywood unions SAG-AFTRA and WGA showed their support for Kimmel — who is a member of both — in light of the news, as per Deadline.\n\nA statement from SAG-AFTRA decried the halting of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, emphasizing the importance of freedom of speech in society. “Suppressing free expression and retaliating against those who speak on key public issues are contrary to the essential rights we all rely on,” the guild stated.\n\nThe statement continued, “Democracy is strengthened when multiple viewpoints are heard. The decision to put a halt to Jimmy Kimmel Live! exemplifies a kind of censorship that threatens everyone’s freedoms. SAG-AFTRA supports all media professionals and champions their right to voice diverse opinions, as well as the public’s right to hear them.”\n\nThe Writers Guild of America West and Writers Guild of America East also condemned the decision.\n\n‘The right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other – to disturb, even – is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people. It is not to be denied. Not by violence, not by the abuse of governmental power, nor by acts of corporate cowardice.’\n\n‘As a Guild, we stand united in opposition to anyone who uses their power and influence to silence the voices of writers, or anyone who speaks in dissent. If free speech applied only to ideas we like, we needn’t have bothered to write it into the Constitution. \n\n‘What we have signed on to – painful as it may be at times – is the freeing agreement to disagree. Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth. As for our employers, our words have made you rich. Silencing us impoverishes the whole world.’ \n\nThe television personality’s remarks had caught instant flak from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson earlier on Wednesday that he was considering an investigation into Kimmel and his network ABC for his claims. \n\n‘When you look at the conduct that has taken place by Jimmy Kimmel, it appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible,’ Carr told Johnson.\n\n‘As you’ve indicated, there are avenues here for the FCC, so there… are some ways in which I need to be a little bit careful because we could be called ultimately to be a judge on some of these claims that come up,’ Carr said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJimmy Kimmel appeared visibly stressed as he was seen publicly for the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Jimmy Kimmel Makes First Public Appearance Following Show&#8217;s Surprise Cancellation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/jimmy-kimmel-makes-first-public-appearance-following-shows-surprise-cancellation/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jimmy-Kimmel-emerges-for-first-time-after-shows-shock-cancellation.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 23:16:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.162},{"id":361665680,"title":"Billionaire mogul David Geffen, 82, offers divorce settlement to former male go-go dancer, 32","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Sep 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeartbroken family of Greek heiress who died after being bitten by an insect threaten legal action against hospitals over 'doctor's negligence'\n\nSomalian migrant living in Epping hotel thanks Keir Starmer 'from the bottom of my heart' after winning right to stay in the UK\n\nTurning Point USA names Charlie Kirk's widow Erika as its new CEO\n\nHow Thomas Skinner's mistress turned on ME.

He noted that for paying customers he would 'put on a good show.'\nSometime between 2016 and 2017 he moved to New York City and started going by Donovan Michaels.\nA former girlfriend said she only knew of him dating women, but that she 'wouldn't be surprised' if he were with men.\n\nIn the fresh court filings handled by Hollywood’s go-to divorce shark Laura Wasser, Geffen claims he’s bent over backwards to settle the ugly spousal support fight — but mediation tanked, and he accuses Armstrong of trying to squeeze him with a media smear campaign \n'I mean, he's very attractive,' she told The Post. 'He would tell me people just assumed that he was into guys from what he posts on Instagram.'\n'I know that he was getting comments like that from gay men, that he was really attractive and in really good shape.'\nA friend of Michael's said he wouldn't be surprised if he'd married Geffen, noting he was 'always looking for his next adventure and was really determined to improve his life.'\nGeffen came out as gay in 1992 after years of being linked to a string of well-known women, including Cher.\nIt was not Geffen's first age gap romance. In 2012, when he was 69, he split from Jeremy Lingvall, who was 41 at the time, after six years together. \n\nGeffen (R) co-founded Dreamworks in 1994 with Jeffrey Katzenberg (L) and Steven Spielberg (C); they are pictured in 1996\nIn 2012 the music mogul also dated 20-year-old former college football player Jamie Kuntz, and at one point filed a restraining order against him. \nEarlier in his storied career, Geffen founded Asylum records, which signed musical sensations like Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, and the Eagles. \nHe later founded Geffen records, which went on to release the work of artists including Elton John, Cher, Aerosmith, Blink-182, Guns N' Roses, and Nirvana.\nAlong with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg, Geffen co-founded DreamWorks in the 1990s. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBillionaire mogul David Geffen, 82, offers divorce settlement to former male go-go dancer, 32\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 71\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., for a House Ethics Committee investigation, he first told Fox News Digital. It is the latest move in the GOP-led fallout over Omar's response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist who was shot and killed in Utah during a college campus speaking event last week. \"I will be filing tomorrow … a complaint with the Committee on Ethics in the House of Representatives with 18 very concerning incidents and/or behaviors and/or statements that, on their face, reflect poorly on the House of Representatives,\" Flood said of Omar. The top of the list of complaints will include the progressive Democrat's \"obnoxious, insulting and dismissive comments following the assassination of Charlie Kirk,\" he said.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., moved to force a vote on censuring Omar over her reaction to Kirk's killing, but the move was quashed when four Republicans and all Democrats voted to table the measure. Flood said at the time of his vote, \"Ilhan Omar's statements and social media posts are reprehensible and should be referred to the Ethics Committee. The appropriate time to consider a censure motion would be after ethics reviews her conduct.\" He told Fox News Digital on Thursday that first initiating an ethics investigation would make a censure \"far more credible.\" Flood pointed out that he similarly voted to table a censure threat against Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., for her conduct outside a New Jersey ICE facility, before the ethics committee could issue a report on the matter. \"And so I have gathered enough information, starting yesterday, before I voted to table, understanding that this was an issue,\" Flood said. He also disagreed with the other three House Republicans who all said Omar's comments were protected by the First Amendment. \"This isn't a free speech issue. This is a, have you demonstrated that you are behaving at all times in a manner that reflects credibly on the House?\" Flood said. Omar specifically faced backlash over an interview with progressive news outlet Zeteo, where she criticized Kirk's past commentary and Republicans' reaction to the shooting. She later accused Republicans of taking her words out of context, and she called Kirk's death \"mortifying.\" SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES OVER SECURITY LAPSES SURROUNDING THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOOTING She previously told Zeteo days after Kirk's assassination that he had \"downplayed slavery and what Black people have gone through in this country by saying Juneteenth shouldn't exist.\" \"There are a lot of people who are out there talking about him just wanting to have a civil debate,\" the \"Squad\" member said. \"There is nothing more effed up, you know, like, than to completely pretend that, you know, his words and actions have not been recorded and in existence for the last decade or so.\" She later posted on X amid the backlash, \"While I disagreed with Charlie Kirk vehemently about his rhetoric, my heart breaks for his wife and children. I don’t wish violence on anyone. My faith teaches me the power of peace, empathy, and compassion. Right-wing accounts trying to spin a false story when I condemned his murder multiple times is fitting for their agenda to villainize the left to hide from the fact that Donald Trump gins up hate on a daily basis.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Omar also reposted a video on X where others who are not associated with the congresswoman said, \"Don't be fooled, these people don't give a single s--- about Charlie Kirk.

Subscribe here.\nWelcome to The Logoff: The Trump administration is leaning into its attack on free speech after pressuring ABC to take late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air. \nWhat happened? Kimmel was suspended by ABC on Wednesday after comments from President Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr. \nIn a podcast appearance Wednesday, Carr said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\nSubsequently, two major broadcast groups announced their intent to pull Kimmel’s show from local stations; Nexstar, one of those groups, needs FCC approval for a pending merger.\nWhat did Kimmel say? Ostensibly, Kimmel’s suspension was over arguably misleading but relatively anodyne remarks he made about the death of Charlie Kirk earlier this week. On Thursday, however, Trump gave away the game, telling reporters that, “When you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump…They’re not allowed to do that.”\nWhy does this matter? Under the First Amendment, the government cannot suppress speech, no matter how much it might disagree with it. Kimmel’s suspension didn’t require any concrete action by the FCC, but it clearly came in response to Carr’s comments. \nCarr also said Thursday that “I don’t think this is the last shoe to drop…the consequences are going to continue to flow.”\nWhat’s the big picture? As my colleague Zack Beauchamp has written, this is Trump’s most brazen attack on free speech yet, and right out of a familiar autocratic playbook. Trump has a long way to go before he achieves a level of media control like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán — but the speed with which he was able to get Kimmel suspended is a concerning sign. \nAnd with that, it’s time to log off…\nHi readers!

The case — which involves a naturalized American citizen who claims her Chinese husband married her solely for a green card — could carry enormous national impact. (RELATED: Here’s How Obama Paved The Way For America’s Roads To Be Filled With ‘Illiterate’ Foreign Truckers)\n\nMarriage-based petitions are the single largest category of green cards, according to government data. The BIA, tasked with reviewing decisions by the U.S. immigration court system, has only ever been used to help foreign nationals appeal denials — until now.\n\n“The Board of Immigration Appeals will decide whether its regulation allows U.S. citizens to challenge previously approved marriage petitions based on newly discovered fraud — bringing needed sunlight to a secretive process that has allowed fraud to fester inside DHS [Department of Homeland Security] for decades,” Cody Brown, the attorney for the petitioner, stated to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe wife — who agreed to share her appeal with the DCNF on the condition of anonymity — is seeking an annulment from her husband based on alleged marriage fraud. In legal filings to the BIA, she presented evidence that alleges her husband had a premeditated plan to obtain legal permanent status while on a temporary visa, took advantage of her while she was healing from an injury and was heavily medicated, but showed no interest in the marriage one he obtained a green card.\n\nWhat makes her case unique is that she is appealing an already-approved I-130 petition, which is a form filed with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) by an American citizen or lawful permanent resident for a relative who wishes to immigrate to the U.S. Throughout its history, the BIA has only considered petitions that were denied by USCIS.\n\nAt the center of the case is one regulation which grants the BIA appellate jurisdiction over DHS “decisions.” Brown is arguing that the term “decisions” includes both denials and approvals. Should the BIA rule in Brown’s favor, he expects immigration officials to more openly review already-approved petitions if and when a sponsor complains.\n\n“This is a critical test of whether the Trump administration is serious about enforcement beyond the border,” Brown told the DCNF. “Declaring a ‘war on fraud’ means little if career staff inside DOJ [Department of Justice] and DHS can quietly shield fraudulent approvals from review.”\n\nA History Of Little Enforcement \n\nMarriage fraud is a serious crime under U.S. law that can render a guilty immigrant ineligible for benefits, but activists have long argued that federal agencies are not prioritizing the issue.\n\nMarriage is the largest pathway to lawful permanent residence for migrants, according to DHS data. Of the nearly 1.2 million migrants who obtained a green card in fiscal year 2023, more than 755,800 were sponsored by a family member, with 276,080 of them being sponsored by a spouse. However, available data demonstrates that virtually zero enforcement is made against marriage fraud.\n\nUSCIS, the agency tasked with managing the country’s legal immigration system, does not regularly publish fraud denial statistics, but data obtained in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and shared in the petitioner’s legal documents sheds light on the subject.\n\nBetween fiscal years 2016 and 2019, federal immigration officials issued virtually zero denials among the five principal forms used in marriage-based immigration adjudications, according to FOIA data.\n\nAgency insiders say lack of enforcement against marriage fraud has been a pervasive issue for years.\n\n“USCIS and DOJ have known about astronomically high rates of marriage fraud for decades,” Matt O’Brien, former chief of the National Security Division within USCIS’ Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate, said to the DCNF. “But pressure from pro alien groups and DOJ’s refusal to prosecute any fraud cases that are not a guaranteed win have created a permissive environment where there has been virtually no consequences for entering into a fraudulent marriage to get a green card.”\n\n“And this, in turn, feeds into the fraudulent exploitation of other programs like Violence Against Women Act petitions — which allow an alien to obtain a green card on the basis of alleged domestic abuse — without any consideration of the sponsoring U.S. citizen’s side of the story,” said O’Brien, who now serves as a executive deputy director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\n\nAs the managing attorney of a law firm that specializes in representing clients who are victims of immigration fraud, Brown is no stranger to the issue. In July, he led a group of marriage fraud victims in a petition that demanded federal immigration authorities adopt a formal process allowing Americans to blow the whistle against marriage-based green cards upon new evidence of fraud.\n\nEvidence of one-sided marriage fraud typically emerges only after a petition has been approved, leaving victims with little avenue for recourse given there is no formal process for post-approval review.\n\n“If a foreign national has a benefit denied, there are ten ways to fight it,” Brown said at the time of his request. “But if a U.S. citizen discovers fraud after the fact, they’re told to submit a tip and hope for the best.”\n\nTrump Administration Cracking Down On Fraud\n\nThe Trump administration — which has championed enforcement against illegal immigration — has begun to take actions against marriage fraud.\n\nUSCIS dismantled a major domestic marriage fraud network in March. The agency worked alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement to uncover a “sophisticated network of individuals” involved in the rampant scheme that allegedly generated millions in illicit revenue. The individuals behind the scheme allegedly charged foreign nationals anywhere from $20,000 to $40,000 per marriage union, generating an estimated $4 million in illicit proceeds.\n\nHowever, this operation targeted a classic sham marriage scheme. One-sided marriage fraud cases can be much tougher for authorities to address.\n\nUpon his return to the agency earlier this year, USCIS Director Joe Edlow told the DCNF that he quickly discovered just how little was done to address immigration fraud during the Biden administration’s four years in power. Edlow has since buckled down on asylum fraud, identified discrepancies in immigration programs, tightened election integrity and vowed to do more.\n\nImmediately after President Donald Trump entered office, his administration fired top immigration court officials and, in April, enacted another round of layoffs within the immigration court system, ostensibly removing judges who are not aligned with the president’s agenda.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has overseen unprecedented reductions in illegal immigration, with Customs and Border Protection officials declaring record-low activity along the U.S.-Mexico border since his return to office. Brown argues that changes to marriage fraud enforcement naturally align with Trump’s hawkish agenda.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is the parent agency of the BIA, acknowledged that it has jurisdiction over family-based immigration petitions, but referred questions over petition approvals to DHS. An EOIR spokesperson further stated that the agency has “long remained” alert against immigration fraud and that it “recently re-confirmed” its commitment to an anti-fraud program.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Increasingly under Trump, immigrants have been arrested by ICE agents after leaving immigration court hearings at the site, and detained in holding rooms on the 10th floor.\n\nImmigrants' rights advocates have sued the Trump administration, contending that conditions in the 10th floor holding areas are cramped and \"inhumane.\" A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the case on Wednesday, ordering ICE to improve conditions at the site, including by providing additional meals and regular, confidential legal calls. The requirements first went into effect through a temporary restraining order issued in August, and were extended indefinitely.\n\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander was among the officials who were arrested. Lander was previously arrested by federal officers at an immigration court in the same building when he was escorting an immigrant man away from his court hearing.\n\nDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin decried the elected officials’ actions in a statement, singling out Lander.\n\n“Another day, another activist politician pulling a stunt in an attempt to get their 15 minutes of fame while endangering DHS personnel and detainees,” McLaughlin said, adding that Lander “proceeded to obstruct law enforcement and cause a scene.”\n\nMcLaughlin also said the building was also on “lockdown” because of a bomb threat called in over the phone.\n\nOther elected officials who were arrested included State Sens. Julia Salazar, Jabari Brisport and Gustavo Rivera, and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll, Emily Gallagher, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, Marcela Mitaynes, Claire Valdez, Tony Simone and Steven Raga.\n\nSeveral New York City Congress members — including Reps. Dan Goldman, Adriano Espaillat, Nydia Velazquez, and Jerry Nadler — have also sought to inspect the holding cells in recent months and were denied entry. While members of Congress are legally entitled to inspect ICE detention centers, ICE officials have claimed that the holding area is instead an off-limits \"processing center\" for immigrants being sent to other facilities.\n\nIn July, Espaillat and Goldman, along with 10 other Congress members, sued the Trump administration to gain access to the holding cells. That case is pending before a federal judge.\n\nAs elected officials were arrested inside 26 Federal Plaza, dozens of protesters outside blocked vans from leaving the building. Sixty-six protesters — including faith leaders, advocates, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and City Councilmembers Sandy Nurse and Tiffany Caban — were arrested outside the building, according to spokespeople for Salazar and Gallagher.\n\nThe arrests inside the building came after an hour-long confrontation between federal officers and the 11 elected officials. The officials banged on locked doors and repeatedly requested entry, before eventually sitting down to chant and sing before they were escorted away in zip-tie handcuffs.\n\n“If you refuse to leave under federal regulations, you’re going to be arrested,” one DHS officer said. “You’re violating the law right now, and you’re protesting illegally.\"\n\nWhile seated, the elected officials shared their reasons for protesting.\n\n“They are destroying our community,” Assemblymember Mitaynes said in Spanish, through tears. “Our neighbors are disappearing. And we can’t let this continue.”\n\nThe elected officials also called on state representatives to pass the New York for All Act, which would largely prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from collaborating with ICE. They also called for city council members to pass the New York City Trust Act, which would create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue the city for violations of sanctuary laws barring the use of city resources for federal immigration law enforcement.\n\nThis article was updated with additional information.","summary":"City Comptroller Brad Lander being arrested while protesting and demanding entry at 26 Federal Plaza.\n\n\n  \n\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander was among those arrested.

At the time, officials insisted Biden was “sharp,” “engaged,” and “fully capable” of performing his duties, even after widespread concern about his debate performance against then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\nZients also testified that he and then-first lady Jill Biden discussed adjusting the president’s schedule to allow more time for rest, family, and early returns to the residence.\n\nHe admitted speaking with former aides who later pleaded the Fifth during the Oversight probe — including Annie Tomasini, Anthony Bernal, and White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor — about tailoring Biden’s appearances to reduce stress and avoid long walks or stairs.\n\nHe said Anita Dunn, Biden’s top adviser at the time, who admitted last month that the Robert Hur special counsel report prompted the ex-president to skip the Super Bowl pre-game interview, raised the possibility of a cognitive exam after the debate. Hur found that while there was evidence Biden “willfully retained and disclosed classified materials,” criminal charges would likely not result in a conviction in part due to Biden’s “poor memory.”\n\nZients also testified that he recommended a full medical workup to Dr. O’Connor after Biden’s disastrous June 27 presidential debate, implying it should include cognitive testing. O’Connor responded that he would take the suggestion “under advisement.” On July 3, 2024, Zients was reportedly telling staffers the debate was just “one night…. We all know is that he is a great president.”\n\nIn the interview on Thursday, Zients maintained his belief that Biden’s poor debate performance was due to a cold and losing his train of thought — but also told the Oversight Committee that he had “never seen [Biden] like that before,” and that the performance made him believe the president should exit the race.\n\nHe added that Jake Sullivan agreed, and that Cabinet officials, including Gina Raimondo, Denis McDonough, and Antony Blinken, expressed private concerns about Biden’s viability.\n\nZients also confirmed that Hunter Biden participated in internal pardon discussions late in the term, attending “a few meetings,” according to the source. It was not clear which meetings the former first son attended, though he was given one of the most sweeping pardons of any recipient, receiving a nearly 11-year unconditional pardon following his criminal cases for tax offenses and felony gun charges.\n\nRep. James Comer (R-KY), chairman of the Oversight Committee, had previewed Zients’s interview as the most important in the panel’s months-long probe, which centers on whether White House aides “usurped authority” from the president or carried out duties without his full consent.\n\n“We believe Zients is the guy that was potentially making a lot of decisions down the stretch,” Comer told reporters. “And had a lot of responsibility with respect to the unauthorized use of the autopen.”\n\nThe committee is investigating whether any documents, including executive orders or pardons, were signed using Biden’s name without his full awareness. While the use of the autopen is legally permitted, as reviewed in a 2005 Justice Department memo, Republicans have raised concerns about whether Biden truly assented to using the autopen.\n\nA source close to Zients said the former chief of staff made clear in his testimony that Biden alone made final decisions during his time in office. Likewise, Biden told the New York Times in July that his decisions during his presidency were his alone.\n\nZients is the final witness among 14 former aides called by the committee. A final report is expected to be released in the weeks ahead now that all interviews with former aides have been completed.\n\n“We believe we have a lot of information already from the witnesses who have answered questions,” Comer said Thursday morning, without specifying when the report would be released. “They’ve been pretty forthcoming in their answers.”","summary":"Former President&#160;Joe Biden’s ex-chief of staff&#160;Jeff Zients&#160;delivered the most revealing testimony to date in the House&#160;Oversight Committee’s investigation into the alleged misuse of the&#160;autopen&#160;and internal efforts to conceal the then-president’s cognitive decline, according to a source familiar with the matter.

More than 75% of Canada’s exports and more than 80% of Mexico’s go to the U.S.\n\nThe two leaders shook hands and strode side-by-side into the presidential palace in Mexico City, where Canadian Sen. Peter Boehm said the leaders were slated to commiserate about U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n“What are they hearing from the Americans, what we are hearing. It’s an opportunity to talk about how to handle the U.S. administration going forward,” Boehm said.\n\nCanada-Mexico trade by maritime routes\n\nSheinbaum said they want to increase bilateral trade in different sectors through the free-trade agreement and to do so through maritime routes – which would avoid those goods having to pass through the United States.\n\n“The idea is to strengthen trade through ports between Canada and Mexico on both oceans,” she said Thursday during her daily morning press conference before Carney’s arrival.\n\nCarney is also looking to improve relations with Mexico during his two-day visit after some of Canada’s provincial premiers talked last year about cutting Mexico out of any new free trade deal with the U.S.\n\nSeeking improved relations\n\nTrump lumped Canada in with Mexico on fentanyl smuggling and promised sweeping tariffs on both countries. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said then that Trump comparing Canada to the Mexico was “the most insulting thing I’ve ever heard from our friends and closet allies, the United States of America.”\n\nBoehm said the comments by the premiers, which he deemed out of their lane, upset the Mexicans.\n\n“The Mexicans are particularly sensitive on these matters and there was concern about that, no doubt,” Boehm said.\n\nBoehm represented the Canadian government when Sheinbaum was sworn in as Mexico’s president last year and is pushing for more engagement with Mexico. He said relations recently improved, noting Mexico appreciated Carney inviting Sheinbaum to the G7 summit in Alberta in June. Carney also sent his foreign minister as well as his finance minister to meet with Sheinbaum in August.\n\n“A lot of people don’t realize that we trade more with Mexico than we do with the entire European Union, all of the Europe, including the U.K.,” Boehm said. “It’s a pretty big deal for us.”\n\nMexico is Canada’s third-largest trading partner after the U.S. and China. Canada was Mexico’s fifth-largest trading partner in 2024.\n\nBut trade with the U.S. remains paramount for both countries and preserving the free trade pact will be critical.\n\nTrump looms over visit\n\nA key exemption for Canada and Mexico shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties. Canadian and Mexican companies can claim preferential treatment under the USMCA. But Trump has some sector-specific tariffs, known as 232 tariffs, that are having an impact. There is a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports.\n\n“Trump looms over this visit. Mexico and Canada now share a common threat from the U.S,” said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.\n\n“While both leaders are interested in expanding their countries trade with each other, I think their priority is to strategize on how to deal with Trump and the coming renegotiation of the USMCA. Carney and Sheinbaum now recognize that tag-teaming Trump may be more effective than competing for separate deals with Trump, although they are still angling for them.”\n\nDifferent approaches to Trump administration\n\nMexico and Canada have had different approaches to manage the negotiations with Trump’s administration but both countries want to increase bilateral commerce within the North American treaty. Sheinbaum said the countries are already setting up teams and reviewing the agreement with the hopes of keeping trilateral free trade in place.\n\nMexico also wants to encourage more Canadian investment in the country but Sheinbaum said the mining companies should respect Mexican laws, namely environmental regulations which the leader said “they haven’t necessarily followed.”\n\nCanadian companies are the largest foreign investors in Mexico’s mining sector, accounting for almost 70% of foreign investment in the sector.\n\nCarney will have a one-on-one meeting with Sheinbaum on Thursday. There will then be a working lunch, which the leaders will be joined by their Cabinet ministers and secretaries. Carney will visit the Canadian embassy on Friday.\n\nGillies reported from Toronto.

Democrats propose $30 million for member security reimbursements, $90 million for the House Sergeant at Arms, $66.5 million for the Senate Sergeant at Arms, and $30 million for U.S. Capitol Police reimbursements.

Hundreds of health care leaders gathered in the World Trade Center to discuss a variety of tech-related topics: How do we achieve interoperability? How do we balance risk with the inevitable price of progress? How should we think about AI governance, and how can we turn those thoughts into actual guidelines?We pondered these questions in panel discussions, fireside chats, presentations and individual conversations. Oftentimes, we couldn't come to a single conclusion—which illustrates both the novelty and complexity of this moment in health tech.You can get a bird's-eye view of the day from our live blog and this recap article by my colleague, Senior Reporter Lauren Giella. But for today's intro, I wanted to take you inside a single panel that stood out to me: our discussion on \"Pacing Innovation: Balancing Governance, Risk and Progress.\"I moderated this conversation with Aneesh Chopra, chief strategy officer of Arcadia and the first U.S. chief technology officer under President Barack Obama's administration; Dr. Daniel Yang, vice president of AI and emerging technologies at Kaiser Permanente; and Dr. Baligh Yehia, president of Jefferson Health.It was an interesting cast for two reasons: Chopra brought a government insider's perspective on tech policy and data sharing, while Yang and Yehia could speak from a \"payvider\" point of view. Both Kaiser Permanente and Jefferson Health belong to the small cohort of U.S. systems that house health plans and provider networks, all under the same umbrella.About halfway through the discussion, Chopra shared a story from Amy Gleason, acting administrator of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Donald Trump's administration. As a former emergency room nurse, Gleason saw the fragmentation of patients' health records firsthand—and got up close and personal with the issue when her daughter was battling multiple rare health conditions. She decided to plug her daughter's health records into a prominent chatbot, which identified a misdiagnosis and confirmed her eligibility for a clinical trial.\"Now this is not like this is going to be a new AI doctor era, but it's a chance for us to bring new technology, new capabilities into a new product area,\" Chopra said. \"And what would that new product area be? It's this vision of a total cost of care, accountable entity.\"\"If you're a health system, a physician group or a health plan, you're in a fragmented part of the health care ecosystem,\" he continued. \"If that is one, you have the ability to pool together a lifetime record of the patient and to incorporate it for decision support or guidance to ensure that the individual gets advice and care at every step of their journey.\"This brought us to the issue of risk in data aggregation. Who owns patients' health records? Do they belong to the patient themselves or to the health system that collected the data over time? Or are they public property? Is it a social responsibility to share them, for the sake of public health, stronger research and the greater good?Here's what Chopra said: \"This gets to the question about who's aggregating and for what purpose. And so remember, the bedrock principle in HIPAA is that we as consumers have the right to access our own data. But as I challenge every health system CEO I've ever met—and I'm still 0 for whatever that number is—go to your medical records office and show me your HIPPA right of access form. It doesn't exist. We have HIPAA authorization forms because we, the institutions, want permission from the consumers who visit us, the patients, to use their data in other ways. But that's different from saying, 'I'm offering you the chance to take your data back and to do with it what you wish.'\"This is the driving force behind CMS' Aligned Networks initiative, he said. The Trump administration intends to make it as easy as possible for patients to access their own health information, and what they do with it after that is their own prerogative.But data sharing amongst organizations for other HIPAA-covered purposes is trickier. Currently, there is a restriction on what payers and providers can share with one another. If we do, indeed, move to view health records as a community resource, both parties need to agree on a governance model that both parties trust. Otherwise, Chopra said, the \"asymmetrical warfare\" between each entity's AI models could result in a net negative for the industry.\"I actually worry that if we don't resolve this, we're going to see AI as an inflationary good, not a deflationary good in the overall health care ecosystem,\" Chopra said.\"So, the open question,\" he mused, \"is whether or not we see more of an open data model with aligned incentives between payers and providers that's benefiting from AI, where you're asking the right questions: Is it allowed to have access to this shared resource?\"Well, if both parties agree to trust it, then I think we're going to reap the benefits. Otherwise, I am worried [about a] 55-45 [split]. We're probably tilting towards inflation, not deflation.\"In Other NewsMajor health care headlines from the week\nHealth systems are advocating for an extension of the Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCAH) waiver, which is set to expire at the end of the month. In this week's cover story for Newsweek magazine, I investigated the promise of these programs and explored some of the challenges that they're up against. Read the full article here.\n\nThe American Hospital Association's CEO, Rick Pollack, is urging Aetna to reverse its new \"level of severity inpatient payment policy,\" set to take effect September 15. In a letterto Aetna President Steve Nelson, Pollack said the new policy will reduce patients' opportunities to file appeals for denied claims and \"further stress an already financially unstable health care system.\" Click here to read the full letter.\n\nHealth care talks are heating up on Capitol Hill. Democratic lawmakers are asking Republicans to roll back some of the Affordable Care Act cuts that are proposed in President Donald Trump's spending plan—and failure to reach an agreement could result in a government shutdown, The Washington Post reported. Also, the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee hosted a hearing on tax-exempt hospitals this week. The committee, led by Republicans, heard arguments that nonprofit hospitals are engaging in non-clinical activities (like support for \"gender identity politics\"), and that urban hospitals are unfairly utilizing programs designed for rural hospitals. Witnesses on this side included Ge Bai, a professor of health, policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and William Hild, executive director of the conservative nonprofit Consumers' Research. On the other hand, hospital leaders argued that nonprofits provide critical services that are rarely profitable.\n\nCMS announced a $50 billion commitment to transform rural health care on Monday. The funding will become available in fiscal year 2026 and will be distributed annually in chunks of $10 billion through the year 2030. Once approved, states can use the funds for various pre-approved investments, including recruitment and retention of clinical teams, expansion of treatments for opioid use disorder and mental health treatments and technology trainings for rural health care workforces. States must apply for the funds by November 5, and awards will be allocated by December 31. More information is available on CMS' website.\nPulse CheckExecutive perspectives on key industry issuesDr. David Callender, president and CEO of Memorial Hermann Health System in Texas, participated in Newsweek's Digital Health Care Forum on Tuesday. Ahead of the event, I connected with him to learn how he approaches tech and innovation from a business standpoint.Find a portion of our interview below.Editor's Note: Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.How do you determine which technologies will provide the greatest return on investment for Memorial Hermann?Obviously, with all of the technology that's available today and the very rapid development of new technology, we have a lot of choices. So a big issue for us is matching the availability of technology or technologies that can help us drive down what we call our \"road to value.\" [That] is really the key to success.So what are the pain points that we have, and then what technologies are available to us or could we pursue that help us fill the gap, relative to reducing the amount of pain or meeting a significant need that we have that will help us drive value? We think about value in the health care context as it's been defined, so it's not just the outcomes divided by the cause, but there's also multiplication times the consumer experience, the experience of our own employees, and then all of the health access and engagement issues in our community.There are really five factors that drive value in health care. From our perspective, these have been pretty much proven to have significant impact in previous studies that have been performed. We're focused on driving value, thinking about how we generate the very best outcomes at the optimal cost, with the best possible experience for patients and consumers of health information and health products, making sure that our employees have a very fulfilling work experience, and doing everything we can on our own and with very important partners in the community to address the huge health equity and access issues across the greater Houston community.What are the health equity issues, specifically, that you think technology can help address in your community?They're certainly not peculiar or unique to Houston. We know that we have those non-medical drivers of health, like access to transportation, access to safe and secure housing, access to a stable and nutritious food supply, level of educational attainment; all of these and others [are] important factors in terms of any individual's health status.Let's think, for example, about what we could do about the transportation problem. And just a scenario, let's say we have an elderly patient who is on Medicare—perhaps dual- eligible Medicaid and Medicare—who doesn't have reliable transportation to get back and forth to appointments, to get to a pharmacy to pick up prescriptions. They may not have a stable housing situation, so we're thinking about those [problems] and the sorts of technology that we could apply.It's a pretty simple one in terms of transportation. In our region, we partner with a couple of ride services, Uber and Lyft, to help provide rides for patients back and forth to their appointments, to pick up their prescriptions, and in some cases, to get to a food pharmacy. And so there's some pretty readily available technology support to address some of those non-medical drivers.Now we also partner a lot with the United Way, which uses an incredible array of technology to really help not only match individuals and families to sources of support, but also to opportunities to get the skills that they need to be employed and generate a self-sustaining wage. So those are not technologies that we control access to, but one of our partners does and can offer those.Patients have so much choice now in where they receive their health care, whether that's through a virtual care company or one of the many health systems in the area. Some health systems have even shifted their verbiage, referring to \"patients\" as \"consumers.\" Has that level of patient choice impacted the need for Memorial Hermann to innovate in order to remain competitive?Oh, absolutely. I think we all face that as we go forward, [there are] so many more sources of information about health. Obviously, we're fortunate here in Houston [as] our region still continues to grow in population. We'll see what happens over the course of time.But you know, we've essentially been forced to grow to be able to accommodate the demands for health care. That's true of our competitors, who are also colleagues across the greater Houston area. As we think about that growing need for service, and we think about the need to improve efficiency, and again, the need to improve outcomes and experience, there's clearly a role for technology that helps us connect better, more effectively and more broadly with patients and consumers.Now I'm biased as a physician, so I think about both [patients and consumers]. I think about patients, those who actually have come to us for service, and then I think about that broader need to improve health. And I think about consumers of health information in particular, but also health products. What's our role as a health system in terms of providing the best information about health or partnering with others to do that—to help people find the resources they need if we don't directly control those or offer them, that can help them improve their health or get on a better road to good health? So yeah, I distinguish between consumers and patients, and I think it's important to consider the needs of both as we go forward, if we're truly going to accomplish that mission goal of improving health.Click here for video footage of Callender's panel, The Business Case for Tech and Innovation, at Newsweek's Digital Health Care Forum.

It is very important, even in the best of times, and it is so critical that we invest in our resilience and our grit and our adaptability and our physical and emotional well-being. Even as we're taking care of others, we have to prioritize how to take care of ourselves.\n\n\"The second is we need to make sure that we are very focused on our mission, on our purpose and what we're doing: everything ties to that mission that we have. We have 10 rules of the road for technology. First thing on that, what is the problem that we're trying to solve? It's not the solution, it's \"what is the problem?\" And that problem is always, \"how do we realize our mission? What are we trying to accomplish every single day? What are we going to accomplish every single day?\" Tie it back. So that's a big focus for us to be laser-focused on our mission.\n\n\"The third behavior that we are focused on is, be curious about the road ahead, and vigorously debate, which requires active listening. It's like a dance. You have to actively listen and communicate. You have to seek out different points of view, really make sure that you've heard and understood what's happening before you make that decision, and then when you make that decision, ensure that you are challenging the status quo. The best part about innovation is that you have to have healthy dissatisfaction with the status quo, and so I really think we can pause and challenge what we've always done and make sure that we're not just doing incremental things like moving paper to electronic—but truly thinking about it in a different way. I also believe that the quality of the decision that you make is based on the quality of the discussion that you have. So ensure that that discussion counts.\"\nThis is a preview of the September 18 edition of Access Health—Tap here to get this newsletter delivered straight to your inbox.","summary":"What industry leaders said at Newsweek's Digital Health Care Forum.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/us-cto-worries-healthcare-ai-could-become-inflationary-access-health-2132208","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2725525/dr-callender-dhcf.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=bba515106059b340263f0c6dedc1d468","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 22:40:34","author":"Alexis Kayser","authors":["Alexis Kayser"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.196},{"id":361641644,"title":"Amid Uproar, Will US Cut Tariffs on Indian Goods? DNA Analysis","text":"India and the United States appear to be moving closer to a breakthrough in their long-running tariff dispute, with signals emerging that Washington could soon slash duties on Indian goods.India’s Chief Economic Advisor V. Anant Nageshwaran said at an event that the US may withdraw the additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian products. He added that reciprocal duties imposed by Washington could also be reduced from the current 25 per cent to as low as 10–15 per cent. According to him, a decision could come “within the next few months, or even sooner.”The optimism is backed by recent diplomatic developments. Just days ago, US President Donald Trump, who until recently accused India of funding the Ukraine war praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support in seeking peace. Washington, which had earlier resisted talks, has since dispatched a trade delegation to Delhi and even dropped some demands related to the dairy sector.In todays DNA, Zee news Managing Editor Rahul Sinha analysed the US Tariffs against Indian goods.Watch Todays DNA Full Episode:राहुल गांधी के परमाणु बम-पार्ट 2 का विश्लेषणटैरिफ वॉर के END की डेडलाइन आ गई!भारत..PAK को मारेगा तो सऊदी बचाएगा?देखिए #DNA LIVE Rahul Sinha के साथ#ZeeLive #ZeeNews #DNAWithRahulSinha @RahulSinhaTV https://t.co/YFzBJMAq7s— Zee News (@ZeeNews) September 18, 2025 Analysts say the shift is driven by domestic political pressure in the US. American farmers are angry as tariffs triggered retaliatory actions from China, which began buying soybeans and corn from Brazil instead. Reports show that 216 US farms declared bankruptcy this year 55 per cent higher than last year. With farms averaging 500 acres, some as large as 10,000 acres, the losses have been devastating. Farmers in swing states, who traditionally back Trump and fund his party, are increasingly blaming him for their plight. Trump hopes India will buy more American corn to ease their anger ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.Meanwhile, tariffs have also hurt US consumers. Seafood and spice prices have jumped 20 per cent, inflation has risen to 3 per cent against the Fed’s 2 per cent target, and each household is paying an estimated $1,300 extra annually. Goldman Sachs estimates consumers are bearing up to 70 per cent of tariff costs, a figure that could climb further.With mounting pressure on both sides, expectations are high that a major tariff rollback is imminent.","summary":"US President Donald Trump, who until recently accused India of funding the Ukraine war praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support in seeking peace.

The FTC said brokers use fake accounts to buy up millions of dollars worth of tickets and then sell them at a substantial markup on Ticketmaster's platform. Ticketmaster benefits from the additional fees it collects from those sales, the FTC said.\n\nThe Associated Press left messages seeking comment Thursday with Beverly Hills, California-based Live Nation Entertainment.\n\nTicketmaster controls 80% or more of major U.S. concert venues' primary ticketing, according to the FTC. Consumers spent more than $82.6 billion buying tickets from Ticketmaster between 2019 and 2024, the agency added.\n\n\"American live entertainment is the best in the world and should be accessible to all of us. It should not cost an arm and a leg to take the family to a baseball game or attend your favorite musician's show,\" FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Joining the lawsuit were the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.\n\nTicketmaster has been in lawmakers' sights since 2022, when it spectacularly botched ticket sales for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour.

The Biden administration took action with a ban on junk fees, requiring Ticketmaster to display the full price of a ticket as soon as consumers begin shopping. That rule went into effect in May.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also taken aim at the industry. In March, with Kid Rock by his side in the Oval Office, Trump signed an executive order directing U.S. officials to ensure ticket resellers are complying with Internal Revenue Service rules. The order also directed the FTC to \"take enforcement action to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct in the secondary ticketing market.\"\n\nIn August, the FTC sued Maryland-based ticket broker Key Investment Group use, alleging it has used thousands of fictitious Ticketmaster accounts and other methods to buy tickets for events, including Swift's tour.","summary":"The Federal Trade Commission and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general sued Ticketmaster and its parent company Thursday, saying they are forcing consumers to pay more to see live events through a variety of illegal tactics.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/ftc-lawsuit-federal-trade-commission-sues-live-nation-ticketmaster-saying-forces-fans-pay-more-concerts-events/17844152/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17844200_091825-wls-ticketmaster-clean-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/091825-wls-ftc-ticketmaster-5p-vo-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-18 22:35:26","author":"Dee-Ann Durbin","authors":["Dee-Ann Durbin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":361647666,"title":"‘These people are crazed lunatics’: Trump gives rambling answer when pressed about attacks on First Amendment","text":"President Donald Trump gave a rambling answer when pressed about free speech concerns after right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was killed last week.\n\nTrump made the remarks in an interview with Fox News’s Martha MacCallum on Thursday from Chequers, the U.K. Prime Minister’s country home. Trump has since departed the U.K. following a two-day state visit, which included a star-studded state banquet and a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nTrump and MacCallum spoke extensively about Kirk, who was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University on September 10. Investigators have since arrested and charged Tyler Robinson, 22, in connection with the shooting. \n\nSince then, Trump’s allies — including Vice President JD Vance and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller — have decried left-wing groups. Attorney General Pam Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department will “go after you if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” Bondi and another Justice Department official later clarified she was referring to speech that incites or threatens violence.\n\nMacCallum asked Trump if he’s concerned about critics who say “this crackdown is a crackdown on free speech.”\n\nIn response, Trump rambled about “crazed lunatics” who say “really bad” things.\n\n“I watch your show, and I watch others, and I see people saying things, they're crazy. These people are crazed lunatics, even the way they'll answer, you know, it's like, you'll see them, and the things they say are really bad, but they look crazy,” Trump told MacCallum. “They're almost crazed. Maybe they're drugged out. Maybe there's some other problem.”\n\n“But the kind of things you hear…are so unbelievable, you wouldn't think — you're a very regular person, I am too, I'm a regular person — who would make the statements that they make?” Trump continued.\n\nMacCallum also asked Trump if he believes there is a “vast terrorist movement” in the U.S. that’s responsible for Kirk’s death, as well as the previous attempts on his own life. \n\n“You never know. And we’ll find out, maybe,” Trump responded. \n\nThe president went on to reference his recent announcement that he plans to designate the left-wing movement antifa — which stands for anti-fascist — as a “major terrorist organization.” It’s unclear what legal standing or practical effect this designation could have, given that experts say antifa is not an organization, but rather an ideology or movement.\n\nTrump’s remarks come as right-wing activists also advocate for companies to fire or sanction employees who allegedly celebrated Kirk’s killing online. A Texas football coach, an Oregon teacher and a Secret Service agent are among the several Americans who have been disciplined, investigated or terminated by their employers for their social media posts about Kirk. \n\nABC also announced Wednesday that Jimmy Kimmel’s late night talk show would be pulled off-air indefinitely following his recent remarks about Kirk’s shooting.\n\n“We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said on his talk show Monday.\n\nThe move to suspend Kimmel’s show prompted a public outcry, including from former President Barack Obama.\n\n“After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like,” Obama wrote on X.\n\n“This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it,” he added.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike have also criticized the wider crackdown. Conservative media personality Tucker Carlson even criticized Bondi’s comments on Wednesday, arguing that Kirk was a free speech champion who would have objected to a crackdown on “hate speech.”\n\n“This is the Attorney General of the United States, the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, telling you that there is this other category... called hate speech,” Carlson said. “And of course, the implication is that's a crime. There's no sentence that Charlie Kirk would have objected to more than that.”\n\nMacCallum similarly noted that Kirk believed there was “no such thing as hate speech” in her interview with Trump.\n\n“Charlie said that ‘there was no such thing as hate speech,’” McCallum said. “He obviously, you know, no one anticipated what would happen to Charlie —”\n\n“He might not be saying that now,” Trump interjected.","summary":"‘I see people saying things, they're crazy,’ Trump said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-charlie-kirk-first-amendment-b2829449.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/18/21/02/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-5-07-30-PM.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xiPC4i2G-APg7GJgG.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-18 22:34:33","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":361640662,"title":"UN Security Council Votes On Reimposing Iran Nuclear Sanctions","text":"The United Nations Security Council will vote Friday on reimposing deep economic sanctions on Iran over its resurgentnuclear program.Britain, France and Germany -- signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action intended to stop Tehran obtaining nuclear weapons -- allege that Iran has broken its promises under that 2015 treaty.Diplomatic sources expect that the resolution will not have the nine votes needed to uphold the status quo -- in which sanctions remain lifted -- and as such the punishment will be reimposed.French President Emmanuel Macron said he expected international sanctions against Iran to be reinstated by the end of the month, in an excerpt from an Israeli television interview broadcast Thursday.\"The latest news we had from the Iranians are not serious,\" he said.In a letter to the UN in mid-August, the \"European Three\" slammed Iran as having breached several JCPOA commitments, including building up a uranium stock to more than 40 times the level permitted under the deal.Despite a flurry of diplomatic talks between the European powers and Tehran, the Western trio insisted there was no concrete progress.Russia and China, which oppose the reinstatement of sanctions, would need to secure nine votes from the 15 members of the Council -- which diplomatic sources say may prove impossible.\"Algeria and Pakistan may support Russia and China in backing the resolution, but I think other members are likely to oppose it or abstain, so the Europeans and US will not have to use their veto,\" said International Crisis Group analyst Richard Gowan.The vote could result in the imposition of sanctions as early as next week -- although the UN's annual high-level meeting which Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian will attend could present opportunities for last-ditch negotiations. \"The Council still has time to greenlight a further resolution extending the suspension of sanctions -- if Iran and the Europeans reach a last-minute bargain,\" Gowan said.The hard-won 2015 deal has been left in tatters ever since the United States, during Donald Trump's first presidency, walked away from it in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran.Western powers and Israel have long accused Tehran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, a claim Iran denies. Following the US withdrawal, Tehran gradually broke away from its commitments under the agreement and began stepping up its nuclear activities, with tensions high since the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June. The war also derailed Tehran's nuclear negotiations with the United States and prompted Iran to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, with inspectors of the Vienna-based UN body leaving the country shortly after. During his previous term, Trump attempted to trigger the so-called \"snapback clause\" to reimpose sanctions in 2020, but failed due to his country's unilateral withdrawal two years earlier.While European powers have for years launched repeated efforts to revive the 2015 deal through negotiations and said they \"have unambiguous legal grounds\" to trigger the clause, Iran does not share their view.Iran has threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if the snapback is triggered.","summary":"The United Nations Security Council will vote Friday on reimposing deep economic sanctions on Iran over its resurgent\nnuclear program.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/un-security-council-votes-reimposing-iran-nuclear-sanctions-3783851","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4622453/western-powers-israel-have-long-accused-tehran-seeking-acquire-nuclear-weapons-claim-iran.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=61bf1a6e12a8472980808110caf36b56","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 22:30:21","author":"Gregory Walton","authors":["Gregory Walton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":361651660,"title":"Trump's push for 'patriotic education' is predictably corrupt and dumb","text":"In any other era, an announcement that the government is going to be spending millions of taxpayer dollars on civics education would come as welcome news, because if there is one thing Americans are in sore need of, it is remedial instruction on civics.

Nope, what we’ve got here are the most MAGA of the MAGA, the least-hinged groups imaginable.\n\nTo start, there’s the America First Policy Institute, which employed both Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Education Secretary Linda McMahon after being founded in 2021 following Trump’s 2020 defeat. You might wonder how it isn’t a conflict of interest for McMahon to oversee her previous employer’s civic education efforts, which are being paid for by her current employer. Glad you asked! She signed an ethics waiver so that she can do whatever she wants, so your tax dollars are totally safe. \n\nNow, AFPI has no background in education issues whatsoever. They were formed as a bog-standard wingnut policy shop for conservative goals like “cracking down on crime” and hating China. But hey, a complete lack of qualifications is no barrier for literally anything in this administration. \n\nAlso here to teach your kids about civics? Stephen Miller’s America First Legal, which actually just functions as a sort of puppet law firm that Miller uses to sue organizations to force them to do the same thing that the government employing Stephen Miller also just happens to want them to do, which is functionally to get rid of everyone who isn’t a white straight man. \n\nIt was probably inevitable that Moms for Liberty would be on the list. Yes, the group behind the howler monkeys being flung at every unsuspecting district in the nation that just wants to let the kids read “To Kill a Mockingbird” or whatever. That’s sort of learning-adjacent, maybe. But they don’t really count at all as a civics or education group unless your definition of civics and/or education is basically book burning and quoting Hitler.\n\nAnd of course it includes late MAGA hero Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA—because of course. \n\nIn case it wasn’t clear what type of “civics” matter to this administration and who, exactly, this sort of thing is for, the money to pay for this effort is being redirected from funds for schools that serve majority-minority populations. Because giving money to those schools is racist communism, natch, but giving millions to Linda McMahon and friends is freedom, baby.","summary":"In any other era, an announcement that the government is going to be spending millions of taxpayer dollars on civics education would come as welcome news, because if there is one thing Americans are in sore need of, it is remedial instruction on civics.

Zients met with House investigators behind closed doors for over six hours — the final former Biden administration official to appear in House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer's probe into ex-President Joe Biden's use of the autopen. Comer, R-Ky., is also investigating whether Biden's top aides covered up signs of mental decline in the former president, and whether executive decisions signed via autopen — including myriad clemency orders Biden approved — were executed with his full awareness. Zients told investigators that Hunter was involved in some of those pardon discussions and attended a few meetings on the subject with White House aides, the source said. BIDEN’S AUTO-PEN PARDONS DISTURBED DOJ BRASS, DOCS SHOW, RAISING QUESTIONS WHETHER THEY ARE LEGALLY BINDING It's not clear how much say Hunter had in those meetings, or if he was involved in discussions about his own controversial pardon. The former president issued a \"full and unconditional\" pardon for his son in early December, just under two months before leaving office. That's despite Biden and his staff denying the possibility of such a move on several occasions. Biden approved nearly 2,500 commutations on Jan. 17, just days before leaving the White House, setting a record for most clemency orders ever granted by a U.S. president — more than 4,200 in total — and the most ever in a single day. Weeks earlier, he issued pardons for several family members, including Hunter. 'SHOULD BE PROSECUTED': HOUSE REPUBLICANS ZERO IN ON BIDEN AUTOPEN PARDONS AFTER BOMBSHELL REPORT It had been previously reported by NBC News and other outlets that Hunter sat in on White House meetings with Biden's aides in the wake of the former president's disastrous June 2024 debate against then-candidate Donald Trump. Zients is the final former Biden aide expected to appear before the House Oversight Committee in its autopen probe. The source familiar with his sit-down told Fox News Digital that Zients \"admitted that President Biden’s speech stumbles increased as he aged.\" \"He also noted that the president’s difficulty remembering dates and names worsened over time, including during the administration,\" the source said.

Democrats had forced multiple votes on almost every one of Trump’s picks, infuriating the president and tying up the Senate floor.\n\nThe new rules allow Senate Republicans to move multiple nominees with a simple majority vote — a process that would have previously been blocked with just one objection. The rules don’t apply to judicial nominations or high-level Cabinet posts.\n\n“Republicans have fixed a broken process,” Thune said ahead of the vote.\n\nThe Senate voted 51-47 to confirm the four dozen nominees. Thune said that those confirmed on Thursday had all received bipartisan votes in committee, including deputy secretaries for the Departments of Defense, Interior, Energy and others.\n\nAmong the confirmed are Jonathan Morrison, the new administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Kimberly Guilfoyle as U.S. ambassador to Greece. Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news personality who led the fundraising for Trump’s 2020 campaign and was once engaged to Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThune’s move is the latest salvo after a dozen years of gradual changes by both parties to weaken the filibuster and make the nominations process more partisan. Both parties have obstructed each other’s nominees for years, and senators in both parties have advocated for speeding up the process when they are in the majority.\n\nRepublicans first proposed changing the rules in early August, when the Senate left for a monthlong recess after a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations over the confirmation process and Trump told Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to “GO TO HELL!” on social media.\n\nDemocrats have blocked more nominees than ever before as they have struggled to find ways to oppose Trump and the GOP-dominated Congress, and as their voters have pushed them to fight Republicans at every turn. It’s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn’t allowed at least some quick confirmations.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has said Democrats are delaying the nominations because Trump’s nominees are “historically bad.” And he told Republicans that they will “come to regret” their action — echoing a similar warning from GOP Leader Mitch McConnell to then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in 2013, when Democrats changed Senate rules for executive branch and lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations. At the time, Republicans were blocking President Barack Obama’s picks.\n\nRepublicans took the Senate majority a year later, and McConnell eventually did the same for Supreme Court nominees in 2017 as Democrats tried to block Trump’s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\n“What Republicans have done is chip away at the Senate even more, to give Donald Trump more power and to rubber stamp whomever he wants, whenever he wants them, no questions asked,” Schumer said last week.\n\nRepublicans will move to confirm a second tranche of nominees in the coming weeks, gradually clearing the list of more than 100 nominations that have been pending for months.\n\n“There will be more to come,” Thune said Thursday. “And we’ll ensure that President Trump’s administration is filled at a pace that looks more like those of his predecessors.”","summary":"The new rules allow Senate Republicans to move multiple nominees with a simple majority vote.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/18/senate-nominations-new-rules-confirmations/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Congress_Budget_20535-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 22:19:06","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":361663944,"title":"Dana White reveals wild detail about UFC White House fights, 'best thing about being friends' with Trump","text":"Dana White reiterated on Logan Paul's podcast that the UFC event at the White House is \"happening.\" The event will be part of commemorating the United States’ 250th birthday, and White said it was actually President Donald Trump’s idea. \"I didn't ask — he brought it up to me,\" White said on \"Impaulsive.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"When you walk around the White House with him, he's so proud of the White House, and he loves it so much and he loves America.

Trump has attended numerous UFC fights, and White spoke at the Republican National Convention when Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago. White also said Trump has been in his corner (no pun intended) since UFC’s early days. \"The best thing about being friends with him is that he's a great guy. … Think about when we started the UFC, and he had us come to the Taj Mahal (Trump's former Atlantic City casino). The Trump brand was [up here], UFC was [down here.] It's hard for people to wrap their heads around how this brand was looked at back then. Venues didn't want us. Sponsors, television was terrified of us. Pay-per-view wouldn't even put us on. Sanctioning organizations, athletic commissions didn't want anything to do with us. So, the way he supported us in the beginning was great.
