When President Biden stepped aside under pressure from his own party earlier this month, Harris rapidly ascended to become the presumptive nominee. Harris has since enjoyed a honeymoon period from her party and from some in the media, but Carville warned Democrats the honeymoon will come to an end. Carville warned Democrats that while the GOP was initially caught off-guard, this will be no easy victory for her campaign as Republicans adapt. “I think that she has a record, she’s going to have to come up with some proposals. But I think a lot of it is going to depend on her ability to define herself, and I actually think she’s going to have to introduce herself, because she’s really not that well known,” Carville said on an episode of “Firing Line With Margaret Hoover” PBS released over the weekend. He later suggested that “Republicans are going to try to introduce her on their terms. I don’t blame them. I would do the same thing. And she’s going to have to get good fast.” He added, “That’s all I can say. And I’m not very giddy about this, I’m not cocky at all, I think we have a tough election ahead of us.” When asked by the interviewer how Harris will be able to “sustain this excitement” throughout the rest of her campaign, Carville said that she must have a deep understanding of why her rise was such a relief to her party in the first place. “That’s the key question. The first thing is to recognize what happened. What happened was that people wanted something different, and that she just projects the fact that she is, you know, excited about the future. And there was no policy that anyone was pushing, there was no particular group that was behind this,” he said. “It was just a general feeling that people wanted a different choice than Donald Trump and President Biden, and they got it.” He reiterated his warning that Republicans are preparing a strategy to attack her credibility as a candidate, and her campaign should not underestimate their ability to do so. “Look, she’s going to get slaughtered, they’re coming, and this is just part of — no different than it was any other time. And they have got to get up and get ready and they’ve got to be able to defend and attack at the same time,” he said. “There’s going to be a time of struggle and definition as to who Vice President Harris is, and we better be ready for that. But I feel like we are in a better position today than we were Sunday morning, and we’re doing this interview on Wednesday. So I will take small victories where I get them.”","summary":"\"I think a lot of it is going to depend on her ability to define herself, and I actually think she’s going to have to introduce herself, because she’s really not that well known,\" Carville said on an episode of \"Firing Line With Margaret Hoover\" PBS released over the weekend.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/democratic-strategist-james-carville-warns-vp-harris-is-gonna-get-slaughtered/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/democratic-strategist-james-carville-warned-86481738.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/T2fRt1Fz-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-31 00:03:57","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":253010092,"title":"UFC Abu Dhabi Fight Card Preview, Odds & Predictions: Ferguson Vs.

The event, also known as UFC on ABC 7, takes place Etihad Arena. In the main event, Cory Sandhagen faces Umar Nurmagomedov in a pivotal bantamweight battle. Earlier on the main card, UFC veterans Tony Ferguson and Michael Chiesa meet in a welterweight scrap. UFC Abu Dhabi begins at 3:00 p.m. ET on ABC, following prelims at 12:00 ET on ESPN2 and ESPN+. Ferguson, a former interim UFC lightweight champion, is on seven-fight losing skid. Meanwhile Chiesa has lost his past three outings. Below, we take a deep dive into the Ferguson and Chiesa matchup.

In his first 16 fights with the promotion, Ferguson went 15-1 with 11 stoppages. His only loss was a May 2012 decision setback to Michael Johnson. Meanwhile, among his victories were wins over Josh Thomson, Edson Barboza, Rafael dos Anjos, Kevin Lee, Anthony Pettis, and Donald Cerrone. Ferguson’s October 2017 victory over Lee earned him the interim UFC lightweight title. A belt he was stripped of in April 2018 when an injury prevented him from making the walk for an often-booked and never realized bout against Khabib Nurmagomedov. In his prime, Ferguson was seen as a legit threat to Nurmagomedov’s lightweight crown. His awkward style, high-level striking and grappling, confidence, chin, cardio and resiliency made him one of the most feared and fearsome fighters at 155 pounds. However, time and his reckless style eventually caught up to Ferguson. The former interim champ has not had his hand raised in victory since he defeated Cerrone in June 2019. Since that victory, Ferguson is 0-7. While it’s true that some of Ferguson’s losses have come to top names (Justin Gaethje, Michael Chandler, Charles Oliveira, Beneil Dariush), his best days are far behind him. In fact, when asked about this matchup UFC CEO Dana White said he hopes the 40-year-old Ferguson retires, regardless of the contest’s outcome. Micheal Chiesa SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH - JULY 29: Michael Chiesa backstage during the UFC 291 event at Delta Center ... [+] on July 29, 2023 in Salt Lake City, Utah. (Photo by Mike Roach/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images) Zuffa LLC via Getty Images Michael Chiesa (16-7) earned his UFC contract by winning Season 15 of The Ultimate Fighter at lightweight. His win over Al Iaquinta on the finale card of that season of the reality show moved his record to 6-0. Like Ferguson, Chiesa picked up a bonus for his victory, nabbing “Submission of the Night” for his first-round rear-naked choke stoppage of Iaquinta. Chiesa had an up-and-down run with the UFC between 2012, when the UFC signed him, and early 2021. He went 11-4 during that time, beating name opponents like Jim Miller, Beneil Dariush, Carlos Condit, Diego Sanchez, Rafael dos Anjos, and Neil Magny, but he could never sustain momentum. His best run was a four-fight winning streak between December 2018 and January 2021, putting him at No. 5 in the welterweight division and inside the Octagon against Vicente Luque. Luque submitted Chiesa in the first round. Since then, he’s lost to Sean Brady and Kevin Holland. Chiesa’s submission defeat to Holland in July 2023 was his most recent trip to the cage. Following the loss to Holland, Chiesa said, “MMA fans are coming at me all different types of direction, saying I should retire and I should be done, be a broadcaster now,” Michael Chiesa said on UFC Round Up. “There’s just so many things that people are saying but it’s just gonna sweeten the pot because I’m not done. I just didn’t show up on fight night.” The 36-year-old Chiesa, who is no longer a ranked UFC competitor, is a top-notch grappler, who is a tough out for any opponent. UFC Abu Dhabi Odds: Tony Ferguson vs. Michael Chiesa Chiesa opened as a -455 betting favorite over Ferguson, who opened as the +350 betting underdog. As fight night nears, Chiesa has moved to -670, with Ferguson being listed at +430.

JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, praised the vision of Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts in the foreword of a forthcoming book that could conflict with the Trump campaign’s effort to distance itself from Heritage’s Project 2025 transition effort. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the foreword to Roberts’ forthcoming book “Dawn’s Early Light” on Tuesday, the same day of a shakeup at Project 2025, which has become an important election-year issue as Democrats and others argue that the nearly 1,000-page vision it set out is extreme. “Never before has a figure with Roberts’s depth and stature within the American Right tried to articulate a genuinely new future for conservatism,” Vance writes in his foreword. “The Heritage Foundation isn’t some random outpost on Capitol Hill; it is and has been the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.” Vance’s words, which echo Roberts’ frequent calls to tear down U.S. institutions entirely to start anew, show the overlap between Trump’s closest allies and the people fueling Project 2025. Trump’s top aides have repeatedly criticized organizers of Project 2025 for what they say is a false impression that the transition effort is associated with the campaign. After Tuesday’s shakeup at Heritage, Roberts is now leading Project 2025 operations directly. The book, scheduled to be published on Sept. 24, outlines a vision for what its publisher calls “ a peaceful ‘Second American Revolution’.” Its subtitle is “Taking Back Washington to Save America,” though earlier descriptions of the book listed it as “ Burning Down Washington to Save America.” The publisher’s description says it identifies institutions that conservatives need to build or to take back, adding that some are “too corrupt to save.” Among those it lists are Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The AP requested comment from spokespeople for Vance and the Trump campaign. Also, on Tuesday, Paul Dans, who had directed Project 2025, left the Heritage Foundation amid continued criticism of the plan. Roberts said his departure came after the project completed what it set out to do. In his foreword, Vance calls for something more than removing bad policies of the past, but instead to “rebuild.” “We need an offensive conservatism, not merely one that tries to prevent the left from doing things we don’t like,” Vance writes. As Vance wraps up, he quotes Roberts as saying that twilight descends and a person hears wolves, “You’ve got to circle the wagons and load the muskets.” “We are now all realizing that it’s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets,” Vance adds. “In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon.” ___ Smith reported from Providence, Rhode Island, and Swenson from New York.

There are reforms that would make the institution more politicized — and then there are reforms that would make it less politicized. Encouragingly, Mr. Biden apparently favors some that move in the right direction. Before Mr. Biden withdrew his candidacy, The Post reported that he had two proposals in mind: First, establish an enforceable ethics code for the justices; second, subject them to term limits. Each idea presents constitutional issues. It is not clear if life tenure for members of the federal judiciary can be changed through ordinary legislation or would require constitutional amendment. Similarly, any effort by Congress to impose a binding ethics code on the Supreme Court could violate the separation of powers. For now, though, it’s enough to consider reform suggestions on their merits, which are real. We have long supported Supreme Court term limits. In part, this is because they are preferable to a more radical alternative progressives have been trying to push on Mr. Biden since the beginning of his presidency: to increase the court’s size and “pack” it with ideologically friendly appointees. The origins of this movement lie in Democrats’ understandable ire over the recent history of appointments. Senate Republicans managed to solidify a GOP-appointed majority for the foreseeable future by refusing to consider one of President Barack Obama’s nominees months before the 2016 election, then fast-tracking President Donald Trump’s pick under similar circumstances in 2020. The court has frequently ruled the way Republicans wanted, on everything from abortion to federal regulation. But packing the court would answer Republican politicization with Democratic politicization. The point is to make the judiciary less of a partisan playground. Term limits would help achieve that. One reason Supreme Court nomination battles are so intense is because the stakes are so high. People live a lot longer than they did when the Framers wrote life tenure for judges into the Constitution — to protect the courts against undue influence. Nowadays, a president elected to a single four-year term can influence the judiciary’s course for a generation. An 18-year term for justices, however, would fit better with the periods their presidential and congressional counterparts serve. If terms on the court were staggered, coming open every four or so years, it would be rarer for a president to install a disproportionate number. Conversely, winning the presidency more often would — appropriately — mean more appointments for a more popular party over time. Justices would feel less pressure to time their retirements based on partisan control of the presidency or Senate. And senators would have less reason to vote against qualified nominees for fear that their choices could doom their legislative agendas for decades. The idea of an ethics code arises from recent scandals over the failure of the court’s existing self-regulation system. Justice Clarence Thomas took luxury vacations funded by a high-dollar GOP donor without reporting them on financial disclosure forms; Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was also reticent about his travel to an Alaskan fishing lodge on the dime of a hedge fund executive whose firm had business before the court. The involvement of Justice Thomas’s wife in “Stop the Steal” efforts after the 2020 election also raised eyebrows. Neither justice recused from arguably related proceedings, though eventually — begrudgingly — Justice Thomas, without admitting any ethical lapse, produced more forthcoming reports. (Justice Alito insisted in op-eds that he had disclosed everything the rules require.) This debacle pointed to the need for greater clarity as to the types of gifts that require disclosure, as well as what fundraising activities are appropriate, which the court, belatedly, provided. What’s still lacking is an enforcement mechanism, which could be hard to design without intruding on the judicial branch’s independence. The president’s forthcoming proposal ought to contribute to that debate by suggesting not only a set of standards to which the court ought to be held but also a system for holding them to it that could pass constitutional muster. One possibility is to keep that system within the judicial branch, by giving the job to retired federal judges whom justices could at least consult regarding their ethical responsibilities. Now that Mr. Biden is no longer a candidate, there is less chance that his proposals can be dismissed as an election-year gambit. Certainly, he should write them as if that’s true; members of the legislative and judicial branches should treat them in the same spirit, too. ONLINE: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/26/biden-supreme-court-term-limits-ethics/ ___ July 26 The New York Times on debates, transparency in the current election cycle Vice President Kamala Harris, now the likely Democratic nominee, has the chance to encourage and embrace the kind of close examination that the public so far has had little opportunity to witness during the 2024 race. Americans deserve a campaign that tests the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates; that highlights their differences and allows scrutiny of their plans; that motivates people to vote by giving them a clear account of how their choice in this election will affect their lives. Americans deserve the opportunity to ask questions of those who are seeking to lead their government. There are promising signs in the early days of Ms. Harris’s candidacy. She has bounced onto the campaign trail with a sense of joyful purpose, seizing the opening to reintroduce herself. She has begun to detail the dangers of a second Trump presidency and to delineate her differences with Donald Trump, while describing her vision for a country where people have the support they need to prosper. But she needs to do more, and she needs to do it quickly. Ms. Harris ought to challenge Mr. Trump to a series of debates or town halls on subjects of national importance, such as the economy, foreign policy, health care and immigration. Mr. Trump claims that he is ready and willing to participate in debates once Democrats have officially selected a nominee. Americans would benefit from comparing the two candidates directly. Both candidates need to start taking questions from reporters, too. Candidates have abundant opportunities to speak directly to voters, through social media and tightly controlled public appearances, without the mediation of journalists. Most voters, however, will never be able to speak directly with candidates. President Biden has rarely granted the news media permission to ask questions on behalf of the American people, and on the rare occasions he did, his team sometimes sent scripted questions. It left him poorly prepared for the campaign trail and for confronting his opponent. Mr. Trump, too, rarely takes questions. Ms. Harris has the chance to do better. Engaging with voters is especially important for Ms. Harris because she would be the first major-party presidential candidate in modern times who did not pass through the state primary process, in which voters have a chance to take the measure of candidates and to ask questions about the issues that matter most to their communities. Ms. Harris’s candidacy does not require legitimation. She is the clear choice of her party. An Ipsos poll this week found that 89 percent of Democrats supported her running as the party’s nominee. But addressing small crowds in small places and answering questions from local reporters are rituals during the primaries for a reason. Unlike large public rallies, they are occasions for encounters on equal footing, and they are an education for the candidate as much as for voters. With debates and town halls, Ms. Harris would also have an opportunity to draw an even starker contrast with Mr. Trump. Presidential campaigns increasingly are conducted as performances before a sympathetic audience, one that is invited to watch and listen but not to question or respond. The false intimacy of social media gives the impression that candidates are more present than ever in the lives of their supporters, but those relationships are one-way streets. Candidates are seen by the electorate but they do not see; they are heard but they do not hear. Mr. Trump, who speaks mostly about Mr. Trump, is an extreme example of this tendency — and it is a perfect embodiment of his politics. If Trump campaign officials were reluctant to have their candidate appear at large outside rallies in the wake of the assassination attempt against him, no one would question that fear. His campaign, however, continues to exist primarily as a series of long, winding speeches that offer no insight into how he would end the war in Ukraine or how he would solve the crisis at the border, two of the many goals he has promised to accomplish if re-elected. The former president has barely been pressed on important policy questions or offered any concrete plans. Both candidates say they are running for office to help ordinary Americans. One way for Americans to judge those claims is by their campaigns. Good leaders speak, and they listen. They welcome scrutiny. They accept responsibility. Ms. Harris now has a chance to demonstrate that she will be the kind of leader who deserves the nation’s support. ONLINE: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/opinion/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate.html ___ July 24 The Wall Street Journal says President Biden owed Americans an honest reason for ducking out of the 2024 election President Biden explained his abrupt departure from the presidential campaign in a speech to the nation Wednesday evening . . . actually, no he didn’t. He delivered an address from the Oval Office saying it was time to “pass the torch to a new generation.” But why was he all-in for re-election five days ago but all-out now? He didn’t say. Did he have some sudden health setback that forced the decision? Or was it a gradual recognition of his growing inability to do the job that finally took hold and he was forced to admit? Or, more likely, was he pushed from the race by fellow Democrats who had concluded that he was a sure loser to Donald Trump and had to go, or they would all say so in public? Mr. Biden explained nothing. “The defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than any title,” he said, without saying why he could no longer do the defending. He could have reassured Americans that he is still capable of doing the job for another six months, while warning adversaries not to take advantage of his remaining lame-duck period in office. Americans were left instead to infer the reasons as Mr. Biden said his accomplishments had earned him a second term but he would no longer seek it. His speech will do nothing to dispel the view that this was a coup by Democratic power brokers, and that he and they and his aides had been hiding the truth about his decline from the voters for months, if not years. We wanted to give Mr. Biden the benefit of the doubt for making the right decision to withdraw, and a gracious farewell would have enhanced that decision. He owed the country more than the self-serving, non-campaign campaign speech he chose to deliver on Wednesday. ONLINE: https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-ducks-the-farewell-question-69cae97f?mod=editorials_more_article_pos17 ___ July 25 The Los Angeles Times on abortion Abortion opponents peddle various myths about the procedure to discredit it and demonize the people who provide or support it. Abortion is healthcare. The earlier it is available, the easier it is for people to make choices about their bodies that will affect the rest of their lives. But during election season, expect to hear some or all of these fallacies as Republicans who oppose abortion inaccurately discuss it. Abortion can happen after birth None are as ludicrous as the myth Donald Trump pitched in the presidential debate in June when he said Democrats “will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth — after birth.” Of course, there is no such thing as abortion after birth. Killing a fetus that emerges alive is infanticide. Abortion involves ending a pregnancy when the fetus is still in the uterus. In California, abortion is legal up to the point of the fetus’ viability to survive outside the uterus, which is around 24-25 weeks — or later if the abortion is necessary to protect the health or life of the pregnant person. The state is one of 20 where abortion is legal to the point of viability or a couple weeks less. In nine states and the District of Columbia, it is legal for any reason to have an abortion beyond that period. “I think it’s exceedingly rare to do an abortion past 32 weeks even in states where there are no limits,” says Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of California, San Francisco and the director of the the research program, Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health. In fact, only about 1% of abortions are performed past 21 weeks of gestation. When they do occur, they are usually done for severe fetal anomalies or to save a woman’s life, health or fertility. Trump also falsely claimed that a former Democratic governor of Virginia said he was willing to “rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.” Not true. In fact, he said the opposite. In a 2019 interview, former Gov. Ralph Northam was asked about a Virginia state bill that would remove the requirement for three doctors to agree on whether an abortion was medically necessary in the third trimester. Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, said that should be a decision left to the woman and her own doctor. He then talked about a situation where a doctor induces labor to deliver a fetus with a severe health problem not expected to live. He said: “If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen — the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired.” Keeping the baby comfortable without performing aggressive measures is sometimes referred to as perinatal hospice care. Abortion is never necessary for emergency medical care Yes, it is. If the amniotic sac ruptures prematurely, especially in the second trimester, that can lead to infection, sepsis, a possible hysterectomy or death. That’s why an abortion is often performed. (If the sac ruptures in the third trimester, labor can often be induced at some point.) A pregnant person who develops a condition where the placenta completely covers the cervix and begins to bleed heavily also may need an abortion. These kinds of severe complications were at the heart of the case the Supreme Court heard this session on whether the state of Idaho’s extreme abortion law prevented pregnant women from getting the emergency care required in U.S. hospitals that receive federal funding. In Idaho, some women with severe pregnancy complications had to be airlifted to other states to have emergency abortions. The court decided it should not have granted review of the case but did restore a lower court’s order blocking the part of the law requiring women to be near death before getting an emergency abortion. Medication abortion is dangerous to women Medication abortion — the most common abortion procedure in the U.S. — is a two-drug regimen that has been prescribed in the United States since 2000. Serious complications occur in less than one-third of 1% of uses. That’s safer than taking Tylenol. The Supreme Court recently dismissed a case from a group of antiabortion doctors and organizations contending that mifepristone, the first drug in the regimen, had not been studied carefully enough by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — despite the drug being safely in use for two decades. The court said the doctors had no standing to bring the suit since not one of them could identify a case where a doctor was forced, against their conscience, to perform a surgical abortion to deal with complications from a medication abortion. A majority of Americans support reproductive freedom and have voted to protect abortion access since the Supreme Court abolished that right in 2022. That hasn’t stopped Republicans from trying to use fear and falsehoods to justify their campaign to further whittle down abortion rights across the nation. In an election season filled with rhetoric, a woman’s ability to control her own body should not be obstructed by lies about what that means. ONLINE: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-07-25/editorial-trump-abortion-myths-that-should-not-fool-you ___ July 25 The Philadelphia Daily News/Inquirer on the Trump shooter, mental health resources in schools “He was bullied almost every day. He was just an outcast.” That observation by a former classmate of the 20-year-old man shot and killed by Secret Service agents after attempting to assassinate Donald Trump should have quelled all the loose talk spewed by the former president’s supporters to persuade voters that the tragic incident was politically motivated. Profiles of Thomas Matthew Crooks thus far instead resemble those of other young mass shooters going as far back as the 1999 murders of 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado. Since 1980, the median age of a mass shooter in this country has dropped from 39 years old to 22. Most mass shooters of any age are also non-Hispanic white men. Could Crooks have wanted to leave life in a blaze of glory? A Secret Service sharpshooter fatally shot him within moments after he wounded Trump and shot three other men, one of whom died. The lack of evidence leading to a specific motive for Crooks may leave that question unanswered forever, but that hasn’t stopped unsubstantiated accusations that he was stirred to action by anti-Trump comments made by President Joe Biden and other Democrats. It’s true that Crooks donated $15 to a Democratic organization on the day Biden was inaugurated in 2021, but later that year he registered to vote as a Republican. While the search for Crooks’ motivation continues, we should return to a topic that, like the need for better gun laws, our nation has yet to adequately address. America’s overburdened, underfunded mental health system still lacks enough resources to both help people before they become mass shooters and address the neglected needs of the general population. Our high schools, in particular, where students spend as much as seven hours a day or more, need trained staff members who can provide appropriate counseling before a student hurts themself or others. “He sat by himself, didn’t talk to anyone, didn’t even try to make conversation,” said another classmate of Crooks. “ He was an odd kid, but nothing about him seemed dangerous.” Figuring out which “odd kid” needs help requires more guidance counselors and advanced mental health professionals at our schools. Instead, many school boards have reduced those positions to save money. The American School Counselor Association recommends at least one counselor for every 250 students, but only Vermont (186) and New Hampshire (208) meet those criteria. Both Pennsylvania (353) and New Jersey (337) fall under the national average of 444 students per counselor, but their schools also fail to meet the ASCA standard. That means even when an overburdened school counselor notices a student has issues beyond bad grades or choosing a college, the demands of assisting dozens of other students may give them little time to intervene effectively. Even if time isn’t an issue, most guidance counselors are not specifically trained to help a student who exhibits behavior that may indicate they might commit a violent act. The National Association of School Psychologists recommends schools have one psychologist on-site for every 500 students, but the national average is only one psychologist for every 1,127 students. In Pennsylvania, the average is one school psychologist for every 1,022 students. New Jersey averages one psychologist for every 663 students, but that doesn’t meet the NASP standard, either. Most students who need help don’t become a danger to others, but many harm themselves, and some die by suicide. Students’ mental health was further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which closed schools, limited children’s interaction with peers, and increased their time on social media sites. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared a mental health crisis among children in 2021 and issued another warning last year about social media’s adverse impact on young people. School districts need more resources to intervene when they recognize a student needs mental health assistance. One avenue may be funding provided through a federal grant program that is part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act signed into law last year by President Biden. It includes $1 billion to be competitively awarded to school districts implementing programs to “prevent and respond to acts of bullying, violence, and hate.” Urgency, however, should also spur state and local governments and school boards to act beyond stringent security measures. Schools not only need teachers, administrators, and support staff, they also need enough guidance counselors and mental health professionals on-site to help prevent a school from becoming the scene of an avoidable calamity.

Harris opened her appearance before a crowd of 10,000 in Atlanta on Tuesday by taking aim at Trump’s record — criminal and otherwise — and calling out the ex-president for killing the bipartisan immigration bill that was crafted by one of the nation’s most conservative senators earlier this year. In a reference to her background as a prosecutor, she told rally goers she had taken on “perpetrators of all kinds,” including “predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers,” and “cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.” “So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type — I know the type, and I have been dealing with people like him my entire career,” she said, leading the crowd to respond with chants of “lock him up,” referring to the ex-president’s 34 felony convictions; Harris also said she would “proudly” compare her record against Trump’s “any day of the week,” including on the subject of immigration, citing her work as the attorney general of California, which shares a border with Mexico. “I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,” she said. By contrast, Harris said Trump “has been talking a big game about securing our border” but “ does not walk the walk.” “Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, DC supported the bill, even the Border Patrol endorsed it,” she said as she recalled how the bill had been “all set to pass” before Trump “directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.” “He tanked, tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election,” she said, adding that she would push a Democratic congress to enact the same bill to law when she is in the White House as president. In response, the crowd roared with approval. The vice president’s appearance at the raucous Atlanta rally demonstrated the massive shift in culture and enthusiasm that has swept through the Democratic Party in the nine days since President Biden shocked the world by announcing that he would become the first American president to stand down from seeking a second term since Lyndon Johnson did so amid the upheaval from the Vietnam War in 1968. Biden’s campaign appearances were usually daytime affairs hosted by labor unions or other Democratic-leaning groups, or nighttime fundraisers with audiences limited to smaller groups of donors and video footage tightly controlled by his campaign apparatus. But since becoming the party’s de facto nominee last week, Harris has returned to the packed rallies that characterized Democratic campaigns before the Covid-19 pandemic upended the 2020 election cycle, with star-studded guest lists reminiscent of Barack Obama’s first campaign for the presidency in 2008. By the time she took the stage at the Georgia State Convocation Center, the stands had been packed to the rafters with a crowd campaign officials estimated at more than 10,000 attendees. They were warmed up by Peach State Democratic mainstays, including former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Georgia’s two Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Rev Raphael Warnock. But even those politicians’ national profiles compared to another of the warm-up acts who entertained the crowd in the minutes before Harris took to the stage: Grammy-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion. The rapper performed four songs: “Girls in the Hood,” “Mamushi,” “Body,” and “Savage” as she exhorted the crowd to vote for Harris. Before she began “Body,” she told them Harris would protect their reproductive rights. “Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies — and if you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for,” she said. She also called Harris “our future president” and told the crowd they were “about to make history with the first female president — the first black female president.” “Let’s get this done, honey,” she added. After Thee Stallion performed to cheers from rally goers, Atlanta-area rapper Quavo praised Harris for her work on addressing gun violence, calling the vice president someone who “always stands on business.” But the cheers both musicians received paled in comparison to the ovation Harris got when she took the stage to Beyonce’s “Freedom” and launched into her remarks. In what has become a standard part of her stump speech, she warned that Trump wants to implement a “Project 2025” agenda that would “cut Social Security and Medicare,” as well as “give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations” and “gut the Affordable Care Act.” “America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not going back.,” she said. “We’re not going back, because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full on assault on hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights, the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,” she said. But Harris also challenged Trump on his recent decision to waffle on whether to debate her at the September 10 presidential debate set to air on ABC. She said Trump’s decision was because “the momentum in this race is shifting” and called the move a “sign that Donald Trump is feeling it.” “Here’s the funny thing about that. So he won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me,” she added, drawing laughs when she asked if the crowd finds her opponents “just plain weird.” Speaking to Trump directly, Harris challenged him to show up and confront her. “Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes: If you got something to say, you should say it to my face.”","summary":"The Vice President and the ‘Hot Girl Summer’ rapper both took to the stage at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-atlanta-rally-trump-border-b2588550.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/31/01/AP24212861191779.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6gamLeMn-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:45:07","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":253009708,"title":"When Trump Criticized Kamala Harris as Being 'Extraordinarily Nasty' For Questioning Brett Kavanaugh","text":"When Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his vice presidential pick in 2020, then-President Donald Trump was quick to attack her. He deemed Harris 'nasty' and 'horrible' within minutes of the announcement. The Republican leader argued Harris was 'extraordinarily nasty' to Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. He claimed she was 'disrespectful' and \"probably nastier than even Pocahontas\" to Biden during the Democratic debates. \"She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing,\" Trump told reporters. He added, \"The way she treated now Justice Kavanaugh, and I won't forget that soon.\" Trump's campaign also released an ad calling Harris 'phony' and part of the 'radical Left'. It read, \"Voters rejected Harris. They smartly spotted a phony. But not Joe Biden. He's not that smart.\" Harris gained attention for her tough questioning of Kavanaugh in 2018. She asked him if he had discussed the Mueller investigation with anyone at a law firm run by Trump's lawyer. When Kavanaugh didn't give a clear answer, Harris asserted, \"I think you're thinking of someone and you don't want to tell us,\" as per ABC News. She also pressed Kavanaugh on abortion rights, asking, \"Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\" Kavanaugh struggled to respond. In 2019, Harris also grilled Attorney General, William Barr, about the Mueller report. She asked if anyone at the White House had ever suggested he open an investigation. When Barr hesitated, Harris said sharply, \"It seems you'd remember something like that and be able to tell us.\" As per CBS News, in light of the same, Trump shared that he was surprised when Biden picked her. He tried to paint Harris as extremely liberal, calling her \"the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate,\" as per VOA News. However, Harris is generally seen as more moderate than some other Democrats. His harsh words about Harris mirrored how he talked about Hillary Clinton back in 2016 when he called her 'nasty' during a debate. Trump has made a name for throwing insults at women in politics, especially women of color, as per CNN. Some saw Trump's comments as sexist and racist. Donna Brazile, former Democratic National Committee chair, said Biden's choice of Harris at the time, showed the growing political influence of voters of color in the U.S. However, not everyone was enthusiastic about Harris. Some progressives criticized her record as California's attorney general. Lindsey Roland, a Black voter in Michigan, argued, \"I still think she was empowered to stand up more for minorities, and I think it was just a really missed opportunity.\" However, criminal justice reform advocate, Rashad Robinson, believed Harris had evolved. He said, \"She's been willing to listen and willing to evolve, and she's been willing to put legislation behind that evolution.\"","summary":"Kamala Harris was called &#34;extraordinarily nasty&#34; by Donald Trump during Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/when-trump-criticized-kamala-harris-as-being-extraordinarily-nasty-for-questioning-brett-kavanaugh","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/708119/uploads/75b12150-4e69-11ef-917f-8b2f284a5630_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":253009530,"title":"Project 2025 director steps down amid criticism from Donald Trump","text":"July 30 (UPI) -- Project 2025 director, Paul Dans, is stepping down at the Heritage Foundation amid intense scrutiny from Donald Trump, who chastised the group for linking its conservative blueprint to his campaign, as Democrats vowed to continue linking the report's policies to the former president. \"President Trump's campaign has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign and should not be associated with the campaign or the president in any way,\" Trump campaign co-managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement. Trump told supporters during a rally earlier this month that Project 2025 was written by people on the \"severe right\" and that its policies were \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\" The 922-page document, which has been used heavily by Democrats to target Trump, calls for expanding presidential power, eliminating the Department of Education, restricting welfare programs, cutting federal funding for clean energy research and taking the abortion pill mifepristone off the market. \"When we began Project 2025 in April 2022, we set a timeline for the project to conclude its policy drafting after the two party conventions this year, and we are sticking to that timeline,\" Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, wrote Tuesday in a post on X. \"Paul, who built the project from scratch and bravely led this endeavor over the past two years, will be departing the team and moving up to the front where the fight remains,\" Roberts added. Trump and his campaign have repeatedly distanced themselves from the initiative and have warned those involved in creating Project 2025 that they would be barred from working in a second Trump administration. In a statement released Tuesday, the former president and his campaign called the project's \"demise\" welcomed news. \"Reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign -- it will not end well for you,\" said LaCivita and Wiles. While Democrats have used Project 2025's policy proposals to target Trump, Kamala Harris' campaign said Tuesday their plan of attack will not change despite the director's decision to leave. \"Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot. This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez claimed in a statement. During her first campaign event last week, Harris linked Trump to Project 2025 by referring to it as \"his platform,\" while the former president called Harris' claims \"pure disinformation.\" Earlier this month, Biden said the initiative was \"written for him.\" Meanwhile, Project 2025 \"has completed exactly what it set out to do,\" according to Roberts. \"Bringing together over 110 leading conservative organizations to create a unified conservative vision, motivated to devolve power from the unelected administrative state and returning it to the people.\"","summary":"Project 2025 director, Paul Dans, is stepping down at the Heritage Foundation amid intense scrutiny from former President Donald Trump, who chastised the group for linking its conservative blueprint to his campaign.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/07/30/project-2025-director-steps-down/8761722380790/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8761722380790/2024/upi/4d373add33c90fd1ea74c35d08a9f4dc/v1.2/Project-2025-director-steps-down-amid-criticism-from-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:44:16","author":"Sheri Walsh","authors":["Sheri Walsh"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":253009366,"title":"AG Garland slams dismissal of Trump’s classified documents case: ‘Do I look like someone who would make that basic mistake?’","text":"Attorney General Merrick Garland suggested Tuesday that his lengthy legal career makes it unlikely that he illegally appointed Special Counsel Jack Smith to investigate alleged crimes committed by former President Donald Trump. Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the federal classified documents case against Trump earlier this month, ruling that the special counsel was not lawfully appointed by Garland – a determination that made the Biden administration official bristle. “For more than 20 years I was a federal judge. Do I look like someone who would make that basic mistake about the law? I don’t think so,” Garland said in an interview with “NBC Nightly News.” The attorney general noted that his “favorite room” in the Justice Department is its law library to hammer down the point. “Our position is, it’s constitutional and valid. That’s why we appealed,” Garland added. “I will say that this is the same process of appointing special counsel as was followed in the previous administration, Special Counsel [John] Durham and Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller, in multiple special counsels over the decades going back to Watergate and the special prosecutor in that case,” he said. “Until now every single court, including the Supreme Court, that has considered the legality of a special counsel appointment has upheld it.” In her July 15 order, Cannon ruled that Congress was required to appoint “constitutional officers” and the legislature was also needed to approve spending for such a prosecution. “That role cannot be usurped by the executive branch or diffused elsewhere — whether in this case or in another case, whether in times of heightened national need or not,” she wrote in her 93-page ruling. The judge determined that “Special Counsel Smith’s investigation has unlawfully drawn funds from the Indefinite Appropriation.” “The Special Counsel’s office has spent tens of millions of dollars since November 2022, all drawn unconstitutionally from the Indefinite Appropriation,” Cannon wrote. “For more than 18 months, Special Counsel Smith’s investigation and prosecution has been financed by substantial funds drawn from the Treasury without statutory authorization, and to try to rewrite history at this point seems near impossible. The Court has difficulty seeing how a remedy short of dismissal would cure this substantial separation-of-powers violation, but the answers are not entirely self-evident, and the caselaw is not well developed,” she added. Smith’s team is expected to file a brief related to their appeal in the case, which charged the 78-year-old Republican nominee for president with improperly hoarding sensitive and classified White House documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence after his presidency, by the end of August. Trump faced up to 450 years in prison if convicted on all counts in the case.","summary":"Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the federal classified documents case against Trump earlier this month, ruling that the special counsel was not lawfully appointed by Garland – a determination that made the Biden administration official bristle.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/ag-merrick-garland-slams-dismissal-of-trumps-classified-documents-case/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-8pfsbcl04-1722381169102.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722366833&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QeCLmLAe-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:39:29","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":253009428,"title":"Joe Biden Passes 'Essential Stop' in Bid to Save Mail-in Ballots","text":"President Biden is making appointments to the U.S. Postal Service to save mail-in ballots, an attorney has said.Joyce Vance, a former federal prosecutor, said it is part of a political struggle within the postal service.Republican lawyers fighting against mail-in ballots recently wrote in a court briefing that they disproportionately favor Democratic Party candidates.Vance wrote in her legal blog, Civil Discourse, on Monday that Biden nominated former Florida Congresswoman Val Demings and Republican businessman William Zollars to the board of governors as a way of exercising more control.In March, Biden appointed former Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.The board consists of 11 people, nine of whom are nominated by the President, similar to a Supreme Court judge.The two other members of the board are the Postmaster General and the Deputy Postmaster General.Vance, a liberal Democrat, said that Biden is seeking to remove Trump-appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.\"The good news is that this is an essential stop towards replacing Louis DeJoy, Trump's Postmaster General, who is still in place.\"\"DeJoy put measures in place that he claimed were designed to cut costs but that, in practice, seriously impaired mail delivery,\" Vance alleged.\"In one notorious move, he dismantled sorting machines.

It’s way too early to confirm who will be speaking at the Democratic convention in Chicago, which kicks off Aug. 19 at the United Center — or the Hollywood, Broadway and musical stars who will appear along with the party giants. But if, as Shakespeare wrote, the past is prologue, we have some educated guesses. Barack Obama. Michelle Obama. Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton. All are powerful speakers who will make the case for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presumptive nominee and the TBD running mate she needs to pick in the next few days. The biggest suspense may be what Republicans the Harris team can woo to speak — with the highest value targets being people who worked in the Trump White House and really know best former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee. Modern political conventions are produced prime-time shows. The viewers are the main audience — not the delegates, donors and party activists inside the convention hall. In Milwaukee, the biggest viewing audience, according to the Nielsen ratings, came on the last night, with people eager to hear Trump talk about the assassin’s bullet that struck his ear just days before. When Trump’s vice president pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, spoke on the third night, he attracted 17.9 million viewers, according to the ratings service, compared to 25.3 million for Trump. With the Republican Party transformed into the Trump MAGA party, no former GOP president, vice president or White House nominee attended, much less spoke. In Chicago, Harris will have a second chance to make a first impression. That’s crucial, since the point of a convention is to gain the vote of people who may have not been paying much attention to politics. For Democrats, those are people who were not enthused about President Joe Biden, who dropped his re-election bid on July 21; swing voters who are persuadable, and Republicans who want nothing to do with Trump but have a hard time voting for a Democrat. Twenty years ago this week, on July 27, 2004 at the Democratic convention in Boston, the world discovered the oratorical power of a then fairly unknown keynote speaker, a state senator by the name of Barack Obama who was running for a Senate seat from Illinois. Obama’s speech was so powerful — there are no red states, no blue states, just the United States — that it put him on the path to the White House. Obama is one of the most popular Democrats with an incredible ability to communicate. With the home field advantage in Chicago, remarks from Obama, the nation’s first Black president making the case for the woman who may be the second, will be much anticipated. Former first lady Michelle Obama, who remains extremely popular, is also likely to speak about a candidate who would be the first female president. It is inconceivable that Michelle Obama would deliver a speech that did not take into account her humble upbringing just a few miles away in a tiny apartment on the South Side. As good a speaker as her husband, at the 2016 Democratic convention in Philadelphia — the one nominating Hillary Clinton — Michelle Obama in her speech delivered her now famous call and response. You remember it — “When they go low, we go high.” Former President Bill Clinton has delivered speeches at every Democratic convention since 1980 and there is no reason out there to think he won’t go for one more in Chicago. At the 2012 Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C. Clinton was tasked with nominating Obama for a second term. Clinton’s speech was a master class in making complex government policies and issues simple and why people should vote for Democrats. Since then, Clinton has been known as the “Explainer-in-chief.” Within hours after Biden stepped aside, Harris was able to all but claim the nomination, invigorating Democrats, especially women. On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton, in a fundraising appeal, reflected back on her history-making nomination at the 2016 Philadelphia convention, where she became the first woman to lead the Democratic ticket. “We made history that day,” Clinton wrote. “The excitement was palpable. Shattering the long-awaited glass ceiling of a woman in the White House felt closer than ever before. Now, we have the chance to make that dream a reality.” It would be a shocker if Hillary Clinton, whose dream was dashed by Trump’s surprise 2016 victory, did not show up at the Chicago convention to help frame the case for Harris to do what she could not — defeat Trump, become the first female president and finally, finally, shatter that glass ceiling.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/07/30/democratic-national-convention-chicago-barack-obama-michelle-obama-bill-clinton-hillary-clinton","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2270e0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1104x630+48+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F34%2Fa49b385dffc6cc287b01a1d25cd3%2Fthe-ob","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:35:37","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":253009382,"title":"Letters: Word and deed | Insurers’ revenue | Source material | Hard lessons | Vaccine pledge","text":"Let’s hope that Harris’ deeds match her words Re: “Harris tells Netanyahu ‘it is time’ to get hostage deal done and end Gaza war” (July 25).

Let us hope Kamala Harris will do more than complain about the egregious death toll of innocent civilians in Gaza. Actions speak louder than words. Forrest Cioppa Walnut Creek Premiums aren’t what make insurers thrive Re: “How to cool down California’s heated home insurance market” (Page A8, July 28). The East Bay Times guest editorial by an insurance company president claims insurance companies can’t survive on insurance coverage revenue when losses exceed earned premiums. Having worked for an insurance company for 32 years, I’m going to counter what he said. The fact is, the majority of insurance companies don’t live on earned premiums. They live on investments. Insurance companies will take your dollars and buy investments. Many insurance companies own investment properties such as tenanted commercial real estate and buy investments such as stocks and municipal bonds. Those insurance companies that are investor-owned receive more money from stock purchases that increase the cash flow to buy more investments. Insurance companies have highly skilled portfolio managers who are experts at maximizing investments. Lawrence Shulman Clayton Trump should carefully choose source material Re: “Trump to Christians: If I win, ‘You don’t have to vote again’” (Page A4, July 28). Donald Trump’s promise to the The Believers’ Summit on July 26 sounded eerily familiar: “Get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Pay no attention to what you’ve been told. Trust me. All will be well. Surely the Turning Point Christians have read or heard that message before. Genesis 3. The Temptation of Eve by the Serpent. Pay no attention to what you’ve been told. Trust me. She did and we all know what followed. Advice to Donald Trump: To avoid being compared to Satan, select your analogies more carefully. Moral for everyone else: Trust not the soothing words of the serpent. Martha Toppin Walnut Creek Harris administration would offer hard lesson I can understand why many young, first-time voters, especially those right out of high school, will flock to Kamala Harris. It gives them the exciting opportunity to make history by electing our first woman president with the promise of a lot of free stuff and a comfortable life. It will take them a few election cycles to learn that all politicians lie and that there is no such thing as a free lunch. They will also learn that most presidents do more harm than good, and some are so bad their policies and decisions get people killed. Right now, our volunteer military enlistments are falling short of their goals and the world is a tinder box in part because of our country’s perceived weakness. How the bad guys act under a Harris presidency versus a Donald Trump one may result in a life-altering change of plans for those first-time voters of draft age.

Vance for Changing Like a 'Chameleon': \"It’s Really Heartbreaking\"","text":"Senate Republican JD Vance has been called out by a former friend who claims he is a 'chameleon' changing his political beliefs for his benefit. Sophia Nelson became friends with JD and his wife Usha Vance when they were students at Yale Law School. During an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday, Nelson said that the former president Donald Trump's 2024 running mate had changed his mind about 'every imaginable issue' while campaigning for office. Nelson—who uses they/them pronouns—informed Burnett that Vance's change of heart was driven by the senator's desire for 'political value and wealth'. As reported by the Raw Story, Nelson revealed during the interview, \"What I’ve seen is a chameleon. Someone who is able to change their position and their values depending on what will amass them political value and wealth and I think that's really unfortunate because it reflects a lack of integrity. This isn’t someone who evolved on one or two issues with new information. This is someone who has changed their opinion on literally every imaginable issue.\" This interview echoes Nelson's remarks in The New York Times, in which they criticized Vance's position on LGBTQ+ rights. According to Nelson, they were friends with J.D. and his wife Usha in the past. However, Nelson informed the Times that their relationship ended when Vance supported laws that would make it illegal to provide gender-affirming medical treatment to kids, first in Ohio and then nationwide. Nelson said, as per CNN, \"That was incredibly hurtful, and I communicated that to him. I communicated that I was disappointed, I was hurt and I was scared. Because I remember what it was like to be a kid and think that there was something wrong with me.\" After the NYT reported on Vance's email and text message with Nelson, it seemed as though Vance's transition from a moderate Republican opposing Trump to a MAGA cultural warrior had begun. As per the same report, Vance even referred to then-Republican presidential candidate Trump as a 'demagogue' in 2015, so the sudden shift from being anti-Trump to being all in on the former president has gotten extreme coverage. Furthermore, when the two friends had a falling out, Vance apparently told Nelson, \"I will always love you, but I really do think the left’s cultural progressivism is making it harder for normal people to live their lives.\" In response, Vance's camp sent a statement, expressing their regret at the disclosure of almost a decade-old communications 'between friends'. The statement read, \"Senator Vance…has been open about the fact that some of his views from a decade ago began to change after becoming a dad and starting a family, and he has thoroughly explained why he changed his mind on President Trump. Despite their disagreements, Senator Vance cares for Sofia and wishes Sofia the very best.\"","summary":"Sofia Nelson recently gave an exclusive interview and described Vance&#39;s dramatic change from what he once was before entering politics.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/ex-friend-from-yale-trashes-j-d-vance-for-changing-like-a-chameleon-its-really-heartbreaking","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/708096/uploads/c4bfe7c0-4e61-11ef-be7f-530b522ddea7_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:30:00","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":253009912,"title":"Trump loses lead in 7 battleground states: 'Kamala moves the needle'","text":"Just two weeks after President Joe Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency, the new 2024 Democratic nominee is taking the lead over former President Donald Trump in several states, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

Coming on after a performance by supporter Megan Thee Stallion, Harris opened with her crowd-pleasing attack on Trump, 78 — casting herself as a tough-on-crime prosecutor going up against a “predator.” “As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, and before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and an elected district attorney, and before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who broke the rules for their own game,” Harris said. “So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type,” she added to raucous applause. It was her second campaign rally as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — after she spoke to 3,000 people last week in Milwaukee. The large crowd blew away the generally small audiences of President Biden, who ended his campaign July 21 and endorsed Harris as his successor. Harris tried to address head-on one of her biggest liabilities — her performance on securing the border as Biden’s point person on reducing illegal immigration. “In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day, any day of the week — including, for example, on the issue of immigration,” Harris said. “I was the attorney general of the border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,” she said. “Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk. Or as my friend, Quavo would say, ‘He does not walk it like he talks it.” She claimed “Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself. And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem.” Harris made the claim despite Republicans regularly slaming her actions as so-called “border czar” — as she presided over sequential record-breaking annual illegal crossings — with polls showing that immigration is a leading liability for Democrats alongside economic concerns.

On average, she notched a 48% to 47% lead in battleground states – jumping ahead in four out of seven of the key contests, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll. The poll pegged Harris led the polls in Arizona with 49% support to Trump’s 47%; Michigan with 53% to 42%; Nevada with 47% to 45%; and Wisconsin with 49% to 47%. Prior to Biden’s abrupt exit, Trump, 78, had generally been leading in most of the battleground state polling, with some variation. Trump still carried the lead in North Carolina (48% to Harris’ 46%) and Pennsylvania (50% to Harris’ 46%) in the Tuesday poll. The two candidates tied in Georgia with 47% each. The poll is among the earliest comprehensive surveys of the battleground states since President Biden’s seismic July 21 decision to withdraw from the race and endorse Harris, 59. Earlier this month, another Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll gauged Biden, 81, behind Trump at 45% to 47% – a two-point spread that also represented Biden’s strongest performance in the battleground states after his disastrous debate performance. At the time, that poll pegged Trump up in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, but behind Biden in Michigan and Wisconsin. Other polls generally showed Biden losing ground at the time in the wake of his debate performance, which triggered a mutiny among Democrats that ultimately culminated with his decision to drop out. Still, most of the battleground states in the most recent poll are within the margin of error, suggesting an even race. The survey sampled 4,973 registered voters from July 24-28 across the seven main battleground states. It held a general margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point for the main chunk of swing states. The margin of error came in at 3 points for Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania; 4 points in Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin; and 5 points in Nevada. The Trump campaign’s top pollster Tony Fabrizio previously warned that Harris would enjoy a “honeymoon phase” in polling over the early days of her abrupt ascension. “That means we will start to see public polling — particularly national public polls — where Harris is gaining on or even leading President Trump,” he explained in a memo last week. “While the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’s done. Stay tuned…” he added. The recently rebranded Harris for President campaign has boasted about the apparent jump in momentum, hauling in some $200 million within her first week as the de facto top-of-the-ticket. Trump and his campaign have begun recalibrating their messaging to go after Harris more aggressively and sew concerns in the minds of voters about her past flirtation with hard-left policies. Bloomberg News/Morning Consult’s Tuesday poll also found that a third of voters across the seven battleground states indicated that they are more likely to cast ballots in the election due to the Democrats’ switcharoo. That includes 44% and 49% of Hispanic and black voters, respectively. Previously, Biden appeared to struggle to ignite enthusiasm from those blocs of voters. In a silver lining for Trump, voters in the survey ranked the economy as their top issue – giving the 45th president an eight-point advantage over Harris. Still, that’s down from the 14-point edge Trump held over Biden. Nationally, Trump is leading Harris by 2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of a five-way matchup. Biden’s decision to withdraw at this stage of the race is unprecedented. Harris is now racing to select her running mate ahead of the Democrats’ planned virtual roll call to crown their nominee early next month.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump's battleground state advantage appears to have evaporated just over a week after Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, a new poll showed.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/kamala-harris-erases-donald-trumps-advantage-in-battleground-states-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/us-vice-president-democratic-presidential-86498592.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:19:18","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":253008404,"title":"Trump accuses Kamala Harris of anti-Semitism and supports radio host’s derogatory comments about her husband Doug Emhoff","text":"Former President Donald Trump claimed Vice President Kamala Harris ‘doesn’t like Jewish people’ and appeared to agree with an interviewer who called her Jewish husband Doug Emhoff a ‘crappy Jew.’ The incendiary comments came during an interview with WABC radio at a time of high tensions an military strikes between Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah, in a campaign where the Biden administration has drawn protests for its military support for Israel. ‘You can see the disdain,’ Trump said of Harris, her party’s presumed nominee. ‘Number One, she doesn’t like Israel. Number Two, she doesn´t like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it and nobody wants to say it,’ Trump said. Trump claimed Harris ‘dislikes Jewish people’, despite her marriage to second gentleman Doug Emhoff, in comments that drew a sharp rebuke from the the Harris campaign. Interviewer Sid Rosenberg brought up Emhoff, saying, ‘He´s Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?’ At that point, Trump can be heard saying ‘Yeah.’ ‘He´s a crappy Jew,’ said Rosenberg. ‘Yeah,’ Trump said again. Then Rosenberg added, without explanation, ‘He´s a horrible Jew.’ The remarks drew an immediate response from the Harris campaign. ‘America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump,’ said Harris campaign spokesman James Singer. ‘Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.’ Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told DailyMail.com when asked about the comments by Rosenberg, ‘He obviously wasn’t agreeing with that sentiment. In fact, Kamala has stoked anti-Israel hate on school campuses with her dangerous and divisive rhetoric.’ Trump made a similar claim about Harris disliking Jewish people on Friday while speaking to a Christian group at a Turning Point USA gathering in Florida. He has also ignited blowback in the past for making similar remarks about Jewish people, like when he said in March that Jews who vote for Democrats ‘hate Israel’ and hate ‘their religion.’ Emhoff, the first Jewish person to serve as the spouse of a nationally elected U.S. leader, has been one of the most visible members of the Biden administration speaking about combating antisemitism. He hung mezuzahs on the doorposts of the vice president´s residence and led Passover celebrations at the White House. Trump also attacked Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, who is Jewish. ‘Fifteen years ago, you couldn’t say a bad thing [about Israel], you’d be out of office. And today it’s almost like — I mean, Schumer has become a Palestinian. Chuck Schumer is officially now a Palestinian,’ Trump said. The Harris campaign said in a statement: ‘Donald Trump is hateful, despicable, and should not be our president. He roots against America. He insults America. Why would we want to put him in charge of America? Donald Trump thinks he can score points with Jewish voters by denigrating them. He is wrong.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed Vice President Kamala Harris &#8216;doesn&#8217;t like Jewish&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump accuses Kamala Harris of anti-Semitism and supports radio host&#8217;s derogatory comments about her husband Doug Emhoff first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-accuses-kamala-harris-of-anti-semitism-and-supports-radio-hosts-derogatory-comments-about-her-husband-doug-emhoff/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/30/21/87962449-13690531-image-a-46_1722372916823.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:17:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.43},{"id":253008680,"title":"Potential Harris running mate Josh Shapiro opposes Nippon-US Steel merger","text":"Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said on Tuesday that he cannot support Japanese firm Nippon Steel’s bid to buy US Steel in its current form because the United Steelworkers union is unhappy with the merger. Shapiro, who is a contender to be Vice-President Kamala Harris’ Democratic Party running mate in the November US presidential election, said he was viewing the proposed merger through its impact on workers. “Speaking from a state perspective as governor, if the US steel workers aren’t happy with this deal, which they are not, I’m not happy with this deal,” Shapiro said at an Internal Revenue Service event attended by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “If I don’t see a future where US Steel manufacturing continues here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and is expanding from what is happening right now, I’m not happy, so I’ve got really serious concerns,” he said. Shapiro told a press conference after a tax event in Philadelphia that he will review any business deal through “the prism of how does it impact Pennsylvania workers”, as the state has grown thanks to US Steel and other industrial manufacturers. US Steel, founded in 1901, is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in the November 5 election. Both US President Joe Biden, who abandoned his bid for a second term and endorsed Harris to be his successor more than a week ago, and Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in the election, have backed US Steel’s unionised workers in their strong opposition to the deal. The Japanese and US firms believe the merger, creating the world’s third-largest steelmaker by volume, would benefit them. A large majority of US Steel shareholders have also already approved the US$14.1 billion deal. But since the planned all-cash transaction was announced in December, United Steelworkers International has spoken against it, turning it into a sensitive political issue. Biden, who needed to secure support from trade unions for the presidential election, said multiple times earlier this year that the steelmaker should be domestically owned. On Tuesday, Shapiro also said: “What’s been put forth on the table is not something that would enjoy my approval, and I’m going to continue to stand directly side-by-side and locked-arms with US steel workers, the very people who have built this commonwealth and this country.” “They deserve real respect,” added the governor. The acquisition plan needs to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is in charge of examining certain foreign investment transactions in US firms and determining whether they pose national security threats. The committee, also known as CFIUS, is chaired by Yellen, who said in April she accepted Biden’s view that US Steel should remain in American hands. Asked where the merger plan’s review stands now, she said CFIUS will look at any transaction from a national security perspective and try to make the right decision, but that she is “not able to talk about the specifics”.

But Australians would get a better sense of just how the family’s media companies are accommodating a rising authoritarianism by looking closer to home. In Hong Kong, The Wall Street Journal, a publication that has marketed itself as the least Murdoch-like of the family’s properties, marked the 28th anniversary of the handover to China this month by sacking reporter Selina Cheng. She had been elected chair of the territory’s leading journalists’ rights organisation, the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA). It’s a blunt reminder that (at News Corp, at least) the global purging of newsrooms is as much about creating a politically correct workforce of reliable journalistic cadres as it is about simply saving costs. For the past decade, Hong Kong has been at the coalface of the global struggle for press freedom. Right now, Jimmy Lai, publisher of the pro-democracy Apple Daily, is in jail facing national security charges. The HKJA has been the key voice for journalists in that struggle. Last year, Cheng’s predecessor as HKJA chair, Ronson Chan, was jailed for five days. It’s that context that has made the sacking of Cheng so shocking, marking the moment when, if we had any doubts, News Corp declared just which side it’s on. As Cheng said: “Reporters in Hong Kong know their editors or employers don’t always have their backs. That’s why the [HKJA] is so important. We want other journalists to know we’re here for them.” The media is so brutalised by repeat rounds of job losses that it’s easy to miss that the cuts are changing the shape of the industry. Here in Australia, the number of journalists across News Corp has drop from a boasted 2,500 across all its titles in 2012 to whispers of fewer than 1,000 now. The so-called “good journalists” have been winnowed far more quickly. They were essential to provide journalistic cover for an otherwise radicalising News Corp — for example, the straight Sky News by day needed to balance the just plain weird Sky after dark. It’s the Lachlan transition: adapting the family business models by accepting, and eventually embracing, that odd mix of authoritarian populism and anarcho-capitalism championed by Donald Trump — then pairing it with radical job cuts. It’s a journalism of hard reporting with the bluster of punditry and the lure of conspiracy theorising, all packaged up with the frenetic urgency of a tabloid news framing. Traditional media is mimicking the new Murdoch model — like at Politico in the US or the Daily Mail and Telegraph in the UK — and doing it just as well, in raw readership terms anyway. The Washington Post has brought in former Murdoch managers to oversee its own transition. Until last year, The Wall Street Journal was meandering more slowly down the path of change. Outside Lachlan’s direct control, it stuck more rigidly to the traditional siloing of its deeply reported news and its often quite bonkers op-eds. After the Murdochs took over in 2008, Rupert’s managers built on its strengths but also made it a sharper, more serious news broadsheet, with a broader market appeal than the old-fashioned business paper they’d inherited. It now boasts one of the world’s most successful digital subscription programs. Since change agent Emma Tucker was brought in from the family’s Sunday Times to be editor in chief last year, the paper has been in turmoil, with job cuts and staff protests (the WSJ remains a strongly unionised newsroom) over her reboot to make the masthead more like, well, all the other “serious” Murdoch mastheads like, say, The Australian. The Lachlan-era shock has encouraged a hope that maybe things would be different if prodigal James was restored in a post-Rupert palace revolt by the family trust. Maybe. Or maybe people are drawing too strong a conclusion from stray comments that the Tesla board member has made about climate change. In the chronicles of the Murdoch dynasty, Hong Kong plays much the same role as it does in British imperial history: once the strategic spearpoint to open up China to drive expansion for a new century; now, a largely greyed-out embarrassing moment of overreach. For the Murdochs, that spear was Star Television, distributed across east and south Asia (although not China itself) bought for about US$1 billion in 1996. The spear carrier was youngest princeling James, who marked his own 28th birthday in 2000 as Hong Kong-based head of the satellite broadcaster. His main job was to persuade Beijing that they could trust the family to go along to get along (a task made harder by Rupert’s incautious 1993 assertion that satellite television was an “unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere”.) In a 2001 speech, by contrast, James shrugged off the threat of authoritarianism, saying Hong Kong democracy activists should “accept the reality of life under a strong-willed ‘absolutist’ government”. That’s the lesson from Hong Kong: you can change the father for the son, or the brother for the other, but you can’t change the fundamentals of the business of right-wing media.

Coincidentally, however, Emhoff dropped in right in the middle of Harris’ push to target Asian voters – particulary in the Hmong community, many of whom didn’t appreciate the second gent crashing their event to canvass. Cory Tomczyk, a Republican state senator, told The Post that those he spoke with in the Hmong community were not pleased with the chaos and campaign paraphernalia Emhoff brought to the event. “There was a huge backlog of people trying to get into the events,” said Tomczyk, who was at the festival manning the Republican booth. Security checkpoints held up people for an hour trying to get to the flag football games and volleyball tournaments. Eventually, the crowd became fed up – and pushed past security. “There was nothing the Secret Service could do,” Tomczyk noted. “Hundreds of people were in a line a street wide for a couple of blocks, on foot, waiting to get in because the Secret Service had the main gate shut down.” Chaos wasn’t the only complaint. Others thought Emhoff’s visit was in poor taste, overshadowing culture with campaigning. “It’s unfortunate that Mr. Emhoff decided to turn an important event honoring the sacrifices of Hmong veterans into a partisan campaign event,” said GOP Rep. Tom Tiffany, whose district includes Wausau, Wis., where Hmong Americans make up the town’s largest ethnic minority. “If the Biden-Harris Administration really cared about the Hmong community they would be working day and night to reduce inflation and the cost of energy, secure our borders, and contain the threat posed by Communist China. Anything else is simply ineffective lip service meant to win votes,” he told The Post. Still, Emhoff proceeded to pander to those in attendance. “This community right here could decide the election in this state, which could decide the entire election,” Emhoff told festival-goers. “You have the power right here.” Governor Tony Evers (D-Wis.) and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) also attended the festival. The latter, who is in a tough re-election race this November, appeared to be there in her official capacity rather than to campaign. It’s no surprise that Harris wants a piece of the Hmong vote in Wisconsin – they number 60,000 strong statewide, making up about 1% of the population. Central Wisconsin is not exactly a blue stronghold for the Democrats. Marathon County, where Wausau is located, went for Trump in 2016 by over 18 points: 57% to Hillary Clinton’s 39%. Trump won the county by the same margin in 2020 against Biden. In 2020 Democrats made a concerted effort to reach the Hmong vote, a strategy that the Harris campaign is building on using the VP’s South Asian heritage. Republicans in the state have also built relationships with the community. Former Republican Gov. Scott Walker attended the first Hmong Wausau Festival in 2017. In 2021, a Republican-led effort designated May 14 as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day in Wisconsin in recognition of Hmong fighters’ partnership with US forces during the Vietnam War. This is the first year there was a Republican outreach booth at the festival and it was “very well received,” Tomczyk told The Post. He also said he brought ten Trump yard signs to the festival, not knowing how many would be wanted, and all of them were taken. “I interacted with a lot of people,” Tomczyk said. “It’s our fault we’ve been absent from this festival,” noting the family values of the Hmong community that “align with Republican values.” The Hmong community is the largest Asian racial group in the Badger State, comprising 33% of all Asian residents. Wisconsin also has the third largest Hmong population in the country, after Minnesota and California. In April of this year, Evers signed into law a bill mandating the teaching of Hmong and Asian American history in public schools, inserting the language into existing law mandating the teaching of American Indian, Black and Hispanic histories. The Hmong community is not one cohesive voting bloc, as business people and entrepreneurs in the community favor Republican policies, while others favor the Democrats’ social policies. Memorably, Donald Trump’s administration faced a public backlash in 2020 when it was revealed they were in talks with the Laos government about deporting non-citizen and criminal Hmong and Lao residents back to the communist country.","summary":"Second Gentleman Emhoff visited a Hmong festival in Central Wisconsin last weekend as the Harris campaign uses the VP's South Asian heritage to reach the Asian vote.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/emhoff-rallies-hmong-vote-in-wi-as-harris-campaign-target-asian-vote/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-wwca5baub-1722376156585.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722361829&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TPnkuS3r-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:10:27","author":"Amy Sikma","authors":["Amy Sikma"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":253008316,"title":"The short, strange life of ‘weird’","text":"THE SHORT, STRANGE LIFE OF “WEIRD.” For a brief moment, every Democratic talker in the United States was calling former President Donald Trump and running mate Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) “weird.” They’re still doing it now, but in the last 24 hours or so, the vogue of “weird” appears to be dwindling. And that leaves the question: What was that about? Several press accounts suggest it got started last week when Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), who just happens to be on presumptive nominee Vice President Kamala Harris’s short list for running mate, “called Trump and Vance ‘just weird’ in an MSNBC interview, which the Democratic Governors Association, of which Walz is chair, amplified in a post on X,” according to ABC News. Then the Harris campaign, just days in existence, began calling Trump and Vance “weird” on every occasion it could. Last Friday, the campaign sent out a press release headlined “JD Vance Is a Creep (Who Wants to Ban Abortion Nationwide).” The first sentence of the release: “JD Vance is weird.” Subscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what’s going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!By the weekend, shows on MSNBC and CNN were talking about it, giving Walz credit. The head of the Democratic National Committee predicted victory in November in part because its Republican opponents are “weirdos.” Later, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), who pulled herself out of the vice presidential pool, claimed the “weird” talking point was breaking through because of the Republican agenda and “the way they address people, it is bizarre. It’s weird. It is weird. … And weird is a kind of a funny phrase to use because it’s bizarre.” By then, it seemed that every Democratic official and every Democratic ally in the press was calling the Trump-Vance ticket “weird.” Look at this collection of clips to see one after the other after the other after the other. Does it work? Who knows? The Democrats speaking in unison obviously believe it does. But here’s one very odd thing about it: President Joe Biden, who was the 2024 Democratic candidate until he was deposed by a group of party insiders, based his campaign on the threat he claimed former President Donald Trump posed to democracy. Say what you will about it — and it was basically malarkey, as the president might say — it was serious malarkey. It was a big, deeply solemn accusation. And now? Oooh, they’re weird. As a whole, on cue, the Democratic Party changed the focus of the campaign from saving democracy to saying the other side has cooties. That was an extraordinary decision, to say the least. A few days ago, Politico suggested that Democrats may have de-emphasized democracy in favor of “weird” because democracy just wasn’t selling. Biden, Politico reported, “believed deeply in making the issue of democracy a central theme of the campaign. But the president’s remarks on the subject often featured a grave tone and a heaviness that, more than three years after the January 6, 2021 insurrection, the country had seemingly tuned out. Polls showed voters rated Biden and Trump roughly evenly on questions of which candidate would be better to protect democracy.” That is a big, serious question. With Biden’s charge in mind, voters could see the sitting president advocate removing Supreme Court justices because he did not like their decisions; they could see his Justice Department indicting his opponent not once but twice; they could see Biden’s supporters trying to remove Trump from presidential ballots — they could see all of that and reasonably wonder which candidate would better protect democracy. No wonder people got a little tired of things. So the Harris team thought it might be better to just dump the big, serious Biden campaign theme in favor of … “weird.” There are those who argue that “weird” itself is a serious message. The Atlantic’s David Frum suggested that it was a shrewd campaign appeal directed at millions of women, who will get the anti-Trump, pro-Harris message even if Trump supporters don’t. “‘Weird’ is code for ‘expresses obsessive hostility to women, including the women in his own personal life,'” Frum wrote, “and because MAGA Republicans don’t get the code, they don’t understand why they are losing the argument.” Maybe. A huge gender gap has characterized this entire campaign, with Trump having a big lead among men and Biden having a big lead among women. Through the ouster of Biden, Trump’s lead was a bit bigger than Biden’s, meaning Trump led in polls both nationwide and in key swing states. Maybe “weird” will be the magic word that turns any women who do not already support Trump against the former president. Or maybe not. In any event, now, although it’s never a good idea to speak too soon, it appears the “weird” wave might have crested. Some Trump supporters started posting images of the Biden administration’s celebration of transgenderism, men dressed in women’s clothing reveling on the White House lawn, alongside photos of Vance and his family with the caption “JD Vance is weird.” That led to other sorts of pushback on the “weird” theme. And then the Harris campaign released its first big ad, and it was an entirely conventional case for her candidacy — no “weird,” no memes, just a straight old-fashioned campaign commercial. And now “weird” doesn’t seem to be popping up every second on some media outlets and in social media. So maybe we are approaching the point where it all seems overdone. And then, voters can hope, the campaign can move on to being a campaign.","summary":"THE SHORT, STRANGE LIFE OF &#8220;WEIRD.&#8221; For a brief moment, every Democratic talker in the United States was calling former President Donald Trump and running mate Sen.

The U.S. and Philippine governments have deepened their military alliance since Ferdinand Marcos Jr. became president of the Philippines two years ago. Unlike his predecessor, who favored an opening with China, Marcos has leaned into ties with the United States. Marcos, who lived in Hawaii while his family was in political exile and has met President Joe Biden one-on-one multiple times since taking office, hosted a meeting today of the top diplomatic and military officials from both nations in Manila. It was the first time that such a so-called 2+2 session between the allied nations has taken place in the Philippines. Biden has made alliance-building a hallmark of his foreign policy, especially in Europe and Asia, where different sets of alliances are aimed at countering or deterring military action by two nuclear-armed superpowers that are partners with each other — Russia and China. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Manila on Monday night as part of a diplomatic mission to the Indo-Pacific region. The backdrop of the talks in Manila was a fraught one: Not only have Chinese coast guard vessels carried out more hostile actions against Philippine naval ships in recent months in the South China Sea, but Marcos and other Asian leaders are wondering who will take over from Biden as the U.S. president next January. Will it be Kamala Harris, the current vice president and presumed Democratic nominee, or Donald Trump, the former president who says U.S. military alliances are a waste of resources? Marcos remarked to Blinken and Austin on the circumstances of their visit at the presidential palace on this morning. “I am a bit surprised considering how interesting your political situation has become back in the States, but I’m glad that you’ve found the time to come and visit with us,” Marcos said. Blinken, in his remarks, made sure to mention Harris, saying he brought “greetings from President Biden and Vice President Harris along with Secretary Austin.” At an afternoon news conference with Austin and with their Philippine counterparts at Camp Aguinaldo, the headquarters of the Philippine military, Blinken highlighted the $500 million in additional military aid and said it would be used for helping to modernize the Philippine military and the coast guard. Austin said “this level of funding is unprecedented, and it sends a clear message of support for the Philippines from the Biden-Harris administration, the U.S. Congress and the American people.” Under the Biden and Marcos administrations, the first substantial boost to the U.S.-Philippine alliance took place in February 2023, when the governments announced, during a visit by Austin to Manila, that the Philippines had granted the United States access to four additional military bases. The northernmost of those are near Taiwan. The agreement allows the United States to use the bases for humanitarian purposes, but in the event of a war — for instance, a Chinese attempt to invade Taiwan — officials in Manila and Washington could decide that the U.S. military could use the bases for combat support. At the news conference today, Philippine Defense Minister Gilbert Teodoro said his country looked forward to enhancing cooperation on those military bases. It is in the South China Sea where tensions between the Philippines and China are the most heated. For months, Chinese coast guard vessels tried to keep Philippine naval ships from bringing supplies to marines posted at the Sierra Madre, a grounded ship on the Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef. Both China and the Philippines claim the area as their territory. Chinese coast guard vessels have rammed Philippine ships and fired water cannons at them; in one episode, two ships hitting each other resulted in the severing of a Philippine sailor’s thumb. Austin stressed at the news conference that the mutual defense clause of the U.S.-Philippine treaty applies to actions against the forces of both of those countries in the South China Sea. China and the Philippines signed an agreement last week in which China would allow the Philippine navy to run resupply missions to the Sierra Madre. There have been some questions on whether the two governments have clashing interpretations of the agreement, but the Philippines was able to run a resupply mission on Saturday to the grounded ship without harassment by Chinese vessels. Blinken said that at a meeting he had in Vientiane, Laos, on Saturday with Wang Yi, China’s top foreign policy official, he told Wang that China had to refrain from hostilities against the Philippines in the South China Sea. At their stops in Tokyo and Manila, Blinken, Austin and their aides have coordinated with foreign counterparts to issue strong messages pushing back against China’s assertive territorial moves. In Tokyo on Monday, Blinken and three foreign ministers from the so-called Quad countries that have a nonmilitary partnership — Japan, India, Australia and the United States — issued a joint statement that, among other things, denounced military aggression in the South and East China seas. Like a similar statement that the ministers issued last year in New Delhi, this one did not name China, but it was clear they were referring to that country. “We are seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,” the four top diplomats said in the latest Quad statement. “We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea,” they said. “We also express our serious concern about the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, the increasing use of various kinds of dangerous maneuvers, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities.” As in New Delhi in 2023, because the statement did not name China, it was not as strong as it could have been. Some countries in Asia want a robust U.S. military, diplomatic and economic presence in the region as a counterweight to China, but at the same time they want to avoid provoking China, which is rapidly building up its military — and especially its navy — while being the largest trading partner for many Asian nations. The Quad is an example of the Biden administration taking a moribund multilateral partnership and reinvigorating it. The administration has also created new latticeworks of trilateral military partnerships. It has done this with Japan and South Korea, and with Japan and the Philippines. Leaders announced the latter in April, when Marcos and Fumio Kishida, the prime minister of Japan, visited Biden at the White House. On Sunday, during the first day of their visit to Japan, Blinken and Austin also held a meeting with Japanese counterparts on extended deterrence, the term that refers to deterrence protection provided to nonnuclear-armed nations by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. It was the first time that a session on extended deterrence had been scheduled outside of the regular 2+2 conference, underscoring the growing anxieties over possible military conflict in the Asia-Pacific region. After the news conference at Camp Aguinaldo, Blinken stopped by an artisanal chocolate shop, Auro, on his way to the airport to fly to Singapore. Blinken is visiting six nations on his 18th trip to the Indo-Pacific region. He tasted both chocolate and pandesal, a Philippine bread, this one stuffed with ube, a paste of purple yam, and sipped from a cup of mocha. He walked away from this final stop in Manila with a gift box of chocolates from the owner, Mark Ocampo.

However, during the interview, both Trump and Rosenberg took aim at Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate following President Joe Biden's drop from the 2024 presidential race, as they spoke about the Jewish voters following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the U.S.In the interview, Rosenberg, a conservative radio personality that has a controversial history, began to criticize the second gentleman, calling him \"a crappy Jew,\" as Trump appeared to agree.\"He's Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me? He's a crappy Jew,\" Rosenberg declared.\"Yeah,\" Trump said as the conversation continued to critique Harris on various other issues.The comments come after Trump, in Tuesday's interview, suggested that Harris appeared uncomfortable during her recent meeting with Netanyahu.\"You can see the disdain,\" Trump said. \"She doesn't like Israel. She doesn't like Jewish people. Everyone knows it, but no one wants to say it.\"In addition, Trump reiterated his criticism of Jewish voters who support Democrats, declaring that they \"should have their head examined\" and labeling them \"fools\" for their political choices.Newsweek has reached out to Trump's and Harris' campaign via email for comment.In response to Trump's remarks, James Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign said in a statement to the Associated Press (AP), \"America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump. Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country, uses the power of the presidency to help families, and has a vision for our future.\"Trump has a history of controversial remarks about Jewish voters, including a statement in March accusing Jews who vote for Democrats of hating Israel and their religion, the AP reported.Tuesday's interview comes just days after Trump accused Harris of antisemitism in a speech on Friday at The Believers' Summit which was hosted in Palm Beach, Florida, by Turning Point Action, the campaigning arm of conservative group Turning Point USA.\"Two days ago she refused to attend the speech in Congress of the prime minister of Israel. She said 'Oh I can't make it.' It was just a small group of people but they couldn't make it because that's her original thought. That's where she comes from. She doesn't like Jewish people. She doesn't like Israel. That's the way it is, and that's the way it's always going to be. She's not going to change,\" Trump said.The vice president skipped Netanyahu's speech to the U.S. Congress last week as she was traveling in Indiana during that time, but did meet with the Israeli leader in a separate meeting the next day.Trump's remarks come as the former President seeks to highlight the divisions within the Democratic Party over the Israel-Hamas conflict as some Democratic leaders decided not to attend Netanyahu's speech last week, citing divisions over the war.Israel is currently at the tenth-month mark of its war against Hamas, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people. Israel subsequently launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes in Gaza. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, the AP said.

Paul Dans, a former top adviser in Trump’s administration, steered Project 2025 as it carved a leading role in shaping discourse around what conservatives dreamed they could accomplish if Republicans won back the White House. While a source with knowledge of the planning said Project 2025 would be effectively ending its policy operations, others familiar with the matter noted that it was always the plan to move on to the next phase now – and efforts to build a conservative personnel apparatus would continue. Project 2025’s plans to radically reshape the federal government and American life, spelled out in detail in an exhaustive 900-page playbook, provided ample fodder for Democrats to warn against Trump’s return to power. In recent months, Trump has lashed out against Project 2025, calling some of its ideas “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.” He strained to distance himself from the work, claiming he had “no idea who is behind it.” Top Trump adviser Chris LaCivita recently referred to Project 2025 as “a pain the a**” for the Trump campaign. Dans’ departure was confirmed in a statement to CNN Tuesday by Dr. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, the group that launched Project 2025. In addition to stepping down from Project 2025, Dans is also leaving the Heritage Foundation. “Under Paul Dans’ leadership, Project 2025 has completed exactly what it set out to do: bringing together over 110 leading conservative organizations to create a unified conservative vision, motivated to devolve power from the unelected administrative state, and returning it to the people,” Roberts said. “This tool was built for any future administration to use.” LaCivita and Susie Wiles, both Trump campaign managers, said in a statement that the Trump team “has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the President in any way.” They continued, “Reports of Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.” A spokesperson for Heritage, though, said despite Dans’ exit, work will continue on the current phase of Project 2025, which is a nationwide search to fill a Trump administration with loyal conservatives. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign made clear Tuesday that the change of leadership will not stop its efforts to share Project 2025’s contents with voters. Harris has made criticizing Project 2025 a centerpiece of her early campaign for the presidency, picking up right where President Joe Biden left off. “Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot,” Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said. “This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country. Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real – in fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.” Project 2025 includes many policy priorities that are aligned with those of the former president, especially as they relate to cracking down on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracy by making it easier to dismiss civil servants and career officials. But Project 2025 has lately become a lightning rod for other ideas Trump hasn’t explicitly backed. Within the group’s seminal work, “Mandate for Leadership,” are plans to ban pornography, reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, exclude the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, make it harder for transgender adults to transition and eliminate the federal agency that oversees the National Weather Service. Its detailed plans also run counter to Trump’s push for a streamlined GOP platform absent any language that Democrats could wield against Republicans this cycle. Still, Trump’s efforts to keep the organization at arm’s length were complicated by his close ties to the people behind it. At least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in the project, a CNN review found, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership.” Nobody embodied the shift from Trump insider to Project 2025 champion more than Dans. Dans served as chief of staff at the US Office of Personnel Management during the Trump administration where he served as a liaison between the agency and the White House. He told a gathering of conservative broadcasters earlier this year in Nashville that he intended to work for Trump again if he win. He has also assured Trump’s supporters that Project 2025 would become a reality if the former president returned to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In June, he told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast that Project 2025 was “gonna be a D-Day invasion plan” and urged listeners to “flood the zone with us.” “We’re going to make this happen under President Trump,” Dans said. “And this is ultimately his direction and his team’s direction.” (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Paul Dans, who predicted Project 2025 would become \"the engine room of the next administration\" in a recent interview with the ABC's Four Corners, will leave the initiative in August. Kamala Harris and, before her, Joe Biden had been frequently targeting Project 2025 on the campaign trail, highlighting its more radical proposals to expand presidential power and reshape government. That prompted Trump to declare he had \"nothing to do with\" the project, though many of the people who worked on it were his allies, including scores of his former staff. Mr Dans served as chief of staff in the Office of Personnel Management in the Trump administration. \"This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez insisted in a statement after today's announcement. But the Trump campaign said it had \"been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the president in any way\". \"Reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.\" The Heritage Foundation think tank, which led Project 2025 in conjunction with more than 100 other conservative groups, said Mr Dans's work overseeing it was always due to end about now. But an anonymous former Heritage Foundation aide said it was almost certain the Trump campaign had forced the shake-up. Trump campaign representatives did not respond to messages inquiring about whether the campaign pushed for Mr Dans to step down. Mr Dans didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. What is Project 2025? Also known as the 'Presidential Transition Project', Project 2025 is spelled out in an almost 1,000-page document. Loading... One of the most controversial proposals involves replacing thousands of traditionally apolitical public servants with Trump loyalists. \"We have a database with over 10,000 people from all walks of life entering into this, aspiring to serve,\" Mr Dans told Four Corners. The proposal lines up with Trump's own plan, outlined on his campaign website, to \"shatter the deep state\". He has vowed to revive a 2020 executive order to reclassify public servants working in policy roles as \"Schedule F\" employees, effectively turning them into political appointments. That would strip job protections from potentially tens of thousands of government workers, making it easy for the president to sack them. Project 2025's other proposals include: eliminating government programs focused on climate protection and racial and gender equitypursuing abortion bans at all levels of government, and removing the mifepristone abortion bill from the marketdisbanding government agencies including the Department of Educationscaling back social welfare programs such as food-stamp support and Medicaid health insurance In July, Trump said \"some of the things\" proposed by Project 2025 were \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal\". \"Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them,\" he wrote on social media. But a CNN analysis later found at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had contributed to Project 2025, including at least six of his former cabinet secretaries. In 2018, the Heritage Foundation said Trump had embraced nearly two-thirds of its 2016 blueprint within a year of taking office. The Harris campaign said Trump and Project 2025 had been working hand in glove. \"Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real,\" it said. \"In fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.\" Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts said the project had \"completed exactly what it set out to do: bringing together over 110 leading conservative organisations to create a unified conservative vision, motivated to devolve power from the unelected administrative state, and returning it to the people\".

Sens. Ron Johnson (R-WI), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) indicated that whistleblowers have been able to fill in key details since the shooting on July 13, which left one dead, two seriously injured, and Trump with a minor injury. “We need more whistleblowers,” Johnson said. “We need people inside the agencies who are willing to talk to us, tell the American people what’s really happening.” Johnson’s remarks came during a press conference the lawmakers held right after a Senate hearing on the shooting, where acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate both testified. Blackburn applauded whistleblowers who had already come forward, pointing to a report in RealClearPolitics of an internal email allegedly written by a Secret Service whistleblower decrying the bureau’s perceived culture of “CYA,” an acronym for “cover your a**.” At the hearing, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) confronted Rowe about a whistleblower report he received indicating that the Secret Service was offered the option to use drone technology at the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the shooting occurred, but an agent repeatedly rejected the offer. “There was an offer to fly a drone on that day,” Rowe said. “We probably should have taken them up on it.” Rowe was put in the hot seat after his predecessor, former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, resigned following her inability to answer numerous questions at a similar hearing about the stunning security failures that led to the assassination attempt. The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to access a nearby rooftop and fire eight shots into the rally crowd. Several senators at the hearing zeroed in on communication failures between the Secret Service and local law enforcement at the rally, but Cruz grilled Rowe on reports that the Secret Service had at times denied additional security requests from Trump since he left office. Rowe said Trump was provided all the security assets his team requested for the rally, but he indicated that there were times in the past couple of years when this was not the case. Cruz said he believed Secret Service leadership “made a political decision to deny these requests.” “Secret Service agents are not political,” Rowe replied. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Later at the press conference, Cruz commended Rowe for doing “marginally better” than Cheatle but was still unconvinced that politics were not a factor in the Secret Service. Cruz reiterated the plea for more whistleblowers, saying they could shed light on the matter. “I want to underscore the call that has come from multiple senators for whistleblowers,” Cruz said. “I believe the rational inference from the evidence we know now is it was political bias at the top, at the leadership of the Secret Service, that led to insufficient agents and insufficient resources being devoted to protecting President Trump.”","summary":"Senate Republicans urged Secret Service agents Tuesday to become whistleblowers and report their concerns about the agency to Congress after some had already anonymously come forward with information about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.

Heritage said Paul Dans was stepping down and Project 2025's policy operations are concluding. Foundation President Kevin Roberts said in a statement that the policy work was always set to conclude after party conventions, anyway, but that their personnel work would continue. \"Our collective efforts to build a personnel apparatus for policymakers of all levels—federal, state, and local—will continue,\" he wrote. The campaign of Republican former President Donald Trump has tried to disavow the project. Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, who lead the campaign, said in a statement that “reports of Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.\" The Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from the sweeping plan to transform the U.S. government in a second Trump administration amid controversy over some of its policy positions on issues such as abortion and immigration. The 900-page plan serves as a conservative guidebook to expand presidential powers and overhaul the federal workforce so that it can be replaced with partisan loyalists. As polls suggested that voters disapproved of Project 2025, Democrats began to tie Trump to it. It prompted the former president to post on Truth Social: “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.” While Trump has sought to deny a connection, there is plenty of overlap between Project 2025 and his agenda: It proposes mass deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants. So does Trump. Trump has called for cuts to the federal agencies like the Department of Education. Project 2025 calls for its elimination. But there are also differences: On abortion, for example, Project 2025 goes further with restrictions than Trump has said he would go. Democrats seemed ready to continue to tie the project to Trump. In a Tuesday statement titled, \"Project 2025 Isn’t Going Anywhere,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez insisted that “Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot.

Biden called Monday for term limits and ethics guardrails for the justices to \"prevent abuse of presidential power and restore faith in the Supreme Court.\" Over the past few decades, Democrats have clamored for institutional change, usually after facing political headwinds from a decision. Another example followed the 2016 election, when Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for the abolition of the electoral college. BIDEN'S SCOTUS CRITIQUES LARGELY UNPRECEDENTED, EXPERTS SAY Warren argued in 2019 during a campaign stop in Jackson, Mississippi, that non-swing states are not often visited during the general election, and their voters are often overlooked. At the same time, other Democrats were livid at the fact former presidental candidate Hillary Clinton scored many more popular votes than Donald Trump, but Trump won by 77 electors. In 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid, D-Nev., invoked the \"nuclear option\" to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for Senate-vetted nominees. At the time, Sen. Mitch McConnell warned Reid, \"You’ll regret this, and you may regret this a lot sooner than you think.\" Within a few years, McConnell’s premonition came to pass as Democrats erupted at the Kentucky Republican after he utilized Reid’s precedent to extend the \"option\" to Supreme Court nominees and quickly shepherded Trump’s picks through the confirmation process. Democrats have decried censorship of journalists on X during Elon Musk’s tenure, while having limited qualms with the Jack Dorsey-led Twitter censoring the New York Post’s Hunter Biden bombshell. Legal experts characterized the reality of the proposed changes as exceedingly unlikely. SCHUMER PLANS TO STRIP TRUMP OF IMMUNITY FOLLOWING SCOTUS RULING \"With respect to Biden wanting to institute term limits on Supreme Court justices, this is a pipe dream at best,\" said Ken Belkin, a criminal defense and civil rights attorney in New York. \"U.S. Supreme Court Justices' terms are set by the Constitution, and they are set for life — so long as the justice serves in good behavior. In order to set term limits like President Biden proposes, it would require a constitutional amendment.\" Belkin noted the tenuous process to pass a constitutional amendment. Thirty-eight state legislatures must approve it. Expanding the court, he noted, could, however, be done through legislative action. \"The attacks on the Supreme Court are being inflamed by certain politicians and media outlets who seem to either have a fundamental misunderstanding of the court's role or are intentionally misleading the public,\" Belkin added. \"The court does not exist to rubber stamp one's policy preferences whether they be liberal or conservative.\" Another legal expert offered that there is indeed a trend on the left to overhaul institutions. \"Clearly, if the left sees something that it doesn't like, it ordains it to be a problem that has to be fixed. Here, of course, they are trying to monkey around with the one branch of government that is, that they don't control, and that is supposed to be independent,\" said former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm. Malcolm, now a senior legal fellow at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, said judges have a lifetime tenure because they are supposed to be independent, and that it is the transition to six conservative justices on the bench that has made the left \"go nuts.\" Malcolm noted justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito had been under fire from Democrats for accepting trips from wealthy friends, pointing out silence on that side of the aisle when the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did the same thing. Throughout Biden’s decades in office, Malcolm said, Biden has never voiced such support for court reforms, but he has done so with 99 days to go in his political career. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This is blatantly political [and] designed to rally the Democratic base,\" Malcolm said. \"It's not about trying to address a so-called problem or a serious effort at reforms.\" As for the political angle of the apparent pattern, Article III Project President Mike Davis said Biden is corruptly trying to \"selectively disqualify\" justices he doesn’t like. \"And our president, who politicized and weaponized his Justice Department to destroy his political opponent, now wants to destroy the Supreme Court who stopped him,\" said Davis, whose organization has a textualist interpretation of the Constitution and helps vet and confirm judicial nominees such as Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"[Biden’s] vice president aided and abetted him every step of the way,\" Davis added. Davis called the behavior on the left \"the gravest threat imaginable to our republic,\" saying Biden and Harris are essentially trying to destroy a co-equal branch of government. \"Both are the 'dictator' and 'danger to democracy' they project onto their political opponents,\" Davis said.

In testimony before two Senate committees, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump’s right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others with an AR-15-style rifle. “What I saw made me ashamed,” Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. “As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.” The first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle’s resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure. But Rowe went on to tell lawmakers that the Secret Service erred by assuming that local officials would cover the building and its roof, not the Secret Service. Republican Senator John Cornyn pushed back on the notion that the responsibility should have been left to others. “Isn’t that something that Secret Service should have covered, as opposed to delegating it to local law enforcement?” Cornyn asked. “We assumed that the state and locals had it,” Rowe replied. “I can assure you that we’re not going to make that mistake again.” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal asked Rowe: “Ultimately, doesn’t the buck stop with the Secret Service?” “It stops with us, sir,” Rowe said. But Rowe added: “If they’d just held their post and looked left.” Rowe’s comments came days after a local SWAT team assigned to help protect Trump told ABC News that it had no contact with Secret Service agents in charge of security at the rally before the shooting, and that an anticipated face-to-face briefing with Secret Service officials never happened. Rowe said he has already taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election. FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who also testified before the panels, said Crooks appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager. It is some of the first evidence of Crooks’ possible inclination toward extremism and political violence found by investigators, who have yet to identify a motive. Abbate said investigators found a social media account dating to 2019-2020, when Crooks would have been 15 or 16 years old, adding that the account had posted more than 700 comments. “Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature,” Abbate told lawmakers. Crooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of the shooting, a flight that Secret Service officials failed to notice because a system for detecting drones was not working properly due to problems with the local cellular network, Rowe said. Lawmakers sought to learn why the Secret Service did not delay the rally or prevent Trump from taking the stage, noting that local police saw Crooks with a rangefinder device for measuring distances about an hour before the shooting. Rowe said Crooks was only one among a number of individuals to draw local law enforcement attention, and added that the Secret Service was not informed when local police saw Crooks on the roof with the rife, just before he opened fire. “They were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,” Rowe said. The proceedings grew heated when Republican Senator Josh Hawley pushed Rowe to begin expelling agency employees immediately. “I will tell you, senator … that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and let people be unfairly persecuted,” Rowe told Hawley with a raised voice.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> The U.S. Secret Service&#8217;s new acting director said today that he was &#8220;ashamed&#8221; of a security lapse that led to the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, but blamed the shortfall on local law enforcement.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/30/breaking-news/secret-service-chief-blames-trump-security-lapse-on-local-police/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-30T174230Z_1439431868_RC2S59AMIK6I_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-CONGRESS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:30:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.574},{"id":253006132,"title":"Trump remains the favorite in 2024 presidential race despite Harris’ rise: Nate Silver","text":"Even after Democrats dramatically moved to re-top their presidential ticket and got an apparent jolt of momentum, famed election analyst and statistical guru Nate Silver still deems former President Donald Trump the favorite. His election forecast model gives Trump a 61.3% chance of prevailing in the Electoral College, while Vice President Kamala Harris is at 38.1%. Silver previously pegged Trump with a 65.7% chance of victory over President Biden during his model rollout last month. In his most recent assessment, Silver included a slew of polling averages that gave Trump slight advantages nationally and in most of the battleground states, albeit not in Wisconsin, where Harris was ahead. Still, Silver’s analysis showed Harris rapidly gaining ground on Trump in most polling. His model also gave Harris a 53.5% chance of winning the popular vote compared to Trump’s 46.5% chance. Last month, his assessment, which was based on 40,000 simulations run through the model, pegged Biden with a 47.2% chance of edging out Trump (47.1%) with the national popular vote. The last Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote was George W. Bush when he secured re-election in 2004. Silver touted his model as a “direct descendent” of the FiveThirtyEight election forecast. Silver founded FiveThirtyEight, which is named after the 538 votes available in the Electoral College, and departed from it last year. FiveThirtyEight had been one of the rare election forecasts that projected Biden was most likely to emerge victorious in the 2024 presidential election. It suspended its forecast after Biden abruptly dropped out of the race on July 21. Biden promptly endorsed Harris who quickly became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, scrambling the 2024 contest. Harris’ favorability ratings in a flurry of polls quickly shot upward and the recently rebranded Harris for President campaign touted a roughly $200 million haul within less than a week of Biden’s exit. Preliminary polling has generally shown tightening in the race, but less than 100 days out from election night, pollsters are racing to recalibrate for the new dynamics of the contest. Trump retains a two percentage point edge nationally in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls, but battleground state polling is still somewhat light compared to the litany of surveys scoring a Trump v. Biden matchup. “Roughly speaking, the strategy of the Harris campaign should be to triangulate the strategy of Hillary 2016, the Harris 2020 primary campaign, and Biden 2024, and do the exact opposite, Silver quipped on X. Silver had been among the chorus of voices publicly encouraging Biden to step aside amid concerns about his mental acuity. He gained notoriety after successfully predicting 49 of 50 states in the 2008 presidential election and was further vaulted to prominence by his prediction of President Barack Obama’s 2012 victory. Back in 2016, his model favored Hillary Clinton to prevail against Trump, but in 2020, his last forecast gave Biden an 89% chance of victory. Harris is now rushing to select a running mate as the Democrats’ planned virtual roll call to coronate their nominee is fast approaching. Following the virtual roll call, Democrats will then hold their national convention in Chicago from Aug. 19-22.","summary":"Even after Democrats dramatically moved to re-top their presidential ticket and got an apparent jolt of momentum, famed election analyst and statistical guru Nate Silver is still deeming former President Donald Trump the favorite.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/trump-remains-the-favorite-in-2024-presidential-race-despite-harris-rise-nate-silver/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/86494736.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KR4DxkUF-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:15:07","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":253006208,"title":"Gina Carano Calls for Pedro Pascal, Kathleen Kennedy to Testify Over ‘Mandalorian’ Firing","text":"Gina Carano‘s legal battle over her firing from The Mandalorian could feature a star-studded cast of witnesses, including Pedro Pascal, Jon Favreau and ex-Disney chief executive Bob Chapek. In a joint filing from the ex-MMA fighter and Disney, Carano pointed to those names as potential witnesses that could be called to testify in her case. She also included Bear Grylls, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and Lynne Hale, the engineer of the publicity campaign behind Star Wars. The July 26 court document previews issues to be raised in the trial — tentatively scheduled for Sept. 25, 2025 — such as whether Carano was under contract on Feb. 10, 2021, when Disney purportedly terminated her for voicing right-wing opinions on social media. Another contested issue is whether Carano was treated differently than her male co-stars. In her lawsuit, filed in February, she alleged that Disney and Lucasfilm turned a blind eye to others, who she said made offensive and denigrating posts directed toward Republicans, while she was allegedly fired for her cultural and religious beliefs. She pointed to Pascal’s 2017 post comparing former President Donald Trump to Hitler. Other posts from Pascal cited in the lawsuit include one of him comparing the United States response to those entering the country illegally to Germany’s concentration camps. The Mandalorian creator Favreau, meanwhile, will presumably be called to testify on whether Disney greenlit plans to a new spinoff entitled Rangers of the New Republic that would feature Carano’s Cara Dune as one of its lead characters. Kennedy in 2020 confirmed production of the title. Grylls may be called to testify over allegations that Disney pulled an episode of Running Wild with Bear Grylls that featured Carano after she was terminated. In the filing, Disney pushed back on Carano’s list of witnesses while saying that it may call Lucasfilm vice president of animation and live action development Carrie Beck and Disney executive vice president of communications to testify. The development comes after a federal judge last week rebuffed Disney’s bid to dismiss the lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett rejected arguments that Carano’s discrimination claims are barred by the First Amendment, finding that the actress may have been terminated from the series in retaliation for holding disfavored political beliefs. Disney had argued that its entitled to protect its speech in the Star Wars series from association with views that it and many viewers considered offensive and contrary to its message, which it said includes respect, integrity and inclusion. With her ousting from the Star Wars universe, Carano potentially lost out on millions of dollars. The standard contract for a series regular on other spinoffs is for roughly six years at a base salary beginning at $150,000 to $250,000 per episode, with each season consisting of up to ten episodes.","summary":"Gina Carano&#8217;s legal battle over her firing from The Mandalorian could feature a star-studded cast of witnesses, including Pedro Pascal, Jon Favreau and ex-Disney chief executive Bob Chapek.

The clashes with police have brought into question the loyalties of the military, with some videos published on social media showing military units sympathizing with or even defecting to protesters. On Tuesday, the military high command reaffirmed its loyalty to Maduro, putting the military establishment firmly behind the incumbent president. “We reaffirm the most absolute loyalty and unconditional support to Nicolas Maduro Moros, Constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

Lopez said there was a coup attempt against Maduro and that the military would move to “defeat” it. “There is a coup in progress, so President Nicolás Maduro has stepped up to stop it again and with him the people who elected him president, all the institutions, the Bolivarian armed forces, and the democratic institutions,” he continued. At the same time, videos emerged on social media showing soldiers interacting in a friendly manner with protesters, contrary to orders. “If you can’t maintain order and peace, then I will have to take action myself to defend them,” a soldier told a group of protesters. “With all due respect to the soldiers, the idea is not for the military to fight against its own people,” one of the protesters responded. “If you respect us, we’ll respect you,” the soldier said. Two separate videos appeared to show riot police mingling with protesters to cheers. One video showed soldiers greeting and shaking hands with protesters to cheers.

Ronald Rowe also testified that he recently visited the shooting site and laid down on the roof of the building where shots were fired in order to evaluate the gunman’s line of sight during the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. “What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,” he said. The testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency’s mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been spotted on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking. “Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president’s security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,” Rowe said. “It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.” He said that the shooting amounted to a “failure on multiple levels,” including a failure of imagination and a “failure to challenge our assumptions.” “We assumed that the state and locals had it,” Rowe said. “We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams” in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots. “And I can assure you,” Rowe added, “that we’re not going to make that mistake again.” He said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs and dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. The blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics. Tuesday’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting. Local law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated. Even though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man. “No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,” Rowe said. At another point, he noted, ”It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn’t know that there was this incident going on.” But Rowe’s willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility. “Isn’t the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded — isn’t that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. Rowe, raising his voice, responded that he has “lost sleep over this for the last 17 days” and that he would not be rushed “to judgment” by Congress. He assured lawmakers that “people will be held accountable.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, “a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.” He added: “Nothing’s going to change until somebody loses their job.” The FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school. Abbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021. The chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks’s presence on that platform was consistent with being “pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden’s immigration policy.” On Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico. The FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.","summary":"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,” Ronald Rowe told lawmakers.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/07/30/acting-secret-service-director-says-hes-ashamed-after-the-trump-assassination-attempt/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24212533223117.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:11:38","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":253007008,"title":"Kamala Harris Gaining Ground On Trump In 6 Of 7 Swing States: Report","text":"Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has gained ground against Republican Donald Trump in six of the seven swing states since President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll of registered voters published on Tuesday.

JD Vance pinned the blame on Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday for “every failure” under the Biden administration, charging that she’s been “calling the shots” in the White House. The Ohio Republican and GOP vice presidential nominee, speaking before a packed gymnasium of several thousands at Liberty High School here, argued that Harris, 59, played an outsized role in the current administration because of President Biden’s cognitive decline. “Kamala Harris owns every failure of the Biden administration over the last four years,” Vance told the crowd. “He didn’t know what was going on,” he said of the 81-year-old president. “So somebody was calling the shots, and we know it was Kamala Harris.” Vance, 39, accused Harris, who’s likely to secure the Democratic nomination for president next week, of being responsible for the crisis of the southern border and record-high inflation under Biden – urging Nevadans to elect former President Donald Trump in November to “take our country back.” Inflation and immigration are regularly listed as top concerns for voters heading into Election Day. The “Hillbilly Elegy” author further alleged that Harris helped “cover up” Biden’s “declining mental capacity for years,” calling it the “worst of all” her “faults.” “Anyone who is too blind to see Biden’s incompetence, or more likely, too dishonest to admit it, is not fit to serve as commander in chief of this country,” Vance asserted, referring to the vice president. Vance’s appearance in Henderson – a booming suburb of Las Vegas – was one of two stops Trump’s running mate was scheduled to make in the key swing state on Tuesday. The Ohio senator is slated to hold a rally in Reno, Nev., in the evening. A Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll released last week showed Trump leading Harris in Nevada by 2 percentage points. The Silver State went for Biden in the 2020 election by less than 3 points. Karie Harwood was one of many who trekked across the Las Vegas valley to see the Republican vice presidential nominee. Was she concerned about Democratic criticisms of Vance’s “childless cat lady“ remarks? “I think it’s garbage,” she told The Post. “Because I think a lot of people have taken simple things that he said – that didn’t, that didn’t mean it as that – and they’ve turned it into something else.” “I came to see JD Vance’s heart,” said retiree Patricia Robertson of Las Vegas, calling him “a good guy.” Physicist Wayne Moore of Henderson said he believes the GOP presidential ticket will carry the Silver State for the first time in two decades. “I see a movement that is so strong that I don’t think there’s any way can be overcome,” he told The Post in Nevada. “Now the down ticket is a more concern. But the Trump and JD I think they’re a cinch.” In a marked contrast to most Democratic events in the state, an overflow crowd of hundreds packed out the high school’s cafeteria to hear Vance speak. Trump, 78, did not attend the rally, but his supporters waited in 95 degree heat to get past security checkpoints for the chance to listen to his running mate.","summary":"The Ohio Republican and GOP vice presidential nominee, speaking before a packed gymnasium of several thousands at Liberty High School in Henderson, Nev., argued that Harris, 59, played an outsized role in the current administration because of President Biden’s cognitive decline. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/jd-vance-charges-that-kamala-harris-is-calling-the-shots-in-the-white-house/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2024-henderson-nevada-vance-traveling-86496825.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TPnkuS3r-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:06:55","author":"Mark Kellner,Victor Nava","authors":["Mark Kellner","Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.524},{"id":253005606,"title":"With Trump’s choice of JD Vance, he sent a message to millions in the ‘forgotten class’","text":"When you hear the term “bootlegger” you may think of Burt Reynolds in a Firebird running from the law or Prohibition busts in 1920s speakeasies — not a 15-year-old high-school dropout trying to pay for her own rent and food. That was me, though, helping run whisky to dry counties in Mississippi before I was even old enough to drive. And my background makes me thrilled to see Donald Trump pick someone like Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. By 15, I’d moved over 30 times, often by Greyhound bus. Welfare and food stamps were nearly the only income my mother had ever known. When your only parent struggles with mental illness and in poverty, you grow up quickly. I’d been the primary decision-maker in my home since age 11: If something was going to be decided or someone was going to be tossed out of the trailer, that was on me. The only responsibility that wasn’t mine was choosing the many boyfriends my mom would allow to move in, including drunks, a child molester and a violent drug dealer who beat her many times within an inch of her life — always within earshot of us kids. You never forget the hopelessness and fear of seeing your half-dressed mother chased around a trailer park by her boyfriend with a butcher knife, all while knowing she’ll go back to him — yes, even after this. At 15, I was married and pregnant, and at 16, I welcomed my first child, my sweet Raychel. Staring at that beautiful baby was a defining moment in my life: She deserved better. I didn’t care how long it took, I was going to build a life for this precious gift God had trusted me with. I wish my story were exclusive to me, but unfortunately I’m not alone. Over 46 million Americans are battling substance abuse of some kind, but that number doesn’t account for the millions more impacted by it. Nearly 38 million people live below the poverty line, most with no idea how to get out. Breaking from poverty isn’t easy when it’s all you know and it feels like there is no escape. I found a way out: I got my GED and eventually graduated college and started my own successful business. In 2013, at 44, I was elected to public office for the first time. Most important, I was able to give my children a better life than I had. When Trump chose JD Vance, chills went down my spine — because I knew it sent a message to those from backgrounds like mine that anything is possible, and where they are is not where they need to stay. Trump signaled to Americans across the country exactly who he was paying attention to: the forgotten class. For my entire lifetime, White House wannabes have promised that they would be a president for the common man, a president for the middle class, for the low-income class — but never before has one proved it quite like Donald Trump has. For most with backgrounds like mine, the American dream feels like just that, a mirage, out of our reach. But under Trump’s first presidency, those dreams felt more like reality. We experienced the lowest unemployment of my lifetime, while income rose for nearly every demographic in the country and businesses were helped to thrive. It was a billionaire from New York that became the greatest champion the middle class and working class had ever known in the White House. Today I serve as a state senator in Missouri. Every day I meet with voters who feel forgotten. With his vice-presidential pick, Donald Trump signaled to my constituents and to millions of others, “No more.” In Washington, DC, a town full of career politicians and trust-fund babies, Donald Trump picked the scrappy kid who grew up below the poverty line and created a life for himself and his family, someone who pulled himself out, but didn’t forget where he came from. Come November, we won’t forget it, either.

Vance has hit the campaign trail hard since being selected as Trump’s running mate during the Republican National Convention earlier in July, but his claims that “crazy cat ladies” in the Democratic Party are propping up Harris’s White House bid drew sharp condemnation last week. On Tuesday, at the first of two Nevada rallies, Vance instead opted to go after Harris’s “dangerously liberal” track record, including past statements from her short-lived 2020 presidential campaign, and instead contrast them with his humble upbringing in rural Ohio. “Kamala Harris has broken, I think, that foundational promise that if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to live a good life in this country now. That’s why so many Americans no longer believe that their children will be better off than they are, and I hate to say it, if we elect Kamala Harris, they’re going to be right,” he declared Tuesday. Vance specifically recounted his childhood and being raised by his grandmother Bonnie Blanton Vance, whom he affectionately referred to as “Mamaw.” “I grew up in a family where things were often tight and tough, but I made it because, first of all, this is a great country that provides opportunities to its citizens, and we are grateful for it. Now, I also made it, of course, because I was raised by a tough old bird I called Mamaw,” he continued. “I’m so grateful for all the strong women out there, especially the strong grandmas and the strong moms.” Vance got off to a rocky start as Trump’s top surrogate, but reports and Republican insiders indicate there are no plans for the Republican vice presidential nominee to pull any punches.

In parallel, Brent crude for October delivery fell by 1.24% to $78.07 per barrel. The declines unfolded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange, respectively. They came amidst persistent concerns about weakening global demand and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Interestingly, the market shrugged off recent Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, showing no significant price reaction to the geopolitical flare-up. This highlights a broader market focus, potentially overshadowing supply disruptions with deep-seated worries about global economic health. The upcoming week is pivotal, with key events that could sway the oil markets. Investors are poised for the Federal Reserve’s next move on monetary policy, expected on July 31. Additionally, a crucial OPEC meeting is on the agenda, where production plans will be scrutinized. These events are particularly significant as they could provide fresh cues on the direction of oil prices amid fluctuating market dynamics. Adding to the complexity, recent data revealed an unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories, up by 1.8 million barrels, countering the forecasted 2 million barrel drop. Market Dynamics This inventory swell suggests a possible slackening in demand. This contrasts sharply with the usual pre-Memorial Day increases in refinery demand and gasoline consumption in the U.S. Further complicating the global supply landscape is China’s decision to increase export quotas for its refineries in an effort to reduce domestic oversupply. This move could intensify the existing glut in the Asian markets, thereby exerting additional downward pressure on prices. Market analysts, like Kelvin Wong from Oanda, note the ongoing impact of domestic policy shifts in major economies. For instance, former U.S. President Donald Trump has advocated for reduced inflationary pressures through increased domestic oil and gas production. In addition, these remarks have added layers to the already complex market sentiment. This confluence of rising supplies, tepid demand, and significant geopolitical and economic events paints a complex picture for oil markets. It underscores the critical role these factors play in shaping global energy prices.","summary":"For the third consecutive day, oil markets have been under pressure, ending lower despite geopolitical tensions.

Before Harris took the stage, Grammy-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion, wearing a royal blue pantsuit, performed a handful of her hits, including \"Savage\" and \"Mamushi.\" Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Mayor Andre Dickens, Rep. Nikema Williams and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams also joined Harris at the event. Harris' campaign sees a win in Georgia, a battleground state, as one of her pathways to winning the 2024 election. Mr. Biden very narrowly won the state against former President Donald Trump four years ago — a rare victory in a state that hadn't backed a Democrat for president in nearly three decades. It was Mr. Biden's disastrous debate performance in Atlanta against Trump in June that ultimately led to the end of his reelection campaign.Harris is expected to pick her running mate by Monday, and a top tier of candidates has emerged, CBS News has learned. Harris said earlier Tuesday she has \"not yet\" made a decision about her running mate. Harris and the yet-to-be-named vice presidential candidate will campaign together in battleground states next week, sources familiar with the plans told CBS News. Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, are scheduled to campaign in Atlanta on Saturday.

Speaking at the House of Commons despatch box on Tuesday, David Lammy issued a one-word message to British nationals in the Levantine nation: ‘Leave.’ He confirmed Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had chaired a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday amid tensions in the Middle East. The meeting followed a rocket strike which killed 12 young people on a football field in the mainly Druze town of Majdal Shams. Israel has said the Iranian-backed Hezbollah was responsible for the attack on Saturday evening, but Hezbollah denied a role in the strike. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has warned that thousands of UK nationals risk ‘becoming trapped in a warzone’ if they fail to leave Lebanon Lammy confirmed Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had chaired a Cobra emergency meeting on Tuesday amid tensions in the Middle East. The aftermath of an Israeli airstrike launched on the Lebanese capital tonight in a dramatic bid to eliminate a senior Hezbollah commander Men walk past debris after the top floors of an eight-storey building were destroyed following an Israeli military strike in a Beirut's southern suburb, on July 30, 2024. The Israeli military said it carried out a strike on July 30, in Beirut that targeted a Hezbollah commander responsible for the killing of children in last week's rocket attack on the Golan Heights Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed retaliation against the group when he wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ‘Our response will come, and it will be severe.’ Read More Israel strikes Lebanon as it targets Hezbollah chief behind Golan Heights massacre Israel has since carried out an airstrike on southern Beirut targeting a senior Hezbollah commander. Mr Lammy told MPs: ‘On July 27, Hezbollah launched a series of rockets into northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. ‘Tragically in Majdal Shams, one strike killed at least 12 civilians, young people, one just 10 years old, who were playing football. ‘I extend my deepest sympathies to their families and to the Druze community as they grieve for their loved ones. ‘The Government is unequivocal in condemning this horrific attack and calling on Hezbollah to cease their rocket strikes. This atrocity is a consequence of indiscriminate firing, paying no heed at all to civilian life. At least 11 people, between the ages of 10 and 20, have been killed after a rocket attack on a football field in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Israeli media reports The rocket hit a football field in the Druze town of Majdal Shams, where 11 people were initially reported as wounded (pictured: Medics transporting the injured from the site) Isreali medical staff and forces transporting a casualty form the football pitch to an ambulance ‘This attack is part of an intensifying pattern of fighting around the Israeli-Lebanese border. For months now, we’ve been teetering on the brink. ‘The risk of further escalation and regional destabilisation is now more acute than ever.’ Mr Lammy said he had spoken to the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, in his first week in office, and again on Monday, to express his ‘concern’, and had previously met with Mr Netanyahu. Turning to UK nationals in Lebanon, Mr Lammy said: ‘The Prime Minister chaired a Cobra meeting this morning and I’m working with Foreign Office consular teams to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios, but if this conflict escalates, the Government cannot guarantee we’ll be able to evacuate everyone immediately. ‘People may be forced to shelter in place and history teaches us that in a crisis like this one, it is far safer to leave while commercial flights are still running rather than running the risk of becoming trapped in a warzone. ‘My message, then, to British nationals in Lebanon is therefore quite simple: leave.’ Share or comment on this article: Thousands of UK nationals risk 'becoming trapped' if they fail to leave Lebanon as fears grow of all-out war with Israel after deadly rocket strike, David Lammy warns e-mail Add comment Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search Advertisement DON'T MISS Huw Edwards 'splits from his TV producer wife and moves out of the family home' ahead of court hearing over child porn charges Freddie Flintoff breaks his silence on horror Top Gear crash that 'changed his life forever' in new trailer Celebrity Race Across The World series two line up REVEALED: From Ted Lasso star to a famous father and son duo The toxic truth about who's to blame for tarnishing Strictly for ever: AMANDA PLATELL EXCLUSIVEReese Witherspoon sparks dating rumors with financier Oliver Haarmann: Legally Blonde star heads to dinner with new man What would YOU tell your younger self?

The visit will likely provide a backdrop for Vance to attack presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on border security and immigration. Vance's multi-day tour of the southern border will begin on Thursday in Cochise County, Arizona, according to the Trump campaign. “President Donald J. Trump and Vice Presidential Nominee, Senator JD Vance are devastated to see the path of death and destruction American families are facing because of the radical-Left policies of the current administration,” the campaign said in a press release. “A Trump-Vance Administration will secure our border, begin the largest deportation operation in American history, and restore law and order to our country.” Since Vice President Harris announced her run for the presidency following Joe Biden's decision to step away from the race, Trump's campaign has focused their attacks against her on immigration and border issues. On Tuesday, the campaign released its first attack ad against Harris, which focused on her border security role in the Biden administration. The ad comes a week after House Republicans approved a resolution meant to condemn Harris's actions in that role, according to The Hill. Harris's campaign responded by pointing out that it was Trump who lobbied against a bipartisan, congressional border security bill earlier this year. Republicans — including and especially Trump — have described Harris as Biden's \"border czar,\" but she never held any such title. She was tasked with duties concerning the border — like leading diplomatic efforts to cut down on poverty, violence, and corruption in Central American countries including Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, as well as in Mexico, according to former special representative for border affairs Alan Bersin, who spoke to Reuters. Regardless, Trump doubled down on the framing during a rally in North Carolina last week. \"If border czar Harris stays in charge, every week will bring a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters,\" he claimed. Despite Trump and the Republican's insistence otherwise, Harris was never tasked with the explicit job of securing the southern border. Still, her campaign has insisted she is the only candidate who will look for \"real solutions\" to border security issues. \"There's only one candidate in this race who will fight for real solutions to help secure our nation's border, and that's Vice President Harris,\" Kevin Munoz, Harris's campaign spokesperson, told Reuters. Vance recently admitted that Republicans are struggling to drum up attacks against Harris because she has less “baggage” than Biden. He made the remarks during a donor fundraiser in Golden Valley, Minnesota on Saturday, and a recording, obtained by The Washington Post, revealed his unfiltered thoughts about Harris’s entry into the campaign. “All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,” Vance said. “The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might say, Kamala Harris is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.”","summary":"Republican VP candidate is expected to attack presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris over border security issues during tour","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-trump-border-immigration-b2588507.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/26/17/2163087347.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wWVtQIBs-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:00:48","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":253006390,"title":"FACT FOCUS: Google autocomplete results around Trump lead to claims of election interference","text":"With fewer than 100 days until the 2024 election, social media users are claiming that a lack of Google autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump and his attempted assassination is evidence of election interference. Many posts include screenshots showing what the autocomplete feature, which predicts what users are trying to type, has generated for text such as “attempted assassination of tr” or “president donald.” Among the pictured results for the former phrase are references to other assassination attempts, including that of Harry Truman and Gerald Ford, but nothing for Trump. The latter provides two options — “president donald duck” and “president donald regan.” Multiple high-profile figures, including Trump and sitting members of Congress, promoted the claim across social media platforms, collectively amassing more than 1 million likes and shares by Tuesday. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google attributed the situation to existing protections against autocomplete predictions associated with political violence, noting that “no manual action was taken” to suppress information about Trump. Search engine experts said there are many reasons that could explain why some autocomplete results concerning the former president were not appearing. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Google is engaging in election interference by censoring autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump, including the assassination attempt at his Pennsylvania rally on July 13. THE FACTS: It is true that Google’s autocomplete feature as of Monday was not finishing certain phrases related to Trump and the assassination attempt as shown in screenshots spreading online, but there is no evidence it was related to election interference. By Tuesday, some of the same terms were providing relevant autocomplete results. The text “president donald” now also suggests “Donald Trump” as a search option. Similarly, the phrase “attempted assassination of” includes Trump’s name in autocomplete predictions. Adding “tr” to the same phrase though makes the option disappear. Completed searches about Trump and the assassination attempt done on both Monday and Tuesday yielded extensive relevant results regardless of what autocomplete predictions came up. Google told the AP that its autocomplete feature has automated protections regarding violent topics, including for searches about theoretical assassination attempts. The company further explained that its systems were out of date even prior to July 13, meaning that the protections already in place couldn’t take into account that an actual assassination attempt had occurred. Additional autocomplete results now appearing about Trump are the result of systemic improvements — rather than targeted manual fixes — that will affect many other topics, according to the company. “We’re rolling out improvements to our Autocomplete systems to show more up-to-date predictions,” Google told The Associated Press in a statement. “The issues are beginning to resolve, and we’ll continue to make improvements as needed. As always, predictions change over time and there may be some imperfections. Autocomplete helps save people time, but they can always search for whatever they want, and we will continue to connect them with helpful information.” Search engine experts told the AP that they don’t see evidence of suspicious activities on Google’s part and that there are plenty of other reasons to explain why there have been a lack of autocomplete predictions about Trump. “It’s very plausible that there’s nothing nefarious here, that it’s other systems that are set up for neutral or good purposes that are causing these query suggestions to not show up,” said Michael Ekstrand, an assistant professor at Drexel University who studies AI-powered information access systems. “I don’t have a reason not to believe Google’s claim that this is just normal systems for other purposes, particularly around political violence.” Thorsten Joachims, a professor at Cornell University who researches machine learning for search engines, explained that autocomplete tools typically work by looking at queries people make frequently over a certain period of time, providing the most frequent completions of those queries. Beyond that, a search engine may automatically prune predictions based on concerns such as safety and privacy. This means that it’s plausible that Google’s autocomplete feature wouldn’t have accounted for recent searches about the assassination attempt on Trump, especially if its systems indeed had not been updated since before the shooting. “Depending on how big the window is that they’re averaging over, that may simply not be a frequent query,” Joachims said. “And it may not be a candidate for autocompletion.” He added that it’s typical not to update a search model on a daily basis, given the costs and technical risks involved. A 2020 Google blog post about its autocomplete feature describes how the system reflects previous searches and why users might not see certain predictions, including those that are violent in nature. The post also explains that predictions may vary based on variables such as a user’s location, the language they speak or rising interest in a topic. Both Ekstrand and Joachims agreed that proving bias in a complex system like Google’s search engine from the outside would be extremely difficult. It would require much more data than just a couple of searches, for example, and would risk setting off the company’s protections against data scraping, reverse engineering and fraud. “In general, claims that platforms are taking particular targeted actions against specific people on political bases are hard to substantiate,” Ekstrand said. “They sometimes, I’m sure, happen, but there’s so many other explanations that it’s difficult to substantiate such claims.” Joachims noted that the demographics of Google’s user base could impact the results of such a study if they skewed toward one side of the political aisle or another and therefore searched more for their preferred candidates. In other words, the way the system works would make it difficult to probe the system. Technical issues aside, limiting autocomplete predictions as a method of political influence could simply be bad for business. “Even if Google would like to do that, I think it would be a very bad decision because they could lose a lot of users,” said Ricardo Baeza-Yates, a professor at Northeastern University whose research includes web search and information retrieval. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.

Tim Walz's top competitors for vice president?","text":"There's little doubt at this point that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is in the mix as Vice President Kamala Harris gets ready to select a running mate. The Harris campaign hasn't confirmed anything publicly, but national media reports are consistently putting Walz in a select group of serious prospects under consideration. He's been acting ready for his closeup, managing to generate some viral fame with recent interview quips that former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, are \"weird\" — a message that Democrats across the board quickly ran with. While certainly a well-known political quantity on the home front — Walz quickly picked up support from a roster of prominent Minnesota Democrats — the governor's sudden ascent took non-Minnesotans on social media by surprise. \"Where has this guy been\" has been a frequent question in recent days. Despite the buzz, Walz faces stiff competition for the VP nod. One possible consideration: As the governor of a state that hasn't gone Republican for president since 1972, Walz isn't ideally positioned to deliver a key state for Harris. From a former astronaut to the solidly popular governors of a swing state and a red state, here are the other likeliest contenders, based on reporting in the national political media. Sen. Mark Kelly, Arizona A former astronaut, Kelly won a special election in 2020 to finish the late Sen. John McCain's Senate term. He won a full term in 2022. Kelly is seen as a moderate voice in the Senate, where he represents a state that long leaned toward Republicans but has gained a purplish hue in recent years. But his departure from the Senate could also imperil Democrats' ultra-thin majority in that chamber. Gov. Andy Beshear, Kentucky Beshear won a close race to oust Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in 2019. He sailed to re-election in 2023, beating his challenger by nearly 5 percentage points to take a second term, in a state that usually goes strongly for Republicans on the statewide level. With Harris poised to make abortion access an important part of her campaign message, some Democrats are wondering whether Beshear would be best positioned to amplify that. Gov. Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania Shapiro was elected to lead the crucial swing state in 2022, beating his Republican opponent by more than 14 percentage points. He won the endorsement of several former GOP officials, including two former congressmen and a former state House speaker. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016, after the state gave Democrats its 19 electoral votes in six consecutive elections. Politico is reporting that Shapiro's position on natural gas extraction, which helped him secure vital labor backing in Pennsylvania, could also help explain Harris' recent shift on the issue. Pete Buttigieg, transportation secretary \"Mayor Pete\" has come a long way from the 2020 Democratic primaries. President Joe Biden tapped Buttigieg to be his transportation secretary and a go-to spokesman for the administration's policies. He has traveled the country touting the massive infrastructure bill that Congress passed in 2023. Buttigieg, 42, could also position himself as a rival to Vance, 39. But the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., lacks the statewide political success of his major rivals.","summary":"Besides Minnesota's governor, Vice President Kamala Harris is said to be considering Mark Kelly, Josh Shapiro and Andy Beshear, among others, as her running mate.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/who-are-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-s-top-competitors-for-vice-president/600387771/","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/BU7S3EHRQBHRNNAZUIU3D5NCH4.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 21:57:57","author":"Eder Campuzano,Star Tribune","authors":["Eder Campuzano","Star Tribune"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.162},{"id":253006148,"title":"FACT FOCUS: Google autocomplete results around Trump lead to claims of election interference","text":"By MELISSA GOLDIN With fewer than 100 days until the 2024 election, social media users are claiming that a lack of Google autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump and his attempted assassination is evidence of election interference.
