Modi “clearly conveyed” to Trump that he did not play a role in the ceasefire during a recent phone call, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on Tuesday. Instead, Modi says the ceasefire was achieved through direct talks with Pakistan.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has pined over the Nobel Peace Prize, which is awarded to a “person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”\n\nTrump has appeared frustrated that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, received the award in 2009, less than a year into his first term. Obama received the award for his “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,” and particularly his “vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.”\n\nLast year, Trump claimed that if he “were named Obama,” he would’ve “had the Nobel Prize given to me in 10 seconds.” \n\nJohn Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser who has since become a vocal opponent of the Republican, once told The New York Times that the “center of his public life is the greater glory of Donald Trump, and the Nobel Peace Prize would be a nice thing to hang on the wall.”","summary":"Trump said he plans to decide whether the U.S. will attack Iran within the next two weeks","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-nobel-peace-prize-iran-b2774265.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/19/17/33/U-S--President-Donald-Trump-meets-with-players-of-the-Juventus-soccer-team-at-the-White-House-in-Was.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1a8QccJt-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-21 01:07:22","author":null},{"id":333607102,"title":"Wall Street mixed with Trump’s ME decision in focus","text":"NEW YORK: Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed in choppy trading on Friday, as inflation concerns and uncertainty around US involvement in the Iran-Israel war offset relief over President Donald Trump holding back from any immediate action. \n\nTrump will take a call in the next two weeks on whether to involve the US military in the conflict, the White House said on Thursday, as hostilities between the two Middle Eastern countries approached their second week.

Islamabad Officially Nominates Trump For Nobel","text":"The government of Pakistan has officially nominated US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, recognising his “decisive diplomatic engagement and leadership” during the 2025 India-Pakistan crisis. Islamabad credits Trump’s intervention with averting a potentially catastrophic conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations.\nThis recommendation was released on Friday, June 20, 2025, following a period of intense cross-border hostilities between India and Pakistan in May 2025.\nAccording to Pakistan’s statement, the crisis began with what it described as “unprovoked and unlawful” Indian aggression that violated Pakistani sovereignty and led to civilian casualties. In response, Pakistan launched “Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos”, which was characterised as a measured military action to re-establish deterrence. The statement claims that as tensions escalated, it was President Trump’s back-channel diplomacy and strategic foresight that facilitated a ceasefire agreement on May 10, preventing a broader war. Pakistan’s government praised Trump’s efforts as a watershed moment for regional peace, underscoring his role as a genuine peacemaker.\nThe nomination follows a rare meeting between US President Donald Trump and Pakistan’s army chief, General Asim Munir, at the White House on Wednesday, June 18. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly confirmed that the President hosted Munir following the latter’s advocacy for Trump’s Nobel nomination, crediting him with averting a nuclear confrontation. During this meeting, Trump claimed credit for stopping the war between India and Pakistan, stating, “They were going at it; they are both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.”\nIndia has consistently denied any US role in de-escalating the tensions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a phone call with President Trump on Tuesday, June 17, clarified that the ceasefire was achieved through direct communication channels between the Indian and Pakistani militaries, without any external mediation. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri reiterated India’s stance, emphasising that New Delhi has never accepted and will never accept third-party mediation in its relations with Pakistan.\nThe crisis was triggered by the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, to which India responded with retaliatory strikes on terror establishments in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as part of “Operation Sindoor”.","summary":"Pakistan credits the US President's intervention with averting a potentially catastrophic conflict with India.

Citing concerns over US trade deficits, he also imposed double-digit tariffs on imports from many other Asian nations.\nCountry-specific “Liberation Day” tariffs were put on hold for 90 days the following week – until July 9 for most countries – pending trade negotiations. Following talks in Switzerland in early May, those on China were also paused for 90 days, until August 12.\nBeijing’s negotiators would draw strength from the US threat to notify trading partners of new duties and the lack of a US-Japan deal because both showed it was hard for Washington to get what it wanted through talks this summer, said Chen Zhiwu, chair professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong.\n“These kinds of threats should embolden the Chinese negotiators because it’s a sign of desperation,” Chen said.\nThreats of letters that would unilaterally announce recalibrated tariffs on target countries and the lack of a Japan deal meant the US had “not gained much ground” in negotiations around the world, he added.\nOn the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada on Monday, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba made “little headway in bridging gaps over tariffs”, Kyodo News reported.\nTrump told reporters last week that Washington would send other countries letters that establish new US tariff rates despite ongoing negotiations with 17 major trading partners.\nThe sheer number of tariff deals being sought was “creating capacity constraints for US trade negotiators” as the 90-day pauses wound down, said Rajiv Biswas, CEO of the Asia-Pacific Economics research group in Singapore.\nThe UK deal – Trump’s first since April 2 – obliges the UK to lower certain non-tariff barriers on US goods and holds out the prospect that British exports of steel and aluminium could be exempted from US tariffs, pending further talks. The UK was exempted from a doubling of US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 50 per cent early this month.\nWhat [China] should take away is that nothing is certain with this Trump administration\nJayant Menon, ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute\nAnalysts have described the UK deal content as thin, with the Brookings think tank calling it “less a done deal than a first instalment in ongoing negotiations”.\nUnilateral changes in US tariff rates would show that the 90-day negotiation periods allowed too little time for deal making, said Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\n“What [China] should take away is that nothing is certain with this Trump administration, but the question is what do you do with that?” Menon said.\n“The takeaway from this is be careful what you offer. Maybe you offer things superficially, but don’t take the negotiations too seriously. Pander to him, pretend you’re conceding, but prepare for a third round.”\nChina already saw its readiness to outlast the US in talks as a “bargaining chip”, even if it had to “eat bitterness” along the way, said Liang Yan, a professor of economics at Willamette University in the US.\nAnalysts said China could afford to wait past the August 12 cut-off date, especially after a tariff rate cut was agreed to in talks with a US delegation in London earlier this month.\nChinese negotiators might capitalise on perceived US weakness by pushing for a further pause in tariffs, pending more talks, in exchange for renewed exports of Chinese rare earth metals to the US, Biswas said. China controls most of the world’s rare earth production, and restrictions it imposed on exports sparked concerns among American carmakers and technology manufacturers.\nThe US Federal Reserve lowered its 2025 growth forecast for the American economy to 1.4 per cent on Wednesday, down from a prediction of 1.7 per cent in March, and raised its unemployment projection to 4.5 per cent from 4.4 per cent.\nBut over time – no matter who was in the White House – China would face steady pressure from the US, cautioned Stephen Nagy, a visiting fellow with the Japan Institute for International Affairs think tank in Tokyo, who said Washington does not, overall, view Beijing as a partner.\n“Beijing is concerned about the US’ current tariff and overall policies towards China and they know that even if Trump disappeared tomorrow that the competition between Washington and Beijing is a structural one that will be with us for decades to come,” Nagy said.","summary":"The United States failed this week to reach a tariff deal with Japan, a key Pacific Rim ally, and has threatened to notify multiple countries of new duty rates on imports after talks with only one, the United Kingdom, have shown any results.\nThose developments, which made the US look weak in the short term, should prompt China to take a harder line with Washington on reaching a deal, analysts said.\nChina, the world’s second-largest economy, was hit especially hard by US President Donald Trump on...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3315199/trump-struggles-secure-trade-deals-has-beijings-hand-been-strengthened","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/06/20/de7b2b9d-1dc2-43d5-9a3d-0aa3d192d240_380f94db.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 01:00:16","author":"Ralph Jennings","authors":["Ralph Jennings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":333605458,"title":"Trump turns against Fox News after shock poll and singles out anchor Jessica Tarlov for 'soiling' evening broadcast","text":"Donald Trump continued his recent feud with Fox News, saying liberal commentator Jessica Tarlov's appearances are what 'make MAGA absolutely hate' the network. \n\nTrump posted to Truth Social Friday: 'Why does Fox News allow failed TV personality Jessica Tarlov to 'soil' The Five? Her voice, her manner, and above all else, what she says, are a disgrace to television broadcasting.'\n\nThe president appears to be reacting to Tarlov - the most consistent Trump-hating voice on the show and network - discussing negative polling numbers on Friday's show. \n\n'I've had the best poll numbers that I've ever had, and she is constantly saying the exact opposite. The just out highly respected Rasmussen Poll is at 56%, Insider Advantage 54%, and many others are at 56% to 68%! Sadly, the audience has to listen to her spew off that I am doing poorly in the polls, while I am beating the democrats by 15%+ points and, more importantly, I just won an election against two candidates, Sleepy Joe and Kamala, in a Landslide by winning all 7 Swing States, and the Popular Vote by millions, with records broken everywhere!'\n\nTrump still stood by commentators Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, saying the pair are 'terrific' but that they 'don't see all of these poll numbers and can't, therefore come to my defense. But I can!'\n\nHe continued: 'Nobody can stand Tarlov! She lies over and over again, and MAGA is complaining, BIG LEAGUE, that she's all over Fox. Watch their ratings go down by keeping her on the show — nobody wants to listen to her. Why doesn't she talk about the fact that I had ZERO illegal aliens come into our Country last month, whereas Sleepy Joe Biden allowed 62,000 people in, many from prisons, mental institutions, and gangs.'\n\nThe president finished by writing that 'people like Jessica Tarlov make MAGA absolutely hate Fox!'\n\nTarlov was citing polls that had Trump in the red with both independents and overall voters on key issues. \n\n'When we say the people don't like this, they don't like it. That doesn't mean that Democrats aren't still unpopular. That doesn't mean I don't know if the election was held again today Donald Trump might very well win again if it was.'\n\nHowever, she said that 'directionally' the polling numbers are going against the president.\n\nHis comments Friday come after Trump went on a tear Thursday morning after a new Fox News Channel poll showed Americans split on the Republican's immigration policy. \n\n'The Crooked FoxNews Polls got the Election WRONG, I won by much more than they said I would, and have been biased against me for years. They are always wrong and negative,' Trump posted to Truth Social. \n\n'It's why MAGA HATES FoxNews, even though their anchors are GREAT,' Trump fumed. 'This has gone on for years, but they never change the incompetent polling company that does their work.' \n\nHe then pointed to the latest survey. \n\nThe poll, which was released Wednesday, showed Trump with a 46 percent approval rating overall, with another 54 percent disapproving of the job he's done so far. \n\nHis numbers on 'border security' were better - with 53 percent approving and 46 percent disapproving. \n\nWhen voters were asked about 'immigration' his numbers were lower again. \n\nForty-six percent said they approved and 53 percent said they disapproved. \n\nHis lowest numbers were actually on the topic of 'inflation,' with 64 percent disapproving of Trump's handling of this top economic issue, and just 34 percent approving.\n\nStill, he took offense at how he was being rated on the border. \n\n'Now a FoxNews poll comes out this morning giving me a little more than 50% at the Border, and yet the Border is miraculously perfect, NOBODY WAS ABLE TO COME IN LAST MONTH,' he wrote. '60,000 people came in with Sleepy Joe in the same month last year.'\n\n'I hate FAKE pollsters, one of the Worst, but Fox will never change their discredited pollster!' the president complained. \n\nThe outburst came Thursday morning as the world continued to wait and see whether the United States would join Israel in its current bombing campaign against Iran. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday night that Trump had signed off on an attack plan for Iran but the president had yet to issue a final order. \n\nOvernight Thursday the U.S. did not get involved in the week-long war between Israel and Iran. \n\n'The Wall Street Journal has No Idea what my thoughts are concerning Iran!' also wrote on Truth Social Thursday morning. \n\nThe president also slammed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell - who he appointed - after the Fed decided Wednesday not to push interest rates down as Trump has demanded. \n\n'\"Too Late\" Jerome Powell is costing our Country Hundreds of Billions of Dollars. He is truly one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government, and the Fed Board is complicit,' Trump wrote. \n\n'Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had none,' he continued. 'We should be 2.5 Points lower, and save $BILLIONS on all of Biden’s Short Term Debt.' \n\n'We have LOW inflation! TOO LATE's an American Disgrace!' Trump wrote. \n\nOverall on the economy, the Fox News poll found that 40 percent of registered voters approved of the job Trump was doing, while 58 percent disapproved.","summary":"The reacted to Tarlov - the most consistent Trump-hating voice on the show and network - discussing negative polling numbers on Friday's show.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14833683/Trump-fox-news-poll-Jessica-tarlov-broadcast.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/21/01/99586563-0-image-m-13_1750466542695.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 00:54:07","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Smith has thrown his support behind Elon Musk after the X boss called for a radical change to American politics amid his ongoing feud with Donald Trump.\n\nMusk set the internet ablaze Thursday after tearing into Trump on his social-media platform, where he claimed the president should be impeached and that his tariff policy will send the United States into recession.\n\nAnd in an astonishing post which has been seen by almost 180 million people at the time of writing, the SpaceX CEO even accused his former ally of being in the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nBefore making that wild allegation, Musk – who was Trump’s most famous supporter in last year’s election – also created a poll on X which asked his near-221 million followers: ‘Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?’\n\nOne person on board with that proposal is Smith, who has told the billionaire he is fully behind the idea of a central political party in America.\n\n‘Mr. @elonmusk I’m all for moving America to the CENTER,’ the ESPN personality responded to his post on X. ‘I’m definitely down for that cause! Sign me up!!!’\n\nEarlier this year Smith emerged as a shock presidential candidate for the future when a national survey revealed that he would receive more support than several high-profile Democrat hopefuls at the 2028 election.\n\nThe sports media star has since flirted with the possibility of running for president in three years’ time, telling DailyMail.com back in February that he would only consider doing so if the American people demanded it.\n\n‘I will confess, like I said, I have no desire to do this, but assuming that I’m well off, that I have lots of money, and money is no longer a concern, if the American people came to me and looked at me and said “Yo, man, we want you to run for office”, and I had a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States, I’m not gonna lie. I’ll think about that,’ he said.\n\n‘But I gotta have my money. I’m not gonna go to the White House broke. I’m not gonna do that. I gotta have my money.\n\n‘I gotta have my home. I gotta have my financial situation completely taken care of. I have no concerns if that happens for me.’\n\nYet two months later, Smith took a firmer stance when he said he is now genuinely considering running for president after being approached by ‘elected officials’ over a shot at the White House.\n\nThe 57-year-old first tweeted a link to a Barrett Media article where he revealed he is walking back on his claims he would never run for office.\n\n‘Time to stop messing around,’ he wrote on X. ‘Life is great. Especially at ESPN/Disney. Hate the thought of being a politician. But sick of this mess. So I’m officially leaving all doors open.’\n\nIn the Barrett Media article, Smith said: ‘Over the last few weeks, I’ve had no choice but to get more serious about it.\n\n‘I’ve been approached by people on Capitol Hill. I’ve been approached by people who are elected officials in office, whether it’s governors or mayors or what have you. People have legitimately, seriously, asked me about it. \n\n‘I have no desire to be a politician, but I’ve decided that I’m no longer going to close that door. I’m gonna keep my options open. I’m going to entertain the possibility. \n\n‘If it comes in late 2026, 2027, where I look at this country and think it’s an absolute mess and there’s legitimate reason to believe … that I indeed have a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States. I am not going to rule it out.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nStephen A. Smith has thrown his support behind Elon Musk after the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Stephen A.

Speaking at an event in Bhubaneswar, where he inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of several development projects, the Prime Minister hailed the completion of one year of the first-ever BJP government in Odisha. He called it not just a political milestone, but \"an anniversary of good governance and public trust.\" Also Read | Weather Forecast Today, June 21: Check Weather Updates, Heatwave Warning, Rain Predictions for Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Shimla and Kolkata.\n\"At a time when Odisha's BJP government is completing one year, the people of Odisha are preparing for the Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra. He is our 'prerna' inspiration and 'aaradhya' worship,\" PM Modi said. \"Just two days ago, I was in Canada for the G7 summit. During that time, US President Donald Trump called me and invited me with great insistence. I told the President of America, Thank you for the invitation, but it is important for me to go to the land of the Lord. So I politely declined his invitation.

PM Modi remarked that June 20 is a very special day, marking the completion of one year of Odisha's first BJP government. \"This anniversary is not merely that of a government, but of the establishment of good governance devoted to public service and public trust\", said the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister also launched a blistering attack on the Congress, blaming it for decades of \"developmental neglect, corruption, and misgovernance.\" \"After Independence, for decades, the people of the country saw the development model of the Congress party. Under their rule, there was no good governance, nor the people were happy. The development models of the Congress included latkana, bhatkana, ghangor corruption (stalling, misguiding and massive corruption),\" he said. Praising the BJP's governance, he said, \"In the past years, in several states across the country, the BJP formed governments for the first time, ushering in not just a change of leadership but also the beginning of a new era of social and economic transformation.\"\n\"A decade ago, Assam faced significant challenges, including instability, separatist movements, and widespread violence. However, today, the state is firmly on the path to development. Decades of terrorist activities have come to an end, marking a strong step towards progress and stability,\" he added.\nPM Modi lauded the health reforms in the state, citing the implementation of both the Centre's Ayushman Bharat and the state-run Gopabandhu Jan Arogya Yojana, now covering nearly 3 crore people with free medical care.\nHe also highlighted BJP's success in curbing Naxalism and integrating tribal communities into the mainstream of development.\n\"For a long time, lakhs of poor families in Odisha were out of the Ayushman scheme. Today, both the Ayushman Bharat Jan Arogya Yojana of the Central Government and the Gopabandhu Jan Arogya Yojana of the State Government are running here. Due to which around 3 crore people here are sure to get the benefit of free treatment,\" he said.\n\"Before 2014, more than 125 tribal districts of the country were in the grip of Naxalite violence. In the past years, we have worked to take the tribal society out of violence and put it on a new path of development,\" he added.\nAdding further, he said, \"A very large number of tribal community lives in Odisha, but unfortunately in the past they have only got neglected. The party which ruled the country for a long time used the tribals for its politics. These people neither gave development nor participation to the tribal society. These people pushed a large part of the country into the fire of Naxalism, violence and oppression.\"\nPrime Minister Modi said that the BJP government has taken firm and decisive action against those involved in violence and has prioritized the development of tribal regions.\n\"With the current pace of efforts to combat this issue, the tribal community is on the path to being completely free from the grip of Naxalism. Naxalism will be eliminated, and it's a Modi's guarantee!\" he added.

I'm sure the money is going to be allocated in the right way. I'm happy to hear that the Dodgers have done that, and it´s certainly the right thing to do.' \n\nRoberts claimed his players haven't extensively discussed the situation in the clubhouse, but some Dodgers have been paying attention.\n\nKike Hernandez, a Puerto Rico native, sharply criticized the raids on social media last weekend.\n\nBaseball Hall of Famer Jaime Jarrin, the Dodgers' lead Spanish-language broadcaster from 1959 until his retirement in 2022, also spoke up against the federal actions.\n\nA number of ICE agents were spotted descending on Dodger Stadium just after 10am local time \n\nFederal agents tried to enter the stadium's parking lot but were denied entry to the grounds\n\nPhotographs captured at the ballpark showed several masked agents staged near Gate E\n\nLos Angeles mayor Karen Bass praised the Dodgers in the team's news release. \n\n'I want to thank the Dodgers for leading with this action to support the immigrant community of Los Angeles,' Bass said.\n\n'These last weeks have sent shockwaves of fear rippling through every neighborhood and have had a direct impact on our economy. My message to all Angelenos is clear: We will stick together during this time and we will not turn our backs on one another - that´s what makes this the greatest city in the world.'\n\nFans and lawmakers have called upon the Dodgers for several days to make an unequivocal statement of opposition to the raids, given their vast Latino fan base and heavy influence in the region.\n\nOther teams in the region have expressed their solidarity with the immigrant community, including Los Angeles FC and Angel City FC.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who represents the Los Angeles area, went on social media earlier Friday to ask the Dodgers to speak up.\n\n'In a city where 36 per cent of the residents are immigrants and nearly 40 per cent of the team's fan base is Latino, saying nothing is not just disappointing - it's a betrayal and an insult,' Gomez wrote. 'Silence is not an option. It's a choice.'\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nLos Angeles Dodgers turn on Donald Trump just months after cozying up to him at the White House\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Back in April, the reigning World Series champions cozied up to Donald Trump during a ceremony to mark their success at the White House.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mlb/article-14833525/Los-Angeles-Dodgers-Donald-Trump-ICE.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/21/01/99586729-0-image-m-39_1750464775981.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 00:32:29","author":"Editor,Max Winters","authors":["Editor","Max Winters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":333603706,"title":"Oil prices slip after US sanctions Iran","text":"HOUSTON: Oil prices slipped on Friday as the US imposed new Iran-related sanctions marking a diplomatic approach that fed hopes of a negotiated agreement, a day after President Donald Trump said he might take two weeks to decide US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\nBrent crude futures were down $2.23, or 2.8 per cent, to $76.62 a barrel by 12:14pm EDT.

There are some disclosure and partial interest sales that could complicate the overall take-home pay from the venture. \n\nBut at just 19 years old, he appears to have earned far more than his older siblings did at the same age — thanks to a digital gold rush that’s become the centerpiece of the Trump family’s modern empire. \n\nThe college student may have raked in $25 million after taxes while his father returned to the White House, according to Forbes. \n\nBarron, who reportedly introduced his father to the concept of digital wallets, has been credited by Trump as the family’s crypto brain.\n\n‘Barron’s a young guy, but he knows it — he talks about his wallet,” Trump said in a previous interview.\n\n‘He’s got four wallets or something, and I’m saying, “What is a wallet?”‘\n\nPresident Trump is also making a healthy sum, too. \n\nA newly released 234-page financial disclosure revealed the President raked in more than $57 million last year from cryptocurrency ventures.\n\nTrump himself owns a 52.5 percent stake in the company, per his disclosure. \n\nHe also made millions off retail offerings, like gold-plated shoes, high-end watches, collectible coffee table books, and electric guitars. \n\nBut the cryptocurrency is ruffling the feathers of White House watchdogs. \n\nInvestments in the currency are shielded from public view, making skeptics nervous about potential foreign investment or unseen lobbying via trades in the Trump-branded coin. \n\nIn May, the President hosted a lavish dinner with some of the biggest investors in his crypto empire. \n\nThe White House has long argued that President Trump remains walled off from political corruption because he ceded financial power of his profit-making organizations to his sons. \n\nBut that argument also came after President Trump railed against the Biden administration for allowing the former President’s son, Hunter, 55, to allegedly profit from his closeness to the White House. \n\n‘Ultimately, no matter what it is, I always put the country way ahead of the business,’ President Trump said, adding ‘You can’t say that about Hunter.’ \n\nWorld Liberty Financial didn’t immediately respond to DailyMail.com’s request for comment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBarron Trump just completed his freshman year of university.  Within just a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Astonishing Amount Barron Trump Has Earned by Age 19 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/astonishing-amount-barron-trump-has-earned-by-age-19/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Utterly-staggering-sum-Barron-Trump-has-already-made-at-19.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 00:25:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.146},{"id":333600320,"title":"Iran hanya ada 'maksimum' dua minggu, tolak usaha damai Eropah -Trump","text":"BAITULMAQDIS: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, berkata Iran hanya mempunyai tempoh 'maksimum' dua minggu untuk mengelak kemungkinan serangan udara AS. \n\nKenyataan terkini Trump menunjukkan beliau mungkin membuat keputusan sebelum berakhir tempoh dua minggu tambahan untuk usaha diplomatik seperti dilapor sebelum ini.\n\nTrump turut menolak usaha Eropah untuk menghentikan konflik dan berkata ia adalah 'sangat sukar' untuk meminta Israel menghentikan serangannya.\n\nSatu siri letupan dikesan di Tehran semalam apabila Israel meneruskan gelombang serangan besar-besaran yang menurut mereka bertujuan menghentikan Iran daripada membangunkan senjata nuklear – satu hasrat yang dinafikan pihak Tehran.\n\n\"Menurut penilaian yang kami terima, kami sudah menunda sekurang-kurangnya dua atau tiga tahun kemungkinan mereka memiliki bom nuklear,\" kata Menteri Luar Israel, Gideon Saar, dalam satu temubual yang diterbitkan pada Sabtu.\n\nSaar berkata serangan yang sudah berlangsung seminggu itu akan berterusan. \n\n\"Kami akan melakukan segala yang kami mampu di situ bagi menghapuskan ancaman ini,\" ujarnya dalam satu temubual dengan akhbar Jerman, Bild.\n\nSementara Trump mempertimbangkan kemungkinan menyertai perang di pihak Israel, diplomat kanan Britain, Perancis dan Jerman mengadakan pertemuan dengan rakan sejawat Iran, Abbas Araghchi, di Geneva, dan mendesaknya menyambung semula rundingan dengan AS yang tergendala akibat serangan Israel.\n\nMenteri Luar Perancis, Jean-Noel Barrot, berkata pihaknya menjemput menteri Iran supaya mempertimbangkan rundingan dengan semua pihak, termasuk AS tanpa menunggu pemberhentian serangan, seperti mana yang diharapkan.\n\nNamun Araghchi memberitahu NBC News selepas pertemuan itu bahawa pihaknya tidak bersedia untuk berunding dengan AS lagi, selagi pencerobohan itu diteruskan.\n\nTrump memandang rendah usaha Eropah dan memberitahu wartawan bahawa Iran tidak mahu berkomunikasi dengan Eropah. \n\n\"Mereka mahu bercakap dengan kami.

Gavin Newsom did not receive advance warning of the visit from Vance, his office said on Friday.The vice president's visit comes amid protests over deportation raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and over the federal response to those protests, which saw President Trump deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines.A federal appeals court on Friday allowed President Donald Trump to retain control of those National Guard troops, halting a ruling from a lower court judge who found President Trump acted illegally by activating the soldiers and who had issued a temporary restraining order.The deployment was the first by a president of a state National Guard without the governor’s permission since 1965. President Trump argued the troops were necessary to restore order, but Gov. Gavin Newsom said the move inflamed tensions and usurped local authority.U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer has now asked for briefings from both parties in the case over whether deployment of the National Guard violates the Posse Comitiatus Act.Meanwhile, tensions remain high in parts of Los Angeles.On Thursday, agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were turned away after they tried to enter the Los Angeles Dodgers' stadium grounds, the team said in a social media post.Images published Thursday showed ICE personnel congregating in a parking lot just outside the Dodgers' property.

The treaty is aimed at ending one of Africa’s deadliest and longest-running conflicts and is due to be formally signed in Washington on June 27. “I am very happy to report that I have arranged, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a wonderful Treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of Rwanda, in their War, which was known for violent bloodshed and death, more so even than most other Wars,” Trump wrote. “This is a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World!” The announcement follows three days of closed-door talks in Washington between representatives of the two nations. The conflict is centred in the mineral-rich eastern provinces of the DRC and has claimed over six million lives over the past three decades. The turmoil is fuelled by competition for control over valuable resources such as coltan, cobalt, lithium, and gold. The peace deal was initiated at the invitation of DRC President Félix Tshisekedi, who requested Trump’s administration to step in after multiple failed attempts at reconciliation, reports CBS News. According to the US State Department, the agreement includes commitments to halt hostilities, respect territorial boundaries, disarm rebel groups, facilitate the return of displaced persons, and integrate local economies. 'Transactional diplomacy' While many welcome the potential end to hostilities, analysts remain cautious. Daniel Van Dalen, a senior analyst at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused intelligence firm, noted that the deal marks a shift in American strategy on the continent. “The days of diplomatic soft power are over,” he said. “This is transactional diplomacy at work.” One major concern is the M23 militia, which controls parts of eastern DRC but was not part of the peace talks. The group is believed to be supported by Rwanda, although Rwandan officials have always denied this. M23 has recently taken over areas in two provinces. “The M23 are still pushing, in spite of peace negotiations, for territorial gains,” Van Dalen warned. Sources told CBS News that Rwanda may agree to withdraw troops believed to be supporting M23 fighters, while the DRC might allow small-scale mining in its territory to be routed through Rwanda. However, without M23’s direct involvement or commitment, observers worry that the conflict may simply continue under new terms. Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law appointed as senior adviser to the White House Amid the negotiations, Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law, Massad Boulous, was appointed as a senior adviser to the White House on Africa. He travelled across the region to meet with leaders and promote US business ties, especially in mining. The Trump administration is reportedly looking to re-establish American interests in Africa’s critical mineral supply chain, where Chinese firms currently dominate. The DRC has begun revisiting mining tax laws to make the country more appealing to Western investment. The US has already committed substantial funding to infrastructure, including $560 million towards the Lobito Corridor, a rail project that connects the DRC’s copper belt to an Angolan port, offering a vital trade route. 'I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this': Trump Even though some people doubt whether the treaty will really work, Trump used the moment to point out what he sees as his ignored efforts to bring peace around the world. “I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this… but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!” he said on Truth Social, also referencing previous efforts to resolve conflicts between India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia, as well as the Abraham Accords in the Middle East.","summary":"Donald Trump announced a peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, brokered with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, aiming to end a long-standing conflict.

According to Araghchi, Iran was ready to consider diplomacy only if Israel's \"aggression is stopped.\" \"I make it crystal clear that Iran's defence capabilities are non-negotiable,\" the Iranian foreign minister stressed after the Geneva talks.He expressed support for “a continuation of discussions with the E3 and the EU and expressed his readiness to meet again in the near future.” He also denounced Israel’s attacks against nuclear facilities in Iran and expressed “grave concern” about what he called “non-condemnation” by European nations.For his part, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy urged Tehran to continue its talks with the United States. Lammy said, “We are keen to continue ongoing discussions and negotiations with Iran, and we urge Iran to continue their talks with the United States.” He added that “we were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”He added there is “a window of within two weeks where we can see a diplomatic solution” and urged Iran “to take that off-ramp.”Trump delays decisionMeanwhile, it remains unclear how that will happen as US President Donald Trump continues to weigh whether to attack Iran by striking its well-defended Fordo uranium enrichment facility, which is buried under a mountain and widely considered to be out of reach of all but America’s “bunker-buster” bombs. Trump said on Wednesday that he’ll decide within two weeks whether the US military will get directly involved in the war, given the “substantial chance” for renewed negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program.Israel says it launched its airstrike campaign to stop Iran from getting closer to being able to build a nuclear weapon. Iran and the United States had been negotiating over the possibility of a new diplomatic deal over Tehran’s programme, though Trump has said Israel’s campaign came after a 60-day window he set for the talks.'We are entitled … to defend our territorial integrity' - IranIn light of the possibility of US involvement, Iran’s supreme leader rejected Trump's calls for surrender Wednesday and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage to them.”Just before meeting the European diplomats on Friday, Foreign Minister Araghchi made a brief appearance before the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, telling the council that Israel’s “attacks on nuclear facilities are grave war crimes”.Araghchi insisted that Iran is \"entitled … and determined to defend our territorial integrity, national sovereignty, and security with all force.”Tehran has long insisted its nuclear programme is peaceful, though it was the only non-nuclear-armed state to enrich uranium up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.The initial 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers was negotiated in large part by the three European nations. However, Iran has been found wanting in its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, leading to warnings by the EU states to reimpose sanctions that were suspended under the agreement.","summary":"It was the first face-to-face meeting between Western and Iranian officials since the war began after Israel attacked Iran last week Friday over Tehran's nuclear programme.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/06/21/top-eu-diplomats-meeting-with-iran-over-tehrans-conflict-with-israel-yields-hope-of-more-t","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/33/76/44/1440x810_cmsv2_ffb5d01c-1b75-5f0f-89e4-477277a4a98a-9337644.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 00:11:15","author":"Jerry Fisayo-Bambi","authors":["Jerry Fisayo-Bambi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":333604736,"title":"World News | Columbia Protester Mahmoud Khalil Freed from Immigration Detention","text":"Jena (US), Jun 21 (AP) Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was released Friday from federal immigration detention, freed by a judge's ruling after becoming a symbol of President Donald Trump's clampdown on campus protests.

But lurking behind the scenes, an unspoken political figure cast a shadow that couldn’t be ignored: U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Business Focus of Conecta\n\nForefronted by industry stalwarts such as Warner Bros. Discovery, The Walt Disney Co., and France’s Gaumont Television, Conecta 2025 was a beacon for the future of entertainment. Deliberations at the conference centered on groundbreaking content and strategic production plans, aiming to solidify the European identity in a globalized market. Yet, as the halls of the conference bustled with enthusiasm, whispers of potential policy shifts a world away began to seep through.\n\nTrump’s Unseen Presence\n\nEven in absence, Trump’s potential policy changes became a silent participant in Cuenca. One conference session delved into diversity and inclusion, a heated topic due to Trump’s previous stands. The discussion, launched by Marina Mathieu from Coalition M.E.D.I.A., underscored the importance of maintaining these values amidst international tensions.\n\nThe French Fortitude\n\nGaumont’s Isabelle Degeorges lauded France’s regulatory practices that safeguard European cultural production. However, she acknowledged the looming uncertainty: “We will always fight for this… especially with this new administration in the U.S., because they don’t care.” Her words resonated with a determination to protect France’s cultural gems, even from transatlantic threats.\n\nInternational Concerns on Production Tariffs\n\nPortugal and Spain’s film commissions cautiously addressed the potential repercussions of Trump’s America-First rhetoric.

She said it was part of a “long overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy”.\n\n“For decades, American taxpayers have been forced to bankroll an agency that’s been riddled with dysfunction, bias and waste,” Lake said in a news release. “That ends now.”\n\nVOA began by broadcasting stories about US democracy to residents of Nazi Germany, and grew to deliver news around the world in dozens of languages, often in countries without a tradition of free press.\n\nBut President Donald Trump has fought against the news media on several fronts, with the complaint that much of what they produce is biased against conservatives. That includes a proposal to shut off federal funding to PBS and NPR, which is currently before Congress.\n\n‘Death’ of independent journalism\n\nMost VOA employees have been on administrative leave since March 15, their broadcasts and social media posts mostly silenced. Three VOA employees who are fighting the administration’s dismantling of VOA in court were among those receiving layoff notices on Friday.\n\n“It spells the death of 83 years of independent journalism that upholds US ideals of democracy and freedom around the world,” plaintiffs Jessica Jerreat, Kate Neeper and Patsy Widakuswara said in a statement.\n\nThe Persian-language employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing legal case, was in the office Friday when colleagues were barred from re-entry. The person was afraid to leave for the same reason – even though authorities said their work had been halted – until receiving a layoff notice.\n\nSteve Herman, VOA’s chief national correspondent who was in the process of retiring to take a job at the University of Mississippi, called the layoffs an “historic act of self-sabotage with the US government completing the silencing of its most effective soft-power weapon”.\n\nIt’s not clear what, if anything, will replace VOA’s programming worldwide. The Trump-supporting One American News Network has offered to allow its signal to be used.\n\nAlthough plaintiffs in the lawsuit called on Congress to continue supporting VOA, Herman said that he is not optimistic that it will survive, even if a Democratic president and Congress take over. For one thing, every day it is off the air is another day for viewers and readers to get into another habit for obtaining news.\n\n“I believe that the destruction is permanent,” Herman said, “because we see no indication in the next fiscal year that Congress will rally to fund VOA.”\n\nBy the time another administration takes power that is more sympathetic to the outlet, “I fear that VOA will have become forgotten,” he said.","summary":"With the Friday notices, 85 percent of Voice of America&#039;s workforce had been slashed.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/6/21/layoff-notices-delivered-to-hundreds-of-voice-of-america-employees?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25112727889108-1745359367.jpg?resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 00:03:18","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":333603764,"title":"‘Only America can help Iran’: Trump reveals why Tehran has 2 weeks before possible US strike","text":"US President Donald Trump spoke to reporters at the Morristown, NJ, airport about several issues, including the potential for US involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict, the Ukraine-Russia conflict, and his administration's deportation policy.","summary":"","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/only-america-can-help-iran-trump-reveals-why-tehran-has-2-weeks-before-possible-us-strike/videoshow/121984519.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-121984519,width-1070,height-580,overlay-economictimes/videoshow.jpg","video":"https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-121984519,imgsize-62500.cms","publish_date":"2025-06-21 00:03:10","author":"Et Online","authors":["Et Online"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1},{"id":333603762,"title":"LIVE | 'Tulsi Gabbard is wrong': Trump slams intel chief, warns Iran may get nukes in 'just weeks'","text":"US President Donald Trump publicly dismissed a report by his own Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who testified before Congress that Iran is not currently developing a nuclear weapon.

The foundations of its relationship with the US have been shaken by punitive tariffs and a sudden withdrawal of aid that hurt some of the region’s most vulnerable – even as Washington maintains its military presence with an eye fixed squarely on China.\nThis volatility has deepened a sense of American “unreliability” across Southeast Asia, according to experts who spoke to This Week in Asia.\nYet a complete rupture between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the United States remains unlikely. With China looming large across the horizon, Washington’s security commitments are expected to endure and continue shaping the region’s diplomatic calculus.\nAt the recent Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth laid out Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategic vision, citing Beijing’s relentless military drills around Taiwan and escalating naval confrontations in the South China Sea.\n“There’s no reason to sugar-coat it,” Hegseth said. “The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent.”\n\nHegseth called on US allies and partners to share more of the defence burden, stressing that such cooperation would enable Washington to allocate more resources to the Indo-Pacific, describing it as “our priority theatre”.\nBut Southeast Asia is also a priority for US commerce officials: in April, Trump announced sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs – ranging from 10 to 49 per cent – on Asean’s export-reliant economies.\nMeanwhile, brutal cuts to US foreign aid have left a deep mark on the region, abruptly terminating long-term projects in healthcare, demining, support for civil society and other programmes.\nNot only that, the Trump administration’s ban on foreign citizens from 19 countries entering the US, which took effect on June 9, included nationals of Myanmar and Laos.\nBrandishing the threat of tariffs, Washington also reportedly sought to discourage governments worldwide from attending a UN conference this week on a possible two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, according to a US cable seen by Reuters.\n\nAmerica’s tariffs, erratic policymaking and stance on the Middle East “have certainly strengthened a perception in Asean of Washington’s unreliability,” said Sarang Shidore, director of the Global South programme at the Quincy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\n“In the shorter term, Asean states will do all they can to limit the damage,” Shidore said. “Offering concessions on trade and their approach on the Middle East has not gone beyond diplomatic criticism of US actions,” he added, noting that on security, Washington was thus far “staying the course” against China.\nBut in the longer term, Shidore warned that US unreliability would accelerate “structural drivers for diversification” – a protracted process for those economies most reliant on US markets.\nThis week, the Philippine army said it would welcome more US Typhon missile systems to expedite troop training and strengthen deterrence. The ground-based launcher, capable of firing Tomahawk and SM-6 missiles up to 2,000km (1,240 miles), puts swathes of the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait and even the south of mainland China within range.\nThe first Typhon system arrived in the Philippines last year during joint exercises with the US – its first overseas deployment – and remains in northern Luzon for ongoing training.\n\nBut even when it comes to security, Shidore said countries like the Philippines had incentives to eventually seek a “more even-keeled policy” between China and the US.\n“If there is any region in the world that has a good shot at reducing its dependence on the US, it is Southeast Asia, and current conditions incentivise it to make major efforts in that direction,” he said.\nTrump’s tariff threats have not only forced Asean governments to rethink their trade with the US, but also reassess how they can secure longer-term growth as supply chains are thrown into chaos.\nYet despite these added strains, analysts say rash diplomatic moves are unlikely.\n“I do not see the development of an outright rift between Asean and the US or, for that matter, US influence in the region eroding rapidly,” said Felix Chang, a senior fellow at the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank.\nSoutheast Asian nations have a long history of pragmatic diplomacy, and many still view Washington as essential for regional stability, economic growth and security – a relationship Chang says is resilient enough to endure.\n“Despite policy shifts from Washington, Asean countries understand the US’ strategic importance and will continue to engage with it,” he added.\nMoney talks?\nAsean remains one of America’s largest trading partners – total US goods trade with the bloc stood at US$476.8 billion last year. Washington is also a major investor in the region, especially in technology, energy and manufacturing.\n“Ultimately, many Asean countries still greatly benefit from the US market, suggesting that economic interdependence will still play a crucial role in their relationships,” Chang said.\nWhile the Trump administration is scaling back security commitments in Europe and the Middle East, US defence efforts in Asia are being reinforced, according to Chang, with allies including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines benefiting from enhanced deterrence capabilities.\nThe US Navy has stepped up freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea, and Washington has reiterated its commitment to a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”.\n\n“These should reassure America’s Asian allies that, in working to strengthen its regional military posture, that the US is actually more likely to come to their aid, if push came to shove,” Chang said.\nWashington also remains deeply engaged in security partnerships with Asean, particularly through the Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM-Plus) and joint military exercises, including those with the Philippines and Thailand.\nHunter Marston, a researcher at Australian National University’s Southeast Asia Institute, said allies and partners were taking the Trump administration’s unpredictability “in stride”. Some, like the Philippines, were doubling down on their reliance on US security guarantees, he said, while others were broadening their network of strategic partnerships – including closer ties with the EU, Canada, Japan and Australia.\nMalaysia, the current Asean chair, is among those looking to China. Trade Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz spoke to Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao in April, seeking deeper cooperation between Beijing and the bloc.\nAt last month’s Asean Summit in Kuala Lumpur, calls grew for greater regional integration and resilience against global trade disruption. “All this is to say that the current trend has already factored in US unreliability,” Marston said. “The Trump administration has not sparked any new form of hedging behaviour above and beyond pre-existing fears of US neglect or volatility.”\n\nMarston pointed to the risks of a widening gap between US rhetoric and policy action, noting that Southeast Asia had long viewed Washington as “inattentive and inconsistent”. The Philippines, for instance, would continue to “oscillate” its China policy to best serve its own security, he said.\nThat includes Manila’s recent reciprocal access agreement for defence cooperation with Japan, atop existing arrangements with the US and Australia.\n“I would expect Manila’s on-again-off-again tensions with Beijing to continue to drive friction in the relationship, particularly concerning disputed territory in the South China Sea,” Marston said.\nHanh Nguyen, a research fellow at the Yokosuka Council on Asia Pacific Studies who specialises in Southeast Asia’s international relations, said that despite the “bombastic rhetoric”, Hegseth’s speech had sought to reassure a region increasingly alarmed by China’s rising military power.\nThose reassurances included a commitment to remain in the region and to strengthen military deterrence – moves consistent with previous US administrations, Hanh said.\nBut she described Hegseth’s promise of American staying power, while also following orders from Trump, as “contradictory”.\nThe heavy-handed reliance on military power while dismantling economic and soft power is not the region’s preference for US engagement\nHanh Nguyen, international relations researcher\n“The heavy-handed reliance on military power while dismantling economic and soft power is not the region’s preference for US engagement,” she added.\nDuring his first term in 2017, Trump withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, ending American participation in the 12-nation trade pact aimed at lowering tariffs and creating a free trade area.\nIn the vacuum, Southeast Asian nations have increasingly hitched their economic fortunes to China.\nBut this presents a dilemma for the Philippines, in particular: caught between US demands for greater defence spending and hosting more American troops, and the economic necessity of working more closely with China.\nLucio Blanco Pitlo III, a research fellow at the Asia Pacific Pathways to Progress Foundation, argued that the US must do more than “lecture” about China’s economic influence.\n“[Washington] has to offer robust alternatives to meet the region’s demand for greater access to export markets, infrastructure funding, and investment and technology transfer for industrial upgrading,” Pitlo said.\nFor example, he said the US should create more opportunities for allies and partners to develop their own defence industries.\n“Beyond low-value ship repair, arms co-production and investment in allies’ shipyards should be considered,” Pitlo said.\n\nTime ticking away\nTrump’s tariffs, announced on April 2, were subsequently paused for 90 days, giving economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand a brief window to negotiate.\nWhether Trump will follow through with his threats against economies that fail to open up to US investment or reduce trade deficits remains uncertain, but Asean’s has already got the message: new trading partners are needed.\nMalaysia, for example, has pivoted more towards China in the wake of US tariff threats and Europe’s phase-out of palm oil exports.\nStill, Asean as a whole has yet to adopt a unified position on the trade turmoil.\nIndonesia, for its part, continues to advocate for stronger ties with the US, even as it deepens economic links with China, particularly in mining and minerals.\n\nIn April, Jakarta and Washington reaffirmed their commitment to expanding their strategic partnership in politics, security, trade and investment during a meeting between Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington.\n“So despite the disruptions under the early Trump administration, I believe Asean is unlikely to fully pivot away from the US,” Chang said.\n“Instead, the region’s countries will likely maintain their divided preferences, leaning somewhat less toward the US, but not decisively turning its back on it.”\nStill, Washington would be wise not to assume its old alliances are unbreakable, observers say, particularly as public sentiment in Southeast Asia sours over the White House’s heavy-handed tactics and the binary choice it offers between the US and China.\nAn ISEAS-Yusof Ishak survey this year found that 47.7 per cent of respondents across 11 Southeast Asian nations would choose China over the US if forced to align with one power.\nMany Asean states will also seek to integrate more deeply with each other, and multi-align outside the region even more\nSarang Shidore, geopolitical risk analyst\n“Many Asean states will also seek to integrate more deeply with each other, and multi-align outside the region even more,” said Shidore of the Quincy Institute. “These preferences are deep-rooted and the larger and more capable Asean states have the means to make progress in that direction.”\nLast month, leaders from Asean, the Gulf Cooperation Council and China convened in Kuala Lumpur for an inaugural summit to deepen cooperation in trade, supply chains, infrastructure and finance.\nMeanwhile, Indonesia became the 10th full member of the China-led Brics group of developing economies in January, and Vietnam gained admission as a partner this month, joining Malaysia and Thailand.\n“The unpredictability of both Washington’s policies and the US-China relationship will incentivise the region to seek insurance policies through enhanced multi-alignment and greater regional integration,” Shidore added.\nChang, meanwhile, recalled repeated warnings from Asean members, including long-time partner Singapore, advising the US not to force the region to choose between America and China.","summary":"Five months into Donald Trump’s presidency, Southeast Asia finds itself

Promises, and skepticism, abound","text":"DUBLIN — Federal prisons officials are promising not to re-open the infamous — and now mothballed — FCI Dublin women’s prison as a new detention facility. But not everyone is buying it.\n\nEast Bay Congressman Mark DeSaulnier said Friday that Federal Bureau of Prisons officials assured him the sprawling grounds — which once housed a notorious “rape club” of guards and prison leaders who ruthlessly terrorized inmates — will never again be used as a detention facility. The pledge came during a tour the Democratic lawmaker received Friday morning of the moldy and decrepit former prison, which was permanently closed in 2024 after years of scandals and poor maintenance.\n\nThe future of FCI Dublin became the subject of intense speculation this year with the re-election of President Donald Trump and his vows to “carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted conducting an assessment there in February, stoking concerns among immigrant and inmate rights groups that the deteriorating facility could be used to house migrants as part of Trump’s crackdown.\n\nOn Friday, DeSaulnier, D-Walnut Creek, said the prisons bureau’s leaders “told me that their orders are to shut it down.”\n\n“They believe it’s not a viable place for any kind of detention facility, for ICE for anyone else,” he said, adding that prisons officials told him that ICE leaders also toured the facility and came to the conclusion that “they don’t want it either.”\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ apparent promise comes despite sightings of plumbers and other crews showing up at the Dublin complex within the past few weeks, according to John Kostelnik, a federal prison guard union leader. He voiced deep concerns about prisons officials misleading DeSaulnier, and implored him to press the bureau’s western regional director more for answers.\n\n“If it’s shutting down, why do we have plumbing companies coming in?” Kostelnik said.\n\nSusan Beaty, an attorney with the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, also voiced serious skepticism about the bureau’s vows. She warned that ICE and the Trump administration could still move to detain migrants at the aging property.\n\nThe prisons system “spent years lying about the abuse that was happening in this facility, the medical care that was being provided, the health and safety conditions inside the prison,” Beaty said. “The public has a lot of reasons not to trust BOP.”\n\nIn a statement, the Bureau of Prisons’ communications team reiterated that “FCI Dublin remains under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice and there are no plans to reopen it.” An email to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not immediately returned.\n\nPrison officials first moved to close FCI Dublin in spring 2024 amid a torrent of lawsuits from inmates claiming to have been sexually assaulted and retaliated against by prison guards. Their claims led federal prosecutors to indict eight former prison officials — including a former warden and a chaplain — on a slew of charges. Seven have pleaded guilty to a range of sexual crimes, while an eighth defendant is awaiting trial.\n\nMore than 100 inmates also have received more than $100 million in settlement payouts from the federal government for the abuses they endured.\n\nEven the prison’s initial closure in April 2024 was “unnecessarily rushed,” leading to “mass chaos” as inmates were scattered to other prisons across the country, a special master appointed by a federal judge to oversee the facility wrote in a report. That special master ultimately excoriated prison leaders for allowing inmates to live in such “unconscionable” conditions.\n\nDeSaulnier, whose district includes parts of Dublin, toured the facility on Friday for the first time since officials made the closure permanent in December 2024. Inside, he found a sprawling complex that was utterly empty, devoid of even the locks on inmates’ former cells. He saw no signs of any attempts to refurbish the facility, which is infested with mold.\n\n“It’s a dump — there’s nothing in it,” DeSaulnier said. “Physically what you see — that was reassuring to me — is all the kitchen equipment has been ripped out, the locks on the doors have been ripped out. It’s just bare bones.”\n\nHe stressed that officials need to raze the entire complex and never allow anyone to be held there again, particularly given the “horror” of a prison culture where inmates were repeatedly raped by their guards, then punished for reporting the abuses.\n\nBut DeSaulnier remained concern that the Trump administration could switch course and order the facility to be re-opened, given how “they don’t seem to be rational when it comes to bankrupting the federal budget for political purposes.”\n\nThe congressman said the “best possible outcome for taxpayers, employees and the community is to sell that valuable real estate.”\n\n“Its not just like a little mold — you have to bulldoze the place,” DeSaulnier said. “It’s a huge liability for whoever would try to operate it.”","summary":"\"Its not just like a little mold -- you have to bulldoze the place,” East Bay Congressman Mark DeSaulnier said.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/20/will-fci-dublin-be-turned-into-a-migrant-detention-facility-promises-and-skepticism-abound/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EBT-L-FCIDUBLIN-02XX-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 23:47:55","author":"Jakob Rodgers","authors":["Jakob Rodgers"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":333605408,"title":"Texas may soon enact restrictions on when and how students can protest","text":"The state of Texas could be set to pass a law putting major limits on protests at its public universities, including banning demonstrations at certain times of day and barring all protests during the final two weeks of the semester.\n\nThe law, whose Republican backers describe as an explicit response to the state’s pro-Palestine campus protests, would impact more than one million students at one of the nation’s largest public university systems and has drawn criticism from free speech advocates and students.\n\n“While the world watched Columbia, Harvard and other campuses across the country taken hostage by pro-terrorist mobs last year, Texas stood firm.

It was the morning of October 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists stormed through a security fence sealing Israel from Gaza and militants flew in firing guns from paragliders. \n\nThat day – the worst intelligence failure in the country's history – was marked by carnage and barbarity on an unprecedented scale.\n\nIn their murderous rampage, Hamas killed 1,189 people and wounded 7,500 - leaving many with life-changing injuries. The terrorists raped and sexually abused hundreds of women and young girls.\n\nTo this day 53 hostages are still in captivity, and the ambassador fears only 20 may still be alive.\n\nSome of Tzipi Hotovely's loved ones were among the victims. 'We lost members of our extended family. We lost friends,' she says of that horrendous day.\n\nThe war that began that morning is now reaching a new peak with Israel's relentless bombardment of Iran. She says that her parents, who remain in Israel, have been caught in the crossfires of Tehran's retaliatory strikes in the past week. \n\nThree or more times every night, they have been moving into the bomb shelter in the basement. Not long before we speak, a ballistic missile landed close to her parents' home.\n\nDespite the civilian death toll on both sides, the straight-talking ambassador is in no doubt about the justification of waging war on Iran. At 75 times the size of Israel, Iran has sponsored a proxy network of terror groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the\n\nHouthis in Yemen to fuel conflict against the Jewish state. 'We have given Iran 20 years to try to make diplomacy work but they are more interested in blowing up the negotiating table than sitting next to it,' she tells me.\n\n'Iran is 1,500 kilometres (900 miles) from Israel but it has circled us with its proxies. We are vulnerable. We are a small country the same size as Wales. \n\n'Iran was on the threshold of making nuclear weapons and we had to stop it. This is not just our war. Iran is Britain's enemy. It is America's war too.'\n\nThe ambassador, who has been in Britain since 2020 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, lavishes praise on Britain's intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 for their help: 'They are brilliant.' \n\nBut, while she liked Johnson as PM, she struggles to conceal her disappointment – even anger – with Sir Keir Starmer and his bumbling Foreign Secretary David Lammy, whose gaffes have tried the patience of even the most loyal Labour MPs.\n\nAs a diplomat, she chooses her words carefully. 'We have gaps with the British Government,' she tells me. \n\nTalk about an under-statement. It is more like yawning chasms in terms of support than gaps. Take the decision of the Starmer Government in September to restrict arms sales to Israel, which is the only democracy in the Middle East.\n\n'It was political. In Jerusalem, people were astonished by the arms embargo. It is just so contradictory. When you are fighting the right war, you expect your allies to support you,' Hotovely tells me.\n\nThen there was the unexpected move by the Government last week to impose sanctions on two Israeli government ministers over their hardline stance on the Gaza war. \n\nThe ambassador says: 'It was a very bad decision, morally wrong. You put sanctions on your enemy not your friend.'\n\nTo underline this, she points to former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who was denounced by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission in 2020 for presiding over 'a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it'.\n\nShe adds: 'Jeremy Corbyn could have been prime minister of Britain. He was anti-Semitic.\n\n'He had supported a terrorist organisation. But we never sanctioned him or the Labour Party. We respect the British people. We can criticise their leaders but we don't sanction them.'\n\nAs for David Lammy, she is even more circumspect when I ask if she thinks he is remotely up to the job of being Britain's diplomat-in-chief on the world stage. \n\nLammy was widely criticised after saying he accepted the International Criminal Court's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes.\n\n'It was a miserable decision,' says Hotovely. 'The ICC is a biased political organisation, which is why US President Donald Trump has imposed sanctions on it. The British Government was used as a political tool by the court.'\n\nThe ambassador is keenly aware that Labour's support from the Muslim community collapsed at the General Election in July last year. \n\nIn the 21 seats where more than 30 per cent of the population is Muslim, Labour's share dropped from an average 65 per cent in 2019 to 36 per cent. \n\nFour Independent Muslim candidates won in previously safe Labour seats, and the situation in Gaza was a hot election issue.\n\nHotovely, 46, is trenchant in her criticism. 'There is no doubt that the Muslim vote is a crucial part of Labour Party politics in Britain,' she declares. \n\n'No one can deny it. It is clear to me. Many decisions about Israel are made [in Britain] according to domestic politics. It is a fact.'\n\nIt was when she was just 26 that Hotovely first came to the attention of Netanyahu, who was then leader of the opposition. \n\nBy this stage, she was a qualified lawyer who had done two years of national service and was working as a political commentator on TV. Netanyahu spotted her and, seeing her talent, made contact.\n\n'I was called into his office. His first statement to me was, 'This is 1938. Iran is the equivalent to Nazi Germany'. That was his dramatic opening. It wasn't 'welcome to my office' or 'nice to see you'. That was 20 years ago. He was right then and he's right now.'\n\nMany now consider her to be Netanyahu's protege. Elected as an MP when she was 30, she is a small part of political history.\n\n'Before I was in parliament, all the women MPs had grown-up children,' she says. 'I got married when I was an MP and had babies when I was an MP. I turned my parliamentary office into a nursery.\n\n'I brought a nanny into the office. All my meetings were outside the office. Five times a day I returned to it to breastfeed my baby.' \n\nHer three daughters Maayan, 11, Eliraz, nine, and Noa, seven, love her being an ambassador. 'My youngest says, 'When I grow up, Mummy, I want to be the ambassador'. I never got that compliment when I was a politician.'\n\nIn parliament she held eight ministerial posts – more than any other woman in Israeli politics with the exception of Golda Meir who was Israel's first and only woman prime minister from 1969 to 1974. Was Golda Meir her political hero?\n\n'Absolutely not. It is Margaret Thatcher. She was a remarkable woman, a brave politician. Mrs Thatcher saved the British economy and her free-market thinking inspired Israel.\n\n'In Britain I have seen that Winston Churchill is remembered everywhere. Quite right. But Mrs Thatcher is not – which means you need a place for people to learn about her.'\n\nIn Israel, Hotovely was often demonised by her opponents for being hard-Right and a religious zealot. She is unmoved by the criticism.\n\n'In politics if, like Mrs Thatcher, you make great changes you will never be loved. I am very opinionated. If you want to be loved, find another profession than politics.'\n\nIt was Netanyahu who persuaded her to take up the ambassador role. She prepared for it by binge-watching the 1980s political satire Yes Minister, a favourite of Margaret Thatcher. The star of the TV series was the civil servant Sir Humphrey Appleby, played by the late Nigel Hawthorne.\n\n'I loved Sir Humphrey and it gave me a great insight into the British civil service,' she says with a loud laugh. 'I have met some really interesting British diplomats.'\n\nWhen she arrived in Britain, she coined a nickname for her husband Or Alon, a lawyer she married in 2013 with a staggering 2,500 guests.\n\n'I'd call him Mr Ambassador. Every time we went to a royal event, or an official reception, people would come up to him and say: 'Mr Ambassador'. They never thought it could be me.'\n\nShe has met the King and says her proudest moment was presenting her credentials as the new ambassador to the late Queen. \n\n'I am so proud and so happy I talked to her, even though it was on Zoom because of lockdown. She said to me, 'You have too many elections in your country'.'\n\nIndeed, when Netanyahu was elected again in October 2022, it was the fifth election in Israel in four years.\n\nWhile Hotovely loves Britain – the Scottish Highlands and Cornwall are her favourite places – she says she will not miss 'all those dark nights in your winter'.\n\nBut she enjoys the dry British sense of humour and says 'the Jewish school my children go to is wonderful. The discipline. The manners'.\n\nYet to this day she is shocked by the anti-Semitism she has experienced in Britain. She believes it is rampant in many universities. When she addressed the London School of Economics in 2021, she needed an armed escort off the premises.\n\n'I did not think in post-war Europe I would experience these levels of hate. I am very involved with the Jewish community\n\nhere and they no longer feel safe. They don't think they can wear symbols of their Jewishness on their clothes.'\n\nBy tradition, many Jewish families place a mezuzah, a small symbol of their Jewish faith, on their front door frame.\n\n'But since October 7 most now have brought those symbols into the house, which is very sad.'\n\nSince the war with Gaza, she has become one of the most closely guarded women in Britain. 'I cannot even go to the synagogue because of the security so I pray at home. The security guys are all British. They have been wonderful to me and my family.'\n\nEvery Saturday there is a huge march, involving thousands of pro-Palestine protesters, into central London. \n\nThere has been repeated criticism of the police for standing by and ignoring anti-Semitic chants and even banners proclaiming support for Hamas.\n\n'There is something badly wrong if a major part of the Jewish community feels they are excluded by the marches from going into central London. I have good relationships with successive home secretaries who say fighting anti-Semitism is an important part of their work.\n\n'But when those marches, with their anti-Jewish slogans go past Big Ben, they are seen by Jewish people on TV all around the world. It sends out a terrible message.'\n\nThe ambassador has an interesting suggestion. 'Words matter. I think the phrase anti-Semitism is now anachronistic. It does not come across as what it really is – Jewish hatred or racism against Jews. Perhaps we should change the description to reflect that. Education is a key factor.'\n\nIn the ambassador's view, this education could start with the BBC, which still refuses to call Hamas a terrorist organisation. The corporation maintains that would mean it was taking a side.\n\n'Hamas is an internationally recognised terrorist organisation,' she counters. 'Look what they did on October 7. Hideous terrorist brutality. I don't understand the BBC's position which I think damages its reputation worldwide. \n\n'Hamas use children as human shields. They looted the food aid that we provided. They don't care about their own people but the BBC will not criticise them.'\n\nIn the current febrile atmosphere, with President Trump upping the anti-Iran rhetoric, it is significant that Starmer has been more circumspect. Is he unwilling to upset the Muslim community or the vocal anti-Israel lobby in his own party? \n\n'The ambassador returns to diplomatic-speak. 'Britain is an important ally. We have shared valuable intelligence with your MI5 and MI6.' No word, however, on Starmer.\n\nLater this year, she will go back to Israel because it is the end of her five-year posting. She is widely expected to return to parliament at the election expected next year. She is a serious contender to replace Netanyahu, 75, who has now served as PM for 17 years.\n\n'I think I am tough but I am very human and I have cried so much since the war started. I cry over the devastating loss of life,' she tells me.\n\n'But I am proud of my country. I will be proud to serve my country in whatever way I can. I have been proud to serve as ambassador to your great country.","summary":"In Israel, where warnings of attacks from enemy nations are rampant, being woken at 6am by a loud air raid alarm is all-too common.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14833643/Israels-ambassador-UK-Labour-backing-Iran.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/21/00/99586039-0-image-m-40_1750462338760.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 23:43:11","author":"Andrew Pierce,Editor","authors":["Andrew Pierce","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.038},{"id":333602402,"title":"Court blocks Louisiana law requiring schools to post Ten Commandments in classrooms","text":"A panel of three federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in each of the state’s public school classrooms is unconstitutional.The ruling Friday marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized displays would isolate students — especially those who are not Christian.The mandate has been touted by Republicans, including President Donald Trump, and marks one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.“This is a resounding victory for the separation of church and state and public education,” said Heather L. Weaver, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. “With today’s ruling, the Fifth Circuit has held Louisiana accountable to a core constitutional promise: Public schools are not Sunday schools, and they must welcome all students, regardless of faith.”The plaintiffs’ attorneys and Louisiana disagreed on whether the appeals court’s decision applied to every public school district in the state or only the districts party to the lawsuit.“All school districts in the state are bound to comply with the U.S. Constitution,” said Liz Hayes, a spokesperson for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which served as co-counsel for the plaintiffs.The appeals court's rulings “interpret the law for all of Louisiana,” Hayes added. \"Thus, all school districts must abide by this decision and should not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms.”Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she disagreed and believed the ruling only applied to school districts in the five parishes that were party to the lawsuit. Murrill added that she would appeal the ruling, including taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.The panel of judges reviewing the case was unusually liberal for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In a court with more than twice as many Republican-appointed judges, two of the three judges involved in the ruling were appointed by Democratic presidents.RELATED STORY | Supreme Court tie vote dooms taxpayer funded Catholic charter school in OklahomaThe court's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana school children from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.The ruling also backs an order issued last fall by U.S. District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the mandate into law last June.Landry said in a statement Friday that he supports the attorney general's plans to appeal.“The Ten Commandments are the foundation of our laws — serving both an educational and historical purpose in our classrooms,” Landry said.Law experts have long said they expect the Louisiana case to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, testing the court on the issue of religion and government.Similar laws have been challenged in court.A group of Arkansas families filed a federal lawsuit earlier this month challenging a near-identical law passed in their state. And comparable legislation in Texas currently awaits Gov. Greg Abbott's signature.In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.","summary":"A panel of three federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in each of the state’s public school classrooms is unconstitutional.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/life/faith-and-religion/court-blocks-louisiana-law-requiring-schools-to-post-ten-commandments-in-classrooms","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2bb3d4d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5535x2906+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2Fef%2Fcde729444cf8b18b96bbca88a50f%2Fap25171737398571.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 23:40:14","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.169},{"id":333598582,"title":"Trump 'may change mind' about firing Fed Chair","text":"US President Donald Trump has again floated the idea of firing Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair he has long attacked over interest rates he wants lowered.\n\n\"I don't know why the Board doesn't override (Powell),\" Trump wrote in a lengthy post on Truth Social criticising Fed policy. \"Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?

That’s why I’m urging our local lawmakers to support Assembly Bill 551.\n\nAB 551 would create a program to help emergency departments across the state provide better care for things like abortion, miscarriage treatment and birth control.

If successful, they deserve our votes. If they spend the next six months playing the blame game, performing for cable TV, giving manic five-minute committee speeches, making videos or holding rallies with no actual positive results, we can then ask Trump and ICE to return, and we vote next year for new leadership in the state.\n\nColumn misses damage\ndone to Israel’s soul\n\nRe: “Israeli government endangers Jews everywhere” (Page A9, Jun 15).\n\nThank you for printing Thomas Friedman’s op-eds; they are always insightful, as is this one about the dangers to Jews around the world of the immoral actions of Israel in both Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHowever, I am afraid that he is wrong about one thing: It is already too late to avoid the terrible damage to Israel’s soul and the stain on its reputation.

There are some disclosure and partial interest sales that could complicate the overall take-home pay from the venture. \n\nBut at just 19 years old, he appears to have earned far more than his older siblings did at the same age — thanks to a digital gold rush that’s become the centerpiece of the Trump family's modern empire. \n\nBarron Trump, the President's youngest son, reportedly raked in an impressive sum in digital earnings\n\nThe college student may have raked in $25 million after taxes while his father returned to the White House, according to Forbes. \n\nBarron, who reportedly introduced his father to the concept of digital wallets, has been credited by Trump as the family’s crypto brain.\n\n'Barron's a young guy, but he knows it — he talks about his wallet,” Trump said in a previous interview.\n\n'He's got four wallets or something, and I'm saying, \"What is a wallet?\"'\n\nPresident Trump is also making a healthy sum, too. \n\nA newly released 234-page financial disclosure revealed the President raked in more than $57 million last year from cryptocurrency ventures.\n\nTrump himself owns a 52.5 percent stake in the company, per his disclosure. \n\nHe also made millions off retail offerings, like gold-plated shoes, high-end watches, collectible coffee table books, and electric guitars. \n\nTrump watches are another retail avenue of revenue for the Trump empire\n\nPresident Trump had long railed against the Biden administration for allegedly allowing the the then-President's son, Hunter, to profit off his White House proximity\n\nTop Republican previews next Trump-backed crypto move that could bring a windfall of cash into U.S.\n\nBut the cryptocurrency is ruffling the feathers of White House watchdogs. \n\nInvestments in the currency are shielded from public view, making skeptics nervous about potential foreign investment or unseen lobbying via trades in the Trump-branded coin. \n\nIn May, the President hosted a lavish dinner with some of the biggest investors in his crypto empire. \n\nThe White House has long argued that President Trump remains walled off from political corruption because he ceded financial power of his profit-making organizations to his sons. \n\nBut that argument also came after President Trump railed against the Biden administration for allowing the former President's son, Hunter, 55, to allegedly profit from his closeness to the White House. \n\n'Ultimately, no matter what it is, I always put the country way ahead of the business,' President Trump said, adding 'You can't say that about Hunter.' \n\nWorld Liberty Financial didn't immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment. \n\nBarron Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nUtterly staggering sum Barron Trump has already made at 19... outshining his dad and brothers\n\nAdd comment","summary":"At just 19 years old, Barron Trump is raking in an impressive sum of cash.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/article-14832595/Utterly-staggering-sum-Barron-Trump-19-outshining-dad-brothers.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/20/16/99574345-0-image-a-23_1750433806523.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 23:19:16","author":"Ben Shimkus,Editor","authors":["Ben Shimkus","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.165},{"id":333593812,"title":"JD Vance travels to Los Angeles to scold Gavin Newsom for 'egging on' violent riots","text":"Vice President JD Vance traveled to Los Angeles on Friday, setting up a showdown with Gov. Gavin Newsom as he visited deployed Marines in the city.\n\nThe vice president traveled to a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center and a Federal Mobile Command Center to visit with federal law officials and thank them for their efforts to protect the city. \n\nHe defended the president's decision to send in federal troops to help local law enforcement combat rioters in the city.\n\nHe described the series of events surrounding the riots a 'tragedy' and said that the rioters were 'egged on' by Newsom and the Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\n'That is disgraceful,' he said, adding, 'We've got to enforce our borders and get so many of these criminals out of our country to begin with.'\n\nHe said that Trump acted because Newsom refused to take the riots seriously.\n\n'If you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement, we're not going to send in the national guard because it's unnecessary,' he said. 'But if you let violent rioters burn great American cities to the ground, then of course we're going to send in federal law enforcement to protect the people the president was elected to protect.'\n\nVance said he was grateful to federal law enforcement officials citing the 'good news' that the rioting had slowed down, but said it was still necessary to keep them on duty in case the riots flared back up.\n\nThe vice president criticized both Bass and Newsom for encouraging a 'crisis' by extending government benefits to illegal immigrants and straining the local public services.\n\nHe also criticized both leaders for inciting violent riots in response to the president's deportation orders and endangering local law enforcement officials. \n\n'I think it's disgraceful that we've ever gotten to this point,' Vance added. \n\nThe vice president also ridiculed Sen. Jose Padilla for causing a scene at a press conference with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last, leading her bodyguards to wrestle him to the ground and handcuff him. \n\n'Well I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question but unfortunately I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't a theater,' he said when asked to respond to the incident. 'I think we ought to laugh them out of the building, we ought to call them out for doing what they are doing which is grandstanding.' \n\nPresident Donald Trump deployed 700 U.S. Marines to the city after protesters rioted in response to increased ICE raids and deportations of illegal immigrants.\n\nVance's visit takes place after Newsom, who is considering a 2028 Ron for president, loudly protested the deployment of military forces to help quell the riots.\n\nNewsom warned that 'democracy was under assault,' because the president ignored his plea to deescalate the riots and protests.\n\nHe described the deployment of federal troops and Marines unnecessary and illegal, filing a lawsuit to contest the president's deployment.\n\nVance's trip takes place just after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled Thursday in favor of the president's authority to deploy military forces.\n\n'The undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters ‘pinned down’ several federal officers and threw ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects’ at the officers,' the court's decision read. 'Protesters also damaged federal buildings and caused the closure of at least one federal building. And a federal van was attacked by protesters who smashed in the van’s windows. The federal government’s interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.'\n\nThe Marines were tasked with protecting federal buildings.\n\nLast week they detained a man for walking onto the property of a Los Angeles federal building but he was released without charges.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance traveled to Los Angeles on Friday, setting up a showdown with Gov.
