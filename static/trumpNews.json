Harris supported legislation imposing a ban in the Senate but walked back that position after announcing her run for president. “Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive,” she said on Friday. Harris has not backed away from the Biden administration’s effort to transition the economy to electric vehicles. In fact, she painted Trump as negligent for not investing in their development as president. “I will make sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century,” she said. Still, Harris’s remark suggests a defensive posture on one of the most politically fraught topics for Michigan voters. Flint, the birthplace of General Motors, has lost much of its auto manufacturing over the decades, and Trump argues the phasing out of gasoline cars will accelerate that trend. He appeared in Saginaw, Michigan, on Thursday with a tough-on-China message and the promise of a “manufacturing renaissance” if elected to a second term. Harris’s answer to Trump was to focus on his record as president. She accused him of letting down the working class while noting that auto plants in Warren, Detroit, and elsewhere closed under his administration. In total, the number of auto jobs under Trump grew slightly before the pandemic, while there has been a larger expansion under Biden. “Thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs, and when it came to building the cars of the future, Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate,” Harris said. Harris promised investments in union jobs if she is elected and made a show of labor support. Before she appeared onstage, she was introduced by Eric Price, a local United Auto Workers leader, plus Shawn Fain, the UAW president. Meanwhile, she sought to shore up support among young black men with an appearance by basketball legend Magic Johnson. “Our black men, we gotta get them out to vote. Kamala’s opponent promised a lot of things to the black community that he did not deliver on. And we gotta help black men understand that,” Johnson said at the event. In September, Trump made an appearance at the same Flint convention center where Harris rallied supporters on Friday and has used unconventional media this cycle to reach out to the black community. On Friday, the Trump campaign accused Biden of “upstaging” Harris with a surprise press conference held as she campaigned in Detroit. Biden told reporters that he and Harris are “singing from the same song sheet,” a comment Republicans quickly used to tie her to the Biden agenda.","summary":"FLINT, Michigan — Vice President Kamala Harris promised not to ban gas-powered vehicles if elected as president, one day after former President Donald Trump told Michigan voters she would decimate the car industry.

The meeting was the first joint appearance of the two Republican leaders since Trump launched a crusade against Kemp over Georgia legally certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election win.Trump, who continues to falsely claim that the election was \"stolen,\" referred to Kemp as \"disloyal\" during a rally in Georgia as recently as August. With polls in Georgia showing a tight 2024 race, Trump has since changed his tune on the popular governor, thanking Kemp for his \"help and support\" in a Truth Social post just weeks after bashing him.However, some suggested that relations between Kemp and Trump remained frosty on Friday after CNN's Kaitlan Collins shared a photo of the pair shaking hands during their meeting to X, formerly Twitter.

The Harris campaign has cast itself as a “big tent,” drawing support from everyone from Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney. The campaign's stable of celebrity backers is just as wide-ranging, with Harris and Walz snagging endorsements and rally appearances from rapper Megan Thee Stallion, Charli XCX, Taylor Swift and now, Springsteen. The famous New Jerseyan, who previously backed Obama and narrated a 2020 ad for Biden, has a history of political activism. Springsteen opposed Trump’s playing of his songs at his rallies in 2016, becoming one of the earliest members of a dozens-deep roster of A-listers asking the ex-president to keep them off his campaign playlist.

This includes a certain former president.Speaking with OutKick's Clay Travis, former president Donald Trump spoke about the new NFL kickoff rule, specifically saying that he doesn't like it.\"I don't know what they're doing with the kickoff return in the NFL,\" Trump said. And I don't want to get involved in controversy, of course, but it looks so bad. And I noticed that they hadn't done that in college, and they shouldn't do it. And I think the NFL should go back.\"\"And maybe it is a little bit more dangerous, but I doubt that it's any more dangerous. It's football.\"While this would normally go unnoticed, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell actually addressed the rules mentioned on \"Good Morning Football\" on the NFL Network.\"I think we'll have to make a few changes on the kickoff that will, I think, lead to a lot more kickoff returns,\" Goodell said.While there may be some tweaks that need to be made, the new kickoff rule has actually been a slight success. According to Kevin Seifert of ESPN, kick returns have actually increased from 17 percent in the first four weeks of the 2023 NFL Season to 29 percent this season in the same amount of time.However, two-thirds of kickoffs are still just touchbacks due to them guaranteeing field position for the offensive team.According to NFL officiating rules analyst Walt Anderson, this rule is still being worked on and hasn't been fully finalized yet.\"There's a lot of elements that go into defining what success is on this play,\" Anderson said. \"And so, really, we're taking the approach of, 'Hey, it's a long season. Everybody's going to have to get used to this. Let's not worry about evaluating it upfront.' There will be plenty of time to evaluate it after the season.\"\"But from our standpoint, it's at least heading in what we feel like is the right direction, which is increasing the number of returns, making the play more exciting, and then, obviously, everybody hopes that it's also making it safer.\"In the end, the safety aspect is the most important part of this rule change.

This two-year period was intended to enable individuals to seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and to work and contribute to the United States,” a DHS spokesperson wrote in an email. The announcement comes a month before the 2024 presidential election when immigration is a top concern for voters and Vice President Kamala Harris has taken hits from former President Donald Trump for her stewardship of the border with President Joe Biden. Under the Biden-Harris administration illegal border crossings reached their highest levels in history, contributing to a majority of the public wanting to see a reduction in overall immigration. The Biden administration announced in late 2022 that immigrants seeking admission from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela would not be released into the U.S. if they crossed the border illegally. Instead, immigrants from those four countries would have the ability to apply from outside the U.S. to be paroled on a two-year basis, which allows the individual to reside in the U.S. without having to make an asylum claim. The government made no promise that the two-year parole status would be continued and Friday’s announcement revealed that immigrants will now be on their own and must leave the country when their parole status expires or find another legal protection that will allow them to remain here. “Those who do not have pending immigration benefits or who have not been granted an immigration benefit during their two-year parole period will need to depart the United States prior to the expiration of their authorized parole period or may be placed in removal proceedings after the period of parole expires,” the DHS spokesperson said. Immigrants were admitted on parole primarily through the CBP One app, a phone application administered by the federal U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. The Biden administration has allowed 30,000 people to be admitted per month. Immigrants in the U.S. may be able to eligible to apply for temporary protected status, which gives the recipient protection from deportation for 18 months, as well as legal permission to work in the country.

The violence escalated early on Tuesday, as Israel launched “limited ground incursions” into southern Lebanon, targeting infrastructure belonging to the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. This followed a week of air strikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrullah and displaced an estimated 1 million of Lebanon’s 5.8 million population. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s bellicose rhetoric has added further fuel to the fire, suggesting in a video message on Monday potential military action against Iran – which leads the anti-Israel “Axis of Resistance” – and even regime change in Tehran. His statements were applauded by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and former Middle East policy architect, who exhorted Israel in a lengthy social media post to “finish the job”. Iran wasted no time in responding to the threats, launching a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles at Israeli military targets within 24 hours. The Iranian mission to the United Nations said that any further Israeli aggression would be met with a “devastating response”. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian later addressed Netanyahu directly, warning on X: “This is only a corner of our power. Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.” Netanyahu promptly retorted, claiming Iran had “made a big mistake” and would “have to pay for it”. ‘Escalation dominance’ This hot-tempered back-and-forth exposes a conflict caught in a relentless cycle of escalation. Each time international pressure mounts for a ceasefire in Gaza, Israel ramps up its military activities against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, shifting diplomatic efforts towards preventing a broader regional war. “Several times during this war, Israel has tried to provoke, essentially, a war between the US and Iran,” said Michael Young, senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut. The involved parties find themselves “locked in” to a pattern whereby each seeks to gain “escalation dominance”, he said – aiming to “escalate to levels that the other side cannot”. The current cycle of violence can be traced back to early April when Israel, under pressure from Washington to avoid mass civilian casualties in Rafah, targeted Iran’s embassy complex in Damascus, killing two Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps generals. After intense negotiations via Arab nations aimed at avoiding a widening conflict, Iran launched a largely performative response against Israel in the form of waves of slow-moving drones and cruise missiles, most of which were easily intercepted. Then in late July, as diplomatic momentum again built for a phased resolution to the Gaza conflict, Israel escalated further by assassinating both Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah’s military chief, and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on successive days. Haniyeh’s killing was particularly provocative, occurring mere hours after Iran’s new president was sworn in and under the noses of Iranian security services. Rather than pursuing a back room de-escalation deal with Tehran, the US reinforced its military presence in the region, deploying additional air, land, and sea forces. This show of strength served as a warning to Iran, which opted to hold back rather than retaliate. The most recent escalation began last month with the detonation of devices used by Hezbollah operatives, culminating in the assassination of Nasrullah in a targeted bombing that destroyed an entire residential block in southern Beirut on September 27. Analysts who spoke to This Week in Asia said they had predicted Iran’s increased involvement, despite its reluctance, given the rising threat of Israeli air strikes. “A significant portion of the US political establishment loathes Iran” and wants Israel to attack it, said Monica Marks, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at New York University Abu Dhabi. US President Joe Biden “is saying he wants regional de-escalation whilst delivering a seemingly endless stream of weapons and political cover to Israel”, she said. “So there is a real likelihood that Israel could escalate this into not only a ground invasion of Lebanon, but a series of more direct military attacks on Iran.” Netanyahu was “seizing the opportunity” to act before November’s presidential election in the US, Marks added. Jonathan Panikoff, a former US deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East, said that Tehran would prefer to stay out of the Hezbollah-Israel conflict unless directly attacked. It would appear Tuesday’s missile strikes against Israel were designed to convey a different message than those in April. This time, Iran offered no advanced warnings through Arab intermediaries, with US officials only receiving alerts hours before the missile launches. In contrast to the slower drones and subsonic missiles used earlier, Iran unleashed supersonic ballistic missiles against military targets in Israel, reducing the window for interception by both Israeli and US forces. Although Iran aimed at specific military installations to avoid civilian casualties, its missile salvo was clearly a retaliation for the recent assassinations of key figures, including Nasrullah, Haniyeh, and Iranian commanders. Threat of all-out war Regardless of what happens next between Israel and Iran, the Netanyahu administration is expected to intensify its military campaign against Hezbollah. The primary objective is to pressure the militant group into withdrawing its forces from the border, allowing the 70,000 or so Israeli citizens who were evacuated from the surrounding area a year ago to return home. Failure to comply could lead Israel to reinstate the buffer zone in southern Lebanon that it previously occupied from 1985 to 2000. However, Israel’s ambitions extend beyond merely securing its northern border – officials aim to “fundamentally alter the threat” posed by Hezbollah, Panikoff said, as many “view this as the right time” to take advantage of the opportunity. Should the conflict escalate, Hezbollah will likely attempt to inflict “as much damage on Israel as possible”, he said. So far, the group has strategically targeted military installations deep within Israel, with its drones and missiles reaching as far south as Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem, while mostly avoiding civilian population zones. Both Israel and Hezbollah “are to a certain extent trying to avoid the worst”, Carnegie’s Young said. “The Israeli calculation is that Hezbollah would be willing to absorb its attacks, and not force Israel to embark on a ground war,” he said. But if tensions continue to rise, “a full-scale war leading to significant destruction and loss of life in both Israel and Lebanon is likely,” Panikoff warned. However, he said “a full-scale war could probably be averted” if Hezbollah relocated its Radwan special forces units away from the border, so they were no longer threatening Israeli towns with missile launches. Panikoff said that Hezbollah’s insistence on tying its withdrawal to the cessation of Israeli military operations in Gaza was “disconnected from any strategic reality”. The group’s leadership likely prefers to avoid a full-blown war with Israel, he said. No American president today wants to enter into a war with Iran Michael Young, Carnegie Middle East Centre All the analysts interviewed by This Week in Asia agreed that both US presidential candidates would be keen to sidestep such a conflict. “No American president today wants to enter into a war with Iran,” Young said. “Certainly, the American public would not back such a war.” Similarly, Iran cannot afford to allow “Lebanon to be destroyed and Hezbollah to be greatly weakened” as this would equate to the loss of another regional asset after seeing Hamas “severely weakened in Gaza”. The Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 41,600 since the conflict began, according to the enclave’s Hamas-run health ministry. Tehran’s strategic calculus will also be influenced by its recent overtures to diplomatically re-engage with the West. In a speech to the UN General Assembly on September 24, President Pezeshkian expressed Iran’s readiness to negotiate with the remaining participants of the 2015 nuclear deal, which aimed to limit Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. The Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 as part of a strategy of “maximum pressure” prompted Iran to expand its uranium enrichment and amass near-weapons-grade material. Israel, staunchly opposed to the JCPOA, is determined to prevent any new agreement that might allow the US to refocus its geopolitical priorities on countering China and Russia. “To a certain extent”, both Iran and Israel “are playing the US”, Young said – as renewed Iranian dialogue with Washington could lead to a revival of the nuclear deal, particularly if Kamala Harris were to win the presidency. Even Trump, much preferred by Netanyahu, surprised many by suggesting on September 26 that the US has “to make a deal” with Iran to avoid dire consequences. This is a scenario that Israel “at all costs wants to prevent”, as it aims to maintain its “hegemonic power” in the Middle East, Young said. Estimates from Western think tanks suggest Israel has around 90 nuclear warheads, though it routinely denies possessing any. Analysts say the escalating conflict in the Middle East is compounded by a lack of a coherent strategic vision among the combatants. “Israel does not have a strategy. It has the tactical goal of neutralising its enemies, but not a wider strategy involving a strategic and diplomatic vision,” said Shaiel Ben-Ephraim, an Israeli analyst specialising in the Middle East peace process. Meanwhile, Hamas, under its new leader Yahya Sinwar, is pushing for escalation “so it will remove the Israel Defence Forces’ chokehold” on Gaza, he said. Unless Israel’s tactical military victories are paired with a longer-term political strategy that involves creating a Palestinian state, “you can rest assured that violent resistance against Israel, likely including terrorism, will continue”, said Marks, the politics professor. This could manifest through revitalised factions of Hamas and Hezbollah or new groups yet to emerge, she said. Young agreed, predicting that the conflict in Gaza will endure as “the Israelis are going to try to maintain a presence”. He foresees a future where “the Palestinians will revolt” again, replicating past intifadas.","summary":"As US ally Israel lashes out at Iranian proxies, a perpetual multi-front conflict that threatens to set the whole region ablaze takes shape.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3281139/israel-vs-iran-new-middle-east-forever-war-looms-1-year-gaza-conflict-began","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/04/6a7cd267-7587-46bf-a011-38a2925d05e2_7e886448.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 00:00:10","author":"Tom Hussain","authors":["Tom Hussain"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":258529092,"title":"Biden: 'I don't know' if Netanyahu is trying to sway US election","text":"While the Biden administration has criticised Hamas for failing to reach an agreement, the president has also expressed increasing public frustration with Netanyahu, who he recently said was not doing enough to strike a deal.

Biden was asked the question directly during a news conference at the White House on Friday, just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, in which at least 41,802 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed. “No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None. None. None. And I think Bibi should remember that,” Biden said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname. “And whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know, but I’m not counting on that.” The Biden administration has for months downplayed the prospect that Israel could be intentionally holding up such a deal, instead regularly laying the blame for breakdowns in talks on Hamas. It has done so despite repeated reports indicating that Netanyahu’s position had shifted throughout the talks, precluding any breakthroughs. Still, some top Democrats have increasingly questioned whether Netanyahu could have an eye on the US election – and the possible victory of former President Donald Trump – in his military calculation. Trump has long been Netanyahu’s preferred occupant of the White House. On the campaign trail, the Republican has attacked the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, over the Biden administration’s inability to reach a deal. “I don’t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel’s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s actions, as connected to the American election,” Senator Chris Murphy, a close ally of Biden, told CNN earlier this week. US officials also told The Wall Street Journal in September they did not believe a deal would be reached during Biden’s presidency, which ends in January of 2025. Continued military aid Biden had initially said that Israel supported a ceasefire plan he introduced in May, despite Netanyahu appearing to swiftly contradict the claim. In September, the Israeli prime minister pushed back on a claim from a Biden administration official that 90 percent of the deal had been completed. Later that month, Israel surged its attacks on Lebanon shortly after meeting with US officials pushing for de-escalation. Since then, Netanyahu’s government has ignored appeals from US officials for a pause in fighting as it has upped its operations – including limited ground incursions – in Lebanon. Biden has also opposed Israel striking Iran’s nuclear facilities following an Iranian attack earlier this week. On Friday, he indicated he also opposed any strikes on Iran’s oil facilities, saying: “If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking about other alternatives than striking Iranian oil fields.” Despite Israel continuing to flaunt Washington’s public appeals, the Biden administration has for months avoided leveraging the military aid it provides to its “ironclad” ally. Transfer of power may not be ‘peaceful’ Speaking during the news conference on Friday, Biden also warned that Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, could refuse to accept the outcome of the election on November 5. Trump had spread false claims the 2020 vote was marred by election malfeasance. The statements culminated in his supporters storming the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn Biden’s victory. Trump has continued to cast unfounded doubt that the upcoming election would be fair. Biden said it was notable that Trump’s running mate, Vance, would not confirm during this week’s vice presidential debate that he would accept the outcome of the vote next month. “I’m confident it will be free and fair. I don’t know whether it will be peaceful. The things that Trump has said, and the things that he said last time out when he didn’t like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous,” Biden said.","summary":"White House has for months said Israel is not the main stumbling block in elusive ceasefire talks.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/4/biden-unsure-if-netanyahu-holding-up-gaza-deal-to-influence-us-election?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AP24278688098512-1728079706.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:57:39","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":258528100,"title":"Ben Horowitz says he’ll donate to Kamala Harris after all","text":"After the podcast where Ben Horowitz repeatedly congratulated himself for being brave enough to support Donald Trump in public, it turns out Horowitz will also be donating to Kamala Harris. Or so he says. “As I mentioned before, Felicia and I have known Vice President Harris for over 10 years and she has been a great friend to both of us during that time,” Horowitz wrote in an email to his venture capital firm obtained by Axios. “As a result of our friendship, Felicia and I will be making a significant donation to entities who support the Harris Walz campaign.” \"“Like, how do you walk that back?”\" I... listen. Two things. First, one of the most striking things about the podcast Horowitz made with his a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen was how focused both men were on who’d take their meetings. Their political commitments in many respects boiled down to who would spend face time with them. Near the end of the podcast, Horowitz told what was (I think?) supposed to be a heartwarming story about hanging out with Trump’s grandkids — and how his reaction to hearing about the assassination attempt on Trump was “Oh my god, Grandpa just got shot.” So you know, the whole thing where Harris has been “a great friend” to both Horowitz and his wife checks out as a political position for him. In some respects, I get it. I too want to see my friends succeed! But second, that crucial Trump endorsement was made before Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race in favor of Harris, and before the enormous outpouring of support for the new Democratic candidate. That meant a16z had already sacrificed any leverage it might have with a Harris administration — and a candidate who made Trump look like less of a sure winner. In the case of a Harris win, these boys were looking at an entire four years without important meetings, and we already know they view that as a dreadful tragedy for the entire nation. In order to regain any possibility of leverage in a potentially Democrat-led government, someone was going to have to eat humble pie, and it sure as shit wasn’t going to be Andreessen. Horowitz, whose support for Trump was termed a “Maga U-turn” by The San Francisco Standard, has a history of donating to progressive causes; Harris, then a senator, was even a guest at a Horowitz backyard barbecue in 2018. “I’m just wondering what they’re gonna do when Kamala wins,” one founder told The San Francisco Standard of the a16z Trump endorsement. “Like, how do you walk that back?” Well, I guess we know now. Horowitz’s email says that he’s had several conversations with Harris and her team — crucial to note here that he got to the candidate herself, given that access is apparently one of Horowtiz’s main political concerns. And so while Horowitz still thinks President Joe Biden is no-good and very bad, he is “encouraged by my belief” in Harris to do good for tech, despite the fact that she has not yet staked out any policy positions. Harris has sort of made overtures on what Horowitz termed “probably the most emotional topic” in the election: crypto. One of her campaign aides has said, “She’s going to support policies that ensure that emerging technologies and that sort of industry can continue to grow,” in response to a question about crypto. Anyway, someone ought to do a wellness check on David Sacks — looks like his VC cabal is cracking.","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262505/ben-horowitz-kamala-harris-a16z","image":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azqRjwrNt-ZFcwZoWbrYk7M5KAk=/0x0:2678x3600/1200x628/filters:focal(1431x515:1432x516)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25659288/1147538703.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:50:58","author":"Elizabeth Lopatto","authors":["Elizabeth Lopatto"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":258527056,"title":"How FEMA's Disaster Funding Compares to Ukraine Aid","text":"Recent concerns regarding Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding have caused some Americans to call into question how U.S. funding of FEMA compares to aid sent to Ukraine.Last week, the House of Representatives and the Senate approved a continuing resolution, which extends FEMA funding through December 20 and permits the agency to access those funds more quickly. But FEMA faces a multibillion-dollar deficit, even after imposing new spending restrictions last month. The agency is forgoing some ongoing rebuilding projects related to disaster repair to be better financially equipped to face immediate needs related to natural disasters.How FEMA Funding Compares to Ukraine AidSince the war between Russia and Ukraine began in 2022, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with almost $60 billion for weapons and security, according to the Associated Press. However, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan agency, claims that U.S. aid to Ukraine is even higher.\"Congress responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with funding of about $176 billion for U.S. agencies to provide arms to Ukraine, aid civilians, impose sanctions, and more,\" the website said.President Joe Biden recently announced an additional $2.4 billion assistance package for Ukraine on September 26.In comparison, in 2022, Congress appropriated $18.8 billion in annual funding for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which is the primary funding for domestic disaster relief programs and has appropriated roughly $20 billion each year thereafter. Additional appropriations measured in the billions of dollars were made in 2023 and 2024. Most recently, Congress approved a continuing resolution that provided FEMA with an additional $20 billion in disaster relief funds to be used through December 20.Newsweek reached out to the White House by email for comment.FEMA Funds for Hurricane Helene VictimsMeanwhile, Hurricane Helene ravaged several states last week, killing at least 200 people and leaving many others displaced and without necessary supplies. Some fear the death toll is much higher than what has been reported.On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that FEMA workers were going door-to-door in affected areas to provide residents with immediate relief money worth $750. The $750 is part of a larger effort to provide aid to those impacted by the hurricane.\"FEMA is also providing tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair, to be able to cover a deductible when and if they have insurance, and also hotel costs,\" Harris said at the time.Despite FEMA's ongoing efforts, several Americans took to social media to express that the aid for hurricane victims wasn't high enough when compared to the funding U.S. has approved for Ukraine since the war with Russia began in 2022.\"Let's check in on our government: Biden announced a new $2.4B aid package to Ukraine last week while Kamala announced today that victims of Hurricane Helene will get a mere $750,\" one post said. \"Oh, and FEMA doesn't have enough money to make it through hurricane season yet spent $640M on illegal aliens.\"\"$2.4B to Ukraine. $750 to the victims of Hurricane Helen $1B+ of FEMA money to illegal aliens No FEMA funds for hurricane survivors,\" another said.\"How is the US GOVERNMENT running out of money for Hurricane Helene victims?!\" one post said. \"They were able to find $63.1 BILLION and counting for Ukraine. FEMA spent over a BILLION on illegal immigrants. But the Americans in Appalachia? $750 bucks. THIS IS AN INSULT.\"Many of the accounts criticizing the government only highlighted the immediate aid money of $750, despite the longer-term efforts by FEMA to help Americans with larger costs, such as housing.FEMA ScrutinyScrutiny about FEMA spending has increased in recent weeks after FEMA  spent money on assisting communities across the country dealing with an influx of migrants through its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). The program had a budget of $640 million for the 2024 Fiscal Year, which ended on September 30.Former President Donald Trump has criticized the SSP, which helps local governments and nonprofits support migrants. However, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security have denied that any FEMA disaster relief funds have gone to the program.\"The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA's disaster-related authorities or funding streams,\" a DHS spokesperson previously told Newsweek.However, claims are now surfacing that FEMA doesn't have enough money to assist those in need after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across several states, including North Carolina.FEMA Director of Public Affairs Jaclyn Rothenberg previously told Newsweek that FEMA has enough funding to support the Hurricane Helene response and any subsequent disasters through December 20.","summary":"FEMA has recently come under scrutiny after Congress approved a continuing resolution that extends agency funding.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-fema-disaster-funding-compares-ukraine-aid-1964240","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488176/how-fema-funding-compares-ukraine-aid.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:48:38","author":"Anna Skinner","authors":["Anna Skinner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":258526846,"title":"Report: Only Trump-backed Bibles fit bid criteria issued by Okla. state officials","text":"Oct. 4 (UPI) -- Two versions of the Bible backed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are the only ones that fit the specifications of bids for classroom holy books issued by the state of Oklahoma, a report indicated Friday. Bid documents for 55,000 Bibles issued by the state Department of Education and obtained by The Oklahoman newspaper reveal a list of specifications that only match two Bibles now on the market -- one of which is promoted by the former president for a fee and another endorsed by his son, Donald Trump Jr. One of the Bibles fitting the criteria is country music singer Lee Greenwood's God Bless the U.S.A. Bible, commonly referred to as the Trump Bible, which costs $60 and from which the GOP candidate collects a royalty fee. The other is the We The People Bible, endorsed by Donald Trump Jr., and selling for $90, the newspaper reported. The specifications were issued by Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters, a staunch Trump supporter who imposed a controversial mandate this year demanding that Oklahoma public schools teach the Bible in class. The state's criteria for the classroom Bibles include that they be the King James Version and that must include copies of secular U.S. documents such as the Pledge of Allegiance, Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. They also must be \"bound in leather or leather-like material for durability.\" Only the two Trump-endorsed Bibles fit the bill, the newspaper found. The state issued the $3 million solicitation Monday. It's open for just two weeks, despite official state agency recommendations that such requests remain open for at least four weeks. A spokesman for Walters said the state intends to pay for the Bibles through payroll savings -- at least 130 people have resigned or been fired since he took office last year, according to The Oklahoman. Under the mandate, each 5th- through 12th-grade Oklahoma classroom is required to have a Bible from which the teacher is required to teach. \"This is not merely an educational directive but a crucial step in ensuring our students grasp the core values and historical context of our country,\" Walters said in July. The rule has sparked a revolt among state educators. At least a dozen school districts in Oklahoma have publicly stated they do not plan to comply with the Bible requirement.","summary":"Two versions of the Bible backed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are the only ones that fit the specifications of bids for classroom holy books issued by the state of Oklahoma, a report indicated Friday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/10/04/Only-Trump-backed-Bibles-fit-bid-criteria-issued-Oklahoma-state-officials/5851728081294/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5851728081294/2024/upi/1bdf94e77f42a14d5fa9be52b0cedd32/v1.2/Report-Only-Trump-backed-Bibles-fit-bid-criteria-issued-by-Okla-state-officials.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:36:02","author":"Don Jacobson","authors":["Don Jacobson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.105},{"id":258528822,"title":"Trump Says Israel Should \"Hit\" Iran's Nuclear Facilities","text":"Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump said Friday he believes Israel should strike Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the Islamic republic's recent missile barrage.The former president, speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina, referred to a question posed to Democratic President Joe Biden this week about the possibility of Israel targeting Iran's nuclear program.\"They asked him, what do you think about Iran, would you hit Iran?

I don’t know whether it will be peaceful. The things that Trump has said, and the things that he said last time out, when he didn’t like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous,” Biden said. Biden said it was notable that Trump’s running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance, would not confirm during this week’s vice presidential debate that he would accept the outcome of the vote next month. Trump is running against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election, in a tight race that will come down to a handful of battleground states. Trump, visiting a Hurricane Helene response center in Evans, Georgia, today, said he had not heard what Biden had said. “I only can hope that it’s going to be free and fair,” he told reporters. “I think in this state it will be, and I hope in every state it will be.” U.S. prosecutors said this week that Trump had acted outside the scope of his duties as president when he pressured state officials and then-Vice President Mike Pence to try to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Their 165-page filing is likely the last opportunity for prosecutors to detail their case against Trump before the presidential election. Asked by moderators during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday, “Would you again seek to challenge this year’s election results, even if every governor certifies the results?” Vance responded by saying that he was “focused on the future.” Vance then said, “Look, what Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020.”","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden said today he is confident the upcoming presidential election will be fairly conducted, but he warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump and his running mate could refuse to accept the outcome.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/10/04/breaking-news/biden-warns-trump-may-not-peacefully-concede-election/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/web1_20241004_brk_tru02.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:20:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":258526608,"title":"Leaked tape reveals Donald Trump cracking jokes about slain firefighter Corey Comperatore's widow","text":"Leaked audio appears to reveal Donald Trump joking about Helen Comperatore, the widow of firefighter Corey Comperatore who was killed by the assassin who targeted Trump's Pennsylvania rally.

Maybe lie less? - USA TODAY","text":"The most conspicuous fault line in 2024's very peculiar presidential election has to be the histrionics Donald Trump and JD Vance have shown us about fact-checking during debates. The former one-term president and his running mate, a senator from Ohio, cast accuracy as the real looming threat to democracy in America last month and again after Tuesday's vice presidential debate. Their opponents, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, by contrast, seem almost agnostic about fact-checking but bemused by the other side's erratic eruptions when debate moderators weigh in. Which raises the question: What does all that tell you about who is more likely to speak the truth as they compete for control of the White House? I've never seen a debate winner complain about fact-checking by moderators. Harris clearly defeated Trump during their lone debate last month. And Trump has wailed since then about the two ABC News moderators who had the audacity to bring clarity to that conversation. Now it's Vance's turn to play victim, even though his debate with Walz on Tuesday evening was widely – and I'd say accurately – judged a draw between the two candidates. How a slight fact-check on the Haitian immigrant lie went poorly The CBS News debate was moderated by Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, who opened by explaining that they would \"enforce the rules and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact-check claims made by each other.\" While there had been plenty of chatter about not fact-checking the candidates, as the moderators of the ABC News debate did with Trump last month, the rules published by CBS News before the debate did not rule out moderators offering clarifying comments. Still, that became an issue when Brennan asked about immigration issues. Walz knocked Vance for previously saying that \"if I have to create stories\" to get media attention \"then that's what I'm going to do\" ‒ in justifying the senator's debunked claims about legal Haitian immigrants who were drawn to Springfield, Ohio, by open jobs. Walz said those claims \"dehumanize and villainize other human beings.\" Opinion:Who won the vice president debate? Vance and Walz spar on abortion, immigration. Republicans in Ohio, from the governor on down, have said that the claims Vance made and Trump amplified in his debate with Harris – \"They're eating the dogs. ... They're eating the cats.\" – are not true. Vance turned defensive, blaming \"millions of illegal immigrants\" for problems with housing availability and \"overwhelmed\" public schools and hospitals in Springfield and across the country. Brennan attempted to conclude the back-and-forth with this: \"And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status.\" And that's when things went from bad to worse for Vance, who clearly had trouble hearing what was meant to be the final word on the subject come from a mouth that was not his That debate moment made clear what's in store for the rest of this election Vance, openly irritated, tried to keep talking about the topic as O'Donnell attempted to head him off while turning to a question about the economy. That prompted the sound bite from Vance that you'll probably hear plenty of times in the next five weeks: \"The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check.\" It was a moment of open weakness in what had otherwise been a strong, if not always factual, performance by Vance. CBS News then muted Vance's microphone as he delved into a detailed description of how migrants seek legal status in this country. Walz's microphone was also muted as he reacted to what Vance was saying. Opinion:I was wrong about Vance. VP debate shows Republicans can win because of him. That came as an abrupt moment of political parity in a debate where Vance, up to that point, had seemed far more polished and adept than Walz. It was also a signal, as it was last month in the presidential debate, for Trump-Vance ticket allies to start barking at the refs when the game stopped going their way. Time to blame the moderators. 'The moderators were obnoxious' Trump's campaign sent the message as the debate continued, posting video of Vance's exchange with the moderators on social media while claiming, \"They got so annoyed that they cut off his mic.\" U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who long ago tried to fact-check Trump before completely surrendering to his party's titular leader, got the message and posted this complaint about fact-checking two minutes later: \"Once again another major media outlet embarrasses themselves on a debate stage.\" Fox News, of course, chimed in. Political analyst Brit Hume offered this on the channel after the debate was over: \"The moderators were obnoxious – and made it feel like three-on-one on Vance – and Vance was just fine.\" Trump's camp quickly circulated a video of that, too, on social media. If Hume's phrasing – \"three on one\" – rings familiar, it's because that's the same line Trump and his allies have been muttering over and over again since his ABC News debate last month with Harris. Here is how Trump's campaign expressed that sentiment in a news release the day after last month's debate: \"Last night's debate was an indisputable victory for President Donald J. Trump — despite a disgraceful three-on-one format.\" Republicans see fact-checking as unfair Trump has used for nearly a decade a political tactic of playing the victor and victim – always claiming triumph while insisting he had to overcome a rigged system to get there. Vance, not long ago seen as an engaging and interesting intellectual (who detested Trump), has abandoned all that to be Trump's victor-victim disciple. Vance fancies himself as an advocate for free speech. But Trump suggested that ABC News should lose its broadcast license for what he deemed \"unfair\" treatment during his debate. If none of that adds up for you, that's because it's not supposed to. You can't oppose accuracy and make sense. You have to pick. Trump and Vance have clearly chosen, given their aversion to fact-checking.

They said it “assumed that [Hoover] had committed uncharged murders,” and they said the judge pressured Bonjean into disclosing them. They also called the question “wildly out of bounds” and pointed to news reports about it. They specifically highlighted the Sept. 27 front page of the Chicago Sun-Times, which quoted the judge over a photo of Hoover. The defense attorneys noted that Blakey, in asking his question, stressed that Bonjean should answer it “as an officer of the court” — a reminder of her duty to tell the truth. They also complained that Blakey suggested Bonjean ask Hoover for the answer, noting that “he probably has the most knowledge of all.” Hoover participated in the hearing by video. Blakey, a former prosecutor, has spent a decade on the bench since his 2014 nomination by President Barack Obama. He also presides over the corruption case against former Illinois House Speaker Michael J. Madigan, which goes to trial next week. Hoover’s attorney’s argue he should get a new sentencing hearing under the First Step Act, a 2018 law signed by President Donald Trump. That prompted the rare public appearance by Hoover in Blakey’s courtroom. The former gang leader has spent decades serving a life sentence in the so-called supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. Hoover was convicted of murder after a trial in December 1973, and a judge sentenced him to 150 to 200 years in state prison. That didn’t stop Hoover from running the gang, though. The late U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber handed the gang leader his life sentence in 1998 following his conviction for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. Hoover would still have to serve his state-court sentence if his federal sentence is undone. Still, the hearing in Blakey’s courtroom was seen as a potential step toward his freedom. But Bonjean seemed taken aback during arguments when Blakey asked her how many murders she’d lay at her 73-year-old client’s feet. She initially said she wasn’t sure how to answer. She wasn’t sure how to properly count. She sarcastically suggested that Hoover is responsible for every murder ever committed by a member of the Gangster Disciples. Ultimately, she said, “I would like to answer that question.” The judge gave her 11 days — until Monday — to do it.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2024/10/04/gang-leader-larry-hoover-asks-judge-to-recuse-hinself-over-wildly-out-of-bounds-murders-question","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e77db3d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/840x480+0+40/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fae%2Fc6%2Fb3d6b5f23cab03caaea82d5ce204%2Fhoover2","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:17:13","author":"Jon Seidel","authors":["Jon Seidel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":258526816,"title":"Oklahoma Schools Need 55,000 Bibles.

Vance, the junior Republican senator from Ohio, and Walz, Democratic governor of Minnesota, debated each other in what is likely to be the last match-off before election day. Poll watchers declared the event essentially a tie. According to a CBS News poll, 42 percent of debate watchers said Vance won the debate, while 41 percent thought Walz emerged as the winner. Overall, debate watchers thought the tone of the debate was positive. Seventeen percent called the debate a tie. Speaking on the Ruthless Podcast, Vance said he wasn’t sure how he did during the event until it was over. “You don’t really know when you’re doing this, your adrenaline is going, you’re trying not to say anything stupid. You don’t actually know how it’s going really,” Former President Donald Trump’s running mate said. “But my wife comes out at the very end, just sort of like this one final, you know, segment for the TV cameras. Gwen Walz comes up, my wife comes up, and I look at Usha’s face and I just knew. “Usha doesn’t lie to me and her face especially doesn’t lie to me and I knew that minute that we had had a very good debate.” Vance addressed a snapshot of him from the event that’s now gone viral. In one moment, he’s seen looking into the TV cameras in what social media has called a Jim Halpert from The Office look. The candidate said he was trying to pay attention to the timer right next to the camera so he would be ready for his turn to speak. “The timer is right by the camera,” Vance said. “So I was just, you know, I was trying to pay attention to what [Walz] is saying. But then you have to be ready for when his time is up, because then it’s your turn to speak.” Vance said he could tell Walz was struggling as the CBS News moderators questioned him about whether he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests. The governor said he “misspoke” and was not in fact in Hong Kong at the time, but was there at one point that summer. “It’s like the old Sun Tzu quote, right?” Vance said, referring to the Chinese military general and philosopher. “When your enemy is making a mistake, don’t interrupt him. I was just like, shut up. Do not say a damn thing, JD. Silence.” The quote is often attributed to another famous military strategist, Napoleon Bonaparte. Vance said his ultimate strategy during the debate was to use it as an opportunity to inform voters about Vice President Kamala Harris’s record. “Ultimately, that was the right strategy,” he said. However, Vance himself was perceived to have had rocky moments during the debate, particularly when questioned about Trump’s efforts to change the result of the 2020 election, and when Vance claimed that Trump had “saved” Obamacare, despite his repeated vows and efforts to overturn it.","summary":"‘When your enemy is making a mistake, don’t interrupt him,’ Vance said of his debate performance","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-the-office-meme-b2624208.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/04/23/SEI224105841.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/i57jcVrQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:10:05","author":"Michelle Del Rey","authors":["Michelle Del Rey"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":258527930,"title":"Dimon denies Trump endorsement after Truth Social post","text":"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is denying claims that he endorsed former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election.

Trashelle Odom, who describes herself as a proud Republican, told CBS News she “just broke down” when a friend called her this summer and said that the Trump campaign was bringing Lewandowski back on board. Lewandowski’s return to MAGA politics came just three years after Odom, then the 32-year-old wife of a deep-pocketed GOP donor, alleged that he sexually harassed her at a Las Vegas charity event. Odom detailed that night in her CBS interview, saying she recalled Lewandowski placing his hands in her lap without permission as they sat at dinner. She said that Lewandowski caressed her leg and was “going up my side and like, trying to touch my butt.” “I felt like I was his prey,” she told CBS News. “He was very persistent, aggressive.” At one point, Odom said that Lewandowski threw his drink at her. When she confronted him about it, Odom said he started laughing. After the dinner, Lewandowski was accused of stalking Odom through the venue while spewing lewd remarks—like boasting about how his “workout routines” contributed to his sexual prowess. Odom reported it all to police. Lewandowski, who was Trump’s 2016 campaign manager, was charged with criminal sexual harassment but got a plea deal that included “impulse control training.” He also had to pay a $1,000 fine and apologized to Odom in court for “any discomfort he may have caused her.” Odom said that Lewandowski offered her more than $30,000 to keep quiet about the episode, but she refused. She said Friday that Trump himself even gave her a call to apologize and say that Lewandowski was drunk. Donald Trump Jr. gave her a call, too. “He was very kind and said things to make me feel like Corey would not be there anymore,” Odom said Friday, recalling her convo with Don Jr. The incident with Odom came years after Lewandowski was hit with other concerning accusations from women, including one who told police that Lewandowski, against her wishes, had slapped her butt during a holiday party in 2017 at the Trump International Hotel. That woman ultimately declined to press charges. Odom, now 35, emphasized that she doesn’t want her trauma to be politicized so close to Election Day, but said she felt she had to speak out after seeing Lewandowski once again being a public figure in the Trump campaign. She said she fears Lewandowski has not changed. “If I can give just a little bit to one person, me speaking up is worth it,” she said through tears.","summary":"CBS NewsThe woman who accused Corey Lewandowski of harassing and stalking her in a hotel—the incident that saw him ousted from Donald Trump’s orbit in 2021—fought back tears as she discussed his return to politics on Friday.  \n\nTrashelle Odom, who describes herself as a proud Republican, told CBS News she “just broke down” when a friend called her this summer and said that the Trump campaign was bringing Lewandowski back on board. \n\nLewandowski’s return to MAGA politics came just three years after Odom, then the 32-year-old wife of a deep-pocketed GOP donor, alleged that he sexually harassed her at a Las Vegas charity event. \n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/corey-lewandowskis-accuser-fights-back-tears-as-she-speaks-about-his-maga-return","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_881,w_1566,x_0,y_63/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1728081205/Screenshot_2024-10-04_at_6.33.08_PM_bwbwu6","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:08:55","author":"Josh Fiallo","authors":["Josh Fiallo"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.477},{"id":258527140,"title":"Constellation Brands CEO downplays worries about higher tariffs if Trump wins","text":"In a Friday interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands brushed off concerns about the possibility of higher tariffs, which former President Donald Trump has pledged to implement if elected. \"First of all, assuming there was a Trump administration, we already had four years of a Trump administration, and our business was up double-digit during that window of time,\" Newlands said. \"Two, we have a fair amount of our inputs that come from the United States and then are made into beer in Mexico.

Numerous polls show she is closing the gap between herself and former President Donald Trump over who is better equipped to handle the economy—particularly after a report dropped Friday showing job growth exceeding expectations. “This is a great weekend for Harris … because of the dock strike, which could have exacerbated supply and inflation problems, and the big growth in jobs. So, you know, I think the Harris campaign has good reason to celebrate,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told the Washington Examiner. The strike, now delayed until Jan. 15, takes a potentially disastrous campaign problem off the table for Harris, particularly as she struggles to reach swing voters on top 2024 matters, such as immigration and the war in the Middle East. Peter Loge, political scientist and director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, told the Washington Examiner the ending of the strike is good for Harris because it’s “one less thing to talk about,” and it would “create an opening for Trump.” “The Trump campaign is saying, in the face of chaos and uncertainty, you need a firm, resolute leader,” Loge said. “The less chaos, the less uncertainty, the better for Harris-Walz. Avoiding a strike takes a bit of chaos and uncertainty off of the table.” Biden administration navigates deal ahead of 2024 election Biden made his first briefing room appearance Friday since taking office, praising the negotiations and tentative agreement made by the International Longshoremen’s Association and United States Maritime Alliance the day prior. “We averted what could have become a major crisis for the country,” Biden said. “I especially want to thank the carriers, the port operators, and the longshoremen union for reaching this agreement at a time when the nation has experienced such terrible devastation from Hurricane Helene,” he added. “It was truly a service to the American people for all these parties to come together and respond to our request to keep the ports open.” Sources close to the president told the Washington Examiner that White House officials began taking a direct interest in the negotiating process in early September, suggesting that Biden himself was personally involved in the administration’s efforts from Sept. 26 to Oct. 3. Those sources gave the Washington Examiner a detailed, day-by-day recounting of the administration’s efforts to avoid, and eventually end, the ILA strike, including five specific meetings between the president’s Cabinet and senior representatives of the carriers, during which the administration pressured USMX to meet ILA’s wage increase demands. The month opened with chief of staff Jeff Zients holding weekly meetings with National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to understand the “lay of the land” and strategize how to bring both parties to the table. Those convenings progressed into daily outreach to USMX and ILA by the president’s Cabinet in hopes of avoiding major work stoppages. As it became clear that neither USMX nor ILA planned on being the first to broach negotiations, Biden himself met with that team on Sept. 26 and directed them to reach out to both parties on his behalf to speed the process along. The following day, Brainard, Su, and Buttigieg hosted USMX officials at the White House’s Eisenhower Executive Office Building to pressure the carrier to extend a new contract offer, a major roadblock in bringing ILA back into negotiations. USMX had not put forth a new offer since 2023. During that meeting, the Biden administration urged USMX to end the stalemate. “Whether you chose to use your power, that’s your decision,” Brainard left it to USMX, according to a person in the room. That day, Biden also put forward his first public comments about a strike, where he reiterated his belief in collective bargaining and said he would not invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to end a strike. Still, Biden also began directing top administration officials over the weekend to prepare for supply chain disruptions in the event of a strike the following week. Any work stoppages could have caused prices to increase ahead of the holidays or delayed greatly needed aid from reaching people in the Southeast recovering from the recent damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Monday provided another opportunity for Zients, Brainard, Buttigieg, and Su to meet virtually with the USMX CEOs, where USMX proposed its first new offer since last year, which still fell short of ILA’s demands. On Tuesday, the first day of the strike, Biden issued another statement pressuring USMX to put forward a “fair offer,” while Zients looped in Biden’s inner circle of personal, White House advisers, Ben LaBolt, Mike Donilon, and Steve Ricchetti, into the Cabinet-level working group. Wednesday proved a major breakthrough for the Biden team after Brainard successfully got global ships to increase the offer, though sources say it still fell short of ILA demands. Public pressure from the Biden administration, coupled with a 5:30 a.m. call between Zients, his working group, and USMX, finally led to a tentative agreement Thursday. ILA leadership and USMX leadership agreed to a 62% increase in workers’ wages over six years, a significant bump from the 50% wage increase offered earlier in the week. The tentative agreement will boost the hourly wage to $63 per hour, up from $39 per hour under the expired contract. Strategists split on strike’s impact on Harris campaign The delayed strike likely won’t do much for the Harris campaign in the long run in the eyes of Dan Bowling, a visiting professor at Georgia State University’s law school. If the strike had continued, it might have increased inflation and had a severe affect on the supply chain. With the delay, the Harris campaign no longer has to worry about it directly affecting her. “They probably weren’t really hanging it around Kamala’s neck,” Bowling said. “Now, if we had shortages in a couple of weeks, which we might have very well … that would have had a negative impact, definitely on Harris.” Bowling “doubt if it impacts” Harris in the long run as he believes the average voter was not paying attention to the port strike. “I suppose if she had flown in, we had seen her at the bargaining table and coming out, making statements to the press on how things were going, what she was doing … it would have helped her. I don’t think it’s going to make a big difference,” Bowling said. Both Harris and Trump blamed foreign shipping companies for the port strike, releasing similar statements supporting workers demanding a fair share of wages. Trump had worked to try and use the port strike to his campaign’s advantage, arguing that Republicans are the “party of the American worker.” He said at a rally in Michigan on Thursday that “under my leadership, Americans won’t have to go on strike for a better wage or a better life.” He also blamed the strike on “massive inflation” caused by the “Harris-Biden regime.” Loge agreed with Bowling that the average voter, particularly in swing states, likely did not pay attention to the port strike as much as the topics “dominating national and global headlines” — the Israel-Hamas war, damage from Hurricane Helene, and fires in California, to name a few. However, he thinks the tentative agreement is “the best possible result” for the Harris campaign as it shows the economy is moving in a positive direction. “The extent that we’re not having a strike, to the extent that inflation continues to come down, that the economy continues to be settling, helps Harris in general,” Loge said. Loge and Bannon said the delay of the port strike gives Harris a chance to move her economic agenda forward. “The fact that the owners and the workers on the docks were able to come to an agreement, the economy’s on the upswing, and that feelings are better illustrates the fact that there is a possibility to the end of political polarization in American politics if she wins and Trumps loses,” Bannon suggested. “So I think she should say, ‘Good economic times are on the horizon,’ and the hopes of the economy will keep climbing if she’s president and not Trump.’”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris dodged a significant problem this week after the Biden administration helped negotiate a deal that delayed the historic United States port strike until after the 2024 election.

According to new reporting by The Oklahoman, state Superintendent Ryan Walters opened bids to purchase 55,000 Bibles for schools. Interestingly, a Bible endorsed by Donald Trump, known as “Lee Greenwood’s God Bless the U.S.A. Bible,” is one of only two that fits the bill—and the other one is endorsed by his son, Donald Jr. According to the request for proposals, the “Bibles must be the King James Version; must contain the Old and New Testaments; must include copies of the Pledge of Allegiance, Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights; and must be bound in leather or leather-like material.” That sure does seem specific. “A salesperson at Mardel Christian & Education searched, and though they carry 2,900 Bibles, none fit the parameters,” according to The Oklahoman—except the one that the former president gets a cut from. Bid documents indicate the supplier must provide a total of 55,000 Bibles to the Oklahoma State Board of Education and each school district. With the Trump-endorsed Bibles selling at a lavish $60 each, that would be a $3.3 million purchase. That’s quite an excessive order as, according to the report, there are only 43,000 classroom teachers in the state—and Walters has claimed he only “wants them in classes where the Bible might apply to academic standards, such as history or literature.” The request for the Bibles could violate state law, according to former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson. “It appears to me that this bid is anything but competitive,” Edmondson told The Oklahoman. “It adds to the basic specification other requirements that have nothing to do with the text. The special binding and inclusion of government documents will exclude almost all bidders. If the bid specs exclude most bidders unnecessarily, I could consider that a violation.” Not to mention that paperback versions of the King James Bible are available for as little as $2.99 each, as The Oklahoman points out. Looks like Sooner State schools might have to pay quite a hefty Trump tax on those Good Books. This is part of a broader trend of conservative states like Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Kentucky integrating religious texts into public education, often justifying it by claiming they teach students about the historical foundations of the United States. This is far from the first time Trump has used his political brand to grift. Recent Daily Kos reporting details how he and his family engaged in profiteering throughout his presidency and during this campaign by hawking jewelry, cryptocurrency, sneakers, and coins, among other products. During a June press conference, Walters said he sees the Bible as “a necessary historic document” that’s essential to learn about “Western civilization” and “the basis of our legal system.” “Every teacher, every classroom in the state will have a Bible in the classroom,” said Walters. “And will be teaching from the Bible in the classroom.” As the debate continues, many are left wondering how this initiative will affect Oklahoma’s already abysmal education system—and if it’ll set a precedent for more states to follow suit.","summary":"So much for separation of church and state.\n\n\n\nAccording to new reporting by The Oklahoman, state Superintendent Ryan Walters opened bids to purchase 55,000 Bibles for schools.

Last year, Mahomes and Taylor Swift struck up a bond as they cheered on their respective Kansas City Chiefs beaus Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. Yet whispers of tension surfaced at the season's start when they were seen seated separately at Arrowhead Stadium. Speculation intensified when Brittany liked an Instagram post from Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Contrastingly, Swift has demonstrated Democratic leanings and recently backed Kamala Harris for the upcoming November election. However, both have made efforts to quash speculation about a bitter WAG dispute, showing unity at Patrick Mahomes' 29th birthday celebration and jointly appearing at the U. S. Open in Flushing Meadows. The Daily Mail reports that a peace accord was reached between Swift and Mrs. Mahomes last August, agreeing to avoid political chat. Nevertheless, Brittany took to Instagram on Thursday with a thought-provoking phrase: \"Be the reason why people believe in beautiful souls, kind hearts, and good energy. Never stop being a good person.\" Former GOP candidate Trump hasn't shied away from commenting on the rumoured rift. After Swift's public backing of Harris, Trump stated on his Truth social platform: \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT! \". During an interview on \"Fox and Friends\", Trump expressed his preference for Brittany Mahomes, stating: \"Well, I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the truth,\" and noting that she is a strong supporter of his. However, Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris could have a significant impact on the closely contested election. Her Instagram post backing Harris garnered over 11 million likes and sparked a surge in online voter registration. Following the September 11 debate between Trump and Harris, Swift announced: \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for Kamala Harris because she fights for the rights and causes that I believe need a warrior to champion them.\" \"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.

Trump appeared next to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp near Augusta for the first time since the former president attacked him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election results in the battleground state. The two recently made up privately, and on Friday afternoon stood before piles of supplies that included Huggies baby diapers, other paper products and water in front and behind a table and podium.

The governor left the pavilion where the press conference was held just as Trump answered questions from the media, and in the process attacked President Joe Biden. Trump lost Georgia to Biden by fewer than 12,000 votes in the last election cycle. Trump’s efforts to subvert the election results there led to his indictment and an ongoing legal case. On Friday, Trump seemed to make a rare confession that he had lost in the Peach State. ‘I won easily in 2016,’ Trump said. ‘We actually were very close last time.’ Former President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Georgia Governor Brian Kemp did a ‘fantastic job’ with Hurricane Helene relief efforts (Picture: EPA) After Trump left, National Guard service members started taking away the toilet paper, diapers and supplies. Trump earlier visited the Columbia County Performing Arts Center in Evans, which was badly bettered by Helene after the Category 4 storm landfall in Florida on September 26. It is not the first time Trump has been surrounded by somewhat comical products to make a point. In August, Trump in New Jersey pitched his economic plan and blamed his 2024 opponent Kamala Harris for rising prices while surrounded by pastries, pie, sweet cereals and other sugary breakfast foods.

It’s a triumph of modern innovation: The devices connect to low-orbiting satellites, allowing first responders to communicate and providing 30 days of free internet access to residents of storm-ravaged areas who’d otherwise be completely cut off. Of course, as Musk himself pointed out, Starlink likely would’ve already been up and running in some of these areas if the Harris-Biden Federal Communications Commission hadn’t slammed the breaks on a $885 million grant to SpaceX to provide broadband to rural communities back in 2022. That Musk needs to step in at all is another indictment of Harris-Biden bungling. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law set aside $42 billion-with-a-B to build broadband infrastructure in rural and underserved communities; so far, Harris-Biden haven’t connected anyone. Their “Broadband Equity Access and Deployment” program just reached it’s “year of execution” this year; now comes its four-year timeline for “implementation” — a level of inefficiency that only government can get away with. Sorry, Helene victims. Kam and Joe will have you covered in 2028 . . . maybe. It’s hardly the first time Musk has come to the rescue: See the use of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon to retrieve astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, whose “one week” visit to the International Space Station has stretched to months thanks to poor decision-making by NASA and a faulty Boeing craft. Elon also sent thousands of Starlink kits to Ukraine in the early of the Russia invasion — a huge boon to Kyiv’s defense, as it enabled communication and drone warfare in areas where both would have otherwise been impossible. Musk is reviled by the left because of his commitment to protecting free speech, even the speech of (gasp!) conservatives. But when the feds biff it, he has repeatedly jumped in to pick up the slack. Donald Trump’s already embraced Musk’s call for a government efficiency commission; Elon might even head it.

Springsteen made the announcement in a video posted to Instagram. “Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does than at this moment,” Springsteen said in the video, shot inside of a diner. “It doesn’t have to be this way.” The Boss added: “Donald Trump is the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime. His disdain for the sanctity of our Constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from the office of president ever again. He doesn’t understand the meaning of this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American.” Springsteen said that Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, “are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow the economy in a way that benefits all, not just a few like me. On top, that’s the vision of America I’ve been consistently writing about for 55 years.” He concluded: “Now, everybody sees things different, and I respect your choice as a fellow citizen. But like you, I’ve only got one vote, and it’s one of the most precious possessions that I have. That’s why come Nov. 5 I’ll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Thanks for listening.” The news of his endorsement is hardly surprising, as Springsteen was a vocal supporter of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 when she went up against Trump. Springsteen joins the likes of Taylor Swift, Oprah, Sigourney Weaver, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, George Clooney, Beyoncé, Charli XCX, Billie Eilish and Chappell Roan, who have all thrown their support behind Harris.","summary":"Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Kamala Harris and labelled Donald Trump as &#8220;the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.&#8221; ADVERTISEMENT Legendary &#8216;Born in the USA&#8217; singer Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Kamala Harris for president, adding his name to a long list of celebrities backing the Democratic nominee.

Over the past months the former president has seemingly become more and more obsessed with attendance, as well as his ratings and other optics – so much so that it has become a target of jabs and jokes by the Democratic party. However despite his claim that “nobody” leaves his rallies, made at a recent town hall event in Flint, Michigan, it seems that that is not quite true. In fact, scores of punters have been known, and seen on live broadcasts, to be leaving the events early. Trump has appeared to become more frustrated and fixated with crowd size ever since Kamala Harris needled him over it during their presidential debate, when she suggested people leave early out of “exhaustion and boredom.” “She said people start leaving, people don’t go to her rallies there’s no reason to go,” Trump shot back, while Harris laughed silently. “People don’t leave my rallies, we have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.” However, interviews conducted by the Washington Post of various supporters leaving the rallies, found that among the things affecting their decision were Trump’s tardiness, the length of his speeches, and his rhetoric. At a recent rally in Las Vegas, a Post reporter standing by the door counted more than 200 people leaving in the first 20 minutes. According to the outlet one attendee said they were still pro-Trump, but that he would have said “You’re fired” if anyone else had been as late as he was. The ex-president was reportedly an hour late taking the stage. Anastasia Bennett, 22, told the outlet that she had become tired of the former president’s constant insults – she now intends to vote for Harris. “It was the insults and just being an hour late,” she said. At a rally in Tucson, Arizona Carlos Chaboya, 65, said that he had arrived for the rally at 8.30am and was still one of the last to be let in. He had to leave early because he had to fix the internet for his daughter at home. “I gotta get it back up for her, so I’m gonna go do that,” Chaboya, who is retired, told the Post. Other guests have expressed frustration that even after driving long distances to see Trump speak and waiting for hours, they are still denied entry. The former president has seemed undeterred by concerns of his length, and has reportedly ignored advice to cut down on time by advisors. “They want a show. They want two hours,” he previously told an ally, who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity. However, some within the Trump campaign are still onboard with the president’s rhetoric around his speeches. “The fake news media never wants to report the truth about President Trump’s rallies: they are the biggest political events in history,” Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Everywhere President Trump goes, thousands of supporters show up to see him, waiting in line for hours to hear him deliver his uplifting message to make America strong, safe, and wealthy again.”","summary":"Over the past months the former president has seemingly become more and more obsessed with attendance – amid claims that his fans are leaving early ‘out of frustration and boredom’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-people-leaving-rally-reason-b2624212.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/04/16/SEI222951488.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/sltzmnoN-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:42:55","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":258524060,"title":"Firefighters nonendorsement latest example of Harris struggle with white men","text":"The International Association of Fire Fighters has joined the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in declining to make a presidential endorsement this election season. Perhaps most worryingly for Harris, both cited feedback from rank-and-file members as the reason behind their decisions. “Over the past year, the IAFF took unprecedented steps to hear our members’ views on the candidates and the policy issues that matter most to them,” the union’s general president, Edward Kelly, said in a prepared statement. “The IAFF Executive Board determined that we are better able to advocate for our members and make progress on the issues that matter to them if we, as a union, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder.” “Standing shoulder to shoulder” apparently means not backing either candidate, though Kelly said the vote among the executive board was close. Both IAFF and the Teamsters had consistently endorsed Democratic candidates dating back to the 1990s, both endorsed President Joe Biden, and both represent a largely white male, non-college-educated workforce. In IAFF’s case, the contrast between 2020 and 2024 is even more stark. It was the very first union to endorse Biden when he announced his candidacy, showcasing enthusiastic support for his bid. But it also declined to endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016, indicating a particular weakness she and Harris have with its membership. “Harris’s lack of endorsement from the IAFF, following the Teamsters’s decision, suggests a broader growing issue for Democrats with union support, especially among non-college-educated white men,” Democratic strategist Tom Cochran said. “The fact that both Harris and Clinton failed to secure the IAFF’s backing while Biden did raises questions about whether this is more about the party’s broader struggles with blue-collar workers than the candidates themselves.” But Cochran, a partner at 720 Strategies, doubted the problem was the candidates’ gender, adding, “The bigger issue seems to be a disconnect between Democrats and organized labor.” Any slippage in union support will be a worrying factor for the Harris campaign through Election Day, even as she gains with broader demographic groups such as women and college-educated voters. Biden and Harris are both strong backers of organized labor, and Harris has received the support of most major unions, but Biden brought decades of experience with the groups and loved to share stories of his “Scranton Joe” upbringing in working-class Pennsylvania. That’s a more difficult connection for Harris, a California native whose parents held doctorate degrees, to make. Polling bears out that she struggles in particular with white men. A recent CNN poll found former President Donald Trump leading with that group, 58%-35%, while white women still favor Trump but by a much smaller margin of 50%-47%. Teamsters internal polling found a huge drop-off from Biden to Harris. The union’s membership preferred Biden over Trump by 9 points, but after he quit the race they went for Trump by 25 points over Harris. The issue for Harris isn’t just with white men, however. An NBC News-Telemundo-CNBC poll of Hispanic voters found Harris leading with the demographic overall by 9 points but trailing with working-class Latino men and with all Latino men under 50. Dan Bowling, who teaches labor courses at Georgia State University’s law school, said he wasn’t surprised at the IAFF snub, and pointed to issues the union had with Democrats that predate the Biden-Harris switch. The union pushed back against COVID-19 vaccine mandates early in Biden’s term, for example. “A firefighter, male or female, is a different breed of cat, and they fit right into the trend that we’ve been noticing of people with blue-collar jobs, whether they’re building factories, delivering goods, or fighting fires, relating far more to Trump,” Bowling said. Bowling mentioned previous elections such as 2012, when the IAFF endorsed President Barack Obama over GOP challenger Mitt Romney, as evidence its members are not necessarily looking at demographics. “Romney is not a guy with grease under his fingernails,” Bowling said, contrasting him with Trump’s image as a developer who has been photographed wearing a hard hat at construction sites. The Trump campaign is aggressively courting union voters this cycle, calling itself the most pro-worker Republican ticket in history. That’s not to say all IAFF members are on board for the GOP ticket. In late August, vice presidential nominees Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and Gov.

Between grilling the Republican leader on corporate taxes and inflation, Ramsey questioned him about how he selects \"quality leaders\" for his staff and administration. According to OK Magazine, Trump surprisingly responded by lauding his elder children, \"Well, my son Eric is very much involved and he runs a lot of it. Don [Jr.] helps out a lot. Ivanka to a lesser extent,\" the GOP nominee said. \"She's a great mother and everything.\" \"She did a fantastic job in the administration. All she wanted to do was to get people jobs ... It's really pretty amazing,\" Trump explained. \"She could have had a very glamorous job and she would've done well.\" He added, \"But Eric's done a great job and I did a similar type of job when I was doing it. Now, I'm doing a thing called running for president,\" he concluded. However, internet users disapproved of his remarks and accused the Trump family of nepotism. \"Hiring family over qualified individuals raises questions about loyalty versus competence. Does nepotism really benefit the country?\" an X user slammed. \"It’s all in the family, Dave. I hire all my kids while Melania & I grift,\" a critic wrote. \"Sounds like nepotism,\" another person agreed. A major nepo baby syndrome in that family, including with Donald himself,\" an X user stated. \"Hiring family over qualified professionals should raise concern. This is also Trump’s family so the bar is already set as low as it could go,\" a netizen raged. Meanwhile, a few online users agreed with Trump's views, \"Good genes… there is nothing wrong with valuing your family and giving them responsibilities in your business. This is totally normal if you stop to consider it for a moment,\" a person praised. \"That's awesome! He genuinely loves his family,\" another netizen supported. The contentious comments are made at a time when Ivanka is thinking about returning to her father's campaign trail following a prolonged absence. \"After a long-standing position of ruling it out, she’s more open to it. It’s getting more real, it’s revving up,\" a source revealed. \"Ivanka has gotten the urge again, but Jared has been a lot more focused on his investment business and being a lot more measured about discussing a return.\" \"Ivanka and Jared continue to focus on their family and lives in the private sector and do not intend to go back to politics,\" a Trump family spokesperson later clarified. Meanwhile, in a 2023 interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, the Republican leader asserted that his children will not be part of his administration in case he wins the elections. “I said, ‘That’s enough for the family,’” Trump said. “It’s too painful for the family. My family has been through hell.” “Eric, my son, is a fine boy. You know him very well. He’s a fine young man. A good student, good everything,” Trump continued. “Nobody has been through what my family has been through. Ivanka had a really successful line of clothing. I mean, making a fortune. When I did this, she was really — she closed it up.” \"I love my father very much,\" according to People, Ivanka wrote in November 2022 while distancing herself from politics. \"This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family.\" \"I do not plan to be involved in politics,\" she added. \"While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena.\"","summary":"His contentious comments came in at a time when Ivanka is thinking about returning to her father&#39;s campaign trail following a prolonged absence.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-accused-of-nepotism-after-boasting-about-hiring-his-children-as-quality-leaders","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/718596/uploads/1d16bfa0-821c-11ef-9db0-fd8eeda72932_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:34:11","author":"INQUISITR,Mary Anthony","authors":["INQUISITR","Mary Anthony"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.214},{"id":258524304,"title":"CNN criticizes Biden for ‘dominating’ attention as Kamala Harris appears on stage in crucial swing state","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris was set to make an appearance in the suburbs of Detroit on Friday when her boss President Joe Biden appeared to steal the limelight making a surprise appearance in the White House press briefing just moments before she took the stage to give remarks. It was the first time the president has shown up in the briefing room. CNN took note of the dueling appearances as it happened. ‘We were actually about to go live to Vice President Kamala Harris who’s speaking right now in Detroit, Michigan,’ anchor Boris Sanchez said on air. ‘And apparently she’s talking about this port strike ending, she’s trying to appeal to union workers, and yet you have the President of the United States come out, clearly overshadowing her, answering significant questions,’ he continued. Sanchez questioned if it was a ‘communications mistake? Is the left hand not talking to the right hand in this situation?’ Political strategist Frank Luntz who was a guest on CNN responded that had the two sides been coordinating ‘this would not have happened.’ Harris was in Redford Township, Michigan on Friday afternoon where she spoke of the importance of organized labor and offered praise for first responders while speaking to a room of firefighters and union members. Her appearance standing next to a firetruck in the Redford Township Fire Department North Station comes as the firefighters union declined to endorse Harris or Trump in the 2024. The non-endorsement is seen as a blow to the vice president after the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), represents over 350,000 firefighters, emergency responders and other medical workers was the first union to endorse President Biden in 2020. ‘Yours is a profession that is more than a profession, it really is about a calling,’ Harris told the crowd after receiving a warm welcome. She noted that her brother-in-law is a retired firefighter in California. ‘I know what you guys do, and I know your character,’ Harris said. ‘I know your families. I know what it means for the whole community for you all to take on the lives that you have decided to live, and I am so thankful to you.’ She praised them for working ‘long shifts with unpredictable hours’ under ‘some of the most dangerous conditions.’ Harris said she’s grateful for the union that supports them and their rights to ‘all they deserve in terms of wages and benefits.’ She was introduced by the president of the Michigan Professional Firefighters Union. The IAFF is the latest major union to withhold an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race. Last month, the Teamsters union declined to endorse a presidential candidate, though multiple local chapters threw their support behind the Democratic nominee. During her appearance, Harris also addressed the International Longshoremen’s Association agreeing to suspend a strike that closed down major ports just weeks before the election. Harris this week signaled support for the union workers after the strike began Tuesday. On Friday, the vice president praised the agreement stating ‘they did good.’ ‘I say everywhere I go, look collective bargaining benefits everybody,’ Harris said. Later in her speech, Harris blasted Donald Trump as an ‘unserious – human,’ pausing before she said the word human as if she would like to have said something else as she went after him over health care and treatment of American workers.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris was set to make an appearance in the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CNN criticizes Biden for &#8216;dominating&#8217; attention as Kamala Harris appears on stage in crucial swing state first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/cnn-criticizes-biden-for-dominating-attention-as-kamala-harris-appears-on-stage-in-crucial-swing-state/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/04/20/90472061-13926161-President_Biden_giving_remarks_in_the_White_House_press_briefing-m-63_1728069989485.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:32:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":258525288,"title":"Trump Set to Return to Butler, Pa., Site of Assassination Attempt","text":"Five days after being shot by a would-be assassin in Butler, Pa., former President Donald J.

Musk accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) of blocking his satellite internet company, Starlink, from delivering to parts of North Carolina decimated by the hurricane, a claim both Fema and Buttigieg said was false. “No one is shutting down the airspace and FAA doesn’t block legitimate rescue and recovery flights. If you’re encountering a problem give me a call,” Buttigieg wrote. Musk replied that he had seen hundreds of such reports and would phone. Musk had spent several hours on Friday raging on X against Fema over what he called “belligerent government incompetence”. Posting texts allegedly received from “a SpaceX engineer on the ground”, he accused the federal agency of blockading the disaster area and preventing private helicopters from delivering Starlink terminals, which connect to satellite internet service, and other supplies. Musk wrote, “SpaceX engineers are trying to deliver Starlink terminals & supplies to devastated areas in North Carolina right now and @FEMA is both failing to help AND won’t let others help. This is unconscionable!!” When reached for comment on Musk’s allegations, Fema issued a statement similar to Buttigieg’s: “The claims about FEMA confiscating or taking commodities, supplies or resources in North Carolina, Tennessee, or any state impacted by Helene are false. “FEMA has helped provide Starlink terminals to the state of North Carolina, including to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Nation and critical lifeline locations as determined by the state. These units are supporting state and local municipalities, Urban Search and Rescue and disaster coordination. Starlink units have been sent to multiple states in support of Hurricane Helene response efforts,” said Jaclyn Rothenberg, Fema director of public affairs. Still, Donald Trump amplified Musk’s claims on his app Truth Social. Musk said he would join the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. False information has swirled in the communications blackout that has followed Hurricane Helene’s devastation. Phone and power lines were down across the south. Trump falsely accused Joe Biden of failing to call Georgia’s governor after the storm, when Biden had phoned Brian Kemp. Musk has a history of inserting himself into rescue operations. In 2018, he offered to deliver a small submersible to Thailand to assist with the rescue of a boys’ soccer team, which divers on the scene called a “PR stunt”. In response, Musk called the head rescuer a “pedo guy”, eliciting a defamation suit that Musk later won.","summary":"The billionaire’s accusations about his satellite internet company are, Fema and transportation secretary say\n\nPete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, shot down criticism by Elon Musk on the government’s handling of Hurricane Helene relief efforts, accusing the SpaceX CEO of spreading misinformation.\n\nMusk accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) of blocking his satellite internet company, Starlink, from delivering to parts of North Carolina decimated by the hurricane, a claim both Fema and Buttigieg said was false.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/04/pete-buttigieg-fema-starlink-musk-hurricane-helene","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ebd89c8c978a4cfb269bfc905600424ffb3e7b/0_150_4742_2847/master/4742.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:29:18","author":"Blake Montgomery","authors":["Blake Montgomery"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.41},{"id":258523568,"title":"Oklahoma's request for Bible supplier for schools match version endorsed by Trump","text":"Oklahoma's top education official is seeking to purchase 55,000 Bibles for public schools and specifying that each copy contain the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution, which are not commonly found in Bibles but are included in one endorsed by former President Donald Trump.

I don't know whether it will be peaceful,” Biden said. “The things that [former President Donald] Trump has said, and the things he said last time out when he didn’t like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.” “I noticed that the vice presidential Republican candidate [JD Vance] did not say he’d accept the outcome of the upcoming election. They haven’t even accepted the outcome of the last election,” Biden said, adding that he was “concerned about what they’re going to do.” Biden's remarks come nearly four years after a mob of Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol during the certification of Biden’s election victory. On Friday, Vance again again dodged the question at a campaign rally, repeating the same “focused on the future” line he deployed at the debate to avoid taking a formal position on whether the 2020 election was won by Biden. Biden previously warned Americans that Trump “means what he says” with regards to fighting a losing outcome, pointing to the former president’s suggestion that there would be a “bloodbath” should he lose. Concerns over Trump’s unwillingness to concede his 2020 loss were rehashed earlier this week when Special Counsel Jack Smith released a 165-page court filing outlining Trump’s actions during his alleged election subversion plot on Jan. 6, 2021. Smith’s filing claimed that Trump responded, “So what?” when informed that violent protests had driven Vice President Mike Pence into a secure hiding spot, and outlines Trump’s resistance to issuing a statement asking rioters to disperse.","summary":"Biden told reporters that Trump's comments about accepting election outcomes \"were very dangerous\"","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/10/04/biden-confident-will-be-free-and-fair-but-not-peaceful/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/joe_biden_2159674021.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:24:32","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":258523080,"title":"JD Vance Calls Out Amount of Hurricane Funding After Skipping FEMA Vote","text":"Republican senator and vice presidential candidate JD Vance called the Federal Emergency Management Agency's spending actions a \"disgrace\" roughly a week after he skipped the vote that would have provided the agency with more funds.Last week, the House of Representatives and the Senate approved a continuing resolution, which extends FEMA funding through December 20 and permits the agency to access those funds more quickly.

That's a disgrace.\"FEMA has denied that disaster relief money has been used to support international efforts or border-related issues in a government webpage addressing Hurricane Helene rumors.\"This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,\" the website said.However, Vance said the federal government was sending \"billions of dollars to illegal aliens.\"\"I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that our own government is sending billions of dollars to illegal aliens when there are hardworking Americans,\" he said. \"We've got to focus on them. Focus on our American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by these terrible storms, that's what Kamala Harris ought to be doing, and it's a damn shame that she's not doing her job.\"FEMA ScrutinyScrutiny about FEMA spending has increased in recent weeks after FEMA  spent money on assisting communities across the country dealing with an influx of migrants through its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). The program had a budget of $640 million for the 2024 Fiscal Year, which ended on September 30.Trump has criticized the SSP, which helps local governments and nonprofits support migrants. However, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security have denied that any FEMA disaster relief funds have gone to the program.\"The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by  Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA's disaster-related authorities or funding streams,\" a DHS spokesperson previously told Newsweek.FEMA was separately given $20 billion for the disaster relief fund as part of the short-term spending bill passed at the end of September.However, claims are now surfacing that FEMA doesn't have enough money to assist those in need after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across several states, including North Carolina.FEMA Director of Public Affairs Jaclyn Rothenberg told Newsweek that FEMA has enough funding to support the Hurricane Helene response and any subsequent disasters through December 20.Why Didn't Vance Vote?Many Republicans voted against the continuing resolution, but Vance was not among them. He didn't attend the September 25 vote, instead attending a campaign rally in Michigan. The Washington Post reported last week that Vance has missed 38 votes over the past few months due to his busy campaigning schedule with Trump.Vance isn't the only politician to miss votes while campaigning for office.In 2020, Harris, a senator at the time and campaigning with President Joe Biden, didn't vote for the continuing resolution passed in September and included a similar funding structure for FEMA. She also didn't vote for a continuing appropriations act in November 2019, when she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination.Even if Vance had voted, his vote wouldn't have been a deciding factor in the continuing resolution.Several Congress members have since called for Congress to reconvene to reconsider aid regarding Hurricane Helene's impacts, including Republican Senator Rick Scott, who voted against the continuing resolution that included aid for FEMA. Vance has also spoken in favor of Congress reconvening to approve funding for hurricane relief, according to a report from Virginia news outlet Cardinal News.","summary":"JD Vance has echoed former President Donald Trump's sentiments about prioritizing money for Americans over migrants.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-fema-funding-hurricane-disgrace-1964231","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488163/jd-vance-calls-out-amount-hurricane-funding.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:23:28","author":"Anna Skinner","authors":["Anna Skinner"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.581},{"id":258523570,"title":"FEMA has faced criticism and praise during Helene.

With Helene hitting during the homestretch of an election year, the agency has been criticized by some residents and politicians, like Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who have questioned its response and are spreading false information that its funding is going to migrants or foreign wars. The Biden administration has defended FEMA's work and says it has the money it needs to help communities right now. President Joe Biden does say the agency will need more cash in the future. Climate change is making storms like hurricanes more severe. There are a lot of misperceptions about FEMA's role in disaster recovery, what it does — and does not — pay for and what residents in hurricane-hit areas can expect. Here's a closer look: What does FEMA do and where does it get its money? FEMA has an operating budget and a disaster relief fund. The fund gets replenished every year by Congress and is used to pay for recovery from hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. FEMA also pays for rebuilding from past disasters and for projects designed to protect communities against future calamity. “This is kind of like the emergency account for the country,” said Samantha L. Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion — the same amount FEMA got last year. About $8 billion of that is set aside for recovery from previous storms and mitigation projects. The federal government doesn't help with every disaster — it generally has to be above the ability of a community or state to handle. In that case, the governor or tribal authority asks the president for an emergency declaration. Once declared, FEMA assistance varies widely. Public assistance — which is a lot of what it pays for — is geared toward reimbursing governments for debris removal or rebuilding roads, public buildings and more. FEMA also has individual assistance, designed to help residents. This can include one-time payments for emergency needs up to a trailer for someone who lost their house. When there is warning — like with hurricanes — FEMA coordinates with state and local governments about what they need and can pre-position supplies like tarps or water in areas likely to be most affected. FEMA also has search-and-rescue teams. But experts stress that the federal agency isn't in charge of the entire process. “Everybody thinks that FEMA just comes in right after the disaster and starts managing the entire disaster. And that’s just not the case,” said Brock Long, who was FEMA administrator from 2017 to 2019. Does FEMA have enough money to respond to Hurricane Helene? Trump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants in the country illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on foreign funding for Israel or Ukraine. “FEMA absolutely has enough money for Helene response right now,” said Keith Turi, acting director of FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery, noting the $20 billion from Congress. FEMA called Trump's accusations “completely false.” The agency administers the Shelter and Services Program, which gives money to reimburse cities, towns or organizations for immigration-related expenses. But that comes from a separate pot of money funded by Congress for Customs and Border Protection. FEMA gives out the money, but it doesn’t come from the disaster relief fund. Congress also separately funds foreign military aid. There are long-term funding concerns for FEMA, however. Turi said the agency was already working to make what's called a “supplemental” funding request to Congress before Helene hit. In the storm's wake, it's clear they'll need even more money, he said. Both Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who oversees FEMA, and Biden have sounded the alarm about more money needed in the future. Speaking from a Georgia pecan farm devastated by Helene, Biden said the supplemental funding could not wait: “People need help now.” FEMA seeking extra money is not uncommon. Long said he had to go back to Congress three times during his tenure for more cash. A 2022 Congressional Budget Office report said that most of the money that goes to the disaster relief fund actually comes in these supplemental requests. Extra money that's needed varies depending on the disaster, but the report noted that “a small number of those disasters account for a disproportionate share of total spending.” What happens when the disaster fund runs low? The disaster assistance fund sometimes runs low in late summer before Congress passes a new budget. When that happens, FEMA shifts to what's called “immediate needs funding.” That means the agency stops paying out for previous disasters and conserves its money for life-saving missions during any new ones. When the disaster relief fund is replenished — like what just happened last week — then money will flow again to longer-term projects. “Honestly, there’s a lot of work that needs to be done to streamline it and rethink, 'How can a disaster relief fund ... be set up in a manner where the FEMA administrator is not constantly having to ask for supplemental funding?” Long said. Will FEMA give me enough to rebuild? No. It’s important to know not just what FEMA does, but what it doesn't do, especially for individuals. One claim floating around after Helene is that disaster survivors only get $750 from FEMA. That figure refers to help that the agency can give someone in an affected area for what they might need immediately, like clothing or food, Turi said. From there, the agency can provide other things like money for a storage unit, medical bills or rental assistance depending on the situation. For homeowners, the first line of defense is always insurance. Those who don't have insurance or not enough can turn to FEMA, but the maximum amount someone can get to rebuild is $42,500. That's a far cry from what is needed to fix severe damage or rebuild completely. “This is one of the kind of major problems FEMA has in terms of how the public understands their role and responsibility,” said Montano, the professor. “FEMA does not make anybody whole after a disaster happens. They are not going to give you enough money to completely recover your life.”","summary":"The Federal Emergency Management Agency is tasked with helping states and communities hit by disasters like Hurricane Helene","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/fema-ap-congress-donald-trump-joe-biden-b2624214.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/03/05/Biden_78591.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:22:06","author":"Rebecca Santana","authors":["Rebecca Santana"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.395},{"id":258527364,"title":"FEMA has faced criticism and praise during Helene.

On Thursday, Oct. 3, The E Street Band leader posted an Instagram Reel where he voiced his support for the Democratic candidate in a video recorded at a diner. \"Friends, fans, and the press have asked me who I'm supporting in the most important of elections,\" Springsteen, 75, said. \"And with full knowledge of my opinions [being] no more or less important than any of my fellow citizens, here's my answer: I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walz for vice president.\" The Boss called the upcoming election \"the most consequential\" and says the United States has not felt as \"politically, spiritually, and emotionally divided\" since the Civil War. \"At this moment, it doesn't have to be this way,\" he insisted. The \"Born to Run\" singer went onto call Donald Trump \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\" \"He doesn't understand the meaning of this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American,\" Springsteen said, citing Trump's \"disdain\" for the \"sanctity\" of the Constitution, democracy and the peaceful transfer of power — the latter referring to Trump's refusal to accept Joe Biden's presidential win in 2020. He added that Harris and Walz are \"committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity.\" \"They want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all,\" Springsteen said. \"Not just for a few like me on top. That's the vision of America I've been consistently writing about for 55 years now.\" Springsteen joins Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence as a high-profile Harris supporter.

He continued: \"Everybody sees things different, and I respect your choice as a fellow citizen.

He appeared at several of Barack Obama's rallies during his election campaigns and also showed support for Vice President Joe Biden — even appearing at his inauguration, per Rolling Stone. In October 2020 on his SiriusXM show, Bruce Springsteen: From My Home to Yours, the New Jersey rocker celebrated Halloween and the upcoming election with an episode titled \"Farewell to The Thief,\" where he recited an Elayne Griffin Baker poem that emphasized what he felt Trump lacked. \"There's no art in this White House. There's no literature, no poetry, no music. There are no pets in this White House, no loyal man's best friend, no Socks the family cat, no kids' science fairs,\" Baker wrote in the first verse.","summary":"The New Jersey icon called the upcoming 2024 election &#34;consequential&#34;","url":"https://people.com/bruce-springsteen-endorses-kamala-harris-2024-presidential-election-8723568","image":"https://people.com/thmb/yGwBVifxggblTf_ehDnf34_2FGc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(653x193:655x195)/bruce-springsteen-053123-7ea2eba3d9c040b1a8bec662d3ea5980.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:20:23","author":"Jade Gomez","authors":["Jade Gomez"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.431}]}
