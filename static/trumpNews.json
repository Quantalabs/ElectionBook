In its influential Stylebook, the AP said it would continue to use Gulf of Mexico, while also noting Trump’s decision, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world.\n\nThe White House’s outright attempt at regulating language used by independent media — and the punitive measures attached to it — mark a sharp escalation in Trump’s often fraught dealings with news organizations.\n\nAt a regular briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that “it is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America, and I’m not sure why news outlets don’t want to call it that.”\n\nIn reality, the body lies partially in waters that don’t belong to the United States and has been called the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years.\n\nOn Tuesday, AP reporters were blocked from attending events in the Oval Office and the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room. While an AP reporter was in the White House briefing room Wednesday for Leavitt’s remarks, they were turned away at a later event in the Oval Office for the swearing in of Tulsi Gabbard as national intelligence director.\n\nJulie Pace, AP’s senior vice president and executive editor, wrote to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on Wednesday objecting to the moves.\n\n“The actions taken by this White House were plainly intended to punish the AP for the content of its speech,” Pace wrote. “It is among the most basic tenets of the First Amendment that the government cannot retaliate against the public or the press for what they say.”\n\nWhite House says Oval Office access is a privilege\n\nThe White House pointed out that the AP was allowed into its briefing Wednesday but continued to take issue with the style of the gulf’s name. “Nobody has the right to go into the Oval Office and ask the president of the United States questions,” Leavitt said. “We reserve the right to decide who gets to go into the Oval Office.”\n\nGenerally, when the press is permitted to cover White House events where space is tight, a small pool of journalists are allowed in. The AP, which transmits news to thousands of clients, has traditionally been a part of that pool in past administrations.\n\nAsked if barring AP reporters was retaliatory, Leavitt said that the Interior Secretary has codified the name change in official documents and that “pretty much every other outlet in this room has recognized that body of water as the Gulf of America.”\n\nThe move raised alarms among several advocates for the press. “Barring an AP journalist from covering an Oval Office event because the AP has not adopted President Trump’s change of name to what has long been called the Gulf of Mexico is an affront to the First Amendment,” said noted attorney Floyd Abrams.\n\nA major consortium of news organizations, the Inter American Press Association, said Wednesday that the White House move was “an act of censorship and intimidation that violates the freedom of the press enshrined in the United States Constitution.”\n\nThe president of the IAPA, José Roberto Dutriz, expressed concern about this measure: “Restricting press coverage and warning against the AP demonstrate a troubling intention to impose official criteria on public interest information, with the threat of reprisals for those who do not comply,” said Dutriz, CEO and general director of La Prensa Gráfica in El Salvador.\n\nMany who write follow AP style\n\nUsers of the Google map app in the United States will now see the body of water referred to as the Gulf of America, the company said. Mexican users would see “Gulf of Mexico.” Elsewhere in the world, Google identifies it as “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).”\n\nBut the AP’s decision is influential because many news outlets and other organizations use it as an arbiter of how to consistently refer to things.\n\nSome larger outlets have their own rules.\n\n—The New York Times said it would continue to use Gulf of Mexico, while noting Trump’s renaming in stories that discuss that issue. The gulf, which borders Mexico and Cuba as well as the United States, has been known as the Gulf of Mexico for more than 400 years.\n\n—The Washington Post also said it would use Gulf of Mexico in most references because it “is not solely within the United States’ jurisdiction and the name of Gulf of America might confuse global readers.”\n\n—Fox News said that, starting Sunday, it would use Gulf of America in all of its references.\n\nTrump has also ordered that the United States’ tallest mountain revert to the name Mount McKinley after President Barack Obama changed the Alaska peak to its Indigenous name, Denali. AP says it would follow Trump’s decision because he has the authority to rename areas that are solely within the United States.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Kathy Hochul over a state law that allows people who might not be in the U.S. legally to get driver’s licenses. The so-called Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nBondi slammed a provision of the law she said requires New York’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nA copy of the lawsuit was not immediately available Wednesday evening.\n\nThe lawsuit comes days after the Justice Department sued the city of Chicago, alleging that its “ sanctuary” laws were thwarting federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.\n\n“This is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans,” said Bondi, with agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration lined up behind her. “Millions of illegal aliens with violent records have flooded into our communities, bringing violence and deadly drugs with them.”\n\nBondi appeared alongside Tammy Nobles, whose 20-year-old daughter was killed in Aberdeen, Maryland, in July 2022 by someone from El Salvador who entered the country illegally months earlier in Texas. The assailant, then 16, was released to a first cousin to pursue asylum, which is common practice under U.S. law and policy. He had been accused by authorities in El Salvador of affiliation with the violent MS-13 gang, according to a report by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nTo trumpet his immigration policies, Trump has often highlighted “angel moms” like Nobles, who lost their loved ones to violent crimes by people in the country illegally.\n\nIn 2020, the Trump administration sought to pressure New York into changing its law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nNew York’s governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nAP journalist Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump&#8217;s newly installed attorney general, Pam Bondi, went&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Pam Bondi, Attorney General, criticizes New York leaders while launching immigration lawsuit. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/pam-bondi-attorney-general-criticizes-new-york-leaders-while-launching-immigration-lawsuit/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/5ILZEWFK2VD6JDADYW7K6KLUXU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 01:02:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.474},{"id":289898736,"title":"Why this moocher red state doesn't hate socialism anymore","text":"If Democrats have learned anything from Republicans and their voters during the first chaotic weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency, it’s that government spending is terrible, the worst, just out-of-control, and it must be frozen or cut—WAIT! NO, NOT THAT SPENDING. THAT SPENDING IS GOOD!\n\nThat’s the difference between us and them. Republicans only care when they are directly affected, and now it’s Alabama’s turn to suffer the consequences of their lopsided 65-34 vote for Trump in 2024.\n\n“Alabama’s junior U.S. senator said she will work with President Donald Trump’s health secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to ‘ensure our nation remains at the forefront’ of innovation, research and care after funding cuts announced Friday night by the National Institutes of Health,” reported AL.com, Alabama’s main media outlet. \n\nThat junior senator is Katie Britt, who you might remember from that creepy State of the Union rebuttal speech last year (which was mocked so well by Scarlett Johansson on “Saturday Night Live”). It turns out Trump’s funding cuts to the NIH will deeply affect the University of Alabama system. \n\nFreedom-loving Alabama’s university system depends heavily on federal dollars (from blue states, mind you). In fact, the University of Alabama-Birmingham bragged that in 2023, it was among the top 1% in recipients of federal research dollars—to the tune of $774.5 million. Taking a break from fighting socialism, the university bragged that “This milestone marks a $247.5 million increase in funding over the past five years and a 73 percent growth over the past nine years.” \n\nBut hey, perhaps I’m being unfair. Universities are bastions of pointy-headed elitist intellectuals. Of course they would love things like “science” and “medicine” and “research” and socializing those costs—all things that modern Republicans supposedly despise and oppose. So we can assume that the state’s all-Republican congressional delegation would be cheering the cuts, right? Isn’t this what they voted for and supported, after all? \n\n“Every cent of hard-earned taxpayer money should be spent efficiently, judiciously, and accountably—without exception,” Britt told AL.com. “While the administration works to achieve this goal at NIH, a smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.” \n\nAh yes, the research in Alabama that’s life-saving and groundbreaking and must not be hindered, unlike all that other inefficient research that’s funded haphazardly in all the other states with all the other programs. I’m sure Britt’s concern has nothing to do with the fact that the University of Alabama is the state’s largest employer, right? \n\nIt’s so weird that the biggest moocher states like West Virginia, Louisiana, and Alabama suddenly love socialism—as long as the dollars are spent on them and no one else. And Alabama, the eighth-biggest moocher state in the country which gobbles up twice as much in federal funds as it pays in taxes, really needs to learn a lesson. Trump’s draconian cuts (instigated by his co-President Elon Musk and his shady DOGE cabal) won’t hurt blue states as much as they will decimate red states. If Republican legislators and voters alike want those federal dollars, maybe vote for the party that believes in sharing the wealth and uplifting everyone? \n\nWhich brings us back to the difference between us and them: We are capable of empathy, even when something doesn’t affect us directly. Republicans only care when it does. \n\nMeanwhile, the University of Alabama will need to pinch pennies. Maybe they can start with football coach Kalen DeBoer’s $10 million annual salary, which will add up to over $80 million through 2031.","summary":"If Democrats have learned anything from Republicans and their voters during the first chaotic weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency, it’s that government spending is terrible, the worst, just out-of-control, and it must be frozen or cut—WAIT!

I was unaware but then someone sent me a link.”\n\n The link was a video of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group known for violence, entering his church’s yard the previous night, tearing down the Black Lives Matter banner that hung within a metal frame and cutting it into pieces with knives. The pro-Trump organization was rallying through D.C., facing off with any and all antifa and Black Lives Matter activism, be it people or vinyl signage. Motivated by Donald Trump’s election loss a few weeks earlier, the group marched down M Street toward Metropolitan AME — a Black-owned house of worship since 1822 that held the funerals of Frederick Douglass and Rosa Parks — where they trespassed, vandalized the sign, and screamed “Fuck Black Lives Matter!” The Proud Boys also vandalized a Black Lives Matter sign hung by the neighboring Asbury United Methodist, a Black church since 1836, setting the sign aflame on the street. \n\n “I couldn’t address it then because I was about to go live in a few minutes,” says Lamar, who is set to release a book on spirituality rooted in his experience with the church. Instead, he sat on his basement steps in meditation and prayer. “I had an ancestral moment where I felt Elizabeth Freeman, Ida B. Wells [an anti-lynching advocate and speaker at the church in the 1800s], my own ancestors, and the Spirit of the Living God say, ‘This is our moment. Get through what you’re doing and get ready.’”\n\n By the following day, a solution came in the form of advocates like Cornell Brooks, the former NAACP president, who connected Lamar and the church to attorneys willing to represent them pro-bono. “They asked if we’d be willing to sue, and the people of Metropolitan stood together and said yes,” Lamar says. “I had the only unanimous vote in the history of church.” \n\n After four years of litigation, the church has a conclusive judgement. D.C. Superior Court Judge Tanya Jones Bosier ruled on Feb. 3 that Metropolitan AME now owns Proud Boys International LLC, which means the church owns the group’s name, materials, and any and all proceeds, including dues, they may receive.\n\n The church is already taking advantage of the ruling. The livestream of Lamar’s service on Sunday included a QR code linking to a statement on the ruling, which noted that the church is selling “limited edition” T-shirts featuring the extremist group’s signature black-and-gold laurel around a bold “PB.” The text around the Proud Boys logo, now owned by the church, reads “Stay Proud, Stay Black” on one shirt, and “Stay Proud, Black Lives Matter” on the other. The proceeds go to the church’s community justice fund.\n\n “We are doing Spirit work, soil work, and solidarity work,” Lamar told his congregation, adding that the shirts are “our version of the trademark that now belongs to us.”\n\n The saga began at the end of a fraught 2020. The nation was in crisis in the midst of the pandemic shutdown, and an emotionally charged presidential election year made tensions even higher. Following the police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd that spring, protests broke out across the nation. In the “Chocolate City,” known for its Black population and culture, Metropolitan AME and Asbury Church advocated for Black folks, as they have since the time of enslavement. Lamar described the church’s Black Lives Matter signs to the court as a “contemporary way of lifting up the fact that, for many generations, persons of African descent in America and around the world had to assert our humanity.” The Proud Boys demolishing those symbols exemplified more than just a violation of church property but one of human rights. \n\n Metropolitan AME sued on Jan. 4, 2021 for trespassing, theft, bias-related conspiracy, damage of religious property (under the FACE Act), and defacement of private property. In June 2023, the church won a judgement of just over a million dollars in damages from former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and four other members. Around $36,000 of it was for physical damages done to the church, covering expenses for the destroyed sign and frame, and compensation for the time and work of the church members and volunteers who provided aid. The additional million dollars was for punitive damages. The judgement was later upped to $2.8 million to include legal fees, and is now over $3 million with interest. The Proud Boys didn’t pay, though, prompting the church to go after the trademark. Judge Bosier gave it to them last week.\n\n Tarrio — whom Trump pardoned last month for crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — sees the ruling as unjust, impossible to pay, and unlawful. He released a statement after the ruling was handed down attacking the church and calling for the impeachment of Judge Bosier. “I hold in contempt any motions, judgments, and orders issued against me,” he wrote.\n\n Tarrio elaborated in an interview with Rolling Stone. “I wipe my ass with it,” he says of the ruling. “I don’t care about this fake church. I don’t care about the judge. It’s an unjust ruling. They’re acting like Pharaoh in the Old Testament. They’re overdoing it and harassing my family by subpoenaing their bank records.” \n\n Tarrio claims there was a “mix up” and that he burned Asbury’s banner, not Metropolitan AME’s, and that he didn’t know it came from a church. “I saw a banner on the floor that said Black Lives Matter and we’ve historically opposed most of the views, if not all, that Black Lives Matter hold,” he says.\n\n Regardless of whether Tarrio personally helped destroy Metropolitan AME’s banner, similar to his Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy conviction, his role as a leader of the group was enough. The court determined Tarrio and the four other members “planned and led the December 12, 2020 Prouds Boys rally,” making them liable and prone to judgement for the crimes committed against the church. \n\n Asbury did not sue the Proud Boys despite Tarrio serving prison time for burning their banner. Instead, the church released a statement: “It was an unprovoked act of violence and vandalism. It is no less reprehensible because the burned object was a banner rather than a cross. It was an assault on Asbury and its values as a member of the Christian community, a repudiation of the important message the banner sought to convey, and an affront to people of faith and goodwill in our community and the world over.” \n\n Tarrio also claims he was not able to defend himself sufficiently because he was incarcerated, but court records hold that he and the other Proud Boys “fail(ed) to respond or otherwise to defend against the lawsuit … despite notices to the defendants — including those who were incarcerated.”\n\n Tarrio and other Proud Boys have been taunting Metropolitan AME on social media since the ruling was handed down last week. Tarrio called Metropolitan AME “a church of Satan” and shared a video of Lamar set to reggae music. He has also posted that the Proud Boys are changing their name to “African Methodist Episocal Boys.”\n\n “I’m going to start printing shirts,” he tells Rolling Stone. “If they want to come after me for intellectual property, go ahead. I owe the federal government restitution about $6.5 million. I’m broke as shit. I don’t have a fucking car right now, I had to sell my car to pay my attorneys. I don’t own anything. The cell phone I’m talking to you on can’t even be under my name because my credit’s fucked up. So if they want to go after the poor, I’m the perfect candidate.” \n\n Metropolitan AME maintains they are not going after the poor; they just want accountability and retribution. “They recorded video and sound and the whole time they were shouting vitriolic, racist, and other profane chants,” Lamar says. “They were exalted. Legally, we own their trademark and we should receive any economic benefit from it. People have asked will we negotiate with them and let them use [their name] and no, we will not. Not under any circumstance.” \n\n Even if the Proud Boys try to change their name in an effort to dodge the trademark ruling, certain members of the group, like Tarrio, still personally owe the church. For Tarrio — who says he is looking to get a license as a general contractor and restart his security business, while also teasing a run for office — any money he makes will go to the church until the $2.8 million judgement is satisfied.\n\n Meanwhile, in D.C., congregants of Metropolitan AME feel the judgement is a statement that could prevent other acts of violent protest, and give hope to those who feel helpless in this political time. “Our victory says we can fight and we can win,” Lamar says. “The current world order was imagined by people who wanted to exploit and oppress and extract. We can imagine and build a new order. There are thousands of AME churches blooming — not only Christians, but Jewish congregations, Muslim congregations, Buddhist congregations, people of no faith at all, who are fighting and winning every day. Human beings together can rise.”","summary":"Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal has repurposed the extremist group’s logo to signify “Stay Black, Stay Proud”","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/proud-boys-trademark-black-church-shirts-1235265640/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/proud-boys-trademark-new.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 01:00:00","author":"Meagan Jordan,Ryan Bort","authors":["Meagan Jordan","Ryan Bort"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.279},{"id":289896600,"title":"SpaceX One Step Closer to Creating Texas City: What to Know About 'Starbase'","text":"A Texas county on Wednesday approved an election sought by SpaceX that will allow residents near Elon Musk's company to decide whether to establish a new city called Starbase.Newsweek has reached out to SpaceX via email Wednesday night for comment.Why It MattersElon Musk, a billionaire ally of President Donald Trump, has steadily expanded his business footprint across Texas, citing the state's business-friendly policies.Since moving there in 2020, he has relocated or expanded several of his companies. Tesla's massive 10-million-square-foot Gigafactory, which produces Cybertrucks, opened near Austin in 2022 and now serves as the company's headquarters.What To Know About StarbaseThe area, located at Boca Chica Beach near the U.S.-Mexico border, sits at the southernmost tip of Texas.SpaceX first broke ground on its Texas launch site in 2014. It has since grown into a hub for the development and testing of Starship, SpaceX's next-generation spacecraft designed for deep-space missions.Within the proposed city limits, only 10 of the approximately 250 land lots are not owned by the company.According to a local impact study released last year, more than 3,400 full-time SpaceX employees and contractors currently work at the Starbase site.In December, more than 70 residents signed a petition requesting the incorporation of Starbase as a municipality. According to copies of the petition obtained by The Associated Press, most signers are SpaceX employees, and the community includes over 100 children.The idea of transforming Starbase into its own city isn't new. Musk first floated the concept in 2021 with a simple social media post stating, \"Creating the city of Starbase, Texas.\"Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño confirmed that officials reviewed the petition and determined it met state requirements, allowing the incorporation process to proceed.Kathryn Lueders, general manager of Starbase, has previously stated that incorporating the area as a city would help streamline processes for developing local amenities.However, some environmental advocates have raised concerns about the potential impact of increased development. In December of 2024, community organizations sued Texas, alleging wastewater from SpaceX launchpads was washing into nearby wetlands. Activists behind the suit against the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) say that the wastewater contains metal and polluting chemicals used at the South Texas launch site.In September, SpaceX said in a written statement that it uses \"literal drinking water\" for its launchpad. It also said that testing after water is splashed on the launch site found \"negligible traces of any contaminants.\"What People Are SayingTreviño said in a statement to the Associated Press: \"If the election passes, this will be the newest town in Cameron County since Los Indios in 1995. We look forward to seeing the outcome of this election.\"Leuders wrote in a letter to Cameron County in December: \"To continue growing the workforce necessary to rapidly develop and manufacture Starship, we need the ability to grow Starbase as a community. That is why we are requesting that Cameron County call an election to enable the incorporation of Starbase as the newest city in the Rio Grande Valley.\"What Happens NextThe election is set for May 3, with voting restricted to those living near the SpaceX launch site.Reporting by The Associated Press contributed to this story.","summary":"Elon Musk, a billionaire ally of President Donald Trump, has steadily expanded his business footprint across Texas.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-spacex-texas-new-city-starbase-2030352","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2587358/starbase.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:57:09","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":289897652,"title":"New Bill Proposes Greenland Be Renamed “Red, White And Blueland.” Say What?","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nYesterday, Earl “Buddy” Carter’s (R-Ga) introduced a two-page bill titled “Red, White, and Blueland Act of 2025.’\n\nWhen someone shared it with me, I thought it was a meme—but it is indeed real.\n\nThe purpose of the bill?

As a response, a “Denmarkification” petition has been launched and collected over 200,000 signatures, calling for Denmark to buy the state of California.\n\nThe proposed cost? $1 trillion.\n\nTOPSHOT - Icebergs float behind the town of Kulusuk in Greenland on August 19, 2019.

There was also growing interest in Arctic resources, such as minerals. The two sides got as far as discussing proposals to purchase the island or to swap it for U.S. territory in the Philippines, but with World War I on the horizon, attention turned to more pressing matters.\n\nPresident Taft in the Oval Office (Photo by B.M.

At the same time, people located in the country of Mexico will see the name “Gulf of Mexico” used to describe the same body of water. And for those who use Google Maps in a country or territory beyond the U.S. and Mexico, they will see both names at the same time, with Gulf of America in parentheses.\n\nIn the latest Google Maps update, the Gulf is named America, Mexico or lists both based on the ...

Trump has signed 60 executive orders, from EO 14147 through EO 14206. As the executive orders (EOs) continue to be drafted, signed and put into action, one thing is clear: The power in these EOs are vested in the president through the power of the electorate. Having won the popular vote, the Electoral College vote, the House and the Senate, the administration is acting upon their beliefs of what would be best for America, both today and into the future.\n\nWith EOs ranging from foreign policy, immigration, national security, energy/climate, DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), trans rights, declaring holidays, faith and abortion, the issues are being decided with the stroke of a pen.\n\nWhile there has been some pushback from the courts, it’s fair to believe more actions will continue to evolve the language used across our institutions (Fort Liberty to Fort Bragg), our policies (DEI to a to-be-determined term) and our geography (Mount Denali to Mount McKinley).\n\nIn the meantime, our maps can be quickly updated to reflect these changes with the touch of a button, appearing in our lives and on our phones almost instantly.\n\nSo, if you happen to fly into one of Greenland’s six international airports, know it’s possible that one day the airport code on your ticket from America may change from GOH to RWB, for Red White and Blueland.\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.

Some lawmakers mentioned specific legislation and other strategies to counter waste, fraud, and abuse in the two health insurance programs.\n\nDemocrats questioned whether DOGE, a temporary advisory body championed by Republican lawmakers, had crossed into illegality.\n\nHere are some highlights from the Oversight subcommittee’s inaugural hearing, convened just weeks after the inception of Musk’s DOGE.\n\nGreene vowed that her subcommittee would “fight the war on waste shoulder to shoulder with President [Donald] Trump, Elon Musk, and the DOGE team.”\n\nRanking Member Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) was critical of both Musk and Trump, saying the two were “recklessly and illegally dismantling the federal government.”\n\nShe called on Musk to testify before the subcommittee. House Republicans previously blocked a subpoena to require his appearance before the Oversight Committee.\n\nRepublicans largely support Musk and DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts, which have been targeted by multiple lawsuits and threats aimed at its engineers.\n\n“For years, Republicans and Democrats on the Oversight Committee have condemned this waste. But now that DOGE is taking real action, Democrats are choosing to defend the bureaucracy and status quo instead of standing up for the American people,” Comer said.\n\nRep. Bill Timmons (R-S.C.) questioned the lawsuits filed against DOGE.\n\nThe president has said the key oversight positions would not remain vacant for long, pledging to “put good people in there that will be very good.”\n\nThere were already 15 inspector general positions still open at the end of Biden’s term.\n\nInspector general firings have caused controversy before.\n\nDuring the Feb. 12 hearing, Casar said Trump’s firings included inspectors general investigating Musk-linked companies.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), ranking member of the Oversight Committee, also criticized the firings.\n\n“We want to have objective, neutral inspectors general who are monitoring government waste, fraud, and abuse,” he said.\n\nThere are more than 13,800 open recommendations from inspectors general.\n\nHaywood Talcove, chief executive officer for government with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, told Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) he believes the government could save $1 trillion through a few reforms—“simply putting in front-end identity verification, eliminating self-certification, and monitoring the back end of the programs that are providing the benefits.”\n\nHe pointed out that Missouri already relies on SteadyIQ for self-certification.\n\nGreene asked Dawn Royal, another witness, about a lack of identity verification measures in public programs.\n\n“Does this mean the federal government and some states are giving out billions of dollars to individuals without verifying who they are or whether they meet program eligibility requirements?” Greene asked.\n\nRoyal, a past president of the United Council on Welfare Fraud and a welfare fraud investigator, replied; “Yes, ma’am, that’s correct.”\n\nTalcove described the PPP as “a virtual buffet for fraudsters” in the COVID-19 period.\n\nBurchett later recommended that the subcommittee adopt Timmons’s legislation.\n\nTimmons also said he was at work on legislation to boost identity and income verification requirements for benefits.\n\n“All we have to do is adopt what has already been proven in Missouri,” he said, referring to the SteadyIQ system.\n\nTimmons estimated that the bills could save a collective $300 billion.\n\nStansbury, meanwhile, said she and the committee’s ranking member, Connolly, had developed “a set of bipartisan ideas we want to work on together that would root out waste, fraud, and abuse and modernize and streamline how agencies deliver vital programs for the American people.”\n\nIn her closing remarks, Greene promised that her subcommittee would soon issue a report outlining bills to address waste, fraud, and abuse.","summary":"Elon Musk, a man absent from the proceedings, was a major focus—but possible solutions to waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid were addressed too.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/4-takeaways-from-first-doge-subcommittee-hearing-5809051","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/02/12/id5809106-02122025-DSC08469-Greene-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:54:30","author":"Nathan Worcester","authors":["Nathan Worcester"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":289896526,"title":"Love Island: All Stars Ekin-Su's brother reveals what he REALLY thinks of Curtis while Grace's dad leaves star in hysterics during embarrassing calls from home","text":"Black Friday\n\nThe Traitors\n\nThe Masked Singer\n\nLove Island All Stars\n\nDancing On Ice\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLove Island: All Stars Ekin-Su's brother reveals what he REALLY thinks of Curtis while Grace's dad leaves star in hysterics during embarrassing calls from home\n\n Have YOU got a story?

You're getting on my nerves,' before Ekin-Su insisted she needed to 'let it go.'\nAs Elma stormed off telling her to 'shut her mouth,' Ekin-Su shouted she 'couldn't hear stupid language,' leading Sammy to tell her to 'chill out,' and berate her for her choice of words. \nThe girls failed to resolve their problems before the night was over, with Ekin-Su going on to share her thoughts on Elma with Gabby Allen and Grace.\nShe told them that she felt Elma's behaviour had changed after she was voted Favourite Girl by the public, and the popularity had 'gone to her head.'\nIt was a theory that was immediately echoed by viewers, with Ekin-Su earning praise from fans for 'clocking' Elma's personality shift.\n\nDuring the reunion, Grace's father couldn't resist embarrassing her with a cheeky comment, asking: 'Was he in the boy scouts?

'For reasons unknown at this time, the plane veered from the runway causing it to collide with another parked plane.\n'On board Mr. Neil's plane were two pilots and two passengers. Mr. Neil was not on the plane. More specific details regarding the collision are not available as this is a rapidly evolving situation and there is an ongoing investigation.\n\n Inside the many tragedies to befall the members of Mötley Crüe as singer's jet is involved in crash \nThe firm said that 'Mr. Neil's thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today.'\nVitosky's daughter Jana Schertzer spoke to the Arizona Republic on Tuesday about the crash, claiming that her father had 'saved' the surviving passengers aboard the private jet.\n'I honestly, wholeheartedly believe that the reason those other passengers are alive — it's because of how he handled it yesterday,' she told the outlet.\nVitosky had been a pilot for 60 years, since he joined the Marine Corps, where he flew helicopters before switching to jets, his daughter added.\nDespite his age, Schertzer said her father remained in perfect health - 'Like, nothing wrong. His vision was perfect — better than 20/20 vision.'\nThe vet, who studied to become an engineer, served several tours in Vietnam.\n\nSince Vince didn't need to be at Rain's competition until its official kick off on Thursday, February 13, he decided to spend a few extra days in Florida; the couple pictured \n\nGraves then spoke of Vince's 'loyalty' to pilot Joie Vitosky (pictured) — a 78-year-old Marine veteran — who ultimately died trying to 'save' Rain and others aboard the doomed flight\nVitosky, originally from Okemah, Oklahoma, joined the Marine Corps in his early twenties because he wanted to fly, his ex-wife Ann Vitosky said.\nAnn said she believed Vitosky had been flying for Neil for 'a few' years.\nHe flew several high-profile names during his flying career, Jesse Jackson, Ronald Reagan's daughter Maureen Reagan and oil barons.\nVitosky also served as a pilot for companies such as FedEx and for transplant patients, taking them to life-saving surgeries.\n'A lot of rich people, but he had a lot of people who needed something immediate,' his daughter said of his career.\nVitosky also leaves behind two other children and four grandchildren.\nFloridaArizona\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWhat saved Motley Crue singer Vince Neil from horror private jet crash that killed pilot\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nKanye West's antisemitic tirades and swastika shirt stunt could cost him $25million\n\nFourth time lucky!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy BRIAN MARKS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:26 GMT, 13 February 2025 |Updated:00:48 GMT, 13 February 2025 \n\nHBO is nearing signing its first major actor for one of its most high-profile roles in its upcoming Harry Potter series.\nThe network is currently in final negotiations to sign John Lithgow to star as Professor Albus Dumbledore in the series, which will again adapt J.K. Rowling's book series, according to Deadline.\nIn a statement to the publication, HBO declined to comment on the news — but did not deny that Lithgow was circling a deal.\n'We appreciate that such a high-profile series will draw a lot of rumor and speculation,' the network said. 'As we make our way through pre-production, we will only confirm details as we finalize deals.'\nLithgow — who has been nominated for back-to-back Best Supporting Actor Academy Awards for The World According To Garp (1982) and Terms Of Endearment (1983) — recently received a fresh round of critical acclaim for his major role in the Oscar hopeful Conclave.\nShould he take on the role of Dumbledore, the 79-year-old American — who recently starred with Jeff Bridges in FX's now-canceled The Old Man — will be following in the footsteps of two esteemed actors to play the wizard in Warner Bros.' Harry Potter films: the late stars Richard Harris and Michael Gambon.\n\nJohn Lithgow, 79, is nearing a deal to star as Professor Albus Dumbledore in HBO's upcoming Harry Potter series remake, Deadline reported on Wednesday\n\nThe character, played by Michael Gambon in the final six of eight Harry Potter films, is the headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts and a mentor to the title character\nHarris, who died in 2002 at 72, originated the role in Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone (known as Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone in the US and other countries) and its first sequel, Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, which was also his final film role before his death.\nGambon, who died in 2023 at 82, took over the role for the final six films of the series and helped to shape the evolving character as Dumbledore became more prominent in later stories.\n\n BBC star and 'Harry Potter expert' is charged with historic child sex offences \nDumbledore, a wise and clever wizard who serves as the headmaster of the magic school Hogwarts and a mentor to the title character, has become one of the most-beloved characters among fans of Rowling's original books and the film series. \nThough Lithgow is an American, which would be a departure for the series after the original films featured an almost exclusively UK-based cast, Dumbledore wouldn't be his first British character.\nDeadline notes that Lithgow nabbed his sixth and most recent Emmy Award for playing former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Netflix's hit drama The Crown.\nMore recently, Lithgow has been portraying the writer Roald Dahl on stage in London in the play Giant, which explores the writer's infamous antisemitism.\nMuch about HBO's Harry Potter series is still up in the air, as no major stars have yet inked deals, but the series is expected to be shot at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, where the original films were made.\nSeveral major stars have been bandied about in rumors as potential actors for the upcoming series, but none have yet been reported as serious candidates in negotiations.\n\nLithgow recently received a fresh round of critical acclaim for his major role in the Oscar hopeful Conclave (pictured)\n\nShould he take on the role, the 79-year-old American will be following in the footsteps of two esteemed actors to play the wizard in the Harry Potter films: the late stars Richard Harris (pictured), who died in 2002 at 72, and his successor, Michael Gambon, who died in 2023 at 82\n\nLithgow, the first major star who is reportedly nearing a deal, has previously played several British character, including his Emmy-winning turn as Winston Churchill on The Crown and as Roald Dahl on stage in London last year\n\nAccording to Deadline, the show's casting team are still working through an astound 32,000 audition tapes sent in by child actors hoping to score roles in the lead trio of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Grangers; Original stars (L–R) Radcliffe, Watson and Grint seen in 2005\nAccording to Deadline, the show's casting team are still working through an astound 32,000 audition tapes sent in by child actors hoping to score roles in the lead trio of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Grangers. \nDaniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, respectively, played the original characters. \nLithgow has remained as busy as ever on film and television in recent years.\nIn addition to his major supporting role in Conclave, he recently starred in the independent drama Jimpa opposite Olivia Colman, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month. \nHe also returned to the world of the bloodthirsty serial killer hunter Dexter on Showtime's prequel series Dexter: New Blood. \nLithgow may even follow in the footsteps of Dexter's star Michael C. Hall by returning to narrate a spinoff series about his character, the Trinity Killer, which is currently in development, Deadline reported in December.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHBO's Harry Potter series circles deal with major star to play Dumbledore\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nKanye West's antisemitic tirades and swastika shirt stunt could cost him $25million\n\nFourth time lucky!

Madigan spent decades building a political empire rivaled in Illinois history only by his most storied peers, rising to become the longtime Speaker of the state’s House of Representatives, chair of its Democratic Party and head of a powerhouse tax appeal firm.\n\nBut in a landmark verdict that could transform the 82-year-old politician into a federal inmate in the twilight of his life, a jury found Madigan guilty Wednesday of a nearly decade-long bribery conspiracy involving ComEd. They also convicted him of a plot to install ex-Ald. Danny Solis on a state board in exchange for Solis’ help securing private business for Madigan’s law firm.\n\nHowever, the jury stopped far short of delivering the sweeping verdict prosecutors sought. The panel of eight women and four men acquitted Madigan of attempted extortion and other crimes involving Solis and an apartment project in the West Loop. They failed to reach any decision on claims involving a parking lot in Chinatown or AT&T Illinois.\n\nMost significantly, jurors couldn’t agree whether to find Madigan guilty of a broad racketeering conspiracy, in which he was accused of turning his political empire into a criminal enterprise.\n\nThat’s likely cold comfort to the man long known as the “Velvet Hammer.” Madigan, who held the gavel in Springfield for 36 years and was the longest-serving state House leader in the United States, is guilty of 10 counts in all, and he is now a convicted felon.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the jury tagged Madigan with that label less than 48 hours after President Donald Trump stripped it from Madigan’s onetime political rival, ex- Gov. Rod Blagojevich, through a full and unconditional pardon.\n\nLike Blagojevich once did, Madigan now faces significant prison time. The most serious counts against him carry a maximum of 20 years in prison. No sentencing hearing has been set.\n\nJurors also failed to reach any verdict regarding Madigan’s co-defendant, 77-year-old Michael McClain, who later smiled and flashed a thumbs-up in the courthouse lobby. He is still challenging his 2023 conviction for his role in the ComEd bribery conspiracy.\n\n“Bribery, whether it’s the old-fashioned cash stuffed in an envelope or the more refined version practiced by Madigan, is still illegal,” Acting U.S. Attorney Morris “Sonny” Pasqual declared in the Dirksen Federal Courthouse lobby after the verdict was read. “It’s still corrupt, and it’s still against the law.”\n\nThe top federal prosecutor said his office had yet to decide whether to take Madigan to trial again on the Chinatown or AT&T Illinois schemes, for which jurors returned no verdict. U.S. District Judge John Blakey scheduled the next hearing in the case for May 5.\n\nThe verdict capped an unpredictable four-month trial that gave jurors an upfront and uncensored look at the practice of behind-the-scenes politics in Chicago and Illinois in the previous decade. The panel heard recorded conversations about an “old-fashioned patronage system,” about ComEd contractors making out “like bandits” and how McClain derided utility officials who resisted political hiring pressures as “dumb s—.”\n\nThey heard more than 100 secret recordings in all, including many made by Solis. The Chicago Sun-Times first broke the news in January 2019 that Solis had been working undercover for the FBI and detailed one of the first recordings that would be heard by jurors in Madigan’s trial. The newspaper’s reporting directly affected the investigation.\n\nThe feds’ aggressive push against Chicago-style politics dates back to 2014 and led to criminal charges against roughly 20 people in all. Nine have gone to prison so far. Now Madigan, who left office in 2021 amid the burgeoning investigation, could join them.\n\nThe verdict came down in dramatic fashion Wednesday. It followed nearly 65 hours of deliberations over 11 days. Word of a note from the jury arrived a little before 10 a.m. And in it, they warned of a partial deadlock.\n\n“We have come to a unanimous decision on 17 counts,” it said. “We have tried our very best to come to a unanimous decision on the remaining 12 counts and have not been able to do so. It is our belief that this impasse will not be overcome.”\n\nProsecutors told the judge they were “amenable” to the partial verdict, and Blakey sent a note back to the group advising them that they did “not have to reach a unanimous verdict on all charges,” but any verdict they delivered would be final.\n\nWord of that verdict officially arrived about 15 minutes later. By then, Blakey’s 12th floor courtroom had already swelled with reporters, lawyers and others, including Pasqual. Two of Madigan’s daughters sat in the courtroom’s front row.\n\nMadigan watched as the verdict was delivered to the judge. The former Speaker looked at the floor, offering no expression, as the various counts were read. He betrayed only an occasional, and slight, nod of his head.\n\nLater, Madigan was met by his daughters as he left the courtroom. They touched his shoulder and followed him out. He continued to hold their hands as he walked through the lobby of the courthouse, out of the building and south along South Dearborn, through the snowflakes.\n\nMadigan did not comment to reporters. McClain told them, “My head is spinning.”\n\nMost of the jurors also declined to speak as they left the courthouse. But one, who identified himself as Malik and said he’s from the “inner-city,” discussed the deliberations while standing outside the courthouse. He said they were “productive.”\n\n“I honestly believe we all got our opinions out about the case,” he said. “… I really believe that we all considered each other’s thoughts and feelings.”\n\nWhen asked about Madigan’s decision to take the stand in his own defense last month, Malik said, “I believe that he was speaking from the truth. From his lens.”\n\nBut, Malik added, “when you put all of the pieces together, I don’t think they were all adding up.”\n\nMalik said there were two jurors who were hard to convince. He didn’t answer when asked if he was one of them. He said some jurors also struggled with the testimony from Solis.\n\n“I thought he was a pretty interesting individual,” Malik said. “I don’t think he was telling the truth at all. Maybe. … I don’t think the entire group thought clearly of Danny Solis. We all had our own different views.”\n\nMadigan’s defense attorneys pilloried Solis in closing arguments. The longtime 25th Ward City Council member agreed to wear a wire for the FBI starting in 2016 after agents confronted him with evidence of his own alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThe deal he struck with prosecutors means he is unlikely to ever face a criminal conviction, despite a bribery charge filed against him. Madigan’s attorneys tried to show that Solis continued to break the law even while cooperating with the feds, and they insisted to jurors that he was “a malignant tumor at the heart of this case.”\n\n“You cannot trust Danny Solis,” Madigan attorney Dan Collins told the jury last month.\n\nWhen all was said and done, jurors cleared Madigan of any wrongdoing when it came to his dealings with Solis and developers of a West Loop apartment complex. That’s even though Madigan seemed to struggle, while testifying last month, to explain why he continued to deal with Solis after Solis told Madigan the apartment developers understand “the quid pro quo.”\n\nThe jury also reached no conclusion regarding another scheme involving Solis, revolving around a parking lot in Chinatown.\n\nHowever, the jurors found Madigan guilty of three counts of wire fraud and other counts tied to Solis’ bid for a paid seat on a government board. Solis asked for Madigan’s help landing the seat as part of an FBI ruse.\n\nIn response, Madigan asked Solis to help him land business at his private tax appeals law firm from the developers of the Old Post Office, and for help connecting his son with a Pilsen not-for-profit. Madigan’s son is in the insurance business, and prosecutors tied $43,000 the son made to an August 2018 conversation between Madigan and Solis.\n\nMadigan’s son is not accused of wrongdoing.\n\nSolis’ secret recordings also helped the feds successfully prosecute former Ald. Edward M. Burke in 2023. So Pasqual delivered a terse response Wednesday when reporters asked about Solis’ value as a witness and his controversial deal.\n\n“Mr. Solis provided testimony in the state board aspect of the case, in which the jury returned guilty verdicts,” Pasqual said. “So that’s that.”\n\nThe broadest scheme for which Madigan was convicted Wednesday revolved around ComEd. The jury agreed that Madigan conspired to have ComEd officials pay $1.3 million to his allies over eight years so that he would look favorably at ComEd’s legislation in Springfield.\n\nThe recipients were former Alds. Frank Olivo and Michael R. Zalewski, former Cook County Recorder of Deeds Edward Moody, former state Rep. Edward “Eddie” Acevedo and longtime Madigan campaign worker Raymond Nice.\n\nOf the five, only Acevedo has faced criminal charges, for cheating on his taxes.\n\nBut even when it came to the ComEd scheme, jurors did not find Madigan guilty on every count. They acquitted Madigan on one bribery count tied to efforts by Madigan and McClain to install businessman Juan Ochoa on ComEd’s board of directors.\n\nWhile Madigan’s conviction may represent the peak of the feds’ yearslong push into Chicago corruption, there’s still much work to do. It also comes at a tumultuous time for the Department of Justice under Trump, who was elected four weeks into Madigan’s trial.\n\nMcClain’s challenge to his 2023 conviction comes in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year. A follow-up decision by U.S. District Judge Manish Shah could come any day and might result in another trial.\n\nMeanwhile, former AT&T Illinois President Paul La Schiazza is set to face trial again in June for allegedly bribing Madigan so that the Speaker would look favorably at the utility’s legislation. La Schiazza faced trial in September, but jurors couldn’t reach a verdict.\n\nThat makes Madigan’s jury, with its verdict Wednesday, the second consecutive panel to fail to reach a conclusion on those allegations, which also involve Acevedo.\n\n“The jury failed to reach a verdict, but that’s all we know,” Pasqual said when asked about the AT&T claims in the courthouse lobby. “We don’t know … of a jury split. So that’s really a matter of speculation about how strong — or not so strong — the majority of the jurors felt.”\n\nPasqual, who has served as Chicago’s top federal prosecutor for two years, also told reporters that “as long as I’m standing here as acting U.S. attorney, I’m very confident we’re going to pursue” cases like Madigan’s.\n\n“This district has a longstanding and a historic tradition of public corruption cases going way back to [former Gov.] Otto Kerner and before that,” Pasqual said. “… We’ve not been told by anybody not to pursue these investigations, and we fully expect to continue to do so.”\n\nContributing: Emmanuel Camarillo","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/madigan-trial-news/mike-madigan-guilty-verdict","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b334e71/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7623x4352+0+366/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F86%2Fcd%2F5138909d43c5be79fa63258e43a3%2Fmadi","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:47:01","author":"Dave McKinney | Wbez,David Struett,Jon Seidel,Matthew Hendrickson,Sophie Sherry,Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Dave McKinney | Wbez","David Struett","Jon Seidel","Matthew Hendrickson","Sophie Sherry","Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.363},{"id":289899066,"title":"CNN host becomes irritated as GOP’s Scott Jennings questions her about honesty and Elon Musk involvement","text":"CNN anchor Kate Bouldan lost her cool with the news network’s Republican outlier Scott Jennings during a tense debate over transparency and Elon Musk. \n\nEarlier this week, it was Abby Phillip who accosted Jennings, one of the few conservatives at the fading network, saying during a debate that she could ‘talk slower’ so he could understand a point.\n\nWednesday morning, Jennings appeared on CNN News Central with Bouldan when discussion of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its high profile press conference Tuesday came up.\n\nJennings was asked for his thoughts on Musk’s efforts: ‘Musk, who doesn’t need to do this, has, you know, he could be doing anything else. He’s got companies, he’s the richest guy in the world.’\n\nBouldan was skeptical, which led Jennings to further hammer home the point that Musk was doing this, in his opinion, for patriotic reasons. \n\n‘Has decided to give his own time to a government of a country that he loves, that has given him all this opportunity. I take him at his word that he wants to be transparent, that he invites transparency,’ he said.\n\nJennings added that the entire media ‘is looking into him every single day’ and should not fear Congressional oversight.\n\nBouldan rejected the idea that Musk has been ‘transparent’ about the nature of his work.\n\n‘They’re making routine announcements about the things they are finding, and they are inviting questions about the things they are finding every single day,’ Jennings claimed.\n\nShe responded: ‘But by definition he’s not being transparent. They’re not, they’re not providing data for the things that they say they have found evidence of. They just aren’t.’\n\n‘So you just don’t believe it. I mean, they are they are providing information. you just choose not to believe that it’s true,’ Jennings said of the announcements Musk and company have made.\n\nBouldan hit back: ‘I don’t think I don’t think anyone should just believe that it’s true. Do you think that people have taken kickbacks of tens of billions of dollars from USAID? Do you believe that?’\n\nThe pair became caught up in crosstalk after that, with Jennings wanting to know if Bouldan believed in the ‘waste, fraud and abuse’ from Washington that Musk seeks to root out.\n\n‘That’s not what you’re asking me and I’m going to ask the questions. Don’t accuse me of just like-‘ she said, before Jennings interrupted.\n\n‘And so if you believe that, do you believe that it’s possible that they are finding and producing information about it? Of course they are.’\n\nBouldan shot back again: ‘That wasn’t my question. My question was: By definition, they’re not being transparent. They can continue to be successful-‘\n\nJennings then wondered what she wants DOGE to do about her concerns.\n\n‘Provide data if they’re firing-, provide data that they have found people-, everyone would want to know if someone has received kickbacks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars,’ she argued.\n\n‘I don’t disagree with you. I love the idea of data. I love the announcements. I love them putting out regular reports of what they’re doing,’ Jennings said.\n\n‘Right, they have not,’ Bouldan claimed.\n\n‘And I love the idea of Congress also bringing them up to report to Congress on what they’re finding, because ultimately, Congress needs to be engaged in this as well. I have no problem with that, and I don’t think they do either. And that’s what I heard in his press conference yesterday,’ Jennings said.\n\nAfter that, the pair appeared to achieve peace and moved on.\n\nJennings, a rising star at CNN who has since joined the LA Times Editorial Board, is rumored to be joining a conservative answer to ‘The View’ started by the paper’s owner. \n\nMusk and his son X took over the Oval Tuesday afternoon to mark President Donald Trump signing an executive order. \n\nThe order, which wasn’t immediately released by the White House, was intended to ‘significantly’ scale back the federal workforce, pushing agencies to hire ‘no more than one employee for every four employees’ that depart, according to Semafor. \n\nTrump didn’t even bother signing the order in front of reporters, allowing Musk to hold court with his toddler for more than 30 minutes instead, with the president asking Musk to reveal some of his findings.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCNN anchor Kate Bouldan lost her cool with the news network&#8217;s Republican&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CNN host becomes irritated as GOP&#8217;s Scott Jennings questions her about honesty and Elon Musk involvement first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/cnn-host-becomes-irritated-as-gops-scott-jennings-questions-her-about-honesty-and-elon-musk-involvement/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/12/23/95152487-0-image-m-9_1739404344514.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:44:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":289896914,"title":"Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ nêu cách tiếp cận mới trong vấn đề Ukraine","text":"Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ bình luận về khả năng triển khai quân đội tới Gaza\n\n Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ, ông Pete Hegseth, cho rằng Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump sẽ không triển khai quân đội tới Gaza trong thời gian gần.\n\n Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Mỹ Pete Hegseth tại phiên điều trần của Ủy ban Quân lực Thượng viện Mỹ ở Washington, ngày 14/1. Ảnh: Reuters/TTXVN\n\nNgày 4/2, Tổng thống Donald Trump đã đề xuất Mỹ kiểm soát Dải Gaza, với mục tiêu tái phát triển khu vực này sau khi nhiều công trình bị phá hủy trong cuộc xung đột kéo dài 15 tháng giữa Israel và Hamas. Ông Trump còn nhắc lại lập trường trước đó rằng người Palestine nên được di dời đến các nước láng giềng, bằng chi phí do các quốc gia đó chi trả. Khi được hỏi về khả năng triển khai quân đội Mỹ để thực hiện kế hoạch này, Tổng thống Trump tuyên bố ông sẽ \"làm những gì cần thiết\".\n\nNgày hôm sau, trên kênh Fox News, Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Pete Hegseth đã lên tiếng làm rõ khả năng quân đội Mỹ can thiệp vào Gaza. Ông Hegseth nói: \"Chúng ta còn một khoảng thời gian dài trước khi có thể xem xét điều đó\". Ông đồng thời cho biết các cuộc thảo luận nghiêm túc giữa Tổng thống Trump, các quan chức an ninh quốc gia và các đồng minh sẽ phải diễn ra trước khi đưa ra quyết định này.\n\nBộ trưởng Hegseth cũng nhấn mạnh Israel muốn hoàn thành nhiệm vụ chống Hamas, đưa các con tin trở về và Washington sẽ hỗ trợ Tel Aviv thực hiện điều đó. Tuy nhiên, ông cho rằng việc sử dụng quân đội Mỹ là điều không mong muốn, nếu không thật sự cần thiết. Ông đồng tình với tuyên bố của Thủ tướng Israel Benjamin Netanyahu rằng cần phải suy nghĩ vượt ra ngoài khuôn khổ trong vấn đề Gaza, đồng thời nhấn mạnh rằng thông qua các cuộc thảo luận, các kịch bản mới có thể được xem xét.\n\nNgày 4/2, Thủ tướng Netanyahu đã khen ngợi ông Trump vì tư duy phi truyền thống của ông và cho rằng quyết định của Tổng thống Mỹ về Gaza có thể thay đổi lịch sử.\n\nĐề xuất của ông Trump đã bị ch.ỉ tríc.h nhiều trên trường quốc tế. Giới lãnh đạo Palestine đã lên án kế hoạch này, cho rằng nó vi phạm nghiêm trọng luật pháp quốc tế. Các quốc gia Arab lân cận - bao gồm Saudi Arabia, Iran, Jordan và Ai Cập - cũng lên tiếng phản đối và ủng hộ quyền ở lại Gaza của người Palestine.","summary":"Đây được đán.h giá là tuyên bố công khai rõ ràng và thẳng thắn nhất cho đến nay về cách tiếp cận của chính quyền mới của Mỹ đối với cuộc chiến đã kéo dài gần ba năm tại Ukraine.","url":"https://vietgiaitri.com/bo-truong-quoc-phong-my-neu-cach-tiep-can-moi-trong-van-de-ukraine-20250213i7377485/","image":"https://t.vietgiaitri.com/2025/2/5/bo-truong-quoc-phong-my-neu-cach-tiep-can-moi-trong-van-de-ukraine-600x432-92e-7377485.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:42:31","author":"Đài Trang","authors":["Đài Trang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vn","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":289896496,"title":"BBC bosses 'are forced to pull a string of classic Top Of The Pops episodes from screens as they feature disgraced rappers R Kelly and Diddy'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia as Zelensky says he hopes he'll broker a peace deal\n\nPictured: Grandmother, 87, who died after being attacked on train station concourse in 'act of senseless violence' - as woman in her 20s is arrested on suspicion of manslaughter\n\nFinal Merseyside derby at Goodison Park ends with mass brawl as FOUR are sent off including Liverpool boss Arne Slot following Everton's 98th-minute equaliser\n\nThe surprising reason Prince Edward 'tore a strip off' his royal chauffeur revealed in bombshell book\n\nI had an affair with a colleague and was never caught.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy LAURA FOX FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:18 GMT, 13 February 2025 |Updated:00:40 GMT, 13 February 2025 \n\nBBC bosses have reportedly been forced to pull a string of classic episodes of Top Of The Pops from their weekly reruns, as they feature stars embroiled in sex scandals.\nFor months fans have tuned into BBC Four for vintage episodes of the beloved music show, but the schedule was thrown into chaos when the repeats reached 1997.\nIt was a year dominated by the success of R&B stars Diddy and R Kelly, who have both had dramatic falls from grace in recent years.\nFour episodes, which aired in March and April 1997, were pulled by BBC bosses after they featured Kelly's performance of I Believe I Can Fly.\nThe musician is currently serving a 31-year prison sentence for sex trafficking and racketeering charges, and was later convicted for further charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice.\nAccording to The Sun, BBC bosses will also skip a run of episodes from the summer of that same year when Sean 'Diddy' Combs topped the charts for six weeks with I'll Be Missing You.\n\nBBC bosses have reportedly been forced to pull a string of classic episodes of Top Of The Pops from their weekly reruns, as some feature disgraced musician R Kelly (pictured in 2013)\nDiddy is currently behind bars awaiting trial at the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center following his arrest last year on sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution charges. He denies all the allegations and has been denied bail multiple times.\nA source told the publication: 'At this rate the only No1 from 1997 that will get shown is Teletubbies.'\nThe episodes are just the latest to be pulled from screens, with others featuring disgraced names such as Rolf Harris, Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter also removed from the show's reruns in recent years. \nTop Of The Pops was a weekly fixture on TV screens for 42 years, with millions tuning in to see performances from global stars as well as finding out who had topped the music charts.\nFollowing a decline in ratings, the show was axed in 2006 in favour of annual Christmas Special.\nHowever in 2022, this was also dropped by bosses, with sources saying at the time it was a cost-cutting measure.\nMailOnline has contacted a representative for the BBC for comment.\nDiddy has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges after his September arrest. He has remained incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn awaiting a May 5 trial, after he was refused bail on multiple occasions.\n\nBBC bosses will also skip a run of episodes that feature Sean 'Diddy' Combs, as he awaits trial on sex trafficking, racketeering and prostitution charges\nProsecutors in Combs' federal case say the music mogul used blackmail and violence in his efforts to silence victims.\nAmong the claims made against the entertainer is that he persuaded women to participate against their will in group sexual exhibitions referred to as 'Freak Offs.' \n\nEXCLUSIVE Kanye West's diatribe could cost him millions as Bianca Censori is too 'traumatised' to shoot film \nThe Can't Nobody Hold Me Down performer remains in federal custody nearly five months after his September 16 arrest in Manhattan in connection with sex trafficking and racketeering charges.\nCombs, who is also charged with transportation to engage in prostitution, has made a trio of attempts in vain to be granted bail, amid concerns from the court he would attempt to flee or tamper with his case.\nPrior to his arrest he was in the headlines for much of 2024 year after raids on multiple properties in March; and video of him assaulting his ex-girlfriend Cassie surfacing on CNN in May.\nIf you or someone you know has experienced sexual violence, RAINN's National Sexual Assault Hotline can be reacted at 800.656.HOPE (4673) and Hotline.RAINN.org and en Español RAINN.org/es.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBBC bosses 'are forced to pull a string of classic Top Of The Pops episodes from screens as they feature disgraced rappers R Kelly and Diddy'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nKanye West's antisemitic tirades and swastika shirt stunt could cost him $25million\n\nFourth time lucky!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JACQUELINE LINDENBERG FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:18 GMT, 13 February 2025 |Updated:00:39 GMT, 13 February 2025 \n\nTeddi Mellencamp revealed a devastating health update on Wednesday and shared 'multiple tumors' were found on her brain - resulting in her needing emergency surgery.\nThe TV personality, 43, has been battling skin cancer since her diagnosis in 2022 and has kept her fans up-to-date with the journey on social media. \nAfter undergoing nearly 20 surgeries in the span of almost three years, the RHOBH star broke down in tears late last year in December as she expressed she finally got good news and would need to undergo another biopsy. \nHowever, on Wednesday Mellencamp explained that had been suffering from 'severe and debilitating headaches' for weeks - which landed her in the hospital. \nTwo tumors will be surgically removed while the remaining ones 'will be dealt' through radiation afterwards. \nFollowing Teddi's health update, DailyMail.com takes a look at the reality star's candid years-long battle with melanoma. \n\nTeddi Mellencamp, 43, revealed a devastating health update on Wednesday and shared 'multiple tumors' were found on her brain - resulting in her needing emergency surgery; seen in 2024 in L.A. \nOctober 2022 - Teddi reveals stage II melanoma diagnosis \n\nIn October 2022, Mellencamp took to her Instagram account in order to reveal that she was diagnosed with stage II melanoma - the most dangerous form of skin cancer\n\nAt the time, she uploaded a photo of her bandaged shoulder where the biopsy had taken place and called the shock diagnosis as a 'wake-up call'\nIn October 2022, Mellencamp took to her Instagram account in order to reveal that she was diagnosed with stage II melanoma - the most dangerous form of skin cancer.\nAt the time, she uploaded a photo of her bandaged shoulder where the biopsy had taken place and called the shock diagnosis as a 'wake-up call.' \n'Melanoma awareness update. Despite my anxiety, I listened to the doctors and went in for my 3-month skin check last week since my previous melanoma.' \n'They said I had another abnormal spot near my last one so they did a biopsy. I got the call this morning: Stage 2 melanoma. Now, next Wednesday I go to an oncologist to have it cut out and come up with a game plan on next steps.' \nThe mother-of-three added, 'Of course, this is all pending some additional testing and biopsies of other spots nearby that were taken today.'\n'Moral of this story: if a doctor says, \"come in every 3 months\" please go in every 3 months,' Teddi encouraged her followers. 'I so badly wanted to blow this off. \"What could happen in 3 months?\" I thought. Apparently a lot.'\n'I continue to share this journey because I was a 90s teen, putting baby oil and iodine on my skin to tan it.'\nShe continued, 'Never wearing sunscreen or getting my moles checked until I was 40 years old. This has been such a wakeup call for me, and I hope to all of you, to love and protect the skin you're in.'\nIn March of that year, she gave a special shout out to her close pal and RHOBH star Kyle Richards for noticing spots on her back. \n'She immediately took me to the doc who within minutes said it looks like melanoma and did a big removal...,' Teddi recalled. \nOctober 2022: Scan update \n\nLater that same month, the star gave an additional update following a PET (positron emission tomography) scan to gather 3D images of the inside of her body; seen in December 2024 in L.A. \n Later that same month, the star gave an additional update following a PET (positron emission tomography) scan to gather 3D images of the inside of her body.\n'Post PET scan update: looking at PET scans and they think I'm predisposed to melanomas,' Teddi explained. 'I will need wide encision surgery removal and nodal mapping.'\n'During the surgery they will also do a sentinel lymphnoid biopsy. Because with a PET scan they can't see if it’s spread to lymph nodes. I am getting 2 more biopsies of new locations today and surgery is on Tuesday.'\nShe also shared a photo of her shoulder to reveal which spots have been removed and others that would be removed at a later date. \nTwo specific spots 'near my shoulder are the ones they are concerned could go to lymph nodes and will be a large connected removal.'\n'Then will meet with a geneticist to see if I could possibly have the BRCA2 mutation. Thank you for the outpouring of love and support Please go get checked.' \n December 2022 - Successful surgeries \n\nTwo months after revealing her stage II melanoma diagnosis, Mellencamp gave a positive update and shared that her recent surgeries at the time 'were successful'\n\nShe added, 'It's been eye-opening how quickly things can change and it's a lesson I will never forget, nor quit speaking up about'\nTwo months after revealing her stage II melanoma diagnosis, Mellencamp gave a positive update and shared that her recent surgeries at the time 'were successful.'\nAlongside a photo that showed off multiple scars on her upper back and shoulder, Teddi wrote, 'The margins are clear. I also got genetic testing results and there are no mutations we need to worry about.' \n'And I just had a healthy mammogram (please don't forgo these either, ladies). So I say peace out to 11 melanomas and 3 lymph nodes - I gladly hardly knew ya - and hello to a new sense of peace.' \nShe added, 'It's been eye-opening how quickly things can change and it's a lesson I will never forget, nor quit speaking up about.'\n'I want nothing more than for all of you to be proactive so you do not have to experience this. Let my scars be your inspiration to get preventative care.' \nJanuary 2023: New spots and bump on neck \n\nTeddi expressed weeks later that after undergoing her 4-6 week checkup, 'there were three new spots my doctors felt needed to be biopsied'\n\nShe also explained, 'Also, recently I felt a bump on my neck. My anxiety, of course, took over. I touched it at least 303 times'\nTeddi expressed weeks later that after undergoing her 4-6 week checkup, 'there were three new spots my doctors felt needed to be biopsied.'\n'I'm getting a lot of questions about the spots being white. I have had both white and brown melanomas; this is why I continue to share to get checked no matter what.'\nShe also explained, 'Also, recently I felt a bump on my neck. My anxiety, of course, took over. I touched it at least 303 times. However, day of appointment, I assumed it was nothing. And then the ultrasound came back irregular.'\n'I had the option of a needle biopsy or getting it cut out completely; the doctor recommended the biopsy to start, however there's a small chance it'll come back inconclusive and we will then have to remove it.'\n'As someone who is a controlled person, I'm dealing as best I can with something out of my control,' Teddi candidly admitted. 'Things I can control: staying on top of my appointments, self-checks, and asking my doctors questions.'\n'I'm trying my best to stay positive and will fill you in when I get the results. If this saves even one person from going through what I'm going through, it's worth it.'\nSeptember 2023 - New melanoma diagnosis \n\nLater in 2023, Teddi gave a devastating update and revealed that she was once again diagnosed with melanoma\n\nAlongside a teary-eyed selfie, the reality star explained, 'I found out late yesterday afternoon that the most recent spot biopsied is another melanoma. I can't even remember if this is the 12th or 13th one'\nLater in 2023, Teddi gave a devastating update and revealed that she was once again diagnosed with melanoma. \nAlongside a teary-eyed selfie, the reality star explained, 'I found out late yesterday afternoon that the most recent spot biopsied is another melanoma. I can't even remember if this is the 12th or 13th one.' \n'At this point, I am starting to black-out these memories like a portion of my childhood. I slept maybe 2 hours last night because my mind was racing.'\nShe positively noted, 'I am so grateful for my 3-month checkup because we caught this one early. This means another surgery next week and additional biopsies.' \n'As I lay here with tears in my eyes and worry, I know my kids will be up soon. I have a podcast at 10. Life goes on.'\n'I am also reminded of my faith and the remainder I keep telling myself, \"We can do hard things.\" We have so many beautiful things to look forward to.'\n'So if you woke up today feeling lost or scared, I encourage you to make a list of some of the things you are truly grateful for and what you are most excited about,' she added. \n'I am posting this to hold myself accountable to doing the same. Off to get my notepad and [pen emoji]. We have got this. Love to you all. We are not alone.' \nSeptember 2023 - Undergoing immunotherapy \n\nMellencamp soon gave another update and said doctors felt that an excision area is too 'broad' and doctors did not recommend cutting and instead she undergo immunotherapy\n\n'Because the area is so broad they no longer feel comfortable cutting. They said I can wait a week so I can show at nationals but upon my return I will start on a 5-week immunotherapy cream,' she added\nMellencamp soon gave another update and said doctors felt that an excision area was too 'broad' and doctors did not recommend cutting and instead should undergo immunotherapy. \n'Another update I didn't want to give but in an effort to be fully transparent and help others, here goes… I received the call yesterday from my doctor that not all the margins are clear after my last wide excision surgery.'\n'Because the area is so broad they no longer feel comfortable cutting. They said I can wait a week so I can show at nationals but upon my return I will start on a 5-week immunotherapy cream.' \nShe then explained that, '\"Immunotherapy is an anti-cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to attack cancer cells. An immunotherapy cream called imiquimod (Aldara®) is a cream that stimulates the immune system.\"' \n'Side effects include: fatigue, inflammation, blisters and some pain but ya know what, it's better than the alternative.'\nTeddi added, 'Stay vigilant on getting your skin checked my friends. We can fight this.' \nOctober 2023 - Immunotherapy not working \n\nAfter trying the immunotherapy cream for almost two weeks, Teddi took to Instagram and penned, ''Melanoma Immunotherapy Update: It's been 12 days since I started the immunotherapy cream on my shoulder, and sadly it has not blistered yet'\n\n'Blisters = it's working,' she wrote, adding that her doctors were 'upping the dosage in the hopes that kicks it into gear'\nAfter trying the immunotherapy cream for almost two weeks, Teddi took to Instagram and penned, ''Melanoma Immunotherapy Update: It's been 12 days since I started the immunotherapy cream on my shoulder, and sadly it has not blistered yet.' \n'Blisters = it's working,' she wrote, adding that her doctors were 'upping the dosage in the hopes that kicks it into gear.'\n'Otherwise, we are going to have to take next steps - which is a full skin graft of my shoulder, taking the skin from my lower abdomen. Let's just say I have never prayed so hard for some blisters.'\n'As always, thank you for your love, support and sharing your own stories. This all gives me the strength to push through and continue to share mine.' \nA few months later in December 2023, she emotionally revealed that the immunotherapy was unsuccessful - even after upping the dosage. \n'It was not successful. So I have two different options. I can either do a big skin graft from my belly or arm, but it's a very long recovery.' \n'Or I can go in and get another wide excision surgery on December 26 [to remove a larger portion of problematic area]. And they'll have a plastic surgeon come too because it's such a big area.'\nShe added, 'And then just keep getting my checks every three months. So that's where we are. Get your skin checked, folks!'\nThe star eventually chose to go for the second option to have the wide excision surgery. \nDecember 2023 - Teddi has 'biggest surgery in her Melanoma journey'\n\nTeddi underwent an important procedure and told her fans on Instagram, 'Surgery went well!'\n\nDays later, Teddi showed a large scar on her back following the surgery\nTeddi underwent an important procedure and told her fans on Instagram, 'Surgery went well! I specifically went through a \"wide excision melanoma, soft tissue defect reconstruction with adjacent tissue rearrangement.\"' \nShe also wrote, 'But the pain and discomfort are all worth it.'\n'The outpouring of love and prayers in the comments and DMs has left me speechless (which is tough). I wish I could respond to everyone but please know I am forever grateful.'\nThe star added, 'Please get your skin checked. I promise you do not want to go through this.' \nIn a separate clip, Mellencamp said on her Instagram stories: 'I'm out of surgery. Now I'm just waiting to be discharged to the nursing facility.'\n'It's pretty painful but I am so grateful that they did such a great job. Whew, that back skin is tight…struggle bus, but I'm hoping they got it all.'\nDays later, Teddi showed a large scar on her back following the surgery. \nIn the image, the star turned her back towards the camera to reveal a zigzag-shaped scar on the right side.\nAnd in the caption, the TV personality penned to her 1 million followers, 'Someone just messaged me that my scar looks like a whale swallowing bubbles. It made me laugh.' \nShe continued, 'I am not very artistic so I see a just see a \"Z\" - what do you see?* *funnyresponsesonly. #skincancerawareness @curemelanoma.' \nMarch 2024 - Healing after surgery \n\nAfter the procedure, she updated her fans three months later to show the vast difference of how her large scar had healed\n\n'What a difference 3 months can make! My scar is healing nicely, and I have the best doctors to thank,' she wrote \nAfter the procedure, she updated her fans three months later to show the vast difference of how her large scar had healed. \n'What a difference 3 months can make! My scar is healing nicely, and I have the best doctors to thank.' \n'But in all transparency, also during my three-month checkup, there was one abnormal spot the doctor felt we should biopsy.' \nShe added, 'It's on the other side of my body, so praying it's nothing. But felt it's a great time to remind you to get those skin checks.' \nJuly 2024 - Preparing for 16th removal of melanoma \n\nTeddi took to her Instagram page to share graphic photos following melanoma surgery as she prepared to undergo her 16th procedure to remove the disease\nTeddi took to her Instagram page to share graphic photos following melanoma surgery as she prepared to undergo her 16th procedure to remove the disease. \n'Thank you to everyone for all the love and support. To answer your main question: My next surgery is August 19th.' \nThe star added, 'This is #16, I think, and I keep fighting it so I am feeling more positive than a week ago.' \nShe also got candid about how the 'the ups and downs of not being able to control what's going on inside my own body' was challenging. \n'August 19th will be here in no time; in the meantime I will be loving on my kids, getting to see my dad in concert with a bunch of friends, going to some incredible horse shows, and podcasting with some amazing women. I am blessed.' \nDecember 2024 - Positive update\n\nLate last year in December, Teddi positively revealed good news and shared she did not need to undergo another biopsy\nLate last year in December, Teddi positively revealed good news and shared she did not need to undergo another biopsy. \nWhile sitting inside her car, the star said, 'I just had a little cry, but it's a good one.'\n'It's the first time in over two years I've gone in for my three-month check and not had to have a biopsy because I have another cancerous spot.' \nShe reflected how it had been 'such a good feeling' and revealed both she and her doctor looked at each other in shock upon discovering the news. \n'I'll go back in March, stay diligent with my checks, and this should be a reminder to all of you guys, please, please, book your skin checks, book your mammograms, book your OB/GYN appointments, book your eye doctor appointments.'\nIn the caption, she also penned, 'Going in for my continual three-month skin checks is never easy.' \n'The anxiety always takes over; the thought of another biopsy, another surgery, another addition to the scar on my back.' \n'And I always end up crying. But today the tears were those of joy. Because for the first time there wasn't anything abnormal, nothing that needed an extra look. And I am grateful.' \nShe continued, 'I'm grateful for my doctors, nurses, family, friends, and all of you for your continual support. As long as you're here, I have a reason to keep advocating for myself and for others.'\n'And if you need to get your skin checked but have yet to make an appointment… what are you waiting for?'\nFebruary 2025 - Brain tumor diagnosis \n\nOn Wednesday, Teddi took to Instagram to reveal that multiple brain tumors have been found after she was suffering from severe headaches for weeks\n\nIn another image, Teddi could be seen laying in a hospital bed and shared, 'Counting down the minutes until my babies get here'\n\nIn another post, a friend of Teddi's could be seen shaving her head and the star wrote in the caption, 'All I need now is an umbrella'\nOn Wednesday, Teddi took to Instagram to reveal that multiple brain tumors have been found after she was suffering from severe headaches for weeks. \nIn a statement, she wrote: 'For the last several weeks I've been dealing with severe and debilitating headaches. Yesterday the pain was unbearable and required hospitalization.' \n'After a CT scan and MRI, doctors found multiple tumors on my brain, which they believe have been growing for at least 6 months.' \n'Two of the tumors will be surgically removed today - The remaining smaller tumors will be dealt with via radiation at a later date.' \nShe added, 'I am blessed to be surrounded by my children, family, friends, doctors, nurses and surgeons who are doing everything possible to get me back into better health.' \n'Thank you to everybody who has reached out, and to everyone who has supported me along this journey.' \nIn another image, Teddi could be seen laying in a hospital bed and shared, 'Counting down the minutes until my babies get here.' \n'As my dad said this am, god only gives hard stuff to those of us who can handle it. It's a hard day but I have faith and amazing surgeons and know everything will be ok.'\nIn another post, a friend of Teddi's could be seen shaving her head and the star wrote in the caption, 'All I need now is an umbrella.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nInside Teddi Mellencamp's years-long skin cancer battle amid devastating brain tumor diagnosis\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nKanye West's antisemitic tirades and swastika shirt stunt could cost him $25million\n\nFourth time lucky!

The prime minister will be hosted by the US President on Thursday in what would be the first bilateral talks between the two leaders since Trump assumed the presidency for a second term last month. With Trump's tariff policy sending shockwaves across the world, Modi's key priority is likely to be to pre-empt any punitive trade action by Washington against India. People closely tracking India-US ties said there is a possibility of both sides exploring the option of looking at a trade pact to avoid high tariffs and expand the overall trade basket. In their meeting, the two leaders are likely to focus on ramping up India-US cooperation in sectors like trade, investment, energy, defence, technology and immigration. Apart from some possible sector-specific outcomes, it will be interesting to see the optics and what kind of broader signal the meeting between Modi and Trump, known for their personal bonhomie, generates. Modi arrived right after his visit to France where he had co-chaired the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit with French President Emmanuel Macron. He is the fourth foreign leader hosted by Trump over the weeks since his inauguration. Within less than a month of the start of his second term in the White House, Trump has hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, and Jordan's King Abdullah II.","summary":"Prime Minister Modi has arrived in the US for high-stakes talks with President Trump, focusing on trade, investment, and immigration amidst concerns over American trade policies.

Canada is the largest source of imported steel in the U.S.\n\nRepresentative Jim Costa of California wrote to the president on behalf of 44 House Democrats urging Trump to reconsider the tariffs on America’s closest neighbors after warning the tariffs could “exacerbate the nation’s housing affordability crisis, drive up consumer costs, and slow down the construction of new homes.” \n\nCosta noted that the U.S. imports billions worth of building materials every year.\n\n“Given the severe housing shortage, compounded by rising construction costs, persistent supply chain disruptions, and an estimated shortfall of 6 million homes, these looming tariffs, while intended to protect domestic industries, risk further exacerbating the housing supply and affordability crisis while stifling the development of new housing,” Costa wrote in the letter shared in a post on X. \n\nThe letter, first reported by the Guardian, urged Trump to reconsider hitting Mexico and Canada in particular with the tax to “ensure that the escalating costs do not further restrict the development of affordable housing for American families.”\n\nCosta cited analysis from the National Association of Home Builders that suggested Trump’s proposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico are projected to raise the cost of imported construction materials by up to $4 billion. \n\nThe association said that the tariffs are in effect a “tax on American builders, home buyers and consumers.”\n\nAmericans are the ones who will pay the price, the association noted. “Tariffs on building materials raise the cost of housing, and consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,” the NAHB warned on its website.\n\nBeyond the tariffs on steel and aluminum, the overall tariffs on Canadian lumber would rise to nearly 40 percent because of a 14.5 percent duty already in place, the association noted. \n\nYesterday top Canadian lawmaker Chrystia Freeland, who resigned last month as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s deputy and finance minister, retaliated by vowing “surgical” reprisals to the tariffs.\n\nFreeland, who is running to be the next leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister of Canada, said that if forced to do so, the nation will “inflict the biggest trade blow that the United States has ever endured.”\n\nThe NAHB is calling for the Trump administration to allow a tariff exemption for building materials. \n\nCosta’s letter ends by calling on Trump to “shield American families from escalating housing costs.” \n\nA White House spokesperson told the Guardian that Trump’s tariffs would “usher in a new era of growth and prosperity.”\n\n“In his first administration, President Trump instituted an America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and an unleashing of American energy that resulted in historic job, wage, and investment growth with no inflation,” said spokesperson Kush Desai. “In his second administration, President Trump will again use tariffs to level the playing field and usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for American industry and workers.”\n\nThe tariffs are currently due to come into effect on March 4.","summary":"Trump’s 25 percent tariffs could ‘exacerbate the nation’s housing affordability crisis, drive up consumer costs, and slow down the construction of new homes’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-canada-mexico-tariffs-housing-b2697222.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/12/15/50/SEI239525715.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rIXPVajk-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:36:30","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.506},{"id":289894306,"title":"Zelensky sanctions key political rival – media","text":"Kiev has allegedly imposed sanctions on former president Pyotr Poroshenko, according to multiple local media outlets, as Vladimir Zelensky spoke about the need to fight those “selling Ukraine” in his Wednesday address.\n\nThe nature of the restrictions remains unclear, but Ukrainian media sources claimed they were linked to the “treason” charges against Poroshenko. The sanctions were reportedly imposed by the National Security and Defense Council (SNBO) – a coordinating body that normally answers to the president – following Zelensky’s meeting with SNBO members.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader confirmed that a certain “decision” was made at the meeting and vowed to make it public on Thursday. He claimed the move was aimed at “protecting our state and restoring justice” and promised to hold accountable those who had supposedly “destroyed” Ukraine’s national security and helped Moscow.\n\nZelensky specifically mentioned “billions … earned by selling Ukraine” and its interests, adding that the money “must be blocked.” However, he did not name anyone.\n\nPoroshenko called the restrictions “absolutely illegal” and branded them a “provocation” in a statement on Facebook. He claimed that Zelensky personally “ordered, signed, and implemented” the SNBO decision. Earlier, he stated that Ukrainian authorities had barred him from attending the Munich Security Conference, scheduled for February 14-16.\n\nThe current head of the European Solidarity party, which holds 27 seats in Ukraine’s 450-seat parliament, Poroshenko led the country from 2014 to 2019 following the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich in a Western-backed coup. In December 2021, he was charged with high treason over alleged coal deals in Donbass during his presidency. His assets were frozen in January 2022, but he vowed in court not to flee the country.\n\nPoroshenko has since emerged as a fierce critic of Vladimir Zelensky. In 2023, he appealed to EU leaders, calling for the “restoration of freedom of speech” and political plurality in Ukraine. He also condemned what he described as Kiev’s “authoritarianism.” In early February, he accused Zelensky of failing to establish effective communication with US President Donald Trump.\n\nZelensky held a phone call with Trump on Wednesday, as the US president’s envoy delivered his demands for the “equivalent of $500 billion worth of rare earths” in exchange for the hundreds of billions of dollars Washington has spent bankrolling Kiev.\n\nZelensky “is selling out what remains of Ukraine, selling it for a pittance and openly,” Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), said on Wednesday, noting that much of the mineral wealth Zelensky is offering to Trump is actually Russian.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly questioned Zelensky’s legitimacy since his presidential term officially expired in May 2024. Amid growing pressure on Kiev to organize a new presidential election, Ukrainian media reported in mid-January that Zelensky was considering further legal action against his critic and political rival.","summary":"Kiev has allegedly imposed sanctions on former president Pyotr Poroshenko, as Vladimir Zelensky spoke about fighting those “selling Ukraine” \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/612615-ukraine-zelensky-sanctions-poroshenko/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.02/article/67ad3da02030274954698c97.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:34:38","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":289893112,"title":"Letters: Withdrawing my support for Tesla and Elon Musk","text":"Withdrawing support\nfor Tesla and Musk\n\nTo the employees of Tesla, I apologize.\n\nYou have made an amazing car.

The letter writer celebrates actions that are frankly illegal and unconstitutional. It appears that the conservative element of our society has become cruel and favorable to criminals that sacked our Capitol, and will promote the rich over the average citizen who depends on traditional government programs to protect their well-being, provide food to struggling families and keep them healthy.\n\nThese programs are not free; they’re funded with the taxes paid by the average citizen.

We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now.”\n\nAccording to the state-run account TASS Russian Media, the Kremlin confirmed the phone call with Trump via a Telegram post.\n\nNot only did Trump say that he’d begin negotiations “immediately” between the U.S. and Russia, but he also referenced Putin’s use of Trump’s “power campaign motto” of “common sense.” \n\nHow does Trump not see that Putin knows how to get what he wants by playing to Trump’s fragile ego and need to be seen as an influential strongman? \n\nAn hour later, Trump posted that he had, indeed, spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying on Truth Social that Zelenskyy agreed that Ukraine “wants to make PEACE.”\n\n“It is time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION,” Trump added. “God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!”\n\nZelenskyy took to X after the phone call and said in a video statement, “We believe that America’s stretch is sufficient to pressure Russia and Putin into peace.” \n\n“I had a long and detailed conversation with President Trump,” wrote Zelenskyy. “I appreciate his genuine interest in our shared opportunities and how we can bring about real peace together.”\n\nCoincidentally, Trump’s announcements came shortly after the U.S. Department of Defense announced it would capitulate to Russia in drawing Ukraine’s borders. On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Ukraine’s pre-invasion borders were “an unrealistic objective” and an “illusionary goal” during his first trip to meet with NATO in Brussels.\n\nBefore being elected to his second term, Trump vowed to end U.S. funding to Ukraine—even though the majority of Americans support it. He picked terrible Cabinet nominees like Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., both of whom have spouted pro-Russian talking points.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, in a move that Daily Kos’ Markos Moulitsas described as truly “morally repugnant,” Trump wasted no time leveraging U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine in exchange for $500 billion of its mineral reserves. \n\n“I told [Ukraine] that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. “And they've essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don’t feel stupid. Otherwise, we're stupid. I said to them we have to—we have to get something. We can’t continue to pay this money.”\n\nGlobal democracy be damned.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump continued wheeling and dealing with the Kremlin. He freed accused Russian money launderer Alexander Vinnik in exchange for wrongfully detained American teacher Marc Fogel. Fogel, draped in an American flag, met Trump outside the White House late Tuesday and called him a “hero.”\n\nTrump’s foreign policy strategy apparently consists of abandoning allies, appeasing adversaries, and profiting off global instability.

In January, Trump signed the executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S.’ tallest mountain in Alaska, Denali, back to Mt. McKinley as part of his administration’s vow to honor “American greatness.”\n\n The body of water borders both the United States and Mexico and has been named the Gulf of Mexico for more than 400 years, the AP notes, adding that its AP Stylebook is used and relied upon by writers and journalists across the world. \n\n Since the president’s order only carries authority within the U.S, and Mexico, as well as other countries, are not required to recognize the name change, the AP stated that it would refer to the Gulf of Mexico “by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.”\n\n White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the ban during a press briefing on Wednesday, per the Washington Post. “It is a privilege to cover this White House. It’s a privilege to be the White House press secretary,” Leavitt said. “And nobody has the right to go into the Oval Office and ask the president of the United States questions. That’s an invitation that is given. … We reserve the right to decide who gets to go into the Oval Office.”\n\n In a letter to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on Wednesday, called on the Trump administration to reconsider its decision, signaling potential legal action. “The actions taken by the White House were plainly intended to punish the AP for the content of its speech,” wrote Pace. “This is viewpoint discrimination based on a news organization’s editorial choices and a clear violation of the First Amendment.”","summary":"The president demanded the news outlet alter its style after he ordered to rename the Gulf of Mexico","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-associated-press-ban-gulf-mexico-america-1235265798/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trump-associated-press-ban.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:21:05","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":289895322,"title":"Donald Trump's High Approval Rating Fades: Poll","text":"President Donald Trump's high approval rating appears to be fading, according to polls from The Economist /YouGov.Newsweek reached out to the White House via email on Wednesday for comment.Why It MattersTrump headed into office on the heels of a favorable rating and held onto the positive polling during his first weeks on the job.

Trump spoke with reporters on Wednesday afternoon from the Oval Office when he was asked how soon he wanted the Department of Education (DOE) to be closed. \"Oh, I’d like it to be closed immediately. Look at the Department of Education. It’s a big con job,\" he answered. \"They ranked the top countries in the world. We’re ranked number 40th, but we’re ranked number 1 in 1 department: cost per pupil. So, we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, but we’re ranked number 40.\" Trump said the last time he looked at where the U.S. ranked in education, it was ranked 38th, but then he looked two days ago, and the country had fallen to number 40. DOGE SLASHES OVER $100M IN DEI FUNDING AT EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: ‘WIN FOR EVERY STUDENT’ He even noted that China had ranked in the top five. \"As big as it is, it’s ranked in the top five, and that’s our…primary competitor,\" Trump said. \"So, if we’re ranked number 40, that means something’s really wrong.\" The president has ordered the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the department led by Elon Musk, to find ways to slash wasteful spending, and the DOE made the chopping block this week. TRUMP PUTS HIGHER EDUCATION ON NOTICE FOR ‘DANGEROUS, DEMEANING, AND IMMORAL’ DEI TEACHINGS In fact, DOGE announced on Monday that $881 million was being cut in connection with 89 DOE contracts. Of that $881 million, DOGE identified $101 million that was being used for DEI training, including teaching educators to \"help students understand/interrogate the complex histories involved in oppression, and help students recognize areas of privilege and power on an individual and collective basis.\" \"Your tax dollars were spent on this,\" Musk wrote of the DOE spending. Last month, Trump signed two executive orders on education: one to remove federal funding from K-12 schools that teach critical race theory (CRT), and another to support school choice. TRUMP EDUCATION DEPT LAUNCHES PROBE INTO ‘EXPLOSION OF ANTISEMITISM’ AT 5 UNIVERSITIES The teaching of CRT, and other controversial content in schools, has sparked backlash from parents at school board meetings across the nation over the past several years. During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to cut federal funding for schools that promote CRT, transgender ideology and \"any other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.\" Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders targeting federal funding for schools as testing scores continue to drop, according to the Nation's Report Card.

Putin and Trump had agreed that the “time has come to work together” and that the Russian leader has invited his US counterpart to Moscow, it said.\n\n‘Make peace’\n\nTrump took the world by surprise as he announced the call on his Truth Social network earlier, saying they had “both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” using an unconfirmed figure for the toll in the conflict.\n\nThe US president said he and Putin had agreed to “work together very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations” and to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately” on Ukraine.\n\nTrump later called Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was not included on the call with Putin. \n\nZelensky said afterwards that he had a “meaningful” call with Trump in which he had “shared details” of his talks with Putin. Trump said after the conversation that Zelensky “like President Putin, wants to make PEACE.”\n\nBut the move sparked concerns that Ukraine will be left out of talks on its own fate.\n\nPentagon chief Pete Hegseth told European counterparts earlier Wednesday that Ukraine’s dream of returning to its pre-2014 borders was an “illusionary goal” and that Kyiv’s wish for NATO membership was “not realistic.”\n\nTrump denied that Zelensky was being frozen out, and rejected criticism that Hegseth’s comments meant Washington was agreeing to Russia’s preconditions.\n\nHe added that NATO membership for Ukraine was “impractical.”\n\nZelensky is due to meet US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday at the Munich Security Conference, after meeting US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Wednesday.\n\nThe Kremlin’s statement on the call with Trump was more measured. It said Putin “agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be reached through peace negotiations” but said he wanted to “address the root causes of the conflict,” which Russian blames on western influence on Kyiv.\n\nHowever, concern has been mounting in Kyiv and European capitals about the shape of a possible deal.\n\nThe French, German and Spanish foreign ministers insisted Wednesday that there could be “no just and lasting peace” without the involvement of Kyiv and its European partners.","summary":"After a “lengthy and productive” call with the Russian autocrat, Trump tells reporters that their next face-to-face will be in the Middle East in the “not too distant future”.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47028","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2024/12/13/908259e09cd3b4b14e6c875288d342fc.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:05:48","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":289892274,"title":"For China, USAID’s demise could be a soft power win in Southeast Asia","text":"As the United States winds back humanitarian assistance in Southeast Asia, its rival China may see an opportunity to expand its influence in a region where it has directed billions of dollars in investment and aid, analysts say.\n\nIn a little over three weeks since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Washington has frozen nearly all foreign aid and moved to effectively abolish the US Agency for International Development (USAID), a longstanding source of soft power in the region.\n\nUSAID, the biggest disburser of US foreign aid, spent $860m in Southeast Asia alone last year, funding projects on everything from treating HIV to preserving biodiversity and strengthening local governance.\n\nMany projects, which run primarily through grants to local NGOs, face an uncertain future as the Trump administration pulls the US back from the world stage as part of his “America first” agenda.\n\nFor Beijing, the circumstances provide an ideal opportunity for it to step in, said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n“The suspension of health, education, and humanitarian programmes – key pillars of US soft power – may create vacuums that China can fill,” Huang told Al Jazeera.\n\n“This strategic retreat could strengthen Beijing’s influence across the region, particularly in current US aid recipients like Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, and Cambodia.”\n\nAs the Trump administration generated headlines with its moves to gut USAID last week, Beijing made news by stepping in with $4.4m to fund a de-mining project in Cambodia that had been left in the lurch by Washington.\n\nHeng Ratana, head of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre, told the Khmer Times newspaper the Chinese aid would help his organisation clear more than 3,400 hectares (8,400 acres) of land filled with landmines and unexploded ordnance.\n\nChina’s embassies in the US, Cambodia and Thailand did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.\n\nJoshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said USAID’s demise comes as US influence in the region is waning more generally and as China scales up its public diplomacy.\n\nSoutheast Asian leaders are concerned about “chaotic policymaking” in the US, Kurlantzick told Al Jazeera, particularly in countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, where the US devotes significant aid and security assistance.\n\n“Beijing is indeed already portraying the US as uncaring and unable to lead regionally or globally and I expect Beijing to increase its aid and investment now in many parts of the developing world,” Kurlantzick told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile the future of many USAID programmes in the region is unclear, some analysts believe that China is likely to leave projects with a more political or ideological focus to other partners to the region, such as the European Union, Australia, Japan or the Asian Development Project, a Manila-based regional development bank.\n\n“China’s existing international aid or international development programme is quite sizeable. But it happens to be quite different from what USAID does in that the latter seems to be devoting a lot of resources to ideology-based initiatives, for democracy, for LGBTQ, for diversity, for inclusiveness, for climate change,” John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Whether China is going to step into the void vacated by the United States, I am very sceptical. We are talking about different things here. And besides, I don’t think the Chinese government is keen on competing with Washington on this front,” Gong said.\n\nChina’s foreign assistance has been heavily geared towards infrastructure, as laid out in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing’s flagship infrastructure investment project estimated to be worth more than $1 trillion.\n\nOther projects, such as its hospital ship Peace Ark, have provided medical assistance.\n\nAlmost all of China’s foreign aid to Southeast Asia – some 85 percent – has taken the form of non-concessional loans with a focus on energy and transport, according to Grace Stanhope, a research associate at the Lowy Institute’s Indo-Pacific Development Centre.\n\nBeijing’s infrastructure-heavy approach has made it a visible presence in the region, albeit not always a popular one, Stanhope told Al Jazeera, due to delays and “blow-out” budgets for projects such as the East Coast Rail Link in Malaysia and Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail line in Indonesia.\n\nSome critics have referred to these and other projects as a form of “debt-trap” diplomacy intended to breed dependency on China, a charge Beijing has denied.\n\nIn a survey carried out by the Singapore-based Iseas Yusof-Ishak Institute last year, 59.5 percent of respondents across 10 Southeast Asian countries chose China as the most influential economic power in the region.\n\nJust over half, however, expressed distrust of China, with 45.5 percent fearing that China could threaten their country economically or militarily. Japan was seen as the “most trusted” major power, followed by the US and the EU.\n\nThough heavily focused on infrastructure, China has been slowly trying to shift its model of assistance towards more “soft” aid such as public health, agriculture and digitisation, said Joanne Lin, a senior fellow at the Iseas Yusof-Ishak Institute’s ASEAN studies centre in Singapore.\n\n“The extent of China’s aid will of course depend on China’s economic ability as it is facing constraints such as its slowing growth and trade tensions with Washington which may limit its ability to replace US aid in full,” Lin told Al Jazeera.\n\nLin said Southeast Asian countries prefer a “diversified approach” to foreign aid and development assistance that is not dependent on a single donor – whether the US or China.\n\nDespite its high-profile presence in Southeast Asia, China has been scaling back its development assistance in the region in recent years.\n\nWhile China was the region’s top donor from 2015 to 2019, it has since slid to fourth place, according to the Lowy Institute.\n\nFunding has similarly dried up, falling from $10bn in 2017 to $3bn in 2022, according to the think tank.\n\nChina faces its own problems at home, including slowing economic growth and high youth unemployment, that could limit its focus on affairs overseas, said Steve Balla, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.\n\n“The domestic issues may serve to limit [Chinese President Xi Jinping’s] attention to international affairs. The issues with Belt and Road may limit the regime’s options for how to step into spaces left by the US,” Balla told Al Jazeera.\n\nBethany Allen, head of programme for China Investigations and Analysis at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, expressed a similar sentiment.\n\n“China is already capitalising on US disengagement in the first Trump era by deepening its economic, diplomatic and cultural influence in Southeast Asia. Initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, Confucius, and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism are tools for expanding soft power,” Allen told Al Jazeera, referring to a global programme to promote the study of Chinese language and culture, and a forum to promote cooperation between China and the Mekong subregion.\n\n“However, China’s lowering economic growth means slowing BRI, resulting in the country’s soft power project might be less aggressive than in the past decade. High-profile debt concerns and pushback against Chinese influence [in Malaysia and Indonesia] also limit its appeal,” she said.","summary":"Washington&#039;s retreat from the region leaves space that Beijing may be keen to fill, analysts say.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/13/for-china-usaids-demise-could-be-a-soft-power-win-in-southeast-asia?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP130437376401-1739337305_01cf24-1739337360.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:02:52","author":"Apps Support,Erin Hale","authors":["Apps Support","Erin Hale"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.161},{"id":289892508,"title":"UK vows ‘steadfast’ support for Ukraine amid reports of Trump-Putin talks","text":"The UK will continue to support Ukraine’s defence against Russia, the Deputy Prime Minister signalled after Donald Trump claimed he and Vladimir Putin had agreed to start negotiations on ending the war.\n\nBritain’s support for Ukraine remains “steadfast”, Angela Rayner said amid the US president’s moves to draw the conflict to an end.\n\nMr Trump said he had agreed with Russia’s leader to “work together, very closely” on bringing the three-year conflict to an end in a phone conversation on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to ITV’s Peston, the Deputy Prime Minister said the Government and “the whole of Parliament” were united in support for Kyiv, when asked about the US president’s claims.\n\n“We’ll continue to support Ukraine, and… the Prime Minister was very clear when he answered that question earlier today in the House,” she added.\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey had earlier said welcoming Ukraine into Nato will take “some time”, and the focus “for now” should be on ensuring Kyiv is in a strong position going into any potential peace talks, after the US insisted the country’s membership of the military alliance was not a realistic prospect.\n\nGiving a press conference in Brussels after a meeting of defence leaders from countries across the world, Mr Healey said that Ukraine’s “rightful place” was within Nato, which the country has been seeking to join for many years.\n\nBut he sought to play down splits between the UK and Washington, despite US defence secretary Pete Hegseth appearing to rule out membership for the country as a way of guaranteeing its security.\n\nIt will be a major blow to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as admission of new countries to the alliance requires unanimous agreement by existing members.\n\nMr Trump’s call with the Russian president came just hours after Mr Zelensky warned “Putin is not preparing for peace” and called for unity from Ukraine’s allies.\n\nMr Healey joined more than 50 defence allies from across the world, including from France, Germany and the US, at Nato’s headquarters in the Belgian capital, where he chaired the 26th Ukraine Defence Contact Group summit.\n\nAddressing defence ministers at the meeting, Mr Hegseth indicated that Washington is intent on getting Europe to carry most of the financial and military burden of defending Ukraine.\n\nHe also appeared to rule out deploying US peacekeeping troops in the event of a potential ceasefire, and suggested any soldiers from other countries should be sent as a non-Nato mission without Article Five protections.\n\nThe alliance’s Article Five says that an armed attack on one member of the military bloc is considered an attack on all.\n\nElsewhere, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage signalled his support for Ukraine joining Nato, describing the move as “essential”.\n\nMr Farage previously came under fire for having claimed Nato and the EU had “provoked” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as the West expanded its influence into post-Soviet states.","summary":"‘The whole of Parliament’ continues to support Ukraine, Angela Rayner said, amid the US president’s moves to draw the conflict to an end.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/john-healey-angela-rayner-ukraine-vladimir-putin-trump-b1210846.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/13/00/12-e07b3f8bfdeb4c26be3edf42c6ef3a39.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:01:40","author":"David Lynch","authors":["David Lynch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.08},{"id":289890102,"title":"'Nowhere else was getting money like Cork was under the last government'","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

We may be about to find out. \n\n12.02am, 13 Feb 2025\n\nShare options\n\nA LITTLE-NOTICED SECTION of the Programme for Government (PfG) may help to pave the way for greater visibility on how different parts of the country receive funding for major projects.\n\nThat’s according to one researcher who has been lobbying for greater oversight of politicians’ influence on capital funding for projects ranging from motorways to urban regeneration projects, hospitals and schools.\n\nFor the first time, the Programme for Government has a section which proposes detailing the breakdown of how much money is going where in each government department.\n\n“The last government spent €44 billion across five Budgets on capital projects,” Ray Griffin, a strategic management lecturer, told The Journal. ”We can’t see the data on that but of the data we can see, Dublin gets between 55 and 65%, with only 30% of the population.\n\n“Cork does okay but – and I’m not saying Cork doesn’t deserve this – nowhere else of a similar size was getting it like Cork was in the last government.”\n\nCompared to other regions, he believes “the flow of money into Cork was obscene”, noting the Dunkettle Interchange, Cork University Hospital and Cork Airport as benefiting to the combined tune of hundreds of millions of euro.\n\nRay Griffin appearing before TDs in the Oireachtas last year.Oireachtas\n\nThe policy is partly driven by a sense in some quarters that senior ministers sitting at the Cabinet see their own backyards benefit much more than others.\n\nThere is a government-stamped capital spending tracker, but Griffin said this is “limited” due to only capturing “roughly half” of the total spend.\n\nWhile capital spending is audited by the Comptroller and General, the total spend is not collected anywhere, Griffin argued.\n\nAt present, Griffin said, to find out the true amount of capital funding you have to “search ministers’ Twitter feeds for scraps of information”, but it is “not possible to definitively identify” the total spend.\n\nEven with this, Griffin believes the capital tracker still demonstrates Dublin and Cork receive an at times “disproportionate” share.\n\nInclusion in the Programme for Government\n\nAccording to the Programme for Government, the new coalition is looking at “greater transparency and oversight” on department spending on capital projects.\n\nThis short section says the Government wants to deliver “necessary improvements in how government departments report capital spending”, with the potential for “statutory reporting obligations” on each department of the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGriffin, who lectures at the South East Technological University and co-authors the South East Economic Monitor, which documents the region’s attempts to recover from the recession, has presented at several Oireachtas committees across previous Dáil terms, including last year when he spoke on behalf of legislation seeking similar reporting on capital spending.\n\nThe bill was proposed by the now former Waterford Independent TD Matt Shanahan but never progressed beyond committee.\n\nUnder that legislation, the final figure for a project would be published five years after the project has completed, partly to avoid an impact on contract tendering.\n\nGriffin views the PfG item – understood to have been included by Regional Independents during Government formation – as a “step towards cleaning up the system and weakening the influence of politicians” on some major funding decisions.\n\nInstead, Griffin would like to see a formula for allocating capital spending across different regions to ensure a “more equitable” distribution.\n\nDescribing the current method in scathing terms, he said “the Cabinet structure” was based on a “klepto-constituency model”.\n\n“The current system works for major parties and senior politicians, who benefit from the status quo,” he added.\n\n‘Putting manners’ on future governments\n\nWhile he expects resistance, Griffin believes that the “very act of having the data being public will put manners” on future governments.\n\nGriffin also warned that the perceived inequality of spending feeds a view that leads to a distrust of the political system and risks “a revenge of the places that don’t matter” in years to come.\n\nOverall, Griffin said there can be an “ugliness to the speed” of some ministers’ endowment of their local constituencies.\n\n“The model is that they have to do it quickly before they lose power – they never know when they’re going to get thrown off the donkey,” Griffin added.\n\nDepartment response\n\nWhen contacted, the Department of Public Expenditure argued that there is “substantial information made publicly available” and that any capital expendture is used as approved by the Oireachtas.\n\nThe department said it had “made enhancements” last year in a bid to improve the reporting on capital spending for the delivery of projects.\n\n“In the annual appropriation account of Government Departments, details of all major capital projects and Public Private Partnership projects, where the project value exceeds €10,000,000, are separately disclosed,” a spokesperson said.\n\n“Where the reported commitment level or projected project cost has varied by more than €500,000 compared with the previous year, the reason for the movement are also explained.”\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting

The former first minister said Palestinians will always resist attempts to take over their land, in response to recent remarks from Donald Trump that have thrown the recent Israel-Hamas ceasefire into question. Maged and Elizabeth El-Nakla – the parents of Mr Yousaf’s wife Nadia El-Nakla – were visiting relatives in the Palestinian enclave when war broke out following October 7, 2023. They became trapped for four weeks before leaving through Egypt with other British nationals. Mr Yousaf said any prospect of his parents-in-law returning to Gaza was a “very distant dream”. One of Nadia’s cousins, Sally, fled her home in the north of Gaza to stay at Maged’s house in Deir al-Balah in the central part of the strip. Mr Yousaf said: “She has not travelled back to the north, because she has already been told her house has been completely flattened and turned to rubble. “So what is the point of making the arduous journey back with four children only to return to rubble and dust? So the situation is hell on Earth.” Those who fled the strip, he said, did so because they had no choice. The former first minister said that before the latest Israel-Hamas war broke out, Maged had extended his house and purchased a mosque next door for the community. These have been damaged in the war but are still standing. Maged and Elizabeth described Gaza as a “beautiful place”, he said, having been removed form another part of Palestine when he was younger. Mr Yousaf said: “He’s now seen the entire land become decimated – seen his mum, his son, his grandchildren all become refugees again. And is powerless to do anything about it. “He’s become a shell of a man, he was incredibly outgoing, sociable, energetic individual. Since those traumatic four weeks it’s had an impact on him and my mother-in-law from, which I don’t think they’ll properly recover.” Any prospect of returning to Gaza is far from their minds and “seems like a very distant dream”, the former first minister said, due to the ongoing hardships there and the fact much of the family has now left. Nadia’s brother, Mohammed, was working as a doctor in Gaza during the war, but has now left and is working in a shwarma shop in another country, Mr Yousaf said. People in Gaza are “the most resilient in the world”, but are “worried about what the future holds”, the MSP said. Mr Yousaf said Mr Trump’s comments should be taken seriously and could lead to more “death and devastation” in Gaza. The US President has suggested taking over the Gaza Strip and recently said “all hell is going to break out” if Hamas does not release all hostages by a Saturday deadline. Mr Yousaf said he could not speak for Palestinians, but suspected “people in Gaza will make it abundantly clear, that whoever threatens to take their land they will resist”. “They’ll make it abundantly clear they won’t give up their land regardless of how many US tax dollars are thrown at them,” he said. Mr Yousaf continued: “Donald Trump tries to use a kind of strongman tactic to convince Hamas to release the rest of the hostages – something I’ve been calling for from day one. “The people who will pay the price of that won’t be Hamas, it will be the innocent people of Gaza.”","summary":"Humza Yousaf has spoken about his family from Gaza in response to Donald Trump’s latest comments","url":"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/hell-on-earth-humza-yousaf-responds-to-donald-trump-and-tells-of-gaza-family-member-now-a-shell-4988223","image":"https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/08/08/15/08/GettyImages-2149692202.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:01:08","author":"Neil Pooran","authors":["Neil Pooran"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":289890574,"title":"Did Japan’s Ishiba cozy up to Trump or was he an effective negotiator at the summit?","text":"Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has received mixed reactions back home over his recent meeting with US President Donald Trump, with critics saying he was submissive in Washington and others defending his effective diplomacy.\nDuring a TV interview on Monday, Ishiba outlined his strategy that he was using in his talks with Trump, who made it clear in his first few weeks in the White House that the US intended to dominate its allies as well as rivals.\nIshiba told Nippon Television Network that the negotiation tactics he deployed in Washington were simple and effective.\n“If I said ‘no’ to him, then everything would be disrupted,” he said. “It is said that he hates being disagreed with, so I didn’t.”\nIshiba avoided pointing out “the rule of law” to Trump so the president did not feel he was being “lectured”, he added.\nHis comments have lent credence to Japanese media reports that he underwent intensive training with the help of bureaucrats in Tokyo ahead of his departure for the US on how to deal with Trump.\nIshiba said he worded his comments carefully to elicit positive responses, at one point suggesting that upending the status quo in northeast Asia would “not be good” – to which Trump agreed. The Japanese leader also avoided discussion on the future of Gaza, which Trump had indicated that it should come under US control.\nIshiba also gave the US leader a replica samurai helmet in gold valued at 168,000 yen (US$1,094). The gift was reminiscent of a gold-plated putter that then-prime minister Shinzo Abe presented to Trump in New York just before the Republican assumed his first term in the White House in January 2017.\n\nNotably, Abe got on well with Trump and was able to help stave off any US measures detrimental to Japan’s interests, analysts say.\nIshiba was quick to highlight Trump’s achievements, pointing to a photo in the White House showing Trump bleeding after he was injured in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last July and saying: “You must certainly have felt then that you were chosen by God.”\nHe also referred to Trump’s familiar slogan “Make America Great Again”, saying it was “based on deep compassion for the forgotten people”.\nA joint statement issued after the Trump-Ishiba summit highlighted a “golden age” in relations between the US and Japan.\nFor some politicians in Japan, Ishiba’s praise of Trump was excessive.\nIchiro Ozawa, a leading member of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, said: “Even though expectations were low due to [Ishiba’s] strange diplomatic manners, he just dangled a huge ‘souvenir’ and praised the other party, and appears self-satisfied and relieved that it went well.\n“I am more concerned about future demands, such as tariffs and increased costs for US military bases.”\n\nOzawa criticised Ishiba’s offer of substantial investments in the US from Japan, saying the “outflow of money will further hollow out the Japanese economy and accelerate its decline”.\nJiro Karafuto, a political commentator, said on his YouTube channel that Ishiba had been carrying out dogeza diplomacy. Dogeza refers to an aspect of Japanese etiquette that involves a person kneeling and bowing so low that the head touches the floor.\n“Don’t you have any pride?” Karafuto added.\nSimilarly, the headline on a front-page opinion article in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper on Tuesday read: “In cozying up to Trump, Ishiba erodes principles of the rule of law.”\nOthers, however, were impressed by what Ishiba had achieved in his talks with Trump.\nAn editorial published on Monday in the Sankei newspaper said the summit was “a success” and that Ishiba and Trump had been aligned “on security issues in the face of common threats from China and North Korea”.\n\nThe summit appeared to have boosted Ishiba’s standing in the eyes of the Japanese people. A survey conducted by national broadcaster NHK conducted over three days from Friday – the day of the summit in Washington – shows Ishiba’s public approval rating rising by four percentage points to 44 per cent.\nHiromi Murakami, a professor of political science at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, said many Japanese were “very worried” about Ishiba’s lack of experience as the country’s leader and that he would face “an extremely difficult meeting” with Trump.\n“But it is clear that he studied and prepared a great deal before he went and that Japanese bureaucrats learned from Abe’s experience, did their homework and were ready,” Murakami told This Week in Asia.\n“It seems to me that they connected very well and that Ishiba himself did well in what could have been a difficult situation,” Murakami added. “This was his first real test on the global stage, and I think there are grounds for optimism going forward.”","summary":"While some critics said Ishiba’s praise of Trump was excessive, others declared the Washington summit between the two leaders “a success”.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3298428/did-japans-ishiba-cozy-trump-or-was-he-effective-negotiator-summit","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/12/aa52851e-d94a-4c39-a090-90a443939d90_6b1eaba7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-13 00:00:14","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":289898740,"title":"Here's the heinous way Republicans plan to fund tax cuts for the rich","text":"House Republicans released a budget proposal Wednesday outlining plans to pay for President Donald Trump's tax cuts for the rich by forcing deep cuts to programs like food stamps and Medicaid.\n\n\"This budget resolution is a key step to start the process in delivering President Trump’s America First agenda. With nearly every House Republican directly engaged in this deliberative process, this resolution reflects our collective commitment to enacting the President’s full agenda—not just a part of it,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, posted on X\n\nThe budget blueprint calls for $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid—the program that provides health insurance to 72 million low-income Americans—over the next 10 years, which would require states to either come up with the money to fund it themselves or slash benefits for recipients.\n\nThe budget also calls for $230 billion in cuts to food stamps, which the Center for American Progress says amounts to a 20% cut to the program that helps feed 42 million Americans annually. Many food stamp recipients live in red states that Trump won by large margins, such as West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, which have some of the highest populations of food stamp recipients in the country.\n\nAnd in recent days, Republicans and DOGE bro Elon Musk have suggested that they are coming for Social Security, the popular social safety net program that provides an income for retirees. Politicians have historically avoided cutting Social Security for fear of voter backlash.\n\nAll of these cuts would be used to pay for the $4.5 trillion renewal of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest tax payers. A Tax Policy Center analysis found that the top 1% of earners received an average tax cut of more than $60,000 in 2025, while the bottom 60% received an average annual tax cut of just $500.\n\nThe Republicans’ budget says that their ultimate goal is to reduce mandatory spending by $2 trillion—this includes Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and veterans benefits. If they cannot find $2 trillion, the tax cuts “should be reduced by a commensurate amount to offset the difference,” according to the budget.\n\nRepublicans plan to have a budget hearing on Thursday, with a goal of passing the budget by the end of the month, CNN reported.\n\nRepublicans have admitted that those kinds of cuts will be “painful” for Americans. Ultimately, making these kinds of cuts could be politically disastrous for the GOP.\n\nA January poll from the Democratic firm Hart Research found that 76% of voters have a favorable view of Medicaid, and that 78% disapprove of major Medicaid cuts. It also found that 82% of voters disapprove of making cuts to health care programs in order to pay for tax cuts.\n\nDemocrats immediately lambasted the Republican budget proposal.\n\n\"Senate Republicans' partisan budget resolution would toss programs like SNAP and Medicaid into the woodchipper—all in service of passing tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans,\" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington wrote on X.\n\nAnd Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina shared similar opposition to the GOP budget proposal in a post on X. \n\n“They have one agenda — stealing from the poor and giving to the rich.”\n\nThank you to the Daily Kos community who continues to fight so hard with Daily Kos.

So USAID was created and has made a huge difference in bringing down childhood malnutrition and birthing deaths, and in suppressing deadly viruses. Yet Elon Musk, who has already made enough money off Donald Trump’s policies to finance most of USAID’s budget, without a second thought, has “put that program in the chipper.” Is it because the greatest needs are in Africa? Make no mistake, people will die.\n\nWhat Trump is doing to people’s lives here and around the world is immoral and against all that Lady Liberty stands for. He believes and acts like he is above our laws. Trump said ”radical lunatics” are running USAID; I think they are running the White House.\n\nSandy Foehr\n\nCongress cannot allow\nthe end of USAID\n\nRe: “World’s richest man takes on poorest children” (Page A7, Feb. 7).\n\nNicholas Kristof’s column about the end of U.S. programs that save and educate children around the world makes me feel like I woke up in the wrong country.\n\nUp until just a few weeks ago we, as Americans in 2023 alone, helped save 238,000 newborns who weren’t breathing at birth. We reached 28 million children under 5 with basic nutrition and made sure that 12 million women had safe facilities for childbirth. All these programs and many more are now gone. Even children and their parents who were undergoing treatments for malaria or TB are no longer allowed to be treated, even though their life-saving drugs are just sitting in warehouses.\n\nIs this what we now stand for as Americans? Congress approved and funded these programs, and Congress must take back its constitutional authority and restore them.\n\nJohn Tupper\n\nCalifornia needs new\nstrategy for housing\n\nRe: “Bay Area still nation’s tech center — for now” (Page A7, Jan. 22).\n\nCalifornia’s plan for solving the housing crisis is always “build a lot everywhere.” Of course. More supply means lower prices.\n\nThe problem is that demand is not static (given that the population here or coming into the state is not static), and incomes are rising, especially among some segments. How well has runaway building lowered prices in major global metropoles? It often hasn’t because demand is not static.\n\nAlso neglected is whether any new supply will be delivered at affordable prices — which often doesn’t happen. Developers have to make money.\n\nAdditionally, no one is talking about all the money needed to enlarge schools and to expand transportation and emergency management systems to cope with massive amounts of sprawling new housing.\n\nCalifornia needs to move away from its illogical (and dangerous) focus on quantity and emphasize quality, which requires it to construct more sophisticated policies than just build, build, build.\n\nJean-Marc Blanchard\n\nIf DOGE wants to cut\ncosts, start with Trump\n\nRe: “Courts last hope to stymie Trump?” (Page A1, Feb. 10).\n\nThe first target for cost-cutting by DOGE should be Donald Trump.\n\nHow much did his attendance at the Super Bowl cost the taxpayer, and how many school lunches could that fund? How much money will be spent on his meaningless name change on the Gulf of America, a name that will only be acknowledged by the United States? How many afterschool programs are killed to pay for his golfing expeditions at his own clubs for which he charges outrageous rates? What does taking Panama and Greenland by force have to do with cutting costs? How much will his crazy Gaza plan cost the taxpayer?\n\nTo paraphrase Walt Kelly’s “Pogo” cartoon back in 1970, “You have met the enemy, and he is you.” I hate to use his own fear phrase, but he is the enemy within.\n\nDavid Wilkins\n\nForeign aid should be\nredirected to U.S. needs\n\nWe have a big homeless problem in the United States. We also have a big affordability problem for many low-income communities. How do we absorb more poor people from around the world into our country when there is plenty of need right here in our backyard?\n\nThe nonprofits are committed to making sure refugees are sheltered and fed. The nonprofits should be making the same commitment to homeless Americans. There is always going to be plenty of chaos, war and poverty around the world but there is never going to be enough taxpayer money in this country to solve these problems.\n\nThe United States spent $71.9 billion in foreign aid in 2023. The United States deficit cannot sustain all this spending and still be able to help our needy and pay our bills.\n\nPatricia Marquez Rutt\nRedwood City","summary":"Also: Congressional authority &#124; New strategy &#124; Cutting costs &#124; U.S. needs.

He made national attention by prosecuting President Donald Trump's hush money trial last year.The district attorney has faced tons of scrutiny from Trump's allies as the president has maintained his innocence and claimed the case hush money case was politically motivated against him. He also has faced criticism for being soft on crime, but Bragg seems to have shifted focus. During his first campaign in the 2021 election cycle, he focused on criminal justice reform, now his campaign website says his top priority is \"ending the scourge of gun violence\" and that he's \"cracking down on illegal cannabis stores.\"What To KnowAccording to the New York State Board of Elections, Bragg has raised $185,157.09 in contributions from January 1, 2025, to February 12, 2025.Candidates historically see an influx in donations the closer it gets to an election.In the months leading up to the 2024 general election, fewer contributions were flowing in for Bragg as the nation was focused on the race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as other down-ballot races.From August 29, 2024, to November 4, 2024, Bragg only raised $60,042.00 in contributions, according to the Board of Elections. Post-election—from November 5, 2024, to February 12, 2025—Bragg raised $221,587.09 in contributions from November 5, 2024, to February 12, 2025, with the majority raised in the first month and a half of this year.Richard Fife, Senior Advisor for Alvin Bragg for DA:\"People across Manhattan are coming together to support Alvin Bragg's record of reducing gun violence, investing in mental health outreach, standing up for victims, and holding the powerful accountable. We know safety concerns are real, and we've got a lot of work ahead of us, but we are inspired, excited, and appreciative of the support Alvin is receiving.\"Meanwhile, Bragg's Republican opponent, criminal defense attorney Maud Maron, has raised $15,237.26 from January 1, 2025, to February 12, 2025, according to the Board of Elections. She's raised $68,774.35 in contributions in total since August 29, 2024.Newsweek reached out to Maron's campaign via social media direct message on Wednesday.Details About Trump's Hush Money CaseIn May 2024, a New York jury found Trump, guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels shortly before his first presidential election in 2016. Daniels alleges she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he denies.Less than two weeks before his January inauguration, the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan gave him an unconditional discharge, meaning that he would not be punished with prison time, fines or community service. He does, however, have felonies on his criminal record, which changed some things for him moving forward such as his ability to own a gun.What People Are SayingChris Coffey, CEO of political strategy firm Tusk Strategies, told Politico in an article published January 14, \"I'm sure there are plenty of Upper West Siders who cheer [Bragg] on for maintaining the rule of law,\" referring to Trump's hush money conviction.\"I think there are other folks who would say: Hey, shouldn't our focus be making sure the city is safe? During times when folks feel public safety is the No. 1 concern, I think you see elected officials become more moderate,\" he added.Maud Maron, 2025 Republican Manhattan district attorney candidate, told The New York Post in an article published in November 2024, \"As a criminal defense lawyer I advocated for my clients and Manhattan needs an advocate now more than ever...Most of us can remember living in a much safer city and we want that city back.\"What Happens NextBragg is running largely unopposed. He did not have a challenger in this year's Democratic primary as of mid-January, and it will be difficult for his Republican opponent to win in the deeply Democratic area.","summary":"According to the New York State Board of Elections, Bragg has made over $221,000 in contributions since the November 2024 election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alvin-bragg-donald-trump-election-campaign-donations-2030256","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2587219/alvin-bragg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 23:59:45","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":289891774,"title":"Senate Confirms Gabbard as Intel Chief","text":"The Senate confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence in a 52-to-48 vote on Wednesday.\n\nGabbard, who served four terms in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021 as a Democrat but subsequently became an independent and then a Republican, was approved on a near-party-line vote. All 45 Democrats and the two nominal independents who caucus with them were joined by Sen Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in voting against her nomination.\n\nAs director of national intelligence, Gabbard will oversee 17 agencies in the intelligence community, including the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency.\n\nGabbard had faced tough confirmation hearing questioning from some Democratic senators. They alleged that Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the Army National Guard who had passed several FBI background checks, was unduly sympathetic to foreign powers. \n\nAt her public hearing, Gabbard had promised “to end the weaponization and politicization of the intelligence community.” She argued that trust in the intelligence community was at an all-time low and traced that failure in confidence to the invasion of Iraq, which in 2017 she called “a counterproductive regime war.” Gabbard’s service in the Army included time in Iraq from 2004 to 2005. \n\nGabbard promised to bring accountability to the intelligence-gathering services of the United States, noting that members of Congress had conveyed to her a lack of responsiveness from the community to requests for information. Gabbard also criticized the FBI’s espionage of Trump campaign official Carter Page and mass government surveillance. \n\n“President [Donald] Trump’s reelection is a clear mandate from the American people to break this cycle of failure, end the weaponization and politicization of the intelligence community, and begin to restore trust in those who’ve been charged with the critical task of securing our nation,” Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nFor Gabbard, serving as Trump’s intelligence chief is quite a turn of events.

Meghan is going home to be with her children.\n\n‘Meghan left the Games in Dusseldorf early after five days to go home. This is Prince Harry’s event and she is there to support him, but this was planned.’\n\nIt comes after Meghan was said to have told fans at a wheelchair basketball game in Vancouver on Sunday that she was missing her children.\n\nIn a recent Instagram post the Duchess of Sussex showed she is supporting Harry from afar and said she is ‘cheering him on from home’.\n\nIn the background were gifts for the children with their names on as mementos from the Games. \n\nHarry spoke to their favourite US based magazine ‘People’ to talk about Invictus and the impact it has on people’s lives.\n\nHe also touched how he talks about the limbless military veterans to his son Archie, five.\n\nHarry was glowing in his praise for Meghan who took centre stage with her public displays of affection at the opening ceremony in front of 40,000 people in Vancouver.\n\nShe was seen planting a kiss on Harry and resting her head on his shoulder.\n\nHe said: ‘To have my wife here supporting me is amazing.

I’m just so sick of talking about it.”\n\nThose comments, per Golf Digest, were made early in the year …\n\nThe year 2022.\n\nLIV didn’t end, of course — still hasn’t. And you’ll never guess who was talking about it again Wednesday at Torrey Pines, calling the current split between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf “unsustainable.”\n\n“Whether you stayed on the PGA Tour or you left, we have all benefited from this,” McIlroy told a group of reporters on the eve of the Genesis Invitational. “I’ve been on the record saying this a lot: We’re playing for a $20 million prize fund this week. That would have never happened if LIV hadn’t have come around.\n\n“I think everyone’s just got to get over it and we all have to say, OK, this is the starting point and we move forward. We don’t look behind us, we don’t look to the past. Whatever’s happened has happened and it’s been unfortunate, but reunification, how we all come back together and move forward, that’s the best thing for everyone.\n\n“If people are butt-hurt or have their feelings hurt because guys went or whatever, like who cares? Let’s move forward together and let’s just try to get this thing going again and do what’s best for the game.”\n\nAbout an hour after McIlroy spoke, there was (potentially) good news for him and anyone else who wants to see the best golfers in the same tournaments week after week: PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said a “productive” meeting last week with President Donald Trump and veteran golfer Adam Scott moved the tour “one step closer” to reunification.\n\n“Candidly, that’s what the fans want,” Monahan said. “ … All the best players in the world competing with each other and against each other.”\n\nMore than once, Monahan said he sees one unified tour as opposed to a truce where LIV Golf and the PGA Tour would operate separately.\n\nMcIlroy said he also discussed the situation with Trump when the two played golf in early January and believes the president can help bring the tours together. LIV Golf hosts a tournament each year at a Trump-owned property (though McIlroy said Trump is not a fan of LIV’s format).\n\n“He can do a lot of things,” McIlroy said. “He can be influential. … I think whenever he says something, they listen, and I think that’s a big thing.”\n\nMcIlroy admitted his feelings toward LIV were much more negative a few years ago. But he said he grew to change his mind as he looked at his bank account.\n\n“I look at what I made in 2019 before LIV came around and I look at what I’ve made after LIV came around and it’s very different,” McIlroy said.\n\nHe added that he didn’t feel that way originally “because of the fracture” LIV caused in the game. “It wasn’t good for the overall game. It wasn’t good for either tour.”\n\nThe PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which owns LIV Golf, announced a framework of an agreement in June 2023. At the time, they aimed to finalize the deal before the end of the year. But that didn’t happen and in early 2024 the tour received a $1.5 billion investment from Strategic Sports Group. There were reports the PIF was not happy with that deal, but late last year there were further reports that the tour and PIF were close to a deal – again.\n\nMonahan said Wednesday the discussions with PIF are not just about finances; they are also about reunification.\n\n“I think the only thing that really matters to fans and for the game is ultimately reunification. I think everything else falls out of that,” he said.\n\nPosner is a freelance reporter.","summary":"“If people ... have their feelings hurt because guys went or whatever, like who cares?

Yes, it fell from the disastrous level of 9.1% in June 2022, but today it is still above the Federal Reserve’s target for getting rid of inflation, a development Austan Goolsbee, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago, called “sobering.” In an interview with the New York Times, Goolsbee said, “There’s no question, if we got multiple months like this, then the job is clearly not done.” The new numbers suggest the Fed is certainly not going to cut interest rates anytime soon and might in fact raise them. \n\nNow the new report shows that prices are still increasing for consumers. Some of the worst areas: Food away from home is up 3.4% from a year ago; meat, poultry, fish, and eggs are up 6.1%; and nonalcoholic beverages are up 2.2%. Shelter is up 4.4%; medical care services are up 2.7%; and transportation services are up 8%. Natural gas is up 4.9%. The bottom line is that even when the rate of inflation goes down, prices still go up, just less quickly than before. Now inflation is increasing, and things are going the wrong way.\n\nTuesday’s newsletter described the huge steps former President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress took to feed the fire of inflation in 2021, 2022, and 2023. High prices became the top issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. On the stump, President Donald Trump made many variations of the promise, “Starting on Day One, we will end inflation and make America affordable again.”\n\nWhat did Trump mean by that? He certainly meant that he would make inflation a top priority and that he would work on it from his first day in office. Did he mean that he would literally end inflation altogether in his first hours in office — that is, inflation would go from 3% on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day, to 0% on Jan. 21? \n\nObviously not, but that hasn’t stopped Trump’s Democratic and media critics from holding him to a 24-hour standard. “He [Trump] said, ‘When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One,'” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Wednesday. “Well, today is Day 23, and prices are up 3%. Let me reiterate: Donald Trump said during his campaign that prices would come down on Day One. It is Day 23 and prices are up 3%.” \n\nSchumer, whose party did so much to fuel inflation, must be delighted to have someone else to blame. Multiply that by the entire Democratic Party and much of the media and you get a sense of today’s discussion.\n\nSo here is the question: The inflation we are seeing now is obviously the work of Biden and his Democratic allies. But when will Trump deserve credit or blame for his efforts to lower it? \n\nDuring the Obama administration, I noted that then-President Barack Obama inherited a terrible economic mess from George W. Bush. How much time should Obama have to turn things around? “Certainly a year was reasonable,” I wrote, before noting that Obama spent not only his first year blaming Bush for economic problems but also his second and third years doing the same thing. And then Obama kept blaming Bush as he, Obama, ran for a second term.\n\nSo should Trump have a year to bring inflation down? Any reasonable standard would say so, but that is not how today’s political discourse works. If Trump — who has gotten a faster start than any president in history, including on economic issues like energy and reducing federal expenditures — is a failure on Day 23, as Schumer said, what will he be six months from now if inflation has not fallen to the Fed’s target level?\n\nObviously Trump cannot operate on Schumer’s timetable. But the president does need to keep in mind every day that fixing the economy, and especially bringing down prices, is the top reason he was elected, and it is the top thing people want him to do now.\n\nA recent CBS News poll found Trump with a job approval rating of 53%, a number unheard of in Trump’s first term. It also showed that big majorities so far believe that Trump is doing what he promised in the campaign. Much of that belief is based on Trump’s early efforts on the border and immigration, which was the second-most important reason he was elected. But 66% say Trump has not focused enough so far on lowering prices. They don’t expect results immediately, but they want to see Trump working on it. That’s something Trump and the entire White House should always keep at the top of their list of priorities.","summary":"TRUMP, INFLATION, AND &#8216;DAY ONE.&#8217;&#160;Yesterday&#8217;s newsletter noted that the new inflation report to be released Wednesday would bring home the message that &#8220;Joe Biden brought inflation on but was unable to fully get rid of it.&#8221; And indeed, with the report came word from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that inflation increased 3% on an [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3318919/trump-inflation-promise-day-one/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/byron-trump-inflation.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-12 23:56:11","author":"Byron York","authors":["Byron York"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.337}]}
