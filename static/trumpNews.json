Mamdani leaned in, fielding questions with a mix of what attendees who spoke to Business Insider characterized as \"charisma\" and pragmatism.Ryan told Business Insider that when someone in the audience raised President Donald Trump's social media post about Mamdani, which referred to him as \"a 100% Communist Lunatic\" who \"looks TERRIBLE,\" he joked that it must have hurt Mamdani to hear he looked terrible, drawing scattered laughs.During their discussion, Mamdani and Ryan pinballed from the state of affairs in New York's tech scene to initiatives across housing, childcare, transportation, healthcare, and government efficiency, attendees said.Last week, Mamdani collided with tech's more conservative wing on social media after a Sequoia Capital investor's viral comments referring to the candidate as an \"Islamist.\"Ryan said the post didn't come up during the chat, but one audience member did ask Mamdani about his past comments on Israel. Mamdani deflected, Ryan said.\"He was trying to focus on being mayor of New York,\" Ryan said, \"not mayor of the Middle East.\"Mamdani was somewhat vague, Ryan and other attendees said, when asked about his previous comments about billionaires. \"I don't think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality,\" Mamdani said in a TV interview in June.He seemed to be reaching out to the business community, nonetheless.\"He didn't have to meet with the CEOs,\" said Ryan, referring to a Tuesday meeting with New York's business leaders.In that meeting, Mamdani reportedly said that he would not use the phrase \"globalize the intifada\" and that he would \"discourage\" others from doing so, after months of declining to condemn the phrase that some interpret as a call to violence against the Jewish people.At Wednesday's event, one attendee, who works at an artificial intelligence company, said he saw the candidate's rhetoric soften into a more pragmatic approach. The person said that when someone asked Mamdani what he hoped to achieve in his first hundred days in office, the candidate referenced a 2009 proposal by then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg to make cross-town buses free. Mamdani has said that he plans to make every bus in New York free.\"I was glad to see him being open to new ideas and working with people outside his base,\" said Yoni Rechtman, a Brooklyn venture capitalist who attended the event. \"Over the last few months, he's done a good job moderating on issues that matter to New York.\" Rechtman questioned if that was because of \"an authentic commitment to pragmatism\" or \"just typical politicking.\"\"He's engaging,\" Ryan said, \"even though he knows that many people in the room don't agree with a number of his positions. I will give him credit for reaching out.\"As an organizer, Ryan played both host and ambassador. He's among the early architects of New York's startup scene, the original \"Silicon Alley insider.\" His hands were on many of its flagship tech companies: Gilt Groupe, MongoDB, and even Business Insider, which he started along with Henry Blodget and Dwight Merriman in 2007.Ryan, who has previously cohosted events with Mamdani rivals Mayor Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, and other New York politicians, said he hasn't endorsed a candidate. This event, he said, came together after Mamdani's primary win and offered a chance to introduce the candidate to the tech ecosystem — and for the ecosystem to size him up.A spokesperson for Mamdani didn't return a request for comment.Mamdani's campaign has proposed a 2% income tax hike on New Yorkers earning more than $1 million a year — a bracket that likely doesn't include most of the city's early-stage founders and startup employees, and might only graze a few of the investors in the room.Zach Weinberg, a New York tech founder who notched one of the city's biggest startup exits with the $2.1 billion sale of Flatiron Health in 2018, didn't attend the fireside chat, but he didn't mince words when asked about Mamdani's platform. While the candidate \"seems like a perfectly nice guy,\" Weinberg told Business Insider, he believes many of Mamdani's policies, especially rent freezes and higher taxes, \"will not work\" and could do more harm than good.\"If he pushes tax rates higher on residents, you will see people move out of the city, which actually decreases tax revenue,\" he said. \"Super wealthy people have flexibility where they live.\"He pointed to hedge fund manager David Tepper's departure from New Jersey — a move that caused a drop in the state's annual tax revenue — as a cautionary tale for what happens when tax policy collides with high-net-worth mobility.Mamdani sits further to the left than most in a room full of card-carrying capitalists, said Ryan. But he tried to show on Wednesday that he's willing to engage with a spectrum of viewpoints ahead of the general election, where he will face a Republican and several independent candidates, he added.When asked about technology's role in the government, Mamdani lamented that while he can track a food delivery order on his phone, he can't monitor a complaint he's logged in NYC311, the city's information and service hotline, as easily. The public sector, he told the group, could learn from the private sector in how it applies technology.\"He's a good politician and understands that we need to create jobs in the city if people want to pay for anything,\" Ryan said.Have a tip?

Hostin and her fellow co-hosts discussed the furor from the right on Monday, calling for the release of the supposed list and more information in general about Epstein's case. That put Hostin on the side of some of the most right-wing elements of President Donald Trump's base, who are angry that he's sided with Attorney General Pam Bondi and derided his own supporters for being too invested in the dead man's case. Referring to Trump downplaying the controversy, she said, \"So now he’s calling his supporters selfish, he’s trying to make this go away, yet in 2002, he told New York Magazine, ‘I have known Jeff for 15 years. He is a terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side.'\" \"So he said that and then also what Pam Bondi didn’t release because it’s already been released. Trump’s name is on the passenger logs of Epstein’s aircraft at least seven times. That’s already been made public. I mean, of course, Trump is denying any and all allegations, but all of that information is out there. Why not just put it to rest and say, release the list?\" BONDI UNDER SIEGE AFTER DOJ REVEALS NO EPSTEIN CLIENT LIST Trump's supporters have called out the administration after the Department of Justice determined that Epstein committed suicide in 2019 and that there is no list detailing who allegedly took part in Epstein's history of sexual deviancy. Bondi, as well as FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, had all called for Epstein's sex-trafficking secrets to be made public long before the DOJ's stunning about-face. Hostin called for more information to be released, demanding Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell testify on whether the list exists or not. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking and helping procure Epstein's young victims. Hostin's attitude appeared to mark a significant shift in her thinking from just one year ago. While discussing the unsealing of a set of Epstein files in January 2024, Hostin advised against repeating any names released in the files. \"I was very concerned about some of the coverage that I’ve seen. People were dying for this information,\" Hostin said on \"The View\" at the time, in a clip first flagged on X by the account Maze. \"There was some sort of list that everybody thought would come out, and who’s on the list? Only some of the documents have been released, about 900 of them. They’ve been unsealed. The documents have identified numerous Epstein associates and figures mentioned in proceedings of the 2015 defamation lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell,\" she continued. DOJ BRASS VOWED FULL TRANSPARENCY ON EPSTEIN BEFORE TURNING UP EMPTY-HANDED \"What’s important for us to note is we shouldn’t be repeating names that are on the list, because just because your name has – not on the list but in the documents – just because your name is on the documents doesn’t mean that you have done anything criminally irresponsible or illegal or civilly irresponsible,\" Hostin cautioned. She went on to say that it was \"extremely important\" to note because \"conspiracy theorists seem to not understand or enjoy facts.\" House Democrats have now called for a public hearing on the issue amid Republican back-and-forth over the DOJ's announcement. \"I do think that this is not going away because of the severity of what could be in these files and because of the severity of the crimes,\" Hostin said Tuesday. \"Democrats are embracing the politics of the situation for a change.

Shares in Japan and South Korea declined while MSCI’s broader gauge of Asian equities was flat. A gauge of the dollar edged up 0.1% after weakening in the prior session. Treasuries dipped marginally with yields on the 10-year rising almost 1 basis point to 4.46%.Trump said he’s “not planning on doing anything” to remove Powell, after a White House official had earlier said the president was likely to seek the Federal Reserve Chair’s ouster soon. The initial speculation sent the dollar, US stocks and Treasury yields downward before Trump’s clarification soothed market fears.The trading action Wednesday hinted at how Wall Street would react if Trump actually removed Powell — a prospect that strategists warn would rattle global markets. Trump has repeatedly assailed Powell as the Fed has held off on cutting rates amid concern that tariffs may spur inflation. Trump and his allies have also lambasted the Fed chair over the cost of a renovation of its Washington headquarters.“After the president’s subsequent backing off on remarks to remove Powell, the immediate crisis may have passed, though we doubt we are entirely done with this saga,” said Michael Feroli at JPMorgan Chase & Co..In tariff news, Trump dialed down his confrontational tone with China in an effort to secure a summit with counterpart Xi Jinping and a trade deal. Trump also said he would send letters to more than 150 countries notifying them of tariff rates and that the levies imposed could be 10% or 15%. Top bosses at some of Wall Street’s biggest banks emphasized the importance of an independent Fed.Bank of America Corp.’s Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Solomon joined JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon in stressing how critical the Fed’s autonomy is.

They spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nMaurene Comey was a veteran lawyer in the Southern District of New York, long considered the most elite of the Justice Department's prosecution offices. Her cases included the sex trafficking prosecution of Epstein, who killed himself behind bars in 2019 as he was awaiting trial, and the recent case against Combs, which ended earlier this month with a mixed verdict.\n\nShe didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday.\n\nIt's the latest move by the Justice Department to fire lawyers without explanation, which has raised alarm over a disregard for civil service protections designed to prevent terminations for political reasons. The Justice Department has also fired a number of prosecutors who worked on cases that have provoked President Donald Trump's ire, including some who handled U.S. Capitol riot cases and lawyers and support staff who worked on special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecutions of Trump.\n\nMaurene Comey was long seen as a potential target given her father's fraught relationship over the last decade with the Republican president. The Justice Department recently appeared to acknowledge the existence of an investigation into James Comey, though the basis for that inquiry is unclear.\n\nMost recently, she was the lead prosecutor among six female prosecutors in the sex trafficking and racketeering case against Combs. The failure to convict the hip-hop mogul of the main charges, while gaining a conviction on prostitution-related charges that will likely result in a prison sentence of just a few years, was viewed by some fellow lawyers as a rare defeat by prosecutors.\n\nBut she was successful in numerous other prosecutions, most notably the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for helping financier Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. In that case, she delivered a rebuttal argument during closings, as she did in the Combs case.\n\nHer firing comes as Attorney General Pam Bondi faces intense criticism from some members of Trump's base for the Justice Department's decision not to release any more evidence in the government's possession from Epstein's sex trafficking investigation. Some right-wing internet personalities, like Laura Loomer, who have been critical of Bondi's handling of the Epstein files had been calling for Maurene Comey's firing.\n\nJames Comey was the FBI director when Trump took office in 2017, having been appointed by then-President Barack Obama and serving before that as a senior Justice Department official in President George W. Bush's administration. But his relationship with Trump was strained from the start, and the FBI director resisted a request by Trump at a private dinner to pledge personal loyalty to the president — an overture that so unnerved the FBI director that he documented it in a contemporaneous memorandum.\n\nTrump soon after fired Comey amid an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's presidential campaign. That inquiry, later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller, would ultimately find that while Russia interfered with the 2016 election and the Trump team welcomed the help, there was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal collaboration.\n\nTrump's fury at the older Comey continued long after firing him from the bureau, blaming him for a “hoax” and “witch hunt” that shadowed much of his first term.\n\nComey disclosed contemporaneous memos of his conversations with Trump to a friend so that their content could be revealed to the media, and the following year he published a book calling Trump “ego driven” and likening him to a mafia don. Trump, for his part, has accused Comey and other officials of treason.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

FEMA canceled some projects already in the works and refused to approve new ones despite funding from Congress.\n\n“In the wake of devastating flooding in Texas and other states, it’s clear just how critical federal resources are in helping states prepare for and respond to natural disasters,” said Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, where the federal lawsuit was filed. “By abruptly and unlawfully shutting down the BRIC program, this administration is abandoning states and local communities that rely on federal funding to protect their residents and, in the event of disaster, save lives.”\n\nFEMA did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment. It said in April that the program was “wasteful and ineffective” and “more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.”\n\nThe program, established by a 2000 law, provides grants for a variety of disaster mitigation efforts, including levees to protect against floods, safe rooms to provide shelter from tornadoes, vegetation management to reduce damage from fires and seismic retrofitting to fortify buildings for earthquakes.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump signed a law shoring up funding for disaster risk reduction efforts. The program then got a $1 billion boost from an infrastructure law signed by former President Joe Biden. That law requires FEMA to make available at least $200 million annually for disaster mitigation grants for the 2022-2026 fiscal years, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe suit contends the Trump administration violated the constitutional separation of powers because Congress had not authorized the program’s demise. It also alleges the program’s termination was illegal because the decision was made while FEMA was under the leadership of an acting administrator who had not met the requirements to be in charge of the agency.\n\nThe lawsuit says communities in every state have benefited from federal disaster mitigation grants, which saved lives and spared homes, businesses, hospitals and schools from costly damage.\n\nSome communities have already been affected by the decision to end the program.\n\nHillsborough, North Carolina, had been awarded nearly $7 million to relocate a wastewater pumping station out of a flood plain and make other water and sewer system improvements. But that hadn’t happened yet when the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal damaged the pumping station and forced it offline last week.\n\nIn rural Mount Pleasant, North Carolina, town officials had hoped to use more than $4 million from the BRIC program to improve stormwater drainage and safeguard a vulnerable electric system, thus protecting investments in a historic theater and other businesses. While the community largely supports Trump, assistant town manager Erin Burris said people were blindsided by the lost funding they had spent years pursuing.\n\n“I’ve had downtown property owners saying, ‘What do we do?’” Burris said. “I’ve got engineering plans ready to go and I don’t have the money to do it.”\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jack Brook, Michael Casey and Gary D.

Coca-Cola, founded in 1892, uses sugar cane in Mexico and some other countries, but not in the US, where high-fructose corn syrup is typically used, according to the company's website. However, this could change thanks to Trump's involvement. The US president , known for having a red button on his desk to quickly get his favorite drink, Diet Coke, has reportedly been in talks with Coca-Cola to alter one ingredient in the original Coca-Cola recipe in the US. If successful, American Coke could soon taste more like Mexican Coke. Trump championed the recipe change as a 'good move' by the Coca-Cola Company, who moved away from using sugar in Coke during the 1980s, switching to cheaper high fructose corn syrup. Taking to Truth Social, the former US President announced: \"I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so. I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them - You'll see. It's just better!\". Trump's fondness for Diet Coke is well-documented, and he even had a red button installed in the Oval Office in 2017 to have an aide fetch him a Diet Coke. The button was reinstalled on January 1st, as part of a redesign, according to the Mirror US. In 2017, Trump joked to reporters, \"Everyone does get a little nervous when I press that button.\" While Diet Coke appears to be Trump's preferred choice, his discussions with Coca-Cola could lead to a change in the original Coca-Cola recipe in the US, making it taste more like the Mexican version. Donald Trump has hailed Coca-Cola's decision to alter their recipe as a 'good move'. Coca-Cola swapped out sugar for high fructose corn syrup in the 1980s in the US, opting for the more cost-effective alternative, according to MailOnline. In a statement to CBS News, Coca-Cola expressed: \"We appreciate President Trump's enthusiasm for our iconic Coca-Cola brand.

There is no evidence former Democratic officials tampered with the documents or played any role in promoting conspiracies about the files, which members of Trump’s administration stoked for years.\n\nThe rhetoric marks a dramatic escalation for the Republican president, who has broken with some of his most loyal backers on issues in the past, but never with such fervor. Though Trump cannot legally run for another term, he will need strong support from a united party to pass his remaining legislative agenda in a narrowly-divided Congress and an energized base to turn out in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nDangled documents\n\nThe schism centers on the administration’s handling of documents related to Epstein, who was found dead in his New York jail cell in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on sex trafficking charges. Last week, the Justice Department and the FBI acknowledged in a memo that Epstein did not maintain a “client list” to whom underage girls were trafficked. They also said no more files related to the investigation would be made public, despite past promises from Attorney General Pam Bondi that had raised the expectations of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.\n\n“It’s a new administration and everything is going to come out to the public,” she had said.\n\nThe reversal sparked fury among Trump’s most loyal defenders, who have turned on Bondi, in particular. But Trump has repeatedly said he maintains confidence in his attorney general and has instead chided those who continue to press the issue.\n\n“I don’t understand what the interest or what the fascination is,” he said Tuesday, after unsuccessfully urging his “’boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals’” to stop wasting “Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”\n\nIn an Oval Office appearance Wednesday after the Truth post, Trump said he had “lost a lot of faith in certain people” as he tried to turn the page on the story.\n\n“It’s all been a big hoax,” he told reporters. “It’s perpetrated by the Democrats, and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net.”\n\nHe complained that Bondi has been “waylaid” over her handling of the case and has given out all “credible information” about the wealthy financier. “If she finds anymore credible information she’ll give that, too,” Trump said. ”What more can she do than that?”\n\nHe continued to complain in a pre-taped interview with John Solomon that aired Wednesday evening on Real America’s Voice that the issue was distracting from his accomplishments.\n\n“All my supporters want to talk about is the Jeffrey Epstein hoax. It’s unbelievable,” he said. “It’s a disgrace. … I’m going to remember.”\n\nWhile Trump has tried to blame Democrats for making Epstein an issue, he and many figures in his administration, including FBI Director Kash Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino, spent years stoking dark and disproved conspiracy theories like those surrounding Epstein, including embracing QAnon-tinged propaganda that casts Trump as a savior sent to demolish the “deep state.”\n\nAnger still brewing\n\nTrump’s comments have not been enough to quell those who are still demanding answers. Some of the podcasters and pro-Trump influencers who helped rally support for Trump in the 2024 campaign said Wednesday they were disappointed or puzzled by his comments.\n\nFar-right conspiracy theorist and podcaster Alex Jones called Trump’s handling of the Epstein situation “the biggest train wreck I’ve ever seen.”\n\n“It’s not in character for you to be acting like this,” he said in a video Tuesday. “I support you, but we built the movement you rode in on. You’re not the movement. You just surfed in on it.”\n\nBenny Johnson, a conservative podcaster, said on his show that he is a fan of Trump’s movement but is trying to “give tough love and speak on behalf of the base.”\n\n“Maybe it hasn’t been framed correctly for the president,” Johnson said. “I don’t know.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in an interview on Benny Johnson’s show Tuesday, had called for the Justice Department to “put everything out there and let the people decide.”\n\nHis first-term national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn implored Trump in a lengthy message to correct course.\n\n“All we want at this stage is for a modicum of trust to be reestablished between our federal government and the people it is designed to serve. That’s all (PERIOD!),” he wrote. “With my strongest recommendation, please gather your team and figure out a way to move past this.”\n\nTurning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on his podcast attempted some damage control on Trump’s behalf.\n\n“Don’t take too seriously this whole Truth Social here,” Kirk told his audience. “I know some people are getting fired up about this. I don’t believe he was trying to insult anybody personally.”\n\nStill, he expressed frustration about the administration’s handling of the issue.\n\n“We are now Wednesday going into Thursday. People are very, very confused, and some people are very disappointed and mad,” Kirk said. “We made so much progress with Gen Z, and this is a big vulnerability. Online, on TikTok, this story is not landing well. Let’s fix this, and we can.”\n\nOther Trump allies have stuck by his side, suggesting he does not need the influencers who have capitalized on Epstein conspiracy theories to make money and earn viewers.\n\n“He lent you his clout and voters,” Brenden Dilley, the head of a group of meme makers who have lent their support to Trump, wrote on X on Wednesday. “They don’t belong to you.”\n\nBroader disapproval\n\nWhile those speaking out represent a fringe of Trump’s most vocal online base, they are not the only ones dissatisfied with the government’s handling of the Epstein case, according to recent polling.\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll, for instance, found that about half of U.S. adults are not satisfied with the amount of information the federal government has released about the Epstein case. About 3 in 10 said it doesn’t matter either way and about 2 in 10 didn’t know enough to offer an opinion. Almost no one said they were satisfied with the amount of information released.\n\nLooking ahead to 2026 midterm elections, some Democrats are clear-eyed that the Epstein files may not be a front-and-center issue for voters who tend to put a premium on kitchen table issues, but they see it as part of a broader pattern that could hamper Trump and the GOP.\n\n“There is something breaking through to voters getting at this idea of a Republican Party working for these big, corrupt, wealthy, famous people and not fighting for their constituents,” said Katarina Flicker of the House Majority PAC, Democrats’ super PAC for congressional races.\n\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson, Amelia Thomson DeVeaux in Washington and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

At one point, several crowd members booed from the mezzanine as Gillis asked the audience to \"lighten up.\" At another point, the comedian defended a joke that didn't land by saying, \"I didn’t write it.\"\n\n Gillis also spent several minutes impersonating Donald Trump, and also gave a nod to the Jeffrey Epstein files while joking with the audience that his jokes could have been more R-rated if not for Disney, ESPN's parent company.\n\n “Actually, there was supposed to be an Epstein joke here but it must’ve been deleted. Actually, it probably deleted itself,” Gillis said.\n\n On social media, some users called Gillis' jokes racist, and questioned his role hosting the annual sports award ceremony. At the end of his monologue, the Pennsylvania comedian recognized that he likely didn't make many friends in the room with his opening speech.\n\n \"Well, I see a lot of you don't like me and that's okay,\" Gillis concluded before handing the show off for its first award presentation. \"That went about as exactly how we all thought it was gonna go, I don't know why this happened.\"\n\n ESPN announced Gillis would host the 33rd ESPYS on June 24. \n\n In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on June 24, Gillis — a huge Philadelphia Eagles and Notre Dame football fan — said “I’m excited to be at The ESPYS this year, I like sports, so this should be a good time.”\n\n The hosting gig comes during a year of brushing shoulders with sports stars for Gillis. In February, he made an appearance in a Bud Light Super Bowl commercial with five-time NFL MVP Peyton Manning.\n\n About the selection of Gillis as a host, Craig Lazarus, the executive producer of The ESPYS, told The Hollywood Reporter that Gillis' known sports fandom made him \"an easy choice to host the ESPYS.\"\n\n The ESPY Awards are airing live on ABC.","summary":"Some crowd members booed as Gillis struggled through his ESPYs monologue, telling the crowd at one point to \"lighten up\"","url":"https://people.com/shane-gillis-struggles-espys-2025-monologue-roasts-simone-biles-jordon-hudson-11770780","image":"https://people.com/thmb/cIV9TqsalTtLkA8e2IviHAbRMVo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(726x250:728x252)/shane-gillis-espys-show-2-071625-c83dfe41b0ef41dc830d9fc04fda6917.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:42:23","author":"Grace Jordan-Weinstein,Sean Neumann","authors":["Grace Jordan-Weinstein","Sean Neumann"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":342337290,"title":"World News | \"Very Close to a Deal with India...we're in Negotiation: US President Trump","text":"Washington DC [US], July 17 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hinted at reaching a new trade deal with India soon.

This will be a very good move by them — You’ll see. It’s just better!”Coca-Cola has not confirmed any immediate change in ingredients but responded with a brief statement acknowledging Trump’s support, reports Axios. “We appreciate President Trump’s enthusiasm for our iconic Coca‑Cola brand. More details on new innovative offerings within our Coca‑Cola product range will be shared soon,” the company said in a statement.No clear confirmation from Coca-ColaWhile the company did not say it would change its formula, it currently uses cane sugar in other markets, including Mexico, the UK, the Middle East and Africa. In the US, the beverage giant switched to high-fructose corn syrup in 1985 due to rising sugar costs and changes in farm subsidies. If Coca-Cola fully reverts to cane sugar in the US, it could put pressure on domestic corn growers and food manufacturers. John Bode, President and CEO of the Corn Refiners Association, criticised the idea, saying, “Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit.”Trump’s history with Diet CokeTrump is famously loyal to Diet Coke, once drinking up to 12 cans a day during his presidency, according to Time Magazine. He had a red button on the Oval Office desk to summon a butler with a Diet Coke. Ahead of his second-term inauguration, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey gifted Trump a special Presidential Commemorative Inaugural Diet Coke bottle.Trump immediately did not give a reason for pushing the sugar switch, though the announcement follows Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign, which calls for removing corn syrup from American food. Health experts warn that both cane sugar and corn syrup pose similar risks, contributing to obesity and chronic diseases.One can of Coke contains around 39 grams of sugar, close to the 50-gram daily limit suggested for adults.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

That office has eight meteorologists and eight vacancies, according to Fahy. \n\nThis week, calls made to the Handford office from around midnight to 6 a.m. local time were handled by the San Diego office thanks to the cuts. \n\nAlex Tardy, the former warning coordination meteorologist for the weather service’s San Diego office, told the LA Times this was “unheard of” and a “big deal.”\n\n“I worked for 32 years [with the National Weather Service], I worked a solo midnight shift a few times, and even that was frowned upon...for safety reasons,” he said.\n\nStaffing shortages could lead to issues this wildfire season, with the role the NWS plays when the state is dealing with this type of weather event. \n\nEach weather office is required to have an incident meteorologist available when there’s a wildfire in California to head an incident command post, Tardy said.\n\nThis means weather offices are down another forecaster while the incident meteorologist is busy with the wildfire, which could possibly be for weeks, according to Tardy.\n\nThere could also be delays in key weather alerts if weather offices are understaffed.","summary":"The Trump administration has left the National Weather Service with ‘critical staff shortages,’ according to an employee union","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-california-wildfires-nws-b2790550.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/16/23/08/GettyImages-2192352123.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LdeQDdzI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:36:06","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.014},{"id":342339928,"title":"Newsom says it’s time for President Trump to ‘grow up’ in rebuke over National Guard deployment","text":"After President Donald Trump federalized California National Guard troops in response to anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles, progressive Democratic Gov.

But six months into his second non-consecutive term, President Trump is realising that this task is not easy and that President Vladimir Putin is neither pliable nor someone who would come on his knees pleading for peace at the talk of sanctions.\n\nClearly exasperated, the American leader has given a deadline of 50 days to his Russian counterpart for a ceasefire deal or else face sanctions over and beyond the country has faced in the last three years. A country that is already in the league with North Korea and Iran on punitive actions, Russia has been threatened with tariffs of 100 per cent.\n\nWorse President Trump has threatened countries that trade with Moscow with the same amount of “secondary tariffs”. In this list would be China, India and Brazil.\n\n“Secondary tariffs are very, very powerful”, President Trump remarked in a meeting with the NATO Secretary General.\n\nPresident Trump’s remarks on Russia appears to have taken some steam out of a pending bi-partisan Senate legislation with some 85 co-sponsors that would authorise the President to raise tariffs on remaining American imports by 500 per cent and slap the same on countries that trade with Russia who are seen as principals in bankrolling Moscow’s continuing war efforts. The sponsors of the “sledgehammer” bill believe “the ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries like China, India and Brazil that prop up Putin’s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas”.\n\nSteep fall in 2-way trade\n\nIt is generally believed that further American sanctions against Russia would not amount to much as published media reports speak of a dramatic fall in two-way trade — from $53 billion in 2021 to about $5.5 billion in 2024. What will make the difference is that efforts are under way between Europe and the US together to make use of “seized assets” to the tune of about $5 billion.\n\nThe thinking is that with oil and gas accounting for 60 per cent or more of Russian exports that additional punitive measures on Russia and the secondary tariffs will hurt Moscow.\n\nHere again sceptics point to the extensive Russian use of its “shadow” fleet of unregistered tankers to keep the oil flowing to its customers.\n\nAlso a flicker of hope that President Trump will not enforce tariffs on third countries just as how he is yet to put into action the 25 per cent he once threatened on countries dealing with Venezuela.\n\nDifficult choices\n\nA country like India that is supposed to buy more than one-third of its oil needs from Russia would be left with difficult choices: buy as much a possible before any deadlines; opt for higher prices from West Asia and elsewhere; or end up on the secondary tariffs list and in the interim period and keep guessing as to how this is going to be applied, on the total trade or products-wise.\n\nEurope is happy for more than one reason, at least for now. The fact that President Trump is showing signs of frustrations with President Putin aside, there is appreciation that Washington is now allowing weapons purchased by NATO to be shipped to Ukraine.\n\nAnd these are top flight systems that include the Patriot air defence and missiles; and would be paid for by some eight European nations.\n\nBut questions remain on any ceasefire to be put in place given the vast divergent position of the principals. In the interim there are the nervous ones who wonder why President Trump asked Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, “Can you hit Moscow”?\n\nThe writer is a senior journalist who has reported from Washington DC on North America and United Nations\n\nPublished on July 17, 2025","summary":"Trump’s threat of more sanctions may not pay-off","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/will-russia-toe-us-line/article69820131.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/q9dsxe/article69820129.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-07-15T120525Z_1984049079_RC2ZMFAGEM3R_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:30:00","author":"Sridhar","authors":["Sridhar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":342336508,"title":"Indians are pouring into crypto as Bitcoin rockets to new highs","text":"Bitcoin’s meteoric rise of breaching all-time highs in the last seven days has seen Indian investors join in the rally.

ZebPay noted an average 75% increase in weekly volumes.While Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to dominate trading activity, other meme tokens like Pengu and Bananas31 have also seen a sharp rise in volume, Zebpay said.“The spike was most notable between July 10 and 15, when BTC (Bitcoin) prices surged past $116K, driving higher engagement from both retail and high-value investors,” said CoinDCX founding partner Mridul Gupta.“BTC trading volumes in July (till July 15) touched 16.69 million, with a daily average of 1.11 million, nearly 80% higher than June’s daily average of 0.62 million,” he said.Meanwhile, analysts said the crypto party may calm down in the coming weeks, as US Congress on July 15 voted against President Donald Trump’s three bills on digital assets: the GENIUS Act, CLARITY Act and the CBDC Act.“Bitcoin’s current growth momentum is being powered by a confluence of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and macroeconomic tailwinds,” said Harish Vatnani, head of trade at ZebPay.“Major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton have made sizable allocations to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Corporates such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continue to accumulate Bitcoin, reinforcing market confidence,” he said, adding that the markets appeared to be approaching a new bull run, one that mirrors the highs of 2022 but with greater maturity.Edul Patel, CEO and cofounder of Mudrex, expects Bitcoin breaching the $140,000 mark in near term. “Awareness around Bitcoin is significantly higher, and institutional players are now entering the space in a meaningful way. However, retail adoption remains relatively untapped suggesting that despite the current surge, there is still substantial room for upside,” he said.CoinDCX’s Gupta cautioned that investors must tread carefully. “Risks such as thinning liquidity near resistance levels, surprise macroeconomic shocks (e.g., inflation prints) and rising leverage in derivatives markets could lead to heightened short-term volatility.”However, the market is entering the second half of 2025 with “clear tailwinds”, and “we may even see BTC eye the $150K–$185K zone by year-end”, he said.Himanshu Maradiya, founder and chairman at blockchain company CIFDAQ, said the rejection of Trump-backed crypto Bills is more of a procedural hiccup than a fatal blow to the current crypto bull run.“While Bitcoin dipped around 3% post-vote and crypto stocks like Coinbase, Circle and MicroStrategy also saw declines, the broader momentum remains intact, supported by strong institutional demand,” he said, adding that the US House plans to revisit the vote soon.","summary":"With Bitcoin hitting fresh highs, Indian crypto exchanges like CoinDCX, CoinSwitch, and Mudrex have clocked net inflows of $150-200 million in just the past week. CoinDCX’s daily trading volume jumped 40% in July to 12.82 million, up from 9.17 million in June.

There, his parents, who own a home near Sinjil, hoped he could better connect with his culture and language.\n\nBut after finishing high school, Sayfollah was eager to return to the US to try his hand at entrepreneurship. Last year, he, his father and his cousins opened the dessert shop in Tampa, Florida, playfully named Ice Screamin.\n\nBut the ice cream shop was just the beginning. Sayfollah’s ambition left a deep impression on Muhammad.\n\n“He had his vision to expand the business, to multiply it by many,” she said, her voice at times shaking with grief. “This at 20, when most kids are playing video games.”\n\n“And the crazy thing is, any goal that he set his mind to, he always did it,” she added. “He always exceeded everyone’s expectations, especially with the love he gave all of us.”\n\nSayfollah’s aunt, 58-year-old Samera Musallet, also remembers his dedication to his family. She described Sayfollah as a loving young man who never let his aunts pay for anything in his presence – and who always insisted on bringing dessert when he came for dinner.\n\nAt the same time, Samera said he was still youthful and fun-loving: He liked to watch comedy movies, shop for clothes and make late-night trips to the WaWa convenience store.\n\nOne of her fondest memories came when Sayfollah was only 14, and they went together to a baseball game featuring the Kansas City Royals.\n\n“When we got there, he could smell the popcorn and all the hot dogs. He bought everything he could see and said, ‘We’re going to share!'” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“After he ate all that junk food, we turned around, and he was sleeping. I woke him up when the game was over, and he goes: ‘Who won?'”\n\n‘I really want to get married’\n\nAnother one of his aunts, 52-year-old Katie Salameh, remembers that Sayfollah’s mind had turned to marriage in the final months of his young life\n\nAs the Florida spring gave way to summer, Sayfollah had announced plans to return to the West Bank to see his mother and siblings. But he confided to Salameh that he had another reason for returning.\n\n“The last time I saw him was we had a family wedding, and that was the weekend of Memorial Day [in May],” Salameh told Al Jazeera.\n\n“I asked him: ‘Are you so excited to see your siblings and your mom?’ He said, ‘Oh my god, I’m so excited.’ Then he goes, ‘I really want to get married. I’m going to look for a bride when I’m there.'”\n\nTo keep the ice cream shop running smoothly, Sayfollah had arranged a switch with his father: He would return to the West Bank while his father would travel to Tampa to mind the business.\n\nBut that decision would unwittingly put Sayfollah’s father more than 10,000 kilometres away from his son when violent Israeli settlers surrounded him, as witnesses and his family would later recount.\n\nIsraeli authorities said the attack in Sinjil began with rock-throwing and “violent clashes … between Palestinians and Israeli civilians”, a claim Sayfollah’s family and witnesses have rejected.\n\nInstead, they said Sayfollah was trying to protect his family’s land when he was encircled by a “mob of settlers” who beat him.\n\nEven when an ambulance was called, Sayfollah’s family said the settlers blocked the paramedics from reaching his broken body. Sayfollah’s younger brother would ultimately help carry his dying brother to emergency responders.\n\nThe settlers also fatally shot Mohammed al-Shalabi, a 23-year-old Palestinian man, who witnesses said was left bleeding for hours.\n\n“His phone was on, and he wasn’t responding,” his mother, Joumana al-Shalabi, told reporters. “He was missing for six hours. They found him martyred under the tree. They beat him and shot him with bullets.”\n\nPalestinians cannot legally possess firearms in the occupied West Bank, but Israeli settlers can. The Israeli government itself has encouraged the settlers to bear arms, including through the distribution of rifles to civilians.\n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded the killings of at least 964 Palestinians at the hands of Israeli forces and settlers in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023.\n\nAnd the violence appears to be on the rise. The OHCHR noted that there was a 13-percent increase in the number of killings during the first six months of 2025, compared with the same period last year.\n\n‘Pain I can’t even describe’\n\nAn Al Jazeera analysis also found that Israeli forces and settlers have killed at least nine US citizens since 2022, including veteran reporter Shireen Abu Akleh.\n\nNone of those deaths have resulted in criminal charges, with Washington typically relying on Israel to conduct its own investigations.\n\nSo far, US President Donald Trump has not directly addressed Sayfollah’s killing. When asked in the Oval Office about the fatal beating, Trump deferred to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n“We protect all American citizens anywhere in the world, especially if they’re unjustly murdered or killed,” Rubio replied on Trump’s behalf. “We’re gathering more information.”\n\nRubio also pointed to a statement issued a day earlier from the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee. The ambassador called on Israel to “aggressively investigate” the attack, saying “there must be accountability for this criminal and terrorist act”.\n\nIt was a particularly jarring sentiment from Huckabee, who has been a vocal supporter of Israel’s illegal settlements in the West Bank and has even denied the very existence of a Palestinian people.\n\nNevertheless, no independent, US-led investigation has been announced.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, three Israeli settlers, including a military reservist, were taken into custody following the deadly attack, but all were subsequently released.\n\nIt has only been four days since Sayfollah’s killing, and his family told Al Jazeera the initial shock has only now begun to dissipate.\n\nBut in its place has come a flood of grief and anger. Muhammad still struggles to accept that he “died because he was on his own land”. She sees Sayfollah’s death as part of a broader pattern of abuses, whether in the West Bank or in Gaza, where Israel has led a war since 2023.\n\n“I see it on the news all the time with other people in the West Bank. I see it in Gaza – the indiscriminate killing of anybody in their way,” she said.\n\n“But when it happens to you, it’s just so hard to even fathom,” she added. “It’s pain I can’t even describe.”","summary":"Musallet, a US citizen who ran an ice cream shop in Florida, was killed by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/17/the-love-he-gave-family-vows-to-keep-sayfollah-musallets-memory-alive?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sayfollah-3-1752687417.jpg?resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:28:08","author":"Apps Support,Joseph Stepansky","authors":["Apps Support","Joseph Stepansky"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.307},{"id":342340764,"title":"Trump Believes China Will Sentence Fentanyl Traffickers To Death","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-believes-china-will-sentence-fentanyl-traffickers-to-death-8890459\" on this server.\nReference #18.1d011002.1752715931.291120e\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.1d011002.1752715931.291120e","summary":"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that the US will work out a deal with China where the latter would give the death penalty to those who transport fentanyl drug into the US.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-believes-china-will-sentence-fentanyl-traffickers-to-death-8890459","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:25:02","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1},{"id":342337624,"title":"Laura Loomer takes victory lap over firing of ex-FBI chief Comey’s daughter after pressing ‘Pam Blondi’","text":"Far-right activist Laura Loomer celebrated the Department of Justice’s decision to fire the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, Maurene Comey, who prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nComey was terminated as a federal prosecutor for the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York on Wednesday, according to reports. \n\nIt’s not immediately clear what led to her termination. The Independent has reached out to the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the DOJ for comment. \n\nThe move comes weeks after Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The rapper was convicted of prostitution-related charges but cleared of the more serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. Before that, she prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison after her 2021 conviction on charges of charges related to her role in a scheme to abuse minor girls with Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nLoomer seemed thrilled about the move. “This comes 2 months after my pressure campaign on Pam Blondi to fire Comey’s daughter and Comey’s son-in-law from the DOJ,” Loomer boasted in a X post on Wednesday, referring to Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nIn May, Loomer urged Bondi to terminate Comey and her husband, Lucas Issacharoff, an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the civil rights division. \n\n“If Blondi was a serious person, she would FIRE them both for being a national security risk via their proximity to a criminal who just committed a felony by threatening to assassinate the President,” the far-right activist wrote in a lengthy X post.\n\nDays earlier, the former FBI director faced intense scrutiny after posting a photo of shells depicting “8647” on his Instagram account. Some close to Trump believed the post was a call to “assassinate” Trump. The elder Comey later took down the photo, denied that he intended for any violence, and said the message was \"totally innocent.\"\n\nLoomer continued: “Both Maurene Comey and Lucas Issacharoff need to be FIRED from the DOJ immediately. If Blondi refuses to fire them, she should RESIGN.”\n\nOn Wednesday, she applauded the attorney general: “+1 for Blondi today!”\n\nThis week, Trump accused James Comey — as well as former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden — of having “made up” the Epstein files, a controversy that has created a schism in MAGA world.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear if Loomer’s demands played a role in the Trump administration’s decision to fire Comey. \n\nLoomer does appear to have Trump’s ear when it comes to who he keeps in his administration.\n\nLoomer met with Trump in April and urged him to fire members of the National Security Council who had been disloyal to him. Not long after, the president terminated several NSC staff.\n\nIn May, the far-right activist believed Trump’s pick for surgeon general, Janette Nesheiwat, was “not ideologically aligned with Donald Trump or his admin’s health initiatives” so she called for a new nominee. The president later withdrew Nesheiwat’s nomination.\n\nAsked how many staffing decisions she’s had a hand in, Loomer told the New York Times this month: “I don’t even know.” She continued: “I really enjoy and take great pleasure in humiliating people who suck at their job.”","summary":"Maurene Comey prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell in the Epstein case, as well as rap mogul Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/maurene-comey-fired-laura-loomer-b2790545.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/16/23/19/FILE-Assistant-U-S--Attorney-Maurene-Comey-is-outside-court-during-the-Sean-Diddy-Combs-sex-traffick.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xe3whdeE-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:22:05","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":342332336,"title":"Paid To Protest?

Speaking to NewsNation, Swart explained that “interests aligned with the organizers of the July 17th movement have approached us,” but the company ultimately rejected the lucrative deal. The protests are planned by Good Trouble Lives On, a group organizing nationwide demonstrations set for Thursday to oppose what they describe as “the most brazen rollback of civil rights in generations.” The timing of the protests coincides with the fifth anniversary of the death of former Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis, who famously encouraged people to get into “good trouble” to fight injustice. Crowds on Demand, founded in 2012 and based in California, specializes in organizing crowds for various causes on demand. Despite the financial potential, Swart said the company declined the contract because it doubted the protesters’ effectiveness. “I’m rejecting it not because I don’t want to take the business, but because, frankly, this is going to be ineffective. It’s going to make us all look bad,” he told NewsNation. Also read: Who Is Maurene Comey?

The Druze are an Arab religious group which adhere to the Druze faith.\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the “situation in southwestern Syria, is very serious”.\n\n“We are working to save our Druze brothers and to eliminate the regime’s gangs,” he said.\n\nIsrael has presented itself as a defender of the group, although some analysts say that is a pretext for pursuing its own military goal of keeping Syrian government forces as far from their shared frontier as possible.\n\nFollowing the fall of Syria’s longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, the Israeli military took control of the UN-monitored demilitarised zone in the Golan Heights and conducted hundreds of strikes on military targets in Syria.\n\nPrior to Wednesday’s attack on Damscus, Israel had conducted air strikes in Sweida province earlier this week in what it said was defence of the Druze.\n\nIsrael said it struck a “military target” in the area of the presidential palace, while a Syrian interior ministry source reported strikes outside the capital in “the vicinity of the Mazzeh (military) airport”.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz called on Damascus to “leave the Druze in Sweida alone”, and threatened to unleash “painful blows” until government forces pulled back.\n\nSyria’s Foreign Ministry has called the Israeli action as “treacherous aggression”, saying they had resulted in the loss of “several innocent civilians”.\n\n“This flagrant assault, which forms part of a deliberate policy pursued by the Israeli entity to inflame tensions, spread chaos, and undermine security and stability in Syria, constitutes a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law,” it added.\n\nSyria has announced its army had begun to pull back from Sweida following the strikes.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there was an agreement to restore calm in Syria by late Wednesday, as he blamed a “misunderstanding” over the violence.\n\n“We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight,” Mr Rubio wrote on X.\n\n“This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,” he wrote, without elaborating on the nature of the agreement.\n\nMr Rubio, who had earlier said to expect “real progress” within hours, blamed “historic longtime rivalries” for the clashes in the majority-Druze city of Sweida, in Syria’s south, which Israel has cited for its latest military intervention.\n\n“It led to an unfortunate situation and a misunderstanding, it looks like, between the Israeli side and the Syrian side,” Mr Rubio told reporters in the White House of the situation which has included Israel bombing the Syrian army’s headquarters in the capital Damascus.\n\n“We’ve been engaged with them all morning long and all night long — with both sides — and we think we’re on our way towards a real de-escalation and then hopefully get back on track and helping Syria build the country and arriving at a situation in the Middle East that is far more stable,” Mr Rubio, who is also national security adviser, said as Donald Trump nodded.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, speaking shortly before Mr Rubio’s announcement of a deal, said that the United States had asked Syrian government forces to pull out of the flashpoint area.\n\n“We are calling on the Syrian government to, in fact, withdraw their military in order to enable all sides to de-escalate and find a path forward,” she told reporters, without specifying the exact area.\n\nShe declined comment on whether the United States wanted Israel to stop its strikes.\n\nMr Rubio, asked by a reporter earlier in the day at the State Department what he thought of Israel’s bombing, said, “We’re very concerned about it. We want it to stop”.\n\nThe State Department afterwards issued fuller comments in which Mr Rubio did not directly reference Israel but said that the communal violence was a “direct threat to efforts to help build a peaceful and stable Syria”.\n\n“We have been and remain in repeated and constant talks with the governments of Syria and Israel on this matter,” he said Mr Trump has staunchly backed Israel including in its military campaigns in Gaza and Iran.\n\nBut he has been prioritising diplomacy with Syria’s new leadership, seeing an opening after Sunni Islamist-led fighters toppled longtime ruler al-Assad in December.","summary":"Dramatic scenes played out in a live TV news broadcast overnight, forcing an anchor to flee for her life.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/us-marco-rubio-says-steps-agreed-to-end-syria-fighting/news-story/695920e0891f0f0da95ed9c394d1ec6a?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/e75f4f99cdbe74278df3df2641335379","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:15:33","author":"Heath Parkes-Hupton","authors":["Heath Parkes-Hupton"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":342330362,"title":"US politics live: Donald Trump floats plan to sack Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell","text":"Donald Trump could make good on his threat to fire Jerome Powell according to a new report, drafting a letter to dismiss the Federal Reserve Chair.\n\nThough the President insisted to reporters he was not currently planning to axe Mr Powell – who he has subjected to months of escalating attacks – he did not rule out it out, either, and confirmed he had informally polled Republican politicians on the matter. \n\n“I talked to them about the concept of firing him,” Mr Trump said. \n\n“I said, ‘What do you think?’ Almost all of them said I should.

We are honoured,” Ms Obama, 61, told listeners before her co-host and brother, Craig Robinson, shot back, “Wait, you guys like each other?” \n\n“She took me back,” Mr Obama, 63, quickly chimed in. \n\n“It was touch and go for a while.” \n\nMr Robinson went on to note it was nice to have the couple in the same room together, prompting Ms Obama to say, “I know. Because when we aren’t, folks think we’re divorced.” \n\nThe Obamas had previously tried to quell speculation by posting cute photos on social media – even as they seemed to live mostly separate lives in public. \n\nThe whispers hit fever-pitch when the former first lady noticeably skipped two high-profile events earlier this year: former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral and President Donald Trump’s inauguration. \n\n“There hasn’t been one moment in our marriage where I thought about quitting on my man,” Ms Obama said during the episode. \n\n“And we’ve had some really hard times, and we’ve had a lot of fun times, a lot of adventures, and I have become a better person because of the man I’m married to.” \n\nTo which her husband responded: “OK, don’t make me cry now, right at the start of the show.” \n\nThe show of unity came despite the pair rarely being seen side-by-side in public for months. \n\nThey were last pictured stepping out for a date night at The Lowell Hotel restaurant in New York City on May 27, and cosying up for dinner at the bustling Osteria Mozza in Washington, DC in April.\n\nBefore then, the Obamas hadn’t been seen together since December 14 when they were snapped leaving the Mother Wolf restaurant in Los Angeles. \n\nThey did, however, share the rare photo or two on social media to mark birthdays, holidays and anniversaries. \n\nDuring the podcast, Mr Robinson acknowledged that he, too, had been dragged into the apparent marriage-woe saga, recalling one moment when a woman in Wichita, Kansas, asked him point-blank if the couple were still together.\n\n“This woman came up to me. She was so nice. (She asked), ‘Can I have a picture?’,” he recalled.\n\n“You know how you get the side hug? She was like, ‘What did (Barack) do? … He did something, didn’t he?” \n\nWhen Mr Robinson assured the woman that the couple was still going strong, “she was so happy, you would have thought I gave her a Christmas gift”, he added. \n\nMr Obama, for his part, said he was largely unaware of the speculation. \n\n“These are the kinds of things I just miss.

John MacArthur Remembered for Upholding Truth to the Woke","text":"Widely renowned evangelical theologian John MacArthur has passed away at the age of 86, leaving a lasting impact on the Christian community. MacArthur, who died on Monday, refused to bend the knee to woke ideology and made national headlines in 2020 when he refused to follow California law to close his church during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nLos Angeles County sued Grace Community Church, and the suit ended in a settlement in 2021 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state could not force churches to close, according to Newsweek. \n\nNewsweek reported that MacArthur wrote in a letter at the time, “We know that there is no circumstance that can cause the church to close. The church is not only a building but is the bride of Christ and exists to proclaim the truth.” \n\nIn August 2020, President Donald Trump called MacArthur to thank him for not closing his church, The New York Times reported. The two talked about how Christians could not vote Democrat, and MacArthur said, “There’s no way that a Christian could affirm the slaughter of babies, homosexual activity, homosexual marriage, or any kind of gross immorality.” \n\nMacArthur passed on Monday after contracting pneumonia, according to his ministry’s website. \n\nHe pastored Grace Community Church for 56 years and served as president of The Master’s University in Santa Clarita, California, since 1985, before transitioning to chancellor in 2019. His media ministry, Grace to You, is a nonprofit organization that distributes MacArthur’s audio programs, books, and television programs. \n\nMacArthur opened The Master’s Seminary in 1986, which trains men “for pastoral ministry—to preach the Word of God, reach the world for Christ, and teach others to do the same,” according to the seminary’s website. \n\nKnown for being an expository preacher, MacArthur dedicated his life’s work to teaching on passages from the Bible verse by verse, to directly align his sermons with the meaning of the Scripture. \n\nCharlie Kirk, an evangelical Christian and the founder of Turning Point USA, posted on X: “Pastor John MacArthur faithfully testified to the Truth of the Gospel for decades all while the culture, the media, and our politicians peddled lie after lie. He was a legend and he will be deeply missed.” \n\nJosh Zeichik, director of church engagement and leader of The Focused Pastor at Focus on the Family, is a Master’s University alumnus. A little over a year ago, he interviewed MacArthur for “The Focused Pastor,” a resource that seeks to equip and encourage pastors. \n\n“He had recently written a book on the war on children,” Zeichik told The Daily Signal. “He was so committed to proclaiming truth and protecting the vulnerable. … You hear people preach sermons. You hear them in chapel. But when you get to sit down and hear their heart face-to-face and his commitment to claiming truth because to not would leave kids vulnerable, I thought was so inspiring.” \n\nZeichik recalled a time when we heard MacArthur speak about 20 years ago at The Master’s University when he was a student there and somebody asked MacArthur how they could pray for him. MacArthur said that he was preparing to be a guest on “Larry King Live,” on CNN and would have an opportunity to speak to the masses. But what MacArthur said next was unexpected: His prayer request was not for him, but for King. \n\n“He goes, ‘Pray for Larry, because I feel like Larry’s very close to believing,’” Zeichik said. \n\nWhile MacArthur was known for plain, true, and unwavering commitment to proclaiming the truth of the Gospel, he ultimately wanted to see that translate to winning over people’s souls for the Lord, Zeichik said. \n\n“Many are eulogizing Pastor John as internationally renowned, but he was not a celebrity pastor,” Jenna Ellis of the American Family Association and host of “Jenna Ellis in the Morning” said on X. “He was a humble and gracious teacher and witness to the goodness of God. He used every moment to proclaim the truth of the gospel and make the name of Christ renowned and glorified.” \n\nOne X account posted a quote by MacArthur on the day of his passing: “All death can do to the believer is deliver him to Jesus.”","summary":"Widely renowned evangelical theologian John MacArthur has passed away at the age of 86, leaving a lasting impact on the Christian community.

'To begin with I was Pierce, then I was Daddy Pierce, and then I just became Dad. Charlotte and Chris have just been amazing in my life.'\nPierce adopted his wife's children after their biological father Dermot Harris died in 1986, and they changed their surname to his.\nSteven GerrardInstagramSnoop Dogg\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRise of the MAGs (that's middle-aged grandparents!): Steven Gerrard joins the ranks of 40-something stars who have welcomed grandchildren\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Obviously Gregg’s case was more clear cut, but John being dragged through the mud wasn’t what anyone wanted or expected to happen.\n'But at the same time, and as a publicly funded body, the BBC has a duty to both provide entertainment as well as fulfil its obligations to cast, crew, contestants and viewers alike.\n'If they were to can these two series, hundreds of people — those who appeared or worked on the shows — would be so bitterly disappointed. So the feeling at present is that the show, quite literally, must go on — albeit once the dust has settled and all the fuss died down.'\nHowever, MailOnline understands BBC director general Tim Davie, who has the final say, has not yet made his decision on whether MasterChef will or will not be aired.\n\nMasterChef bosses are reportedly pushing to air Gregg Wallace and John Torode's final series 'when the dust settles' after they were both sacked from the cooking show \n\nThe BBC and production company Banijay plan to air both the amateur and celebrity editions 'once the dust has settled'\nThe decision comes as Australian chef John plans to take legal action against the BBC after he was sacked from MasterChef.\nSources told The Mirror: 'John is preparing to launch the lawsuit against the BBC. He wants to pursue them for unfair dismissal. \n'He’s telling people there is no proof of his supposed comment. It was not in a work capacity, it was just hearsay. John is determined to clear his name.'\nBut, such legal action may prove impossible for John as sources told MailOnline his contract was with Banijay rather than the BBC.\nMailOnline has contacted the BBC for comment. \nThe Australian chef was dramatically axed from MasterChef - hours after the BBC's director general refused to back him over an allegation of using racist language.\nThe corporation said the host's contract would not be renewed after a report found he had used an 'extremely offensive racist term' during drinks after filming the show.\nThe complaint against John was revealed in the report into co-presenter Gregg's inappropriate behaviour. \nGregg, 60, was sacked after dozens of complaints against him were upheld.\n\nThe upcoming series' - which have already been filmed - features former I'm A Celeb star and restaurant critic Grace Dent , who replaced Gregg to co-host with John\n\nHowever, MailOnline understands BBC director general Tim Davie (pictured), who has the final say, has not yet made his decision on whether MasterChef will or will not be aired \n\nThe decision comes as Australian chef John plans to take legal action against the BBC after he was sacked from MasterChef. But, such legal action may prove impossible for John as sources close to MailOnline understand his contract was with Banijay rather than the BBC\nJohn identified himself on Monday as an unnamed person in the report who was accused of using 'racist language'.\nHowever, the presenter said 'he had absolutely no recollection' of the incident and did 'not believe that it happened'.\nBut in a statement yesterday, the BBC said: 'This allegation - which involves an extremely offensive racist term being used in the workplace - was investigated and substantiated by the independent investigation led by the law firm Lewis Silkin.\n'The BBC takes this upheld finding extremely seriously.\n'We will not tolerate racist language of any kind and we told Banijay UK, the makers of MasterChef, that action must be taken. John Torode's contract on MasterChef will not be renewed.'\nHours before the announcement, BBC director general Tim Davie had refused to back John and said he expected 'action to be taken' over the allegation.\nHe delivered the remarks as the BBC released its annual report - an occasion overshadowed by controversies for the second year in a row.\nLast year's was published amid the fallout over news presenter Huw Edwards who pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images of children.\n\nThe Australian chef was dramatically axed from MasterChef - hours after the BBC's director general refused to back him over an allegation of using racist language. The complaint against John was revealed in the report into co-presenter Gregg's inappropriate behaviour\n\nAsked about the Torode racism row, Tim Davie said: 'The BBC in some ways are quite simple on this - if someone is found to not live up to our values we expect the independent company, Banijay in this case, to take action and report back to us on what they have done.\n'These are not BBC employees, but we absolutely expect action to be taken.'\nTim added: 'I think a great programme that's loved by audiences is much bigger than individuals.\n'It absolutely can survive and prosper, but we've got to make ing drinks sure we're in the right place in ness terms of the culture of the show.' \nIt had been alleged by a source close to John that he had used an inappropriate racial term during drinks after filming. The witness claimed he had apologised immediately and 'was mortified' and he 'didn't use the term as a slur'.\nNo one complained at the time but the incident was brought up during the inquiry into Gregg, they said.\nOn Monday, John said he had 'absolutely no recollection' of the incident and was 'shocked and saddened' by the allegation. 'I would never wish to cause anyone offence,' he added.\nResponding to his sacking, John, who is married to actress and former Celebrity MasterChef contestant Lisa Faulkner, said: 'I'd hoped that I'd have some say in my exit from a show I've worked on since its relaunch in 2005, but events in the last few says seem to have prevented that.'\nHe said he 'had loved every minute' working on the show but it was 'time to pass the cutlery to someone else'.\n'Life is everchanging and ever moving and sometimes personal happiness and fulfilment lay elsewhere,' he added.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMasterChef bosses DO want to air Gregg Wallace and John Torode's final series 'when the dust has settled' - despite 'possible legal action by sacked hosts'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Shareholders say Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent. Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges. The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay a $5.1 billion penalty to settle FTC charges. The social media giant also faced significant fines in Europe and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users. Now shareholders want Zuckerberg and others to reimburse Meta for the FTC fine and other legal costs, which the plaintiffs estimate total more than $8 billion.The first trial witness, privacy expert Neil Richards, testified Monday morning for the shareholders.\"Facebook's privacy disclosures were misleading,\" said Richards, a professor at Washington University Law School.In later testimony, Jeffrey Zients, who served on Facebook's board from 2018 to 2020, testified that consumer privacy and user data were priorities for both management and the board.Nonetheless, he supported settling with the FTC as it investigated potential violations of the 2012 consent order, so the company could move forward.\"It was difficult because this was a lot of money, but I think it was better than the alternative,\" Zients said.Asked if the board considered making its founder a party to the settlement, he said Zuckerberg was \"essential\" to running the company.And, Zients, who served in both the Obama and Biden administrations, said, \"there was no indication that he had done anything wrong.\"The case is expected to run through late next week and include testimony from both Zuckerberg and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Other witnesses expected in Delaware Chancery Court, where Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is incorporated, include board member Marc Andreessen and former board member Peter Thiel. The judge is not expected to rule for several months. Meta had hoped the Supreme Court would dismiss the case. Justices heard arguments in November before deciding they should not have taken it up. The high court dismissed the company's appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.âOrtutay reported from San Francisco.","summary":"The case is expected to run through late next week and include testimony from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-trial-meta-privacy-lawsuit/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/16/b58406d0-0c19-459b-9ca7-f655493c6009/thumbnail/1200x630/3e864f3bdc71486c70b4930d9cc28ae9/ap25197506882515.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:06:52","author":"Cambridge Analytica","authors":["Cambridge Analytica"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":342329248,"title":"Coca-Cola Agrees to Use Cane Sugar in US-Made Coke: Trump","text":"The Coca-Cola company has agreed to use cane sugar in its iconic Coke drink in the United States, President Donald Trump said on July 16.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had been speaking to the beverage company about its Coke products.

However, this change would not impact Trump’s preferred beverage, Diet Coke, which uses aspartame for a sugar-free option.\n\n“I’ve been in discussions with Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke sold in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,” Trump posted on his social media platform.\n\nDonald Trump has announced Coca-Cola is changing its recipe at his request.

Technically, it’s not the first that this has happened. In 2017, he made headlines when he first installed a red button in the Oval Office that would have an aide fetch him a Diet Coke. Now, it's been confirmed that he had it reinstalled on January 1st, just in time for his second term debut. The reintroduction of the Diet Coke button was part of this redesign, reports the Mirror US . The publication recalls a quote Trump gave to reporters in 2017, at the start of his first presidency. He had jokingly said: \"Everyone does get a little nervous when I press that button.\" While the diet version appears to be Trump's drink of choice he has reportedly been in discussions with Coca-Cola to change one ingredient in the original Coca-Cola recipe in the US. If his vision goes to plan, soon American coke could soon taste much more like Mexican Coke. Trump championed the recipe change as a 'good move' by the Coca-Cola Company. Yesterday Donald Trump took to Truth Social to share the news, he wrote: \"I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so. I’d like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You’ll see. It’s just better!\" The company moved away from using sugar in Coke in the US during the 1980s, switching to cheaper high fructose corn syrup, reports MailOnline . In an email to CBS News , Coca-Cola said, \"We appreciate President Trump's enthusiasm for our iconic Coca-Cola brand. More details on new innovative offerings within our Coca-Cola product range will be shared soon.\" The company didn't add details about whn or where the 'innovative offerings'.","summary":"While the diet version appears to be Trump's drink of choice he has reportedly been in discussions with Coca-Cola to change one ingredient in the original Coca-Cola recipe in the US","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-reveals-coca-cola-35569152","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35569163.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_Coca-Cola-is-poured-into-a-glass-for-a-photograph-in-New-Yor.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-17 00:02:40","author":"Paige Ingram","authors":["Paige Ingram"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":342329476,"title":"Zito’s book on Trump assassination attempt will be a movie","text":"“There was a production company, it’s called Pense, and they just asked to see an early copy of the book.

Of course, their names are not provided, so as per usual, there’s no way to fact check the now-standard assertion that the people being deported are the very worst of the worst. \n\nSimilarly, when the Trump administration deported immigrants to South Sudan, McLaughlin made an almost identical statement, saying that it was necessary because “no country on earth wanted to accept them because their crimes were so uniquely barbaric.”\n\nJust as the Trump administration decided it was fine to deport people to South Sudan despite warning people not to travel there because it’s too dangerous, it’s also content to ignore government reports on the human rights crisis in Eswatini. \n\nThe State Department’s 2023 report found “significant human rights issues” in Eswatini, including torture by the government, extrajudicial killings, lack of independence of the judiciary, trafficking, and child labor. Of course, neither immigrants nor their lawyers have any idea what exactly they will endure, but the report detailed overcrowding, nutrition deficiencies, lack of health services equipment, and gang violence in Eswatini’s prisons. \n\nA spokesperson for the Eswatini government confirmed that the 5 immigrants are imprisoned in “isolated units” and that both Eswatini and the U.S. government will work with the United Nations to “facilitate the transit” of the men to their countries of origin. \n\nIt’s not entirely clear what that means, as it makes it sound like somehow the Trump administration deported people to Eswatini only to work jointly with that country to eventually send them home. Of course, that does not at all seem like the intent.\n\nAccording to a report from The New York Times report last month, the Trump administration has explored these trafficking arrangements with dozens of countries, many beset by violence, poverty, and human rights abuses. And of the 58 countries the administration has approached, many are covered by or are being considered for President Donald Trump’s latest travel ban. \n\nRelated | Rubio callously revokes visas for entire country over US mistake\n\nSo it’s too dangerous to allow people from those countries into the United States, but it’s totally safe and cool to send people to their prisons. And in case countries were on the fence, the State Department told diplomats that these countries could possibly evade the travel ban if they take deportees. \n\nWe can expect much more of these blatant human rights violations, thanks to the Supreme Court blocking a lower court order requiring immigrants to have a reasonable chance to challenge their deportations. Now, people can be deported to any random country of Trump’s liking with as little as 6 hours’ notice. \n\nThe conservatives on the Supreme Court knew full well that their decision would open the floodgates to these evil actions. They just don’t care.","summary":"The Trump administration has been deporting immigrants to random countries, and they couldn’t be more proud.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security’s Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin boasted on X that “a safe third country deportation flight to Eswatini in Southern Africa has landed,” with 5 immigrants aboard.\n\n\n\n“This flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,” she wrote. “These depraved monsters have been terrorizing American communities but thanks to Trump and [Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem], they are off of American soil.”\n\n\n\nTo back up the assertion, McLaughlin posted some photos of the alleged barbarians, along with their criminal convictions.
