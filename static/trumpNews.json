Will the COP29 climate talks tackle this injustice?","text":"Since the Industrial Revolution, country after country has turned to fossil fuels to power their transport and industry. \n\nNow the bill is coming due. Huge volumes of long-buried carbon are in the atmosphere, warming the planet. Climate disasters are arriving more often and getting worse.\n\nBut the pain from climate change is not distributed fairly. Developing nations are suffering the worst, despite emitting far fewer greenhouse gases. To date, two regions – Europe and North America – have contributed fully 60% of the world’s total emissions. This has made them much richer, but at a cost borne largely by those of us in the Global South. \n\nThis injustice will be in the spotlight this week, as leaders and diplomats gather in Baku, Azerbaijan, for the yearly United Nations climate talks. Climate finance is high on the agenda – specifically, the vexed question of who pays. \n\nWho is responsible for climate change?\n\nHistorically, North America and Europe are the highest emitters. \n\nAsia’s emissions have grown sharply in recent decades, due to its high population size, sustained economic growth in China and high emitting, oil-reliant Gulf states. \n\nBy contrast, Africa and South America are each only responsible for 3% of the world’s total emissions over time. \n\nThis is a necessarily simplistic picture. It hides, for instance, which companies and organisations emitted most in Europe and North America, as well as which income groups emit most. \n\nBut even at this level, it is increasingly clear the wealthiest people in the world are the highest emitters – including the rich who live in the Global South. \n\nThis unequal distribution of emissions gave rise to the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” in international environmental law in the 1990s. \n\nThis phrase speaks to the common responsibility to tackle climate change, the fact some nations have contributed less to the problem and some much more, and that some can respond more easily to the threat. \n\nThe idea was first articulated in the 1992 Rio Declaration on sustainable development. It was featured in the 1996 Kyoto Protocol on climate change and the 2015 Paris Agreement. \n\nPain for the poor\n\nUntil very recently, economic growth went hand in hand with using ever more fossil fuels. \n\nThe problem is the benefits were localised (an industry booms, a country gets wealthier), the environmental cost was deferred until later, and the damage would be borne more widely. \n\nIf fast-growing countries like Ethiopia, and Indonesia took the same route, climate change would get even worse and the world would blow through its shrinking carbon budget. \n\nThis is just one of many cruel twists of fate. As the damage done by climate change intensifies, developing countries have to spend more of their budgets on maintaining the status quo – repairing broken bridges, keeping farmers afloat – and less on improving the lives of their citizens. \n\nClimate change also poses major financial risks to developing nations. To cope with more and worse disasters, governments have to borrow more. More of their budgets have to go towards servicing debt, leaving less for everything else. \n\nRight now, millions are going hungry in southern Africa, after an unprecedented drought devastated crops. Zimbabwe has lost 80% of its crops, Zambia 70%. \n\nIn 2022, catastrophic floods in Pakistan forced almost 8 million people to leave their homes and forced another 20 million to seek immediate humanitarian aid. \n\nThese disasters are bad enough. But they can also disrupt national climate efforts. The hydroelectric Kariba Dam has long provided low-carbon power to Zambia and Zimbabwe. But the water level has dropped sharply due to the drought. In September, the dam stopped generating electricity – and brought power cuts across both nations. In response, the governments have looked to solar and even coal. \n\nWho pays for loss and damage?\n\nAdapting to climate change can only go so far. In response, nations in the Global South have sought recognition of the disproportionate loss and damage they were suffering. \n\nIn 2013, the world community set up the Warsaw Mechanism for Loss and Damage in a bid to tackle this injustice. \n\nIt took a decade of negotiation, stalling and delay before agreement was reached to create the Loss and Damage Fund at last year’s COP climate talks. It will be hosted in the World Bank at first. No funds have yet flowed. \n\nThis year’s COP meeting has been dubbed the “finance COP”. On the table will be how to structure this fund. One challenge will be securing funding, given contributions are voluntary and the Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund are also seeking funding for mitigation and adaptation projects. \n\nAt present, pledges come to a meagre US$661 billion. Wealthier countries have consistently tried to avoid liability for climate change and have blocked the use of terms such as “compensation” or “reparation”. \n\nWill we see progress?\n\nIn 2009, nations agreed to fund climate change adaptation and mitigation at $100 billion a year. This figure has now been reached. \n\nThe top item at this year’s climate talks will be setting a bigger goal for these climate funds. We don’t know yet whether loss and damage will be included alongside adaptation (living with it) and mitigation (preventing it). Leaders and activists in the Global South have called for a much larger sum for loss and damage, starting at $724 billion per year. \n\nClimate change is already costing poor nations a great deal of money, estimated at $100 to $500 billion in damage each year. \n\nIf this year’s COP is to correct this injustice, funding must be in line with expected costs. Funding should flow largely as grants, rather than loans. And wealthy nations should also contribute towards the loss and damage already being suffered.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re unlikely to see this happen if history is any guide. The COP discussions will be overshadowed by the election of Donald Trump, who has promised to give fossil fuel companies free rein. \n\nEven so, these talks offer an important way to get wealthy nations to pay attention to the very real damage done by climate change, far from the headlines. Persistence and advocacy may still pay off. \n\n Read more:\n COP29: who pays for climate action in developing nations – and how much – becomes more urgent","summary":"This week, nations are hashing out new goals for climate finance at the COP29 talks.

Kennedy Jr., who was picked Thursday by President-elect Donald Trump to head the Department of Health and Human Services. \"What I would ask of him is that he keep an open mind. We're happy to try to show as much of the data as we can. And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, speaking at an event hosted by the Milken Institute in Washington, D.C., this week, ahead of Trump's decision. Kennedy has insisted that he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and has pledged not to ban vaccines under Trump. Instead, Kennedy has promised to \"restore the transparency\" around vaccine safety data and records that he accuses HHS officials of hiding.Marks flatly rebuked Kennedy's claims about the safety data.\"There's no secret files. I mean, if they're secret, I hold a security clearance. If they are secret from me then, they must be at some other level of classification,\" he said.Public health experts have objected to Kennedy's long record of misleading statements questioning vaccine safety and worry he could upend decades' worth of hard-fought wins in improving vaccination rates against deadly diseases.The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group that has often clashed with the FDA, likened the pick to \"putting a Flat Earther at the head of NASA.\"Marks, a career civil servant who played a key role in launching the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, says he has \"sat in the room\" across from Kennedy when vaccines were discussed multiple times.While he said he worries that spending time \"re-litigating things that we know work\" could undermine other important FDA efforts — and could be potentially deadly during a future pandemic if it further erodes confidence in vaccines — Marks also said that working with RFK Jr. could turn out to have a silver lining.\"Perhaps engaging in that dialogue, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help. It may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be,\" he said.Marks rejected Kennedy's claims that the FDA is filled with corrupt officials who need to be fired, stressing that the staff is dedicated to protecting Americans' health. Marks said he hopes to keep his job under Trump and Kennedy, and to protect the team at his center.\"They do what they do to protect the American people. Not for any kind of nefarious purpose. And during the COVID pandemic, people worked 14 hours a day,\" Marks said of the agency's staff.Kennedy has vowed to end what he calls the agency's \"war on public health,\" warning workers who are \"part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\" He has also specifically pledged to fire all of the nutritional scientists at the FDA and other agencies on his first day, accusing them of being co-opted by corporate interests. \"I look forward to working with the more than 80,000 employees at HHS to free the agencies from the smothering cloud of corporate capture so they can pursue their mission to make Americans once again the healthiest people on Earth,\" Kennedy posted Thursday on X.Asked about Kennedy's scientific expertise, Marks said he thought Kennedy's understanding is \"not as deep as others,\" but added, \"I know a number of attorneys who know more than most PhDs and MDs about medicine. So it's not the degree. It's just a matter of keeping an open mind.\" While Kennedy's pick for the role was just announced on Thursday, health officials have been bracing for the possibility for a while. During the campaign, Trump vowed he'd let Kennedy to \"go wild\" on health if he won. \"President Trump wants to see, has told me, he wants to see concrete, measurable diminishment in chronic disease within two years,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 9.Kennedy says he has called on Trump to declare an emergency to counter chronic disease, supercharging his authority to address what he sees as the root causes of the federal government's failure to address rising rates of a range of ailments from autism to obesity.\"In order to do that, we need to operate very, very quickly. And we need to treat this with the same kind of urgency that we did, the COVID epidemic. This is a thousand times worse than COVID,\" Kennedy said.","summary":"The FDA's Dr. Peter Marks says he hopes to keep his job under a second Trump term, and urges Robert F.

The future First Lady replied, \"First, you will have lunch, and then you'll go to school.\"\n\n\"You can do reading, writing, and arithmetic,\" Donald said from his desk. Fans have praised Melania in the video's comments, as his thick Slovenian accent indicated he spent more time with her growing up.\n\n\"Lowkey impressed by this [because] I'm assuming this means he spent a lot of early years [with] his mom instead of a nanny,\" one user wrote. \n\n\"You can tell she was a very involved mother,\" another commented. \"It's such a cute interaction.\" Many called the exchange \"adorable\", commenting their surprise that he didn't have an American accent despite being raised in New York. \n\nHis accent is not the only change that Barron has experienced growing up in the public eye; he recently shocked the world when he towered over his father as Donald made a speech accepting his election win. \n\nThe college student stood at a whopping 6'7, and the President-elect credited his mother-in-law, Amalija Knavs, for his son's incredible height.\n\n\"Boy, did she take care of Barron,\" he said of Melania's late mother at the Iowa caucus in January. \"That's how he got so tall– he only ate her food.\"\n\nHe told the crowd that Amalija was \"way up there, she's looking down, and she's so proud of us\". \n\n\"Great people, great parents to all of us, really great parents but also to Barron,\" he finished. The 78-year-old also joked that Barron's stature could lead to a successful basketball career if only he were interested.\n\n\"I said, 'You're gonna be a basketball player',\" Donald said at the event. \"He said, 'Well, I like soccer, Dad, actually'. I thought…at your height, I like basketball better, but you can't talk them into everything.\"\n\nBarron, a freshman at NYU, became involved in his father's election campaign this year, lending Donald his insight as a member of Gen Z.\n\nHe encouraged his father to do interviews on some of the world's most popular podcasts, like with Joe Rogan and Logan Paul.\n\n\"He tells me about all the hot guys,\" Donald told Maria Bartiromo in October. \"People I never heard about.\"","summary":"A video has emerged showing Barron Trump's surprising accent despite being raised in New York.

'These are what we want to avoid.'\n\nAnother option is to eliminate bus routes in the city's hilly neighborhoods\n\nA working group is set to meet in the coming months to generate ideas for boosting revenue, and the agency has already launched a merchandising campaign ahead of the holiday season that includes branded hoodies, hats, socks, mugs and stickers, NBC Bay Area reports. \n\nTransit officials are also hoping to place funding measure on the ballot in 2026, even though an earlier effort failed this year in the state capitol of Sacramento.\n\nEven if that were to pass, the revenue would have to be split with other transit organizations, like BART and Caltrain, according to SFist. \n\nAs a result, Tumlin warned the cuts are 'potentially real.\n\n'If we fail to come to an agreement, and we fail to win [more funding], we will need to make massive service cuts.' \n\nCaliforniaDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nSan Francisco's most iconic tourist attraction could be axed as progressive city faces huge budget shortfall\n\nAdd comment","summary":"San Francisco officials may be forced to get rid of one of its most iconic features amid a large budget shortfall.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14084943/San-Francisco-cable-cars-axed-budget-shortfall.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/15/00/92092287-0-image-a-13_1731631547440.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 01:04:16","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":264902788,"title":"Elon Musk enters diplomatic arena to defuse tensions between Washington & Tehran under Donald Trump","text":"Elon Musk, the technology billionaire with close ties to US President-elect Donald Trump, held discussions with Iran's UN Ambassador to ease tensions between Tehran and Washington.Anonymous Iranian sources described the meeting between the world's wealthiest individual and Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani as \"positive,\" according to The New York Times on Thursday.The newspaper reported that they convened for over an hour at an undisclosed location on Monday.

Kennedy Jr. to be health secretary","text":"New York — President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n“For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,” Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would “end the Chronic Disease epidemic” and “Make America Great and Healthy Again!”\n\nKennedy is one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world and has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism and other health issues.\n\nTrump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.\n\nHailing from one of the nation’s most storied political families, Kennedy is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent before abandoning his bid after striking a deal to give Trump his endorsement with a promise to have a role overseeing health policy in a second Trump administration.\n\nHe and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race’s final stretch, and Trump had made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major role overseeing public health as part of a campaign to “Make America Healthy Again.”\n\n“I’m going to let him go wild on health,” Trump said at a rally last month.\n\nDuring his victory speech in Palm Beach, Florida, last week, Trump exclaimed, “Go have a good time, Bobby!”\n\nStill, it was unclear precisely what job he would be offered. In an October interview on CNN, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick assured there was no way Kennedy would receive the job he got.\n\nThe appointment drew alarms from public health experts.\n\n“Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is not remotely qualified for the role and should be nowhere near the science-based agencies that safeguard our nutrition, food safety, and health,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the public health watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nDr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, “I don’t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.”\n\n“Any misinformation coming from places of influence, of power, are concerning,” she said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to “reorganize” agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nKennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.\n\nBut he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.\n\nAgain and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.\n\nIn a 2021 podcast he urged people to “resist” CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.\n\n“I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, ‘Better not get them vaccinated,’” Kennedy said.\n\nRepeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year\n\nTrump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving many lives.\n\nTrump, in his announcement, said that, under Kennedy, HHS would “play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country.” But HHS does not have jurisdiction over many of those issues, which fall under the purview of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture.\n\nKennedy is an attorney who has built a loyal following over several decades of people who admire his lawsuits against major pesticide and pharmaceutical companies. He has pushed for tighter regulations around the ingredients in foods.\n\nWith the Trump campaign, he worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, with his message of making food more healthful in the U.S., promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. In a nod to Trump’s original campaign slogan, he named the effort “Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nIt remains unclear how that will square with Trump’s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.\n\nKennedy’s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nHe also has said he would recommend removing fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the material has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.\n\nHe has said he would seek to ban certain food additives, cracking down on substances such as food dyes and preservatives, which are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. He has also targeted pesticides, which are jointly regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA.\n\nKennedy has also drawn headlines for his history with wild animals. He admitted to dumping a dead bear in New York’s Central Park — placing it as though it had been hit by a bike — and found himself the subject of a federal probe after his daughter revealed that he had cut off a beached whale’s head and strapped it to the roof of his car to take home.\n\nHHS has more than 80,000 employees across the country. Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the CDC.\n\nHe has said he is especially focused on putting an end to the “revolving door” of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer.\n\nKennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research.\n\nThe expected appointment was first reported by Politico Thursday.\n\nKennedy’s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children’s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump also announced Thursday that he will nominate Jay Clayton, who served as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first term, to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.","summary":"Trump says he will nominate Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2024/11/trump-to-nominate-anti-vaccine-activist-robert-f-kennedy-jr-to-be-health-secretary.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/JOOBSFH3Y5CY3CYDTW2V6JGFE4.jpg?auth=cb9806cb8301869f6824197406bdbc1d325bbd0e07d2fc2b81827df1ecbe9cef&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 01:03:22","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":264902848,"title":"Irish politicians and voters ‘don’t take climate threat seriously enough’","text":"According to the Climate Action Tracker — an independent scientific project — “minimal progress” has been made in curbing expected global temperature rises since Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021.\n\nThe world is on track to hit 2.7C of global heating, which would have profound effects of human life and biodiversity, rendering some areas of the planet unliveable, the scientists said.\n\nFriends of the Earth said all political parties in Ireland must spell out how they are going to uphold Ireland’s climate law, which was passed three years ago in the Dáil by 129 votes to 10.\n\nDespite the overwhelming parliamentary majority, Ireland’s emissions are not nearly going down quickly enough to match the legally binding targets that the legislation sets out, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the independent Climate Change Advisory Council, and leading climate scientists here.\n\nResearch has shown that storms such as Storm Babet, which devastated Midleton in East Cork last year, were exacerbated by climate change, with such events set to become more frequent and intense in the future.\n\nFriends of the Earth Ireland CEO Oisín Coghlan said climate change must be taken more seriously by politicians and voters. He said: \n\n There’s been some reports that climate hasn’t been coming up on the doorsteps as much as it did four years ago.\n\n“I doubt climate change came up that much on the doors in the Spanish general election last year.

Here’s what to know about recess appointments","text":"Washington — President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general is his most controversial Cabinet pick yet, and the Florida Republican is likely to face obstacles in the confirmation process. \n\nBut Trump is seeking an important change to the Senate confirmation process that would allow him to install some officials and sidestep lengthy hearings and a floor vote, in which nominees need a majority vote to be confirmed. \n\nBefore Senate Republicans elected their leaders for the upcoming 119th Congress, Trump demanded that the candidates agree to recess appointments, which would give him the option of bypassing the Senate’s role of approving or rejecting the president’s nominations. Trump argued that without the ability to temporarily install nominees he would not be able to fill the positions in a timely manner. \n\nThe legal basis for recess appointments emanates from a constitutional clause that gives the president “the power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.” A Supreme Court ruling in 2014 concluded that recess appointments could only be made when the Senate is not in session for 10 or more days, after President Barack Obama made controversial appointments when senators were on break. \n\nSenators often leave Washington for long stretches of time, but have utilized pro forma sessions to prevent presidents from installing nominees without their consent. \n\n“In recent years, the Senate — regardless of which party controlled it — has used pro forma sessions to ensure that it is never in recess for more than three days,” said Josh Chafetz, a law and politics professor at Georgetown University. \n\nFor Trump to make recess appointments, the Senate would have to agree, through a simple majority vote, to go on recess for at least 10 days. The House must also agree to allow the Senate to adjourn, but Chavetz says if the House does not agree, or if it disagrees with the Senate on the length of adjournment, then the president has the constitutional power to adjourn both chambers for a timeframe of his choosing. \n\n“That second route has never been used before in U.S. history, so no one is quite sure how it would work,” Chafetz said. \n\nA recess appointment, however, does not have the same benefits as a nominee confirmed by the Senate. Without Senate approval, the appointee would not be paid. The appointee can serve in the role for up to two years, depending on when the appointment was made. After that, the individual could be installed again through a recess appointment or the regular confirmation process. \n\nSome senators, including Republicans who will be in the majority come January, showed little appetite for giving up their constitutional power, especially after Trump announced that he intended to nominate Gaetz to lead the Justice Department. \n\n“I was shocked,” Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Wednesday. “If the president proceeds with that nominee, I think it shows the importance of having the Senate advice and consent process.” \n\nGaetz resigned from Congress on Wednesday after Trump announced his selection. The timing came days before a House panel was set to vote on releasing a report on whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct. Gaetz was also the subject of a previous Justice Department investigation that sought to determine if he violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws. No charges were filed, and Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. \n\n“We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees,” Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday when asked by reporters about Gaetz. “That’s a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the Judiciary Committee in doing that vetting and advice and consent.” \n\n“I don’t think we should be circumventing the Senate’s responsibilities, but I think it’s premature to be talking about recess appointments,” Cornyn added. \n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for conducting confirmation hearings for the attorney general nominee. Several other Judiciary Committee members also weighed in Thursday. \n\n“The bottom line is our responsibility in the Senate is advice and consent,” said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the committee chairman. \n\nRepublican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said recess appointments should be used “judiciously,” adding that he has concerns about “blanket recess appointments.” \n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said he could name between “five to 10 Republicans who are seriously considering voting against” Gaetz “and insisting that there will be a vote.” \n\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri indicated he would not have an issue if Trump made recess appointments, saying the president “has total authority to make recess appointments.” \n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware urged his Republican colleagues to protect their role in confirmations and encourage Trump to pick confirmable candidates. \n\n contributed to this report.","summary":"Washington — President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s selection of former Rep.

But held too long, the technique can restrict the flow of blood to a person’s brain, ending their life in a matter of minutes.\n\n“Once the person is rendered unconscious, that’s when you’re supposed to let go,” Caballer told a jury on Thursday.\n\nHis testimony came weeks into the trial of Penny, who faces charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after placing Jordan Neely, a homeless man and Michael Jackson impersonator, in the fatal chokehold last May.\n\nProsecutors allege that Penny “went way too far” in his attempt to restrain Neely, showing an “indifference” toward his life even after he had lost consciousness and stopped fighting back.\n\nPenny, an architecture student who served four years in the U.S. Marines, told police he was seeking to protect himself and other riders from a man who was acting erratically on the train and frightening riders with distressing comments. His attorneys have emphasized Neely’s previous arrests, along with his struggles with mental illness and drug use.\n\nBystander video of the encounter shows Penny with his bicep pressed across Neely’s neck and his other arm on top of his head, a position he held for close to six minutes, even after the man went limp.\n\nThe technique — an apparent “blood choke” — can make a person feel like “trying to breathe through a crushed straw,” Caballer said. In his own training sessions, Caballer recalled telling his fellow Marines: “You don’t want to keep holding on. This can result in actual injury or death.”\n\nAsked by prosecutors whether Penny has used the chokehold in an “improper” manner, Caballer said that he had.\n\nAttorneys for Penny argue their client had sought to restrain Neely by placing him in a headlock, but that he did not apply strong force throughout the interaction. They have raised doubt about the city medical examiner’s finding that Neely died from the chokehold, pointing to his health problems and drug use as possible factors.\n\nPressed by Penny’s attorney, Caballer acknowledged that he could not “definitively tell from watching the video how much pressure is actually being applied.” But at times, he said, it appeared that Penny was using a hold that may have cut off the flow of blood to Neely’s brain.\n\n“He could possibly be cutting off maybe one of the carotid arteries,” the witness added.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Dr. Cynthia Harris, the city medical examiner who inspected Neely’s body, reiterated her finding that he had died from a lack of oxygen caused by the chokehold. Though she did not describe the exact process of asphyxiation, she testified that “blocking both arteries in both veins, could kill a person in a matter of seconds.”\n\nJurors were also shown video for the first time Thursday of Penny demonstrating the chokehold to detectives during an interview inside the precinct.\n\n“He had his back turned to me and I got him in a hold, got him to the ground, and he’s still squirming around and going crazy,” Penny said, adding: “He gets a burst of energy at one point and I did have to hold him a little more steady.”\n\nIn the eighteen months since the killing, Penny has been embraced by conservatives as a good Samaritan who used his military training to protect his fellow riders. U.S. Rep. U.S. Matt Gaetz, who President-elect Donald Trump nominated this week as his attorney general, described him as a “Subway Superman.”\n\nBut the trial has also drawn near daily protests from Black Lives Matter activists, who’ve labeled Penny a racist vigilante who overreacted to a Black man in the throes of a mental health episode.\n\nPenny faces up to 15 years in prison if he is convicted.","summary":"In the eighteen months since the killing, Penny has been embraced by conservatives as a good Samaritan who used his military training to protect his fellow riders.

Read Australia's OTHER vitriolic insults now set to blow up in all our faces with President-elect Donald Trump\n\nREAD MORE: PVO - Why Rudd is going no-where \n\nFollow DailyMail.com's presidential election live blog for all the latest news and updates\n\nBy PETER VAN ONSELEN, POLITICAL EDITOR FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 00:46 GMT, 15 November 2024 | Updated: 00:53 GMT, 15 November 2024\n\nThe Prime Minister will be hoping incoming US President Donald Trump doesn't let his bestie Elon Musk sit in on their telephone conversations the way he did when Trump talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBecause if Musk does do that, you'd have to assume Trump's anti-Albo attitude will only solidify. The PM has been even ruder about Musk than Australian ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd has been about Trump.\n\nBack in April in an interview with the ABC (who else) our PM labelled Musk an 'arrogant billionaire who thinks he's above the law'.\n\nSimilar insults were hurled at Musk, one of the world's richest people, by Labor cabinet minister Tanya Plibersek (she called him 'egotistical') and Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young (a 'narcissistic cowboy').\n\nThe context for the barrage of insults was Musk challenging attempts to force him to take down graphic posts of a stabbing attack in a Sydney church.\n\nThe Australian E-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant took the billionaire to court in a bid to force him to delete the widespread images - ultimately withdrawing the action in what really was a humiliating backdown.\n\nThe whole, ultimately unsuccessful, saga did more to draw attention to the content on X than otherwise would have been the case. The images were also easily accessible right across the internet - and in the mainstream media, not just on social media.\n\nAlbanese's government has since looked to amend the law to ensure that it has the powers to get its way in such disputes with social media companies in the future.\n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump huddles with Elon Musk, on right, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Musk has gotten so close to Trump he's called himself the 'first buddy' to the incoming American leader and Trump has jokingly told House Republicans he 'can't get rid of him' \n\nPutting to one side the irony of the PM labelling Musk as someone who arrogantly thinks he's above the law when Albo's government is seeking to amend said laws to achieve their desired outcome, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the PM's concerns for online safety are selectively applied.\n\nWhat about existing easy access to graphic online pornography for minors, for example? You don't hear a peep out of the government when it comes to tackling that issue.\n\nOr tighter online gambling restrictions? The crossbench has become increasingly vocal in its frustration at expectations the Labor government plans to rollover on its previously strong rhetoric to take action.\n\nSo why is Labor fixated on tackling social media giants more so than these other important issues?\n\nCould it be because Albo is looking to pander to Australia's legacy media businesses that are currently fighting a losing war with social media giants?\n\nIt is hard not to think the PM and his strategists see this issue as a perfect way to try and appease important media executives on this issue in a bid to ameliorate broader concerns about the failures of his government.\n\nThere is no escaping the poor opinion polls and the growing perception that the first term Labor government has underperformed.\n\nElon Musk is unlikely to have forgiven, or forgotten, what the Australian Prime Minister has said about him. Mr Albanese will have to hope Musk doesn't join his calls with Trump - as he did with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nThe tough talk about taking on social media giants - continued in Communications Minister Michelle Rowland's speech to the Sydney Institute on Wednesday night - no doubt is also a populist pitch to parents concerned about their children's online activities. \n\nBut as mentioned, the response is selective at best.\n\nMeanwhile, now that Trump has one foot back in the White House and his mate Musk has his ear more than anyone, Albo personalising his attacks is all too clearly yet another misstep by a PM all too prone to them.\n\nVolodymyr ZelenskyElon MuskSydney\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nPETER VAN ONSELEN: It's not just Kevin Rudd...

News of Butker's injury came out Thursday evening ahead of the Chiefs-Bills showdown Sunday, and, for many liberals disgruntled with the outcome of the recent election, the news was a reprieve and cause for celebration on social media. Several social media users posted in celebration of Butker's injury, referencing the kicker's previous comments on the benefit of women accepting domestic roles as mothers and wives and his endorsement of Trump. One widely circulated post had a caption that said, \"Women seeing Harrison Butker get injured,\" attached to a video of a television audience standing up and cheering passionately. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Another user wrote, \"Please take all of Harrison Butker’s pain and have it stay exactly where it is.\" Some users took the injury as an opportunity to knock Butker's masculinity. One post said, \"real men don't miss work.\" \"Too busy bending the knee to Trump huh,\" another post said. However, some fans stepped up to defend Butker from the harsh responses. \"Any of y’all, Chiefs ‘fans’ that are celebrating the Butker injury because of his ‘politics’ go find another team for we don’t need that kind of negative energy,\" one fan wrote. Some used the injury as an opportunity to push conspiracy theories and make jokes about Butker being appointed for Trump's Cabinet. HARRISON BUTKER'S FAITH-DRIVEN COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT BENEDICTINE COLLEGE: READ THE SPEECH HERE One user jokingly wrote, \"Donald Trump announces that Harrison Butker will lead the Department of Women’s Rights and Home Affairs.\" Another user falsely wrote, \"He’s holding out for a few weeks hoping for the ‘Director of Family Services’ cabinet position.\" The jokes and false claims about Butker come amid recent announcements of Trump's Cabinet appointments, many of which have drawn praise and controversy. The appointments of Matt Gaetz as attorney general, Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency have been among the most discussed appointments in recent days. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Butker endorsed Trump and Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley in the recent election. The kicker announced his Upright PAC along with Hawley, earning the praise of Chiefs owner Clark Hunt. The kicker's shift into politics accelerated after he made remarks about women and their careers during a commencement address at Benedictine College. \"Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife Isabelle would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother,\" Butker said at the time. Shortly after the speech, Butker's jersey sales soared. His jersey ranked 11th in NFL sales, from March 1 to May 31, the NFLPA said. However, Butker's speech also incited fierce and oftentimes emotional backlash from many in the mainstream media. Washington Post columnist Sally Jenkins mocked Butker for being a kicker after delivering the remarks, while NBC's \"Today\" host Hoda Kotb scolded the kicker, telling him \"not to speak for women.\" Butker later told Fox News host Laura Ingraham he’s \"saddened\" some people took his words in a \"poor manner.\" \"I was trying to speak life for so many women that have dedicated their life to being the homemaker, being the one that raises the children. And it's a beautiful role, but it's not a role that should be diminished,\" he explained. \"There's nothing shameful if you are a woman, and you want to spend time with your family and raise your children. So, it's not putting down anyone who maybe wants to go get a great education and have a career. \"But it's more talking about how beautiful it is for women to maybe just step aside and prioritize their family and spend time with their children and raise their family. And that's what I was just trying to speak love about.\" Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","summary":"Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker injured a knee, prompting liberals on social media to celebrate due to his conservative beliefs.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chiefs-harrison-butkers-injury-sparks-feminist-celebrations-trump-cabinet-conspiracies-social-media","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/931/523/Harrison-Butker5.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:50:24","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.434},{"id":264902776,"title":"I was in denial about my drinking until waking up one morning with that awful symptom we all dread.

Email carina.stathis@mailonline.com \nBy CARINA STATHIS FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA \n Published:00:49 GMT, 15 November 2024 |Updated:00:50 GMT, 15 November 2024 \n\nBelinda Stark had one hand on a full glass of sauvignon blanc and the other holding her head as she sobbed at the dining table alone. Her blue eyes were bloodshot and her nose was blocked as she tried to remain quiet while her sons slept in their bedrooms.\nIt wasn't an especially sad occasion. Nothing catastrophic had happened. It was just another weekday night for the mother of two from Melbourne.\n'I'm not good enough. I hate myself,' the voice in her head would say on repeat. \nShe'd done it again.\n'I loved to drink. Alcohol was my best friend. I'd go through this vicious daily cycle of telling myself I wouldn't drink, but then by 4pm I would know I'd be having a couple of glasses of wine that night. But I was in denial about my problem, burying my head in the sand,' Belinda, now 55, tells me.\nBelinda would stumble to bed drunk most evenings after finishing a bottle to herself. Then around 3am she would jolt awake, racked with anxiety over being unable to recall what had happened the night before. \nIt wasn't always this way. She could go long stretches of time without drinking to excess. And she was able to keep this 'on-and-off' relationship with alcohol a secret for two decades, mainly because she only drank at home or at acceptable social events and always managed to avoid that dreaded reputation as a 'party girl'.\nThe cracks showed only briefly in 2003 when she got divorced. The other mums at children's parties noticed her fondness for boozy singledom and nicknamed her the 'real-life Bridget Jones'.\n\n'I loved to drink. Alcohol was my best friend. I'd go through this vicious daily cycle of telling myself I wouldn't drink, but then by 4pm I would know I'd be having a couple of glasses of wine that night,' says mother-of-two Belinda Stark (pictured)\nIt would take almost 20 years for her to hit 'rock bottom' - a term alcoholics use to describe the nadir of their drinking. It happened over Christmas in 2022 when she woke up with 'the shakes' that were so severe she had to race to the nearest hospital.\nWhile waiting to see a doctor, she sent a text to her son, husband and best friend that read: 'I know I have a drinking problem. I need your help. I'm sick of feeling like this. I'm so scared, but I know I need to do this. Please help me. I love you so much.'\nInstantly her son Mitch, who was 27 by this point, replied: 'Mum, I'm so proud of you. I never thought you'd admit that you had an issue with drinking. I love you very much and of course you've got my support 100 per cent.' \nThe heartfelt response came as a shock. Belinda had never once considered that her son had noticed her drinking, let alone had been concerned about it for so long. \n\nBelinda's bad drinking habits started in the early 2000s following a bout of depression after the birth of her first child. Drinking to cope with her sadness, she would again turn to alcohol when she went through a divorce from her first husband \nBelinda's bad drinking habits started in the early 2000s following a bout of depression after the birth of her first child. Drinking to cope with her sadness, she would again turn to alcohol when she went through a divorce from her first husband.\nThis coincided with the birth of what some now call 'mummy wine culture', where mothers normalise drinking - sometimes on a nightly basis - as a way to cope with the daily struggles of parenting.\nSex and the City and Bridget Jones dominated pop culture and it was perfectly normal to see women on TV with a cocktail or wine glass in hand.\nBelinda even recalls some kids' play centres had a fully stocked bar for parents to indulge in while their children ran amok. \n'Drinking was really cool and I was drinking every night as a reward,' she says. \nFor years, Belinda would drink most days but life was still good: she even pursued a lifelong dream of buying a fashion store and running her own business.\n\nBelinda knows she wasn't the most severe kind of alcoholic, but considers herself a grey-area drinker - someone who would regularly drink too much but was not physically dependent \n\nBelinda's drinking problem had been 20 years in the making, and like so many women of her generation, it was so easy to be in denial. She is pictured here with her husband\nShe continued to drink after meeting her now-husband Andy, but stopped before falling pregnant with her second son, Max, who is now 18.\nOnce again, she suffered from postnatal depression and found herself in and out of hospital for 12 months. \nAmid the fog of depression, Belinda starting drinking again, describing a glass of wine - or two, or three - as 'a release' and a 'reward' during this difficult time.\n'I was struggling and I didn't have much support, which you really need during postnatal depression,' she says.\nFlash forward to 2014 and her whole world came crashing down with her breast cancer diagnosis.\nShe did not have any symptoms - she only went for a check-up after a speaker at a business lunch recommended it - but she did have a family history of the disease. The screening detected early signs of cancerous cells in her breast.\n'I'll never forget sitting in my car and getting a call from the nurse telling me they had found something. I cried instantly. I went straight to the radiologist who then confirmed it was cancer,' Belinda says. \n'I rang my husband and best friend to tell them. Then went home and my oldest son could tell straight away something was wrong.\n'I remember just holding him and saying, \"Look, I don't want you to worry at all, but I've been to the hospital and they think I might have breast cancer.\" And to this day I will never, ever forget the guttural crying and sorrow.\n'The day I found out I had cancer, Andy came home with two bottles of wine and we all sat in the lounge room sobbing. I told him I wasn't ready to die.' \n\nBelinda's drinking in the early 2000s coincided with the birth of what some now call 'mummy wine culture'. Sex and the City and Bridget Jones (pictured) were also dominating pop culture and it was perfectly normal to see women on TV with a cocktail or wine glass in hand\n\nIt wasn't until she reached her early fifties and experienced that unmistakable physical symptom of alcohol withdrawal - 'the shakes' - that she realised she needed to seek help (pictured with husband Andy) \nLooking back, Belinda says her drinking habit was worse then being diagnosed with cancer because 'with cancer I knew what I was dealing with - it wasn't a bed of roses but it was something that had a timeframe on it.'\nBy contrast, alcohol was a 20-year albatross around her neck. \n'It's a habit and an escape for so many people. It's a legal drug. I turned to it when life was tough and when I was going through rough patches,' she tells me.\nBelinda underwent cancer treatment, miraculously experienced no side effects, and would remain on medication for 10 years.\nLife was good for another five years, right up until 2019. She was busy running her fashion label and was in a good place with her mental health.\nThen Covid hit.\n\nWhat happens to your body when you stop drinking \n\nWithin 12-24 hours: Detoxification begins and blood sugar normalises. \nDuring this period you may experience withdrawal symptoms, including sweating, anxiety, depression and insomnia.\nWithin one week: Quality of sleep should improve and you should start to feel more energised and hydrated.\nWithin two weeks: Weight loss may begin thanks to cutting out the hidden calories in alcohol.\nWithin three to four weeks: Blood pressure stabilises.\nSource: Dry July\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the pandemic shut down the world, Belinda started drinking heavily again. It was easy then - the bars and restaurants were shut so the idea of drinking at home was suddenly normalised.\n'I thought since everyone else was doing it so it was okay, and the whole \"I deserve it\" mentality played a part too,' she says.\nBut the drinking soon impacted her mental health and relationships.\nAlarmingly, during this period she would drink so much she could not recall anything from the night before - from what television show she had watched, to if she had picked a fight with her husband, or what - or how much - she had eaten before bed.\n'I crashed pretty hard at night then would wake up at 2am feeling thirsty or needing to go to the bathroom. Then I always struggled getting back to sleep and would lay there feeling anxious because I couldn't recall what I had done,' she says.\n'In the morning I would wake up feeling like crap with no energy so I would cancel any gym class, get through the day and the cycle would repeat.\n'It got to a point that I was so sick of beating myself up every morning saying, \"You've done it again, you were going to try stop\".'\nThat Christmas morning when her shakes brought her to hospital was the wake-up call Belinda needed to get her life on track. \nShe took her last drink on January 12, 2023.\n\nAn ex-addict's five question quiz that'll reveal if you have a drinking problem... \n\nBy Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober\n\n1. You've googled 'am I an alcoholic?'\nPeople who drink healthily don't Google about whether it's troublesome, just as people who don't have marital issues don't look for relationship counselling.\n2. You are secretive about drinking\nMy dad apparently hid vodka bottles behind lampposts on the way to his job so it was easy to fool myself that my, 'I'm staying up to watch another episode' and then finishing off the bottle I would later replace, wasn't 'hiding bottles'. But it was. Because I was hiding having finished it.\n3. You tried controlling your drinking\nI started a 'moderation experiment' when I was 29, in which I kept a daily unit count in a golden notebook to attempt to stay under my goal of 30 units a week - which was already excessive. I kept it for a few months and - given I only managed to limbo under 30 units twice - I ended up scribbling the charts out angrily.\nI now know this 'count and control' stage, and the ditching thereof, is very common. The attempt to control is actually a sign you've lost control.\n4. You'd say you drink moderately\nIt's the people who protest too much about how they're definitely moderate, and how they always stop at two, they never get hangovers: these are the people who ask me: 'How did you quit? Just asking for a friend.'\nThey also cast around (like I did) for people who are worse than them in order to protect their own toxic drinking. If you have nothing to protect, you don't need to prepare a speech of defence.\n5. You drink more than you intend to\nThis is the clincher. You go out intending to only have two white wine spritzers, or three bottles of beer, and you have more. Consistently and repeatedly.\nThink of other consumables in life, to give this perspective. I don't buy a family cheesecake and intend to have one slice and end up having three. Therefore, I have no issue with cheesecake. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow 55, healthy and sober, she is on a mission to help Gen X women overcome their problematic drinking before it tilts into full-on addiction. \nBelinda knows she wasn't the most severe kind of alcoholic, but considers herself a grey-area drinker - someone who would regularly drink too much but was not physically dependent. \nLooking back through the lens of sobriety, she now recognises the ways she would try to rationalise her drinking.\n'I would play little tricks on myself by drinking a whole bottle of low-alcoholic wine and justify it because it wasn't full strength. Or I would share a bottle with my husband - even though he would only have one glass.'\nNow Belinda helps others by becoming a sobriety coach - and her key advice is to have self-compassion and self-love.\n'To anyone considering changing their drinking habits, start with small steps and be kind to yourself,' she says. \n'For the first couple weeks, don't go out too much and gradually cut back. And if you slip up, that's okay. The next day, just get back on the bike and try your best.'\nIt comes as research by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows Gen X women in their late forties and fifties are among the heaviest drinkers - and it's a health catastrophe waiting to happen.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nI was in denial about my drinking until waking up one morning with that awful symptom we all dread.

Despite these figures, the euro found little support as the dollar pressure intensified.\n\nAnalysts warn of euro weakness as dollar ‘continues to hammer the market’\n\nThe latest Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey underscored a significant sentiment shift among investors following Trump’s election victory, with 45% of respondents now picking the dollar as their top-performing currency for 2025, up sharply from 20% in October.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists lowered their growth forecasts for the eurozone, citing concerns over heightened uncertainty and trade-related spillovers from Trump’s policies. “The policy proposals on offer would raise the cost of US imports, lower the cost of doing business domestically, and weigh on foreign activity levels. We believe this will have direct and powerful implications for the dollar on a broad basis,” analysts at Goldman Sachs remarked. \n\nGoldman even indicated that, if US tariffs and tax cuts proceed as planned, the euro could fall below parity with the dollar – a scenario not seen in more than two decades. \n\nBBVA’s chief strategist Alejandro Cuadrado highlighted the risk for Europe’s largest economy, noting: “Potential new US tariffs are a concern, and Germany would be one of the countries most affected.” \n\nHe added that with eurozone inflation under control, the European Central Bank (ECB) may feel little pressure to intervene to support the euro. \n\nIntesa Sanpaolo market strategist Luca Cigognini warned: “The dollar continues to hammer the market, crushing all major currencies to the downside. EUR sees the spectre of 1.0500 approaching. The eventual break of this psychological support would open a broader bearish front that could favour a collapse toward 1.0440.”\n\nFurther downward pressure on euro likely\n\nSaxo Bank’s chief investment strategist, Charu Chanana, sees further downside for the euro, saying: “The USD still has room to run. Political instability in Europe, combined with an already fragile economic recovery and the looming threat of tariffs, leaves the euro vulnerable.” \n\nA more cautious outlook on the euro came from ING forex analyst Francesco Pesole, who noted that Trump’s policies could face obstacles within his own party. \n\nPesole pointed out that Republican Senate leader John Thune, a free trade advocate, may push back against some of Trump’s aggressive tariff plans. \n\nHe also highlighted downside risks for the dollar, citing stretched long positions and potential dovish remarks from upcoming speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in Dallas later on Thursday.","summary":"The euro fell to 1.05 against the dollar on Thursday, hitting a fresh 13-month low as President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s trade policies and tax cuts are expected to strengthen the greenback.

With her comments going viral on X, outraged Mr Trump supporters are vowing to boycott the project.\n\n“Not taking my kids to see this trash after the statement you put out. Disney you need to do something about this,’ one social media user wrote, per the Daily Mail.\n\n“I hope you get no peace when this film BOMBS at the box office and streaming,” a second wrote.\n\nOthers hope the young starlet loses her job and Disney shelves the movie entirely.\n\n“Rachel Zegler is unhinged and a liability,” a critic claimed. “They should permanently shelve Snow White and distance themselves from her. Her involvement with the company alienates millions of people and poisons the brand overall.”\n\nFollowing Mr Trump’s win last week, Zegler shared a series of messages with her 2.3 million Instagram followers.\n\n“I find myself speechless in the midst of this. another four years of hatred, leaning us towards a world i do not want to live in,” she wrote in a now-deleted Instagram Story. “I shouldn’t be this shocked. but i am. i am heartbroken for my friends who awoke [in] fear this morning. and i am here with you. to cry, to yell, to hug. to wax poetic on how the left continues to fail us in forging a new path forward. this loss should not have been. and it certainly should not have been by so many votes.”\n\n“May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace,” Zegler stated. “Another four years of hatred, leaning us towards a world I do not want to live in. Leaning us towards a world that will be hard to raise my daughter in.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, the actress added there is a “deep, deep sickness” in the United States due to how many people voted for a “man who threatens our democracy.”\n\nDescribing Kamala Harris’ loss as “one that should not have been… and it certainly should not have been by so many votes,” Zegler took a moment to touch on Mr Trump’s campaign.\n\nShe continued, “It is terrifying the number of people who stand behind what this man preaches. it is a foolish subscription to a false sense of security, of masculinity, of intelligence, of patriotism, and of humanity. there is no help, no counsel, in any of them. i could go on. i won’t. i feel sad. you probably do, too. f**k this.”\n\nAlso, taking a shot at billionaire Elon Musk, who became one of Mr Trump’s most outspoken allies and has nabbed a spot on the president-elect’s team, she noted, “Get off of Elon’s app.”\n\n“I don’t use that app for a reason. He helped get that man elected and you’re giving him business,” explained the Disney star.\n\nDisney has been approached for comment.\n\nThe Hunger Games actress previously criticised the 1937 original animated Snow White, calling David Hand’s work “extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power and what a woman is fit for in the world.”\n\n“The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,” Zegler told Extra in 2022.\n\n“There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird. So we didn’t do that this time,” she quipped.\n\nAt the time, Zegler also spoke to Variety about how her version of Snow White would be about becoming a “fearless leader” rather than “dreaming about true love.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in New York Post and was reproduced with permission","summary":"After Snow White star Rachel Zelger went on an ‘unhinged’ tirade about newly elected president Donald Trump, supporters have called on Disney to fire the actress.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/disney-slammed-over-snow-white-star-rachel-zeglers-trump-tirade-unhinged-and-a-liability/news-story/2e9bd12838617c337e5acd136265b5ad?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3294d432d5bccecf7bd5a152fa4d268d","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:46:29","author":"Donald Trump","authors":["Donald Trump"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":264900624,"title":"Trump announces pick to lead U.S. attorney's office that indicted Mayor Eric Adams","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has announced his pick to lead the U.S. attorney's office for Southern District of New York — the same office that's prosecuting Mayor Eric Adams on corruption charges.\n\nTrump said he'll nominate Jay Clayton of New York, who served as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first first term.

US tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Iran’s Iran’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Amir Saeid Iravani have met to discuss ways of easing tensions between Iran and the United States, The New York Times wrote citing anonymous sources.\n\nAccording to the report, the meeting took place in New York on Monday and lasted for more than an hour. NYT sources described the meeting as \"positive\" and \"good news.\" Musk is widely viewed as the most powerful private citizen in Trump’s transition team, The New York Times said.\n\nThe Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations has declined a TASS request for a comment on the issue. Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman for the incoming Trump-Vance administration, said in a statement that the American people had re-elected Trump because they trust him to \"restore peace through strength around the world.\" \"When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary action to do just that,\" she added.\n\nWashington and Tehran could eventually conclude a diplomatic deal during Donald Trump’s second tenure as US president, despite \"the mutual hostility,\" The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on November 8. Meanwhile, officials told The WSJ that the president-elect plans to drastically increase the sanctions pressure on Iran and stifle its oil trade. Chinese ports that receive Iranian crude could also be targeted, according to the report.\n\nEarlier, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said that Iran was planning to expand partnership with its neighbors and other Islamic countries and that Tehran was indifferent to the result of the US election. Iran considers Russia to be among its neighbors.","summary":"According to the report, the meeting took place in New York on Monday and lasted for more than an hour","url":"https://tass.com/world/1872607","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:44:48","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.165},{"id":264901064,"title":"GPA supports Trump’s peaceful, pro-life world mission","text":"By Henry Umahi \n\nThe Global Prolife Alliance (GPA) has sent its vision for a pro-life world to United States President-elect, Donald Trump, saying it stands with him in his ‘life across the globe’ mission.\n\nIn a letter to Trump signed by its chairman, Dr. Philip Njemanze, the group said: “The Global Prolife Alliance stands united with you in this mission. Together, we can pave the way for a peaceful, pro-life world. The unborn children of the world were with you in spirit, and now it’s time to dismantle the global culture of death that has spread over recent decades. \n\n“This culture of death, backed by powerful global interests, has been advanced through five primary strategies: Legalizing abortion, infanticide, and widespread contraception; sanctioning same-sex marriage; redefining gender as a social construct, disregarding biological and neurological factors; controlling food security in developing nations through genetically modified organisms (GMO) crops and patented seeds and fueling religious conflicts and culture wars to mask the funding of terrorist organizations.”\n\nThe group said that in the coming months, it will address these critical issues in detail, providing a path forward for global peace, including specific initiatives to resolve conflicts like those between Russia and Ukraine, and Israel and Palestine. \n\nThere group added: “Together, we will build a future founded on peace and the sacredness of life. In Africa and across the Global South, the culture of death, supported by various multinational organizations and certain U.S. agencies, has spread through corruption and legislative manipulation, pressuring countries to legalize abortion and undermine traditional values. In Nigeria, for instance, abortion was effectively legalized under the misleadingly named “Violence Against Persons Prohibition” law. by defining “person” ambiguously and excluding the unborn from legal protection, this law opens the door for abortion without accountability.\n\n“Similarly, vague language has allowed for same-sex marriage by stating that ‘every person is free to choose a spouse.’ Further, these agendas seek to ban the Holy Bible and Holy Quran from public spaces under claims of banning books that ‘stereotype women.’ \n\n“They passed laws like the National Health Act (NHAct), 2014, which permits the poaching of human organs and ovarian eggs without consent, and the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) Act, 2015, which abolished the internationally established Cartagena ‘precautionary principle’ and permits the introduction of GMO seeds without due long-term safety monitoring.” \n\nTherefore, the GPA calls for immediate action to repeal these laws, protect the sanctity of life, and restore respect for cultural and religious values around the world. \n\nThe group further noted: “The culture of death agenda has also sought to redefine gender as a purely social construct, ignoring the science of neurobiology. Your position against gender reassignment therapies in the U.S. is grounded in solid scientific evidence that men and women have distinct neurological structures.”\n\nThe chairman of GPA said, as a neuroscientist specializing in gender neurobiology, he was the first to demonstrate “gender complementarity in the human brain.” He explained that in his study, titled “Cerebral Lateralization and General Intelligence: Gender Differences in a Transcranial Doppler Study” (Brain and Language, 2005; 92:234-239), he showed that men and women process intelligence differently across brain hemispheres. \n\nNjemanze added that this finding, later validated by American researchers, supports the biological basis of gender. \n\nThe GPA further stated: “Biotech companies are exploiting vulnerable communities, aiming to monopolize global food production through genetically modified seeds and industrial cloning of human organs. In Nigeria, they distributed cell phones with GPS tracking to farmers under the guise of “e-wallets” for accessing grants. The real aim was to track, eliminate, and replace natural seed growers with GMO seeds, controlled exclusively by these corporations and their local proxies. Biotech-sponsored agencies are now pushing for a dangerous ‘Egg-for-Food’ programme, where impoverished women may be forced to trade their ovarian eggs for seeds. \n\n“This programme could lead to widespread cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, with devastating consequences for millions of women. \n\n“Furthermore, this foreign biotech corporate agenda has fuelled violence and instability through groups like Boko Haram, deceptively linked to religious motives, to remove natural seed growers from their lands and promote GMO crops. The United States Council on Foreign Relations showed that, between 2015 and 2018, this violence led to the tragic loss of 37,500 lives (of which 32,000 or 85% were Muslims and 5,500 or 15% were Christians)—primarily targeting natural seed growers under the false guise of Islamic terrorism. \n\n“Rather, it is evident that this was biotech terrorism against the Nigerian people, with operatives from across Africa and elsewhere now being exported to the United States disguised as unvetted migrants from different countries. It is possible that, in the foreseeable future, these biotech sponsors could use some mercenary migrants in civil conflicts within the United States.” \n\nThe GPA said it looked forward to working with Trump on these critical issues and other pathways to conflict resolution, bringing hope and action toward a pro-life world of peace and justice. \n\n It sent copies of the letter to: United Head of States of all UN member countries, Nations Mission Ambassadors, Heads of States of the African Union, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Vice President Kashim Shettima, HE Senator Godswill Akpabio, President of the Senate, NASS, HE Hon.

More About Her Family Life","text":"Tulsi Gabbard has been appointed Director of National Intelligence by President-elect Donald Trump, in a series of surprising nominations to key government positions.\n\n“For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and Freedoms of all Americans,” Trump said in a statement. “I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!”\n\nThe loyal Trump supporter has had a unique political career, having previously run against President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic primaries. Gabbard was also elected to Hawaii’s House of Representatives at just 21 and made history as the first American Samoan and practicing Hindu to serve in Congress.\n\nWhile the combat veteran’s political career has been widely covered, the family life of the now-conservative has received less focus. Read on to learn more about her personal life below.\n\nDoes Gabbard Have Children?\n\nGabbard does not have children. However, she underwent IVF (in vitro fertilization), a topic she discussed during an appearance on Meghan McCain’s podcast in mid-2024.\n\n“As hard as this was for me, it was extremely hard for Abraham to watch this heartbreak over and over again,” she said, opening up about the private IVF journey she and her husband, Abraham Williams, experienced. Gabbard went on to explain that they paused the IVF process when she ran for president in 2020, and ultimately, they decided to discontinue the treatment entirely.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nWho Is Gabbard’s Husband?\n\nAbraham Williams is a part-Māori, part-Samoan filmmaker and surfer from Auckland, New Zealand. According to his IMDb page, he’s best known for his work on low-budget productions such as Decade of the Dead, Go for Broke, Angel by Thursday, and Down on the Sidewalk in Waikiki, a short poetic film about a janitor in Hawaii. His website also states he works in “diverse and challenging environments,” ranging from cities across America to war zones in the Middle East.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nBefore marrying Williams in 2015, Gabbard was previously married to Eduardo Tamayo from 2002 to 2006. In a 2013 interview with Vogue, Gabbard shared that she and Tamayo had been childhood sweethearts. She described their marriage as “young love,” explaining that they surfed together and were best friends. “His family was like my family,” she said.\n\nIn a personal note posted online, Gabbard revealed that she and Tamayo divorced shortly after her return from an 18-month deployment in Iraq. “Sadly, Eddie and I became another statistic, another sad story, illustrating the stresses war places on military spouses and families,” she wrote.\n\nHow Did Gabbard and Williams Meet?\n\nWilliams is said to have met Gabbard during her first run for Congress in 2012, when he volunteered to shoot campaign ads for her. The two bonded over their shared love of watersports, and about 18 months later, they began dating.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nWilliams proposed during a sunset surf session, with the diamond ring duct-taped to a flotation device being pulled behind them. “He paddled over, pulled out a double-tethered contraption attached to a gold duct-tape-covered flotation device with a beautiful ring attached, and said, ‘I have a question for you: Will you marry me?’” Gabbard recalled in an interview with The New York Times.\n\nThe couple, both practicing Hindus, were married in a traditional Vedic ceremony on the eastern shore of Kahaluu, Hawaii.","summary":"Here’s a look at the former Democrat's personal life, following her appointment by President-elect Donald Trump as Director of National Intelligence.","url":"https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/does-tulsi-gabbard-have-kids-5345890/","image":"https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182701891_ddb7a9-e1731618532985.jpg?fit=6000%2C3390","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:41:47","author":"Vivian","authors":["Vivian"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.17},{"id":264900698,"title":"Shut it down! Vivek Ramaswamy wants to close FBI and sack 1.5 million employees under Trump’s new cost-cutting department DOGE","text":"Vivek Ramaswamy has now been handed over the responsibility of cutting government expenses alongside Elon Musk in an all-new department known as 'DOGE-Department of Government Efficiency'. And the first thing that Ramaswamy and Musk are reportedly planning on doing is closing down the FBI that could cut off a majority of unchecked government expenses. He is also thinking of sacking nearly 1.5 million federal employees under his 'shut things down' strategy, which is already raising fear in the hearts and minds of federal workers across the country, according to a previous ET report. Ramaswamy will now have the power to shape the priorities of the new department and it will operate outside of government and provide recommendations to the White House on huge chunks of expenses from the multi-trillion dollar federal budget. This Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE was actually the brainchild of Elon Musk, the billionaire who has become one of Trump’s closest aides throughout the Presidential campaign, and has been constantly rooting for the idea of a cost-cutting commission on the campaign trail.Trump has stated that he wants to do away with the Department of Education, and leave states in control of education and schooling. Among his other top agenda, he wants to decimate his own theory of a 'deep state', where federal employees are clandestinely pursuing their own agendas, spending tons of public money for that purpose. FAQs:Is Elon Musk a Donald Trump supporter? Yes, Elon Musk is an ardent Donald Trump supporter, and has been instrumental in the entire Presidential election campaign 2024 for the Republican candidate. Is Vivek Ramaswamy close to Donald Trump?Yes, Vivek Ramaswamy is quite close to President-elect Donald Trump, and has been therefore given a very important position in the upcoming Trump administration.","summary":"Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk are now becoming the poster boys of instilling fear in the hearts of federal employees after their new department plans on putting an end to FBI itself, laying down millions of federal workers to cut down government expenses.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/shut-it-down-vivek-ramaswamy-wants-to-close-fbi-and-sack-1-5-million-employees-under-trumps-new-cost-cutting-department-doge/articleshow/115318235.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-115318231,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-21798,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:39:33","author":"The Feed","authors":["The Feed"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":264901608,"title":"Vaccine skeptic RFK Jr. vows to 'Make America Healthy Again'","text":"Washington - Robert F.

Remember, she was out being like, \"There's certainly not gonna be a prince rescuing me, I can tell you that.\" \n\nKelly said Zegler, who is currently starring in Romeo and Juliet on Broadway, would have been fired if she was a conservative who said the same thing about Democrats\n\n'Even Disney got on its heels and they're like, we're gonna reshoot the movie immediately… because there's so much backlash to her arrogance and just inanity. Well, she's back, and she's very, very upset about the Trump win.' \n\nZegler has repeatedly sparked fury with her woke views and is caught up in an apparent feud with her Snow White co-star Gal Gadot over their opposing stances on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe film has been riddled with controversy, with some fans baffled by the decision to cast a Latina actress to portray the famously 'fair-skinned' character who is known for being 'as white as snow'.\n\nOthers took issue with casting Jewish Israeli actress Gadot amid the current war - with pro-Palestine viewers claiming her inclusion calls for a boycott while conversely pro-Israel viewers claimed it was offensive to cast her in an 'evil' role.\n\nRachel ZeglerMegyn KellyDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMegyn Kelly unloads on Disney darling Rachel Zegler for her shocking comments about Trump voters\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Snow White star Rachel Zegler wished Americans who voted for Donald Trump 'never know peace' after his landslide election victory.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14084755/Megyn-Kelly-unloads-Rachel-Zegler-Trump-comments.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/14/23/92091875-0-image-m-16_1731627098617.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:37:26","author":"Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":264900660,"title":"What the Mike Huckabee pick could signal for the West Bank","text":"What the Mike Huckabee pick could signal for the West Bank\n The West Bank has seen escalating violence since Oct. 7, with Israeli soldiers pursuing militants in residential areas and Jewish settlers mounting attacks on Palestinians in land grabs.

keeping the trains running is a major job in its own right.\n\nA radical, prolonged and confused transition ordered by a guy like RFK Jr., who will use his high office to spout his controversial beliefs, leaves a lot of room for things to go wrong — and for people to wind up harmed or even dead.\n\nAll that, of course, if the Senate actually confirms RFK Jr., which will be a challenge in its own right: Republicans only have three votes to spare.\n\nDonald Trump won on promises to fix the economy, the border and soaring global disorder; his team needs to focus on delivering change on those fronts — not spend energy either having to defend crackpot theories or trying to control RFK Jr.’s mouth. \n\nWe fear the worm that he claims ate some of his brain some years ago is contagious and there’s been an outbreak at Mar-a-Lago.","summary":"The overriding rule of medicine is: First, do no harm.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/opinion/putting-rfk-jr-in-charge-of-health-breaks-the-first-rule-of-medicine/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/F1212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:36:15","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":264900638,"title":"Hyundai Motor to name global COO Jose Munoz as CEO, report says","text":"SEOUL : Hyundai Motor will name Jose Munoz, the current global chief operating officer, as its new chief executive officer later on Friday, a news report said, citing unnamed industry sources.\n\nIf confirmed, it will be a rare appointment of a foreign national to the top post of a major conglomerate in South Korea, which continues to be controlled largely by the families of the founders.\n\nMunoz has the confidence of Hyundai Motor Group's Executive Chair Euisun Chung who believes the Spanish native is the right person to lead the company based on his track record of accomplishments in the U.S. market, the Korea Economic Daily newspaper reported, citing industry sources.\n\nHyundai Motor declined to comment on the report. \n\nMunoz, who has also been the CEO of Hyundai Motor America, has been credited with Hyundai's increased commitment to electrification and growth in sales across multiple vehicle sectors.\n\nThe change at the helm of the world's No. 3 automaker by sales together with affiliate Kia Corp comes as South Korean businesses that have invested heavilty in the United States brace for President-elect Donald Trump's second tenure.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reported Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation, citing sources with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nMunoz joined Hyundai in 2019 and was formerly considered potential successor of Nissan Motor after the ouster of Chairman Carlos Ghosn.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/hyundai-motor-name-global-coo-jose-munoz-ceo-report-says-4749121","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--eD0UWnrN--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-11-15t003536z_1_lynxmpekae00i_rtroptp_3_autoshow-la.jpg?it","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:35:36","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":264900802,"title":"Robert F Kennedy Jr to be next US secy of Health and Human Services","text":"Robert F Kennedy Jr will be the next United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday.“I am thrilled to announce Robert F.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MAILONLINE REPORTER \n Published:00:33 GMT, 15 November 2024 |Updated:00:33 GMT, 15 November 2024 \n\nAs any dog owner knows, your pet growling or barking at a stranger in public is always an embarassing situation, which could potentially escalate into something more dangerous. \nSome owners even notice a pattern whereby their dog only reacts badly to certain demographics - whether that be children, the elderly, a certain sex or ethnicity - with the latter prompting them to wonder if their dog is 'racist'.\nIt's sparked countless online threads where worried owners ask for advice because their dog tends to growl or freeze when they see people with a certain skin colour. \nNow experts have told MailOnline that while it's a misconception that dogs display racial prejudice, they can react because of 'a lack of experience' with people who look different to their owners. \nCaroline Wilkinson, a Certified Animal Behaviourist, told MailOnline: 'If you are living in an area that is dominated by people identifying as 'white British' you may find your dog hasn't had a lot of exposure to black or brown people. \n'Dogs can therefore be deemed 'racist' by their guardian. However, dogs aren't acting in a hateful way in these contexts, it could just be down to a lack of experience with part of our population.'\nIt comes after Labour-run Wales was told to ban dogs from parts of the countryside to help make the outdoors 'anti-racist'. \nAccording to a report by the environmental group Climate Cymru BAME, funded by the Welsh government to help steer its 'anti-racist' policy, dog-free zones in local green spaces should be set up to make outdoor areas more inclusive. \n\nExperts have revealed what's really behind dogs' behaviour when they react to people who are a different race to their owners (File image) \n\nIf you are struggling with a new puppy, try following this simple socialisation checklist to ensure they are well-behaved and calm in the future \nA government spokesman today insisted it was not planning to act on the proposal and dogs 'would continue to be welcomed in the hills of Wales'. \nThe reason why dog-free areas would help tackle racism is not explained in the report, which will be used by the government to 'support policy teams' that are 'developing and implementing' Wales' anti-racist plans. \nHowever, speaking to MailOnline, Caroline Wilkinson, who is also the founder of digital pet coaching service Barket Place, gave some insight into why dogs could be considered 'racist'.\nShe said that in addition to dogs reacting to physical appearance, they can pick up on cues from the other person that impact their behaviour. \n'It's not always about how someone looks,' she explained. 'People from certain cultures are more likely to be fearful of dogs.\n'This can be due to religious reasons around cleanliness for example or even due to a larger presence of threatening wild dogs in their country of origin. \n'If someone is displaying anxiety or reacts in an unpredictable manner around a dog, it can make the dog themselves trust the situation - and thus that person - less.' \nClinical canine behaviourist and animal training instructor Lauren Sharkey of winniesworld.co.uk added that sometimes it's the owner making the connection between their dog's behaviour and the other person's race. \n\nLabour-run Wales has been told to ban dogs from parts of the countryside amid plans to rid the country of racism by 2030. (File image)\n\n7 things every owner needs to know about socialising your dog - and what to do if you're past the puppy stage \n\n1. Socialisation isn't something that should be rushed, says Caroline Wilkinson. Whenever your dog is having a new experience, it's important to watch their body language for any signs of stress. \n2. Pair new experiences with something positive that your dog enjoys - be that a tasty piece of food, play with a toy, having the opportunity to sniff or move their body in a particular way.\n3. Consider just how optimistic your dog is generally about experiencing something new. A healthy dog, who is feeling confident and relaxed may be more likely to find interacting with something or someone they haven't before in a more positive way. If a dog is finding new experiences difficult, then it's worth getting them checked out by your vet and then working with an ethical behaviourist to support them in moving forward positively.\n4. It's important not to overwhelm puppies during this period, says Lauren Sharkey. While they do need to experience a variety of things, you want to make sure they are comfortable while doing so and learning that those things are nothing to worry about. You can do this by letting them watch things from a distance initially and pairing things they see and hear with things they enjoy such as treats and toys. \n5. Seek professional advice if your dog is showing an adverse reaction towards certain people as an adult, especially if the behaviour involves aggression. They will be able to figure out what's going on, put a plan in place to change the behaviour over time, and support you through the process. You can find a qualified behaviourist via the ABTC website abtc.org.uk\n6. Prevent your dog from practising the behaviour as the more they do it, the more likely they are to keep doing it. You can do this by walking in quieter places and at quieter times, avoiding having visitors in the home or creating a safe space for your dog away from visitors, and by teaching them cues to move away with you when you ask them to. For some dogs, a scattering of treats on the ground when someone goes by is enough to distract them from reacting. Others will struggle if a person is too close for comfort and require more personalised advice. \n7. Do not 'overload' your puppy while socialising, says James Hare, dog trainer. \n'We know that dogs learn through reinforcement, so whilst meeting new people and people of diverse cultures is important, there is a fine line between a good amount for socialisation, and over reinforcing the need to want to say hello to every person they meet.\n'Socialisation of a puppy is about building focus on you, whether that is around other people of all diversities, other dogs, wildlife etc.' \n\nAdvertisement\n\n'That behaviour may include things like barking, growling, freezing or trying to move away and avoid the person,' she said.\n'It's possible a dog had a negative experience with someone who looked similar and has formed a negative association with people who fit that category. \n'Again, this may not be to do with race. Some dogs can be sensitive to things like people wearing hoods, carrying umbrellas or using walking sticks.\n'Puppies have a very important socialisation period that closes around the age of 16 weeks. If dogs haven't been positively and gently exposed to a diverse number of things during that period, they may view new things as a threat or may be unsure of new things. \n'This isn't just limited to people but includes everything from other dogs and animals to the sights and sounds of the areas they're going to be living in and visiting, such as traffic, wheelie bins and even your washing machine.'\nClimate Cymru BAME was set up by Climate Cymru, a larger environmental campaign group made up of 370 organisations from across Wales. \nClimate Cymru BAME consists of around 20 members made up of students and professionals who have interest in environmental preservation and protection, who work with North Wales Africa Society (NWAS), Sub Sahara Advisory Board (SSAP) and the Northwest Wales Climate Action Group.\nA separate set of recommendations submitted by the NWAS also called for 'dog-free areas'. \nIt said that during one of its focus groups, 'one black African female stated that she feels unsafe with the presence of dogs'.\nOthers also kept 'seeing dog fouling on the floor', the report added.\nThe NWAS report said that barriers to outdoor activities include the perception that growing food in gardens or allotments is 'dominated by middle-aged white women'. \nIts authors also informed the Welsh government that people from ethnic minorities were upset about the 'low quality' of local green spaces. \nOne person complained that 'the green spaces are not respected in areas where there is a bigger population of ethnic minority people'.\nOther problems flagged included lack of public transport to non-urban green spaces and poor air quality in towns and cities.\nThe report also found that some BAME who provided evidence had 'concerns of the lack of understanding and relationships by the wider white population particularly in rural areas'. \nIt added there were 'concerns of the lack of understanding and relationships by the wider white population particularly in rural areas, from personal experiences'.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: 'These comments are feedback from people who were asked their views and NOT proposals. \n'There are NO plans to ban dogs from the countryside and any suggestion otherwise is inaccurate and a complete misrepresentation of the report.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHow to tell if your dog is 'racist': Experts reveal best way to handle awkward incidents - after call for pet-free zones in Wales to make the outdoors more 'inclusive'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nNicole Kidman takes savage swipe at legendary film director Martin Scorsese\n\nLegendary Irish band join Jeremy Clarkson to perform at his new pub The Farmer's Dog leaving his famous punters delighted\n\nEXCLUSIVEFormer Strictly professional Oti Mabuse defends her decision to leave her daughter, 13 months, at home while she takes part in I'm A Celebrity\n\nEXCLUSIVEInside Rebekah Vardy's revenge plot against Coleen: Friends tell KATIE HIND details of her 'wind up' plan... and reveal truth about if she'll appear in I'm A Celeb Jungle\n\nAshley Judd, 56, was an A-list '90s movie star who worked with Sandra Bullock and Natalie Portman - see her now\n\nA luxury summer holiday for a bargain price!

They know very well how to organize big events and big sporting events.”\n\nIn 2025, the Games plan, the venues and competition schedule, medal event program and athlete quota will be finalized, which in turn will drive transportation, security and ticketing plans.\n\nIn 2026, the LA organizing committee will “get into some of the fun stuff,” Wasserman said, which includes opening up ticketing and hospitality options to the public, organizing the torch relay, creating a mascot, Cultural Olympiad and volunteer program.\n\n“We cannot wait to host the world,” he said during a news conference on the campus of UCLA, which will host the athletes’ village.\n\nWasserman doesn’t anticipate any issues working with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who was in office in 2017 when Los Angeles won its bid to host and signed federally binding documents for the government to deliver security and transportation for the Games.\n\n“Our conversations with the federal government always involve talking to folks from every party, that’s the nature of the world we live in in this country,” Wasserman said. “One side doesn’t get to dictate everything. It requires cooperation and coordination. We’ve had great success with both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we have no doubt that will continue.”\n\nWasserman and the LA organizing committee visited Paris to get an up-close view of how the French capital staged the recent Summer Games.\n\n“We spent most of our time touring the back of the house while the competition was going on,” he said. “That’s where we will learn a lot and see a lot. Producing an event on the field of play I think we have a pretty good handle on. What makes the Olympics unique is everything else.”\n\nCricket is among the new sports at the 2028 Games, as are flag football, lacrosse and squash. A cricket venue doesn’t currently exist in Los Angeles.\n\n“If we can find a place for cricket in Los Angeles, in the region, we will,” he said. “If not, it’s incumbent upon us to find the best place to produce the best cricket tournament.”\n\nSoftball and canoe slalom have already been moved 1,300 miles east to Oklahoma City.\n\n“These Games are incredibly focused on LA and Southern California and being responsible and making hosting the Games fit our city and our community as opposed to fitting our city to host the games,” Wasserman said, “which is the mistake that has been made in the past and the promise we have made to the city and the community not to make going forward.”\n\nAP Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games","summary":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The International Olympic Committee’s Coordination Commission wrapped up a three-day visit Thursday to check out selected venues and track the progress of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics-and-paralympics/los-angeles-is-on-the-clock-for-2028-olympics-with-focus-turning-to-delivery-and/article_6a8065a3-05a3-5912-8dfb-4d13b2ea96d7.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/25/d253082c-8c1c-5be5-a273-5c3ce0cb26b2/6719da4431173.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C90&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:32:36","author":"Beth Harris The Associated Press,Wire Content","authors":["Beth Harris The Associated Press","Wire Content"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.428},{"id":264900880,"title":"Did Kimberly Guilfoyle And Don Jr. Split? Many Think So After Her Absence in Kai Trump’s Election Vlog","text":"Speculation about a potential breakup between Donald Trump Jr. and his fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle is reaching new heights after a behind-the-scenes video posted by Don Jr.’s daughter, Kai Trump. The video, a detailed Election night vlog, not only provided a rare look into the Trump family’s interactions but also added fuel to rumors surrounding the state of Don Jr. and Guilfoyle’s relationship. The absence of Guilfoyle in a key family photo during the victory celebration has many questioning if this public pair has finally called it quits. Since their engagement in 2020, Don Jr. and Guilfoyle have had a tumultuous relationship, with public displays often painting a strained picture.\n\nAs per Political Flare, election night at Mar-a-Lago was filled with family, friends, and even Elon Musk, who joined the Trumps for a group picture. Oddly, Guilfoyle was missing from this celebratory picture despite being present at the event. Kai’s video showed the family eagerly awaiting results, capturing moments of Trump’s ‘Dark MAGA’ hats and lively dancing, yet there was no sign of Guilfoyle in the footage either. Given her history of loyalty to Don Jr. and the Trump Campaign, her absence from the spotlight was a curious detail for fans.\n\nAs the night unraveled, viewers noted Kai’s candid moments with her grandfather, Donald Trump, and lighthearted interaction with her family. Kai remarked, \"I'm ready to party it up tonight, and hopefully we can catch a dub…The past five days, I have been so nervous, like I feel like I've had butterflies in my stomach for so long… It's his last time running, so it was so special for him to win.\" Meanwhile, Don Jr. seemed distant from Guilfoyle during the celebration, reportedly moving around the stage as though to avoid her.\n\nViewers quickly picked up on this and noted the conspicuous absence of the woman who had once proudly called herself his ‘Mamacita.’ Kai, who frequently shares glimpses of her family life, left many fans wondering if her carefully curated content was hinting at a deeper family shift. Adding to the tension, rumors about Don Jr.’s 'wandering eye' have resurfaced, especially as Guilfoyle’s once-public affection for him appears to have dimmed. Sources say she’s been noticeably quiet about the relationship, marking a stark departure from her previous enthusiastic displays of support.\n\nAs per Daily Beast, while Guilfoyle has been a constant presence in Don Jr.’s life, especially during the campaign trail, the couple has dodged marriage questions for years. Recent reports hint at possible trouble in paradise, suggesting that Don Jr. was spotted with Bettina Anderson, a young Instagram influencer, in Palm Beach back in August, igniting rumors of an affair.

They know very well how to organize big events and big sporting events.”\n\nIn 2025, the Games plan, the venues and competition schedule, medal event program and athlete quota will be finalized, which in turn will drive transportation, security and ticketing plans.\n\nIn 2026, the LA organizing committee will “get into some of the fun stuff,” Wasserman said, which includes opening up ticketing and hospitality options to the public, organizing the torch relay, creating a mascot, Cultural Olympiad and volunteer program.\n\n“We cannot wait to host the world,” he said during a news conference on the campus of UCLA, which will host the athletes’ village.\n\nWasserman doesn’t anticipate any issues working with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who was in office in 2017 when Los Angeles won its bid to host and signed federally binding documents for the government to deliver security and transportation for the Games.\n\n“Our conversations with the federal government always involve talking to folks from every party, that’s the nature of the world we live in in this country,” Wasserman said. “One side doesn’t get to dictate everything. It requires cooperation and coordination. We’ve had great success with both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we have no doubt that will continue.”\n\nWasserman and the LA organizing committee visited Paris to get an up-close view of how the French capital staged the recent Summer Games.\n\n“We spent most of our time touring the back of the house while the competition was going on,” he said. “That’s where we will learn a lot and see a lot. Producing an event on the field of play I think we have a pretty good handle on. What makes the Olympics unique is everything else.”\n\nCricket is among the new sports at the 2028 Games, as are flag football, lacrosse and squash. A cricket venue doesn’t currently exist in Los Angeles.\n\n“If we can find a place for cricket in Los Angeles, in the region, we will,” he said. “If not, it’s incumbent upon us to find the best place to produce the best cricket tournament.”\n\nSoftball and canoe slalom have already been moved 1,300 miles east to Oklahoma City.\n\n“These Games are incredibly focused on LA and Southern California and being responsible and making hosting the Games fit our city and our community as opposed to fitting our city to host the games,” Wasserman said, “which is the mistake that has been made in the past and the promise we have made to the city and the community not to make going forward.”\n\nAP Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games","summary":"Los Angeles is on the clock for 2028 Olympics with focus turning to delivery and planning next year  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/2028-olympics-los-angeles-bc48d4f92963940cf6d1587eedc74c61","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d42ee88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7200x4050+0+375/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F23%2F4e%2Ff2145ba7f560d1bd0550fdce8a6e%2Fcfecaa08bfb4451ca18aa09e27d10064","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:31:00","author":"Beth Harris","authors":["Beth Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.428},{"id":264902096,"title":"House Republicans applaud Trump's picking Kennedy to lead HHS -- with a few concerns","text":"House Republicans had mixed reactions to President-elect Donald Trump's announcement that he would nominate Robert F.

Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, laughed when asked for an opinion, saying “It’s the president’s prerogative. I am not a senator.”\n\nRep.

Joe Biden should have announced he would not seek reelection right after the 2022 midterm elections and there would have been a contested primary such that the strongest candidate would have emerged. But inflation and the border hurt the most.\n\nBeyond that were polls showing that 70% of voters felt the country was on the wrong track, and even though he deserved to be charged for inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and the classified documents case, Donald Trump did what he does best, i.e. he “whines till he wins,, and plays the victim card, causing quite a few voters to believe he was being persecuted.\n\nArthur Straus\nWalnut Creek\n\nAmerican moderates\nneed their own party\n\nIt would solve no constructive purpose for us moderates to spend our energies blaming the current state of American politics on the progressives.\n\nInstead, we need to teach the lesson its evolution has revealed: A political party that adopts an ideology, rather than focusing on solving real-world problems, becomes a church. Its leaders become priests who shepherd their flocks according to the doctrinaire agenda of their faith. They cannot be bothered with solving the day-to-day needs-to-survive of their charges.\n\nThe curse of religion is that its faithful cannot learn objective lessons from the evidence before them.

Smith | Associated Press\n\nLong before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was building up a following with his anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children’s Health Defense, and becoming one of the world’s most influential spreaders of fear and distrust around vaccines.\n\nNow, President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates vaccines.\n\nKennedy has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. He has also pushed other conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 could have been “ethnically targeted” to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.\n\nNo medical intervention is risk-free. But doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines.\n\nVaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades — they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.\n\nKennedy has insisted that he is not anti-vaccine, saying he only wants vaccines to be rigorously tested, but he also has shown opposition to a wide range of immunizations. Kennedy said in a 2023 podcast interview that “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and told Fox News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to “resist” CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.\n\n“I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,” Kennedy said.\n\nThat same year, in a video promoting an anti-vaccine sticker campaign by his nonprofit, Kennedy appeared onscreen next to one sticker that declared “IF YOU’RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN’T PAYING ATTENTION.”\n\nThe World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years.\n\nIn a study of verified Twitter accounts from 2021, researchers found Kennedy’s personal Twitter account was the top “superspreader” of vaccine misinformation on Twitter, responsible for 13% of all reshares of misinformation, more than three times the second most-retweeted account.\n\nHe has traveled to states including Connecticut, California and New York to lobby or sue over vaccine policies and has traveled the world to meet with anti-vaccine activists.\n\nKennedy has also aligned himself with businesses and special interests groups such as anti-vaccine chiropractors, who saw profit in slicing off a small portion of the larger health care market while spreading false or dubious health information.\n\nAn Associated Press investigation found one chiropractic group in California had donated $500,000 to Kennedy’s Children’s Health Defense, about one-sixth of the group’s fundraising that year. Another AP investigation found he was listed as an affiliate for an anti-vaccine video series, where he was ranked among the Top 10 for the series’ “Overall Sales Leaderboard.”\n\nAn AP review of the book found dozens of individuals included in it died of known causes not related to vaccines, including suicide, choking while intoxicated, overdose and allergic reaction. One person died in 2019.\n\nChildren’s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.","summary":"In a study of verified Twitter accounts from 2021, researchers found Kennedy's personal Twitter account was the top \"superspreader\" of vaccine misinformation on Twitter, responsible for 13% of all reshares of misinformation, more than three times the second most-retweeted account.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/14/rfk-jr-has-a-long-history-of-promoting-anti-vaccine-views/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sjm-S-TRUMP-KENNEDY-HHS-GET_210350572.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-15 00:29:11","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":264899832,"title":"Trump's pick of Matt Gaetz for attorney general draws criticism","text":"Trump's pick of Matt Gaetz for attorney general draws criticism\n Matt Gaetz immediately resigned from the House on Wednesday following the surprising announcement that he was President-elect Donald Trump's selection for attorney general.
