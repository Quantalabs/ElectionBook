The decision, insiders caution, threatens to unleash a tsunami of controversy that could engulf the wealthy and influential. However, according to sources across the pond, it's Donald Trump who faces \"the greatest single threat\" from the file release. It comes as the other high-profile victim of the scandal, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has nothing left to give up after already stripped of his titles and banished from Royal duties. Yet despite years of playing down their association , the leader of the free world's ties to Epstein are anticipated to loom large in the documents. That's unless his name gets blacked out by his desperate Justice Department. Speculation about photographs showing the president alongside Epstein and young women, correspondence between the pair, and further revelations about their decades-spanning bond has reached boiling point. The papers due next week encompass witness statement transcripts, confiscated-evidence catalogues, and private correspondence from numerous federal probes, including material from Epstein's Manhattan residence, Palm Beach estate, and New Mexico property, according to the Mirror . During the raids, authorities confiscated 40 computers, 26 encrypted hard drives and a wealth of audio-visual equipment. \"There were enough devices to run a small intelligence agency,\" one former Department of Justice official revealed. Legal boffins suggest that the documents unearthed could shed new light on Epstein's 2008 Florida plea deal — the infamous \"sweetheart\" agreement that let him dodge severe federal charges. American analysts reckon that internal memos and communications might unveil whether officials were privy to more information than they let on at the time. They also anticipate the emergence of financial records, including ledgers, bank transfers and account documents tied to Epstein's network. \"The money trail is where the real power connections are,\" the official noted, \"those documents will make a lot of people very uncomfortable.\" British officials are keeping a keen eye on any mentions of Epstein's activities in the UK, particularly his ties to London's social scene through Ghislaine Maxwell and the former Duke of York. \"If there are specific references to addresses, guests, meetings or events on British soil, the political fallout could be immense,\" cautioned a contact from the Met police. Previously, it was disclosed that more than 300 Brits are listed with over 1,000 phone numbers and dozens of email addresses between them within Epstein's black book. Senior sources on both sides of the Atlantic have warned the Mirror that these documents could prove \"catastrophic\" for some of Epstein's most prominent associates and include far more comprehensive flight logs, visitor records and evidence catalogues than anything previously disclosed. A Washington insider revealed to us: \"This is the moment everyone within Epstein's circle has always feared. If even half of what investigators know is in those files is released, Trump will be dragged into the Epstein storm while any hopes Andrew Mountbatten Windsor had of things dying down will implode.\" However, no one stands to lose more than Trump. High-ranking US sources have revealed that these documents pose \"the greatest single threat\" to Trump's presidency, cautioning they could unveil previously undisclosed emails, visitor lists and evidence inventories \"far beyond anything ever made public\". The insider further disclosed: \"There is a reason why Trump fought so hard to keep them under lock and key and a reason why his Attorney General Pam Bondi is said to have had FBI agents working tirelessly to remove her boss's name wherever it appears. If even a fraction of what investigators believe is in them becomes public, the consequences could be catastrophic for him.\" The Royal family is also bracing for another round of embarrassment, with officials anxious that the revelations will thrust Prince Andrew back into the spotlight of the Epstein scandal. \"If the files contain what investigators know, Andrew could be dragged straight back into the centre of the Epstein storm.\" For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters .","summary":"A whole new wave of documents from the Epstein files are set to be released next week, and the results could prove to be damaging not just to Andrew — but also US President Donald Trump","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/new-epstein-files-update-cause-36388951","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article36388950.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-POLITICS-TRUMP-EPSTEIN.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 22:34:30","author":"Christopher Bucktin,Rory Gannon","authors":["Christopher Bucktin","Rory Gannon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":386933492,"title":"What role will Trump play in the battle over Warner Bros. Discovery?","text":"The fight over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery is really a battle to decide who will control much of the news and entertainment Americans consume. So perhaps it is no surprise that President Donald Trump is wading straight into the middle of the fray between Netflix and Paramount Skydance.\n\nTrump’s assertion this week that he will play a role in deciding the winner of that battle tests the “boundaries of his power,” said The New York Times. “I’ll be involved in that decision,” he said to reporters. Congress gave merger oversight authority to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said the Times, but the law does not “specify a personal role for presidents” to influence that process “on a whim or for their own benefit.” Trump is thrusting himself into that process, however, forcing executives and shareholders in business sectors far beyond the media industry to “consider the risk” that the president will get involved.\n\nNetflix won the initial bid for Warner Bros., but Paramount this week announced its attempt to bypass Netflix with a $30-a-share hostile takeover effort. A Paramount-Warner merger “could give Trump even more influence over U.S. media,” said The Conversation. The new conglomerate under the helm of mogul (and Trump ally) Larry Ellison and his son, David Ellison, would “control a vast share of U.S. viewership.” Paramount already owns, and has upended, CBS News. Adding Warner-owned CNN to the mix would “concentrate oversight of two of the country’s most prominent newsrooms” under an owner with “strong ties to Trump.”\n\nWhat did the commentators say?\n\nIt is “normal” for the federal government to scrutinize and even attempt to block a “mega-merger deal,” said Brian Stelter at CNN. But it is not normal for a president to “openly opine about it, or to say that he’ll be involved.” It is not just Paramount that understands the changed landscape. So does Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos, who reportedly met with Trump ahead of his company’s bid for Warner Bros. Trump’s involvement raises concerns about “favor-trading and corruption” and “could make the most earth-shattering Hollywood merger in years significantly more difficult to move forward.”\n\n“Let Warner’s shareholders decide,” said The Wall Street Journal editorial board. Neither the Paramount nor the Netflix offer “presents major competition concerns” for federal antitrust enforcers, but each bid should be “analyzed without political interference.” Trump’s involvement is not the “way capitalism is supposed to work,” but now businesses and shareholders are “at the mercy of Trump’s mood.”\n\nThe political battlefield over the company’s sale extends beyond the president. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is part of Paramount’s bid, said Axios. Democrats are also weighing in. Reps. Sam Liccardo (D-Calif.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said in a letter that they may “try to block or unravel any acquisition by Paramount,” said Semafor. The company’s offer is backed by sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. That creates “foreign influence risks,” said the lawmakers.","summary":"Netflix and Paramount fight for the president’s approval","url":"https://theweek.com/politics/trump-role-battle-warner-bros-discovery-netflix-paramount","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tu5VtZN2y3vWWUd2MwFPSF-2000-80.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 21:12:29","author":"Joel Mathis","authors":["Joel Mathis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.02},{"id":386932682,"title":"As US seizes oil tanker, Venezuelans focus on daily survival","text":"As the United States faces increasing questions about the legality of its military pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, this week seizing an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast, Venezuelans inside the South American nation are more focused on personal survival.\n\nOn a spotty video call from her modest tin-roofed home in Caracas, Venezuela, a grandmother describes how her routines have “completely deteriorated” in recent years. The cost of food and transportation are increasingly out of reach for the seamstress, who is being identified by her initials, A.C., for her security. Her siblings and children pitch in to keep the lights, internet, and gas on.\n\nAnd ever since the introduction of a government telephone application that Mr. Maduro says allows citizens to report “24 hours a day everything they see, everything they hear,” A.C. finds herself worrying about who she can trust on the streets. It’s a fear rooted in reality: She says her niece was detained for four months after the disputed July 2024 presidential election, which Mr. Maduro claimed he won without evidence. It was part of a government crackdown involving door-to-door raids of the homes of suspected government opponents.\n\nThe United States has carried out more than 20 military strikes on suspected drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since early September, killing more than 80 people. It is building up its military in the Caribbean, with some 15,000 U.S. troops and the world’s largest aircraft carrier now stationed there. U.S. President Donald Trump has directly threatened to strike inside Venezuelan territory and announced on Dec. 10 that the United States had seized a sanctioned oil tanker involved in an “illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.” It is the first known action by the administration against a Venezuela-related tanker since the military buildup.\n\nAlthough direct military action is at odds with international norms of nonintervention established over the past several decades, many in the region – including governments that have taken in the estimated 8 million Venezuelans who have fled growing economic, humanitarian, and political crises since 2014 – are ready for change.\n\nA.C. says she hopes Mr. Trump’s pressure on Mr. Maduro will lead to a democratic transition. For now, she doesn’t have the luxury of daydreaming about what that might look like.\n\nHer family can afford ingredients for basic meals, including meat twice a week, but “there’s no money left for anything else,” she says. She needs dental attention but can’t afford it. “It makes me feel ashamed,” she says.\n\nBut A.C. is better off than many around her. Looking down from her living room window in her hilltop home, she can see children playing outside. “After five minutes, they sit down because they don’t have much energy,” she says of the effects of the lack of sustenance. A 2025 study by Caritas found nearly 80% of Venezuelan families exhaust their savings in order to eat and more than half have gone into debt to put food on the table. Some 90% of households lack regular access to drinking water.\n\nEconomic downslide\n\nOnce a regional beacon of democracy and prosperity, Venezuela began a steep political and economic decline in the 2010s. For years, late President Hugo Chávez concentrated power and expanded military influence over civilian institutions. A a drop in global oil prices exposed years of underinvestment and mismanagement in the state-run oil sector. The crisis deepened under his successor, Mr. Maduro. The economy shrank by roughly three-quarters between 2014 and 2021.\n\nAs Mr. Maduro’s popularity slipped, the government grew more repressive, locking up protesters, activists, journalists, defecting military officers, and members of the political opposition. This week, opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has been in hiding in Venezuela since January and has been barred by Mr. Maduro from leaving the country since 2014, took the risk of traveling to Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. Her daughter accepted the award on her behalf, as Ms. Machado reached Norway several hours later.\n\nHeightened tensions between the United States and Venezuela have put the Venezuelan government on edge, increasing repression inside the country. And cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development and other sources of funding this year have created major gaps in humanitarian response for Venezuelans in need, says Ciarán Donnelly, senior vice president of international programs at the International Rescue Committee. Of 38 humanitarian organizations providing services in Cúcuta, a Colombian city at the border with Venezuela, 20 are expected to close by year’s end, when their funding cycle runs out.\n\nPublic school teacher D.Y., who asked not to be identified by her full name due to fear of government repression, says her local soup kitchen in northern Venezuela shut down last year.\n\nDaily struggles often overshadow news about U.S. military threats, D.Y. says, partly because quality information about what is unfolding off the coast of Venezuela is limited. “There’s a communication blockade – people outside the country know more than those inside,” she says. “There isn’t real information here, and a lot gets disguised.”\n\nA push for change\n\nA.C. prays for an end to Mr. Maduro’s rule. She’s hopeful U.S. military pressure could bring about change for Venezuela. “I wish it could be right now that we were done with this” government, she says.\n\nFor D.Y., U.S. escalation is one of the only remaining pathways to change. Last year, Venezuelans elected opposition candidate Edmundo González president with 67% of the votes, according to reviews of official voting tallies. But Mr. Maduro didn’t recognize the results, claiming he was victorious. “If we [Venezuelans] already did everything we had to do,” she says of voting and taking to the streets in peaceful protest, a military option is “the only way out I see.”\n\nYears of crisis have made Venezuelans resilient, D.Y. says. She keeps a small stock of food in case of an emergency – something past crises have taught her. “Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to recover and rise again,” she says.\n\nEven if, for Venezuelans, it’s been years of thinking “what more bottom is there for us to hit,” adds A.C.","summary":"The United States seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, upping pressure on Nicolás Maduro’s ouster.

(AP) — A grand jury declined for a second time to re-indict New York Attorney General Letitia James on Thursday, refusing to resurrect a mortgage fraud prosecution encouraged by President Donald Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nIt’s another major blow to the Justice Department after the dismissal of earlier charges against James and another longtime Trump foe, former FBI Director James Comey, in a stunning rebuke of the Trump administration’s efforts to prosecute the president’s political opponents.\n\nA judge threw out the original indictments against James and Comey in November, ruling that the prosecutor who presented to the grand jury, Lindsey Halligan, was illegally appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. \n\nThe Justice Department asked a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, to return an indictment Thursday after a different grand jury in Norfolk last week refused to do so. The person who confirmed the failure to secure an indictment was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n\nThe allegations related to James’ purchase of modest house in Norfolk, where she has family.\n\nJames says the case is politically motivated and has denied any wrongdoing. \n\nJames, a Democrat who infuriated Trump after his first term with a lawsuit alleging that he built his business empire on lies about his wealth, was initially charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a home purchase in 2020. \n\nDuring the sale, she signed a standard document called a “second home rider” in which she agreed to keep the property primarily for her “personal use and enjoyment for at least one year,” unless the lender agreed otherwise. Rather than using the home as a second residence, prosecutors say James rented it out to a family of three, allowing her to obtain favorable loan terms not available for investment properties.\n\nThe cases against James and a separate prosecution of Comey have heightened concerns that the Trump administration is using its law enforcement powers to pursue the president's enemies. \n\nBoth cases were brought shortly after the administration installed Halligan, a former Trump lawyer with no prior prosecutorial experience, as U.S. attorney amid public calls from the president to take action against his political opponents. \n\nBut U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie threw out the cases last month over the unconventional mechanism that the Trump administration employed to appoint Halligan. The judge dismissed them without prejudice, allowing the Justice Department to try to file the charges again.\n\nHalligan had been named as a replacement for Erik Siebert, a veteran prosecutor in the office and interim U.S. attorney who resigned in September amid Trump administration pressure to file charges against both Comey and James. He stepped aside after Trump told reporters he wanted Siebert “out.”\n\nJames’ lawyers separately argued the case was a vindictive prosecution brought to punish the Trump critic who spent years investigating and suing the Republican president and won a staggering judgment in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. The fine was later tossed out by a higher court, but both sides are appealing.\n\nAfter the Norfolk grand jury rejected a new indictment last week, James’ lawyer said, “This should be the end of the case.” \n\n“If they continue, undeterred by a court ruling and a grand jury’s rejection of the charges, it will be a shocking assault on the rule of law and a devastating blow to the integrity of our justice system,” defense attorney Abbe Lowell said at the time. \n\nComey was separately charged with lying to Congress in 2020. Another federal judge has complicated the Justice Department’s efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey, temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing computer files belonging to Daniel Richman, a close Comey friend and Columbia University law professor whom prosecutors see as a central player in any potential case against the former FBI director. \n\nProsecutors moved Tuesday to quash that order, calling Richman’s request for the return of his files a “strategic tool to obstruct the investigation and potential prosecution.” They said the judge had overstepped her bounds by ordering Richman’s property returned to him and said the ruling had impeded their ability to proceed with a case against Comey.\n\nRicher reported from Washington. \n\nAlanna Durkin Richer And Michael Kunzelman, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/world-news/justice-department-again-fails-to-re-indict-new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-ap-source-says-11612777","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/12/53daa80c43507bb27da17ea92c215b9de275ca723c4ada8b284db0303e0daa09.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 20:52:35","author":"President Donald Trump","authors":["President Donald Trump"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":386933358,"title":"Actress doubles down on Charlie Kirk comments","text":"A﻿ctress Amanda Seyfried has doubled down on her assessment of the late Charlie Kirk as \"hateful\", as the accused killer of the conservative activist faces court for the first time.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actress, who has starred in movies including Mean Girls, Mamma Mia, Les Miserables, The Housemaid, and The Testament of Ann Lee, ﻿originally commented on an Instagram post about Kirk on September 14, several days after his death.\n\n\"He was hateful,\" she wrote.\n\nREAD MORE: Time magazine names 'Architects of AI' as its person of the year for 2025﻿\n\nIn a featured interview published in Who What Wear yesterday, Seyfried reflected on her decision to make a rare public foray into current affairs.\n\n\"I'm not f------ apologising for that.

In lieu of a bra, she wore a bright purple bikini top, the pop of colour a perfect partner to the black.\n\nHeller says the woman, who wore the look confidently on her fuller figure, a push against the new wave of skinny models recently returning to fashion runways, \"looked amazing\".\n\nHeller was wearing the same sheer dress from designer Caitlin Crisp with underwear underneath, an adjacent trend where lingerie is no longer hidden but made to be seen. Ironically, it was one of the few instances of late that she wore a bra because normally she doesn’t.\n\nYou might have also seen Lorde wear a bikini top instead of a bra in her music video for 'What Was That'. Shot in a park in the middle of New York City and far from any beach, Lorde paired the metallic bikini top with loose jeans and an unbuttoned white shirt.\n\nA bikini top as a bra is part of a larger trend where women are embracing comfort and their natural shape by wearing a minimally supportive bra such as a bralette (a light, wire-free bra designed for comfort). In some cases, they are wearing no bra at all. Take the singer-songwriter Charli XCX, a close friend and collaborator of Lorde, who made a recent appearance on Saturday Night Live in a black t-shirt sans bra, her natural movement and shape, including nipple show, on full display.\n\nThe store’s most popular bra 15 years ago - a padded, underwire pushup - was recently discontinued because not enough people bought them. The trend is towards wireless bras or bralettes with a “more natural shape,” she says.\n\n“Also, people aren’t concerned as much about nipple show,” Lewthwaite adds.\n\n(The ultimate sign that nipples are in is a moulded bra with \"nipple detail\" made by Kim Kardashian's underwear line Skims so you can fake the no bra look.)\n\nFor Bella, a 24-year-old who lives near Auckland, body positivity has come from ditching the traditional underwire bra with heavy padding when she was 19. She was always self-conscious about her larger breasts - one a DD cup and the other an E - until she embraced her natural shape and movement.\n\n“It's multi-functional. I'm probably going to go to the beach later, and I'm gonna have to get changed, you know, and it's there.\n\n“And there are way cuter bikinis on the market than any bras, like for sure.”\n\nHer standard look is an unbuttoned shirt with a bikini top, likely from the brand You Swim, which boldly claims to be the “world’s most comfortable swimsuit\" It’s an ensemble she has even worn into Auckland city.\n\nFor Bella as well as Lauren Brodie, comfort is a key to their decision to ditch an overly controlling bra style, especially with underwire. Brodie is also known as the Wellington-based fashion content creator elbee. She hadn’t worn an underwire bra for years, but a strapless dress she wore a few weeks ago called for a strapless bra.\n\n“... I had literally, you know, cuts underneath afterwards because of the sticky adhesive, and it's like, for what? What am I really doing here?\"\n\nIt made her question who she was dressing for: The male gaze or for herself?\n\n“There's something about reclaiming sexuality in there too, where I'm me in my natural form, not having any additions to it, not having it pushed up and pulled together to look attractive. It's just like, ‘Take me as I am'.\n\n“I love seeing it. I love seeing the girls just be comfortable, whatever that may be, right? If that's wearing a bra, if that's not wearing a bra, I think that's great.”\n\nBrodie sees a line between women going bra-free and the current political climate, especially in the US.\n\n“Seeing certain men come into power, there is something you can definitely read into there that mirrors both the 60s and the 70s burning the bra, right?” she says, referring to President Donald Trump. He has denied any wrongdoing in the numerous instances where women have accused him of sexual assault.\n\nChallenging underwear norms has a long history in feminism and women’s liberation movements, according to Katie Pickles, a professor of history at the University of Canterbury. Often it stems from health and safety reasons, such as restrictive corsets in the Victorian era, that at times permanently maimed some women.\n\n“Symbolically, breaking away from old restrictive clothing is about embracing new, free, experimental ways of living,” Pickles wrote in an email to RNZ. That includes the era when feminists were labelled as “bra burners” later on in the 20th century.\n\nBut the current no-bra or minimal trend isn’t something only for the youth, says Emily Miller-Sharma from New Zealand fashion label RUBY.\n\nShe recently added a lingerie line to RUBY’s sister brand, Liam. The line is wireless and embraces the natural shape of breasts with limited concern for nipple show. The bras are also designed to be seen, with attention to detail on the back of the bra.

A Trump-style Republican, this move may spark fears in Europe that American support for Ukraine and traditional alliances could be at risk. According to British Labour Party politician and economist Ed Balls who served as the UK’s Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, and later as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Vance represents a new, hardline strain of American conservatism that could spell trouble for Europe if he gains more influence. On the Political Currency podcast, which he co-hosts with his once political rival, British Conservative politician and journalist George Osborne, he opened up about Vance’s play for the next presidential election. During the podcast’s “Promoting European Greatness” section of the new National Security Strategy, Balls said: “[JD Vance] made that speech at the Munich Security Conference at the beginning of the year, and that was the first time we heard the language so strongly echoed in this document.” He continued: “...That says to me this is actually a document about the next presidential election. “JD Vance is setting out stall in the same way that Marco Rubio was setting out his stall when it comes to Latin America. If you are in opposition, you have to run against the failures of the government you're taking on … and it’s very hard to run in the next presidential election against the government, because they are the government. “So what do they have to do? You have to set up a bogeyman, a threat. “‘If you elect a Democrat president, we will go like the Europeans. We'll go down the road of civilizational erasure.’ … “This is the Vance pitch for 2028.” Meanwhile, Osborne, who served as the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister David Cameron, argued it’s “a bit late” for Europe to come up with a Ukraine plan now. He said: “Where's our plan for the Ukrainian post war resettlement? … I fully applaud Starmer's attempts to try and create a common European position. “I just think it’s a bit late, three or four years on, to come up with Europe's Ukraine plan.” On the original plan, which would see Ukraine ceding further territory to Russia , Balls added: “Actually currently on the table, as far as we can see, is a substantial rolling back from that position. “As of today, who will reject this deal? It won't be Zelensky that'll reject it, it’ll be Putin because this is not a deal in his interest. “Has that happened because Donald Trump has been persuaded by Zelenskyy. Has it happened because Donald Trump and the American negotiators, in those conversations with European leaders, have been persuaded that this is a bad deal, which would not only be bad for Ukraine and for Europe, but for America too.” J.D. Vance is an American politician, author, and former US Senator from Ohio who became US president Donald Trump's vice president in 2025. Known for his bestselling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\", Vance served in the Marine Corps, attended Ohio State and Yale, and worked as a venture capitalist before entering politics. Once a Trump critic, he later became a strong supporter and was chosen as Trump’s running mate in 2024. Vance is known for his conservative views, including opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control, and has been influenced by Catholic theology.

The health savings accounts in the GOP bill would give money directly to consumers instead of to insurance companies, an idea that has been echoed by President Donald Trump. \n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said ahead of the vote that a simple extension of the subsidies is “an attempt to disguise the real impact of Obamacare's spiraling health care costs.” \n\nBut Democrats immediately rejected the GOP plan, saying that the accounts wouldn't be enough to cover costs for most consumers. \n\nThe dueling Senate votes are the latest political messaging exercise in a Congress that has operated almost entirely on partisan terms, as Republicans pushed through a massive tax and spending cuts bill this summer using budget maneuvers that eliminated the need for Democratic votes. In September, Republicans tweaked Senate rules to push past a Democratic blockade of all of Trump’s nominees. \n\nThe Senate voted 51-48 not to move forward on the Democratic bill, with four Republicans -- Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan -- voting with Democrats. The legislation needed 60 votes to proceed, as did the Republican bill, which was also blocked on a 51-48 vote. \n\nNo interest in compromise \n\nSome Republicans have pushed their colleagues to extend the credits, including Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who said they should vote for a short-term extension so they can find agreement on the issue next year. “It’s too complicated and too difficult to get done in the limited time that we have left,” Tillis said Wednesday.\n\nBut there appeared to be little interest in compromise. Despite the potential for bipartisan agreement, Republicans and Democrats have never engaged in meaningful or high-level negotiations on a solution, even after a small group of centrist Democrats struck a deal with Republicans last month to end the 43-day government shutdown in exchange for a vote on extending the ACA subsidies. Most Democratic lawmakers opposed the move as many Republicans made clear that they wanted the tax credits to expire. \n\nStill, the deal raised hopes for bipartisan compromise on health care. But that quickly faded with a lack of any real bipartisan talks. \n\nAn intractable issue \n\nThe votes were also the latest failed salvo in the debate over the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature law that Democrats passed along party lines in 2010 to expand access to insurance coverage.\n\nRepublicans have tried unsuccessfully since then to repeal or overhaul the law, arguing that health care is still too expensive. But they have struggled to find an alternative. In the meantime, Democrats have made the policy a central political issue in several elections, betting that the millions of people who buy health care on the government marketplaces want to keep their coverage. \n\n“When people’s monthly payments spike next year, they’ll know it was Republicans that made it happen,” Schumer said in November, while making clear that Democrats would not seek compromise. \n\nEven if they view it as a political win, the failed votes are a loss for Democrats who demanded an extension of the benefits as they forced a government shutdown for six weeks in October and November — and for the millions of people facing premium increases on Jan. 1. \n\nMaine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said the group tried to negotiate with Republicans after the shutdown ended. But, he said, the talks became unproductive when Republicans demanded language adding new limits for abortion coverage that were a “red line” for Democrats. He said Republicans were going to “own these increases.”\n\nA plethora of plans, but little agreement \n\nRepublicans have used the looming expiration of the subsidies to renew their longstanding criticisms of the ACA, also called Obamacare, and to try, once more, to agree on what should be done. \n\nThune announced earlier this week that the GOP conference had decided to vote on the bill led by Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the chairman of the Senate Health, Labor, Education and Pensions Committee, and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, even as several Republican senators proposed alternate ideas. \n\nIn the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has promised a vote next week. Republicans weighed different options in a conference meeting on Wednesday, with no apparent consensus. \n\nRepublican moderates in the House who could have competitive reelection bids next year are pushing Johnson to find a way to extend the subsidies. But more conservative members want to see the law overhauled.\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., has pushed for a temporary extension, which he said could be an opening to take further steps on health care. \n\nIf they fail to act and health care costs go up, the approval rating for Congress “will get even lower,” Kiley said. \n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Joey Cappelletti contributed to this report. \n\nMary Clare Jalonick, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/world-news/senate-rejects-extension-of-health-care-subsidies-as-costs-are-set-to-rise-for-millions-of-americans-11611602","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/12/34d0631f2e160028f24c051a91aac8e8e3326bfbf4bd9bacb06fdb1f3c46043e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 18:19:28","author":"President Donald Trump","authors":["President Donald Trump"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.681},{"id":386932862,"title":"England fans could be barred from World Cup if Trump does not like their tweets","text":"England fans could be barred from the World Cup if Donald Trump does not like their tweets. Supporters applying for travel visas to enter the US to watch the football showpiece face having to submit their social media activity dating back five years. Officials will then study messages and posts to see if they meet the US President’s approval. Fans whose activity does not will not be allowed to enter the US to watch the tournament. The move has been slammed by fan organisations, human rights groups and politicians who have called on football’s governing body FIFA to put pressure on Trump to reverse the measure. Ronan Evain, executive director at Football Supporters Europe, said: “Freedom of expression and the right to privacy are universal human rights. No football fan surrenders those rights just because they cross a border. “This policy introduces a chilling atmosphere of surveillance that directly contradicts the welcoming, open spirit the World Cup is meant to embody, and it must be withdrawn immediately. This is a World Cup without rules - or at least the rules change every day. “It’s urgent that FIFA clarifies the security doctrine of the tournament so that supporters can make an informed decision whether to travel or stay home.” Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch called the new entry requirements ‘an outrageous demand that violates fundamental free speech and free expression rights’. She said: “This policy expressly violates FIFA’s human rights policies and FIFA needs to pressure the Trump administration to reverse it immediately. The World Cup is not an opportunity for the US to exclude and harass fans and journalists whose opinions Trump officials don’t like.” Irish European Parliament member Barry Andrews said: “President Trump’s plan to screen visitors to the US based on their past five-year social media history is outrageous. Even the worst authoritarian states in the world do not have such an official policy. “The plans would of course seriously damage the US tourist industry as millions of Europeans would no longer feel safe - including football fans due to attend next year’s World Cup.” Under Trump’s new rule all US visitors - including those from visa-free countries such as France, Germany and Britain - would have to submit details of their social media activity before being allowed across the border. Travellers will also have to provide emails, phone numbers and addresses they have used over the past five years. The law would come into effect early next year shortly before hundreds of thousands of football fans are expected to travel to the US to watch the World Cup. America is co-hosting the tournament - which begins in June - with Mexico and Canada. Trump’s henchmen have stepped up social media surveillance at the border, vetting profiles and denying tourists entry or revoking visas over political posts. The President said: “We want safety. We want security. We want to make sure we're not letting the wrong people come into our country.” FIFA had not commented. But a source told the Daily Star the move was introduced on security grounds. “It is designed to give the US even tighter control of its borders,” they said. “It is not aimed at excluding people who don’t support the US team or don’t agree with Presidential policy. The aim is to restrict entry by people who may have expressed sympathies for enemies of the US.” A spokesman for US Customs and Border Protection said: “This is not a final rule. It is simply the first step in starting a discussion to have new policy options to keep the American people safe.” “The Department is constantly looking at how we vet those coming into the country.”","summary":"Supporters applying for visas to watch the tournament face having social media activity dating back five years checked to see if it meets presidential approval","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/england-fans-could-barred-world-36388423","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article36387808.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-POLITICS-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 18:18:43","author":"Jerry Lawton","authors":["Jerry Lawton"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.052},{"id":386932856,"title":"Trump sparks health fears as he 'freezes' on air in bizarre rant after 'passing' cognitive test","text":"Fears have once again been stoked about US President Donald Trump's health. Questions arose after the American head of state appeared to stutter and repeat himself several times during a press conference. It comes after his most recent health scare, which he even underwent MRI scans to monitor his condition. Trump had been giving a press conference live when the leader appeared to \"freeze\" and lose his train of thought mid-sentence. Viewers watching on Fox News were left shocked, and rushed to social to ask whether the president was okay. The 79-year-old president was addressing the interest rates cut, which has reduced borrowing costs in the United States for the third time in 2025. However, he also seized the opportunity to launch an attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell, known as the \"Fed Chair\", ruled out the necessity for immediate tax rises, much to Trump's dismay, according to the Express . But while this did come as a welcome respite to the government, this still failed to satisfy Trump. Speaking at the conference, he declared: \"We're scheduled to be at 4%, which is pretty amazing because we have a, er, you know, a dead head- fed... fed hair... \"I mean, this guy... the head of the Federal Reserve is a stiff.\" Rather than saying \"Fed Chair\", he repeatedly uttered \"Fed Hair\", and branded him a \"dead head\". The viral clip sparked worry amongst supporters about Trump's potential health issues , with one X (formerly known as Twitter) user posting: \"If only we had a real physician to give us a real health report!\" Another commented: \"Jerome Powell, a Republican that Trump appointed, is a stiff?\" \"Says the guy who supposedly aced the cognitive tests!\" a third replied. A fourth social media user shared: \"Does he ever hear himself speak?\" This follows Trump appearing to confirm he has undergone additional cognitive testing through a post on Truth Social. He stated: \"In addition to the medical, I have done something that no other president has done, on three separate occasions, the last one being recently, by taking what is known as a cognitive examination.\" He maintained that outlets such as The New York Times are \"pretending\" that he is \"slowing up\". He added: \"I am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true, and knowing that I work very hard.\" \"I will know when I am 'slowing up', but it's not now!\" he concluded. However, he was eventually forced to undergo MRI tests regarding \"preventative cardiovascular and abdominal checks\" due to rising pressure and speculation. In a statement, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said of the results, published last month: \"The vessel walls appear smooth and healthy and there are no signs of inflammation or clotting; overall, his cardiovascular system shows excellent health. All major organs appear very healthy and well perfused; everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits, with no acute or chronic concerns.\" For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters .","summary":"US President Donald Trump was appearing at a press conference on Thursday (December 11) when he repeatedly said 'Fed Hair' instead of 'Fed Chair' and appeared to lose track of what he was saying","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/trump-sparks-health-fears-freezes-36388082","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article36388080.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_President-Trump-Participates-In-A-Roundtable-On-Farm-Aid-At-The-White-House.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 18:00:30","author":"Jess Phillips,Rory Gannon","authors":["Jess Phillips","Rory Gannon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":386928148,"title":"The View’s Sunny Hostin compares Trump to a pirate amid Venezuela ship takeovers","text":"The View co-host Sunny Hostin has questioned Donald Trump’s motives behind ordering the U.S. military to seize a tank in Venezuela.\n\nAfter Trump escalated tensions with Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, with the controversial move Wednesday, the panelists on ABC’s popular daytime talk show suggested that the president is preparing for a war with Venezuela to distract from his own White House scandals. \n\nHostin, 57, joined her co-hosts in debating the legality of the seizure before she slammed Trump for acting this aggressively in international waters.\n\n“The piece that I don’t understand is that the President of the United States is almost acting as if he’s a pirate and the United States is just a group of pirates,” Hostin said during Thursday’s episode\n\nShe doubled down while acknowledging that a federal judge previously signed a warrant allowing the seizure: “Who are we to board a ship even with a U.S. federal judge's seizure warrant and then keep the oil? \n\n“That to me feels a lot like corruption. It feels a lot like, to me, imperialism. It feels a lot like me to fascism,” Hostin slammed. “And while it may be cloaked in an appearance of legality, I still question that.”\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin chimed in to say that the decision might have been legal, but that it was undiplomatic of the president.\n\n“We do sanction terrorist organizations and regimes that are associated with them all over the world and we do seize assets that could support terrorist activities,” the former aide to Trump explained to her co-hosts. “This is long-standing throughout the Middle East.

Speaking in Berlin, Germany, on Thursday (December 11), Rutte said war was no longer a distant concern but something “at our door”. He also cautioned that Europe risked repeating the darkest chapters of its history if it failed to act. Moreover, Rutte criticised what he described as a lingering sense of complacency within several NATO member states despite Russia’s continued aggression . “We are Russia’s next target ,” he said. “I fear that too many are quietly complacent. \"Too many don’t feel the urgency. And too many believe that time is on our side. \"It is not. The time for action is now.” He argued that Russia could be ready to use force directly against NATO within five years, adding: “Conflict is at our door. \"Russia has brought war back to Europe. And we must be prepared.” Rutte urged governments to accelerate defence spending, boost weapons manufacturing, and strengthen deterrence measures to ensure Europe is capable of responding to any escalation from Vladimir Putin . His comments came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held urgent talks with officials from around 30 nations supporting Kyiv’s efforts to secure fair conditions for ending the war. Leaders from Germany, Britain, and France were expected to join the discussions via video link as part of the so-called coalition of the willing. Zelensky suggested the talks were convened swiftly as Ukrainian officials work to avoid being boxed in by pressure from Washington. The US president said on Wednesday (December 10) that he and European leaders had recently discussed proposals “in pretty strong terms”, adding that Zelensky “has to be realistic” about Ukraine ’s stance on a peace plan that could involve ceding territory to Russia. Nevertheless, He did not provide further details. The push for a settlement has taken longer than Washington hoped. Earlier deadlines for progress passed without significant breakthroughs, and US Present Donald Trump ’s initial target for Kyiv to accept his plan before Thanksgiving also came and went. Russia, meanwhile, is reportedly seeking to show Washington that it is engaging with diplomacy in an attempt to avert further sanctions. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow had presented the US with “additional proposals concerning collective security guarantees”. He added: “We understand that when discussing security guarantees, we cannot limit ourselves to Ukraine alone.” The Kremlin has not released further information on the proposals. While political manoeuvring continued, Ukraine launched one of its largest drone operations of the nearly four-year war. Flights in and out of all four Moscow airports were suspended for seven hours, and airports in eight other Russian cities faced restrictions. The Russian defence ministry said its air defences intercepted 287 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions. Analysts say Ukraine’s ability to strike deep inside Russian territory challenges the Kremlin’s narrative that it holds overwhelming military dominance.

The merchant ship has been under U.S. sanctions “for years” after transporting “sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil called the seizure “blatant theft and an act of international piracy” aimed at robbing Venezuela of its oil.\n\nWho said what\n\n“We’ve just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela — a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized, actually,” President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday. Asked what will happen to the oil, he said, “Well, we keep it, I guess.” The ship was seized by FBI and Homeland Security agents with military backing, Bondi said. “Using U.S. forces to take control of a merchant ship is incredibly unusual,” The Associated Press said.The operation was a “significant escalation in the U.S. pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro and his country’s oil-dependent economy,” The Washington Post said. The White House did not specify “the legal authority under which the vessel and its contents were seized.” It also wasn’t clear the U.S. “had the legal authority to keep the oil,” The New York Times said, but according to one official, a “federal judge issued a seizure warrant roughly two weeks ago because of the ship’s past activities smuggling Iranian oil, not because of links to the Maduro government.” The tanker, identified as the Skipper by officials and maritime tracking firms, was sanctioned under its previous name, the Adisa, and was falsely flying the Guyana flag. Venezuela uses dozens of these “shadow” tankers to evade U.S. sanctions on oil exports, the backbone of its economy. The tankers “typically disguise their locations until long after departure” as they head to Malaysia or China, Venezuela’s top oil buyer, Reuters said. The U.S. is No. 2.\n\nThe vessel seizure was a “warning to other tankers waiting to dock and load up Venezuelan crude,” The Wall Street Journal said, citing a Pentagon official. It also “came just hours after Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado left the country on a boat, an escape that potentially gave the Trump administration an opening to take more aggressive action against the Maduro regime.” Machado arrived in Oslo last night, missing her Nobel Peace Prize bestowal ceremony by hours.","summary":"The seizure was a significant escalation in the pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro","url":"https://theweek.com/politics/venezuela-oil-tanker-seizure","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BgMfw2MkfUXdmQBGxUiWRh-2000-80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 17:10:17","author":"Peter Weber","authors":["Peter Weber"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":386932706,"title":"Judge orders Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be immediately released from immigration detention","text":"A federal judge in Maryland ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia freed from immigration detention on Thursday while his legal challenge against his deportation moves forward, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement. \n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must let Abrego Garcia go immediately. \n\n“Since Abrego Garcia’s return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.” \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was highly critical of the release order and vowed to oppose it, calling it “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. \"This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with Abrego Garcia’s attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the order. \n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. \n\nAbrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. under a court order. Since he cannot be deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His lawsuit in federal court claims Trump's Republican administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish Abrego Garcia over the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation to El Salvador.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The reference was made to the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia to and submitted affirmations that Costa Rica had rescinded its offer to accept him — later determined to be untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote. \n\nXinis also dismissed the federal government's arguments that the court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a final order of removal, noting that order had not been filed.\n\n“Thus, Abrego Garcia’s request for immediate release cannot touch upon the execution of a removal order if no such order exists,” she wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia is petitioning to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States. \n\nAdditionally, Abrego Garcia is facing criminal charges in federal court in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive. \n\nHis defense attorney in the Tennessee case, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held on the motion after previously finding some evidence that the prosecution against Abrego Garcia “may be vindictive.” The judge said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.”\n\nThe judge specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey then joined a lawsuit against HUD, arguing the changes violated administrative law and were made too hastily.\n\nThen, less than an hour before a federal court hearing on that lawsuit, HUD reversed course. The agency pulled the grant ask from its website, saying it was planning to make “appropriate revisions.”\n\nWhen U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy found out, she was not happy.\n\n“She was very, very irate with what she called a ‘haphazard approach to administrative law,'” said Katie Spencer White, the CEO of the Mid-Maine Homeless Shelter in Waterville, who watched the hearing remotely. “She admonished the government’s lawyer for not following the Administrative Procedures Act, and she said, ‘Even in cases where you disagree with the Congress’s allocation, you can’t just not pay out what you said you’re going to pay out. There is a process that needs to be followed.’ And this is a key part: She said, ‘It’s not by tweet.'”\n\nMcElroy, a judge in the Rhode Island District Court, was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2019.\n\nWhile White said HUD’s retraction of its changes gives some breathing room to service providers to figure out what to do next, she said significant uncertainty remains in the short-term.\n\nProviders across Maine must now wait for a court hearing Dec. 19 to know if they will receive emergency relief to fund homelessness prevention programs in the new year.\n\nUnder the new proposal, a maximum of 30% of the $3.9 billion would have funded Permanent Supportive Housing, a program that provides stable housing and supportive services to people with disabilities. Previously, closer to 90% of the funding had supported long-term housing.\n\n“While we’re trying to figure this out, there’s irreparable harm being caused to very vulnerable people,” said White, who also serves on the Maine Continuum of Care funding committee. “That’s why next Friday is so critical. We’re going to find out at that point whether or not we’re going to get the immediate relief. We’ll find out if we’re going to continue under the currently approved contract.”\n\nSeventy people in Kennebec and Somerset counties are among those at risk of losing their housing through the Permanent Supportive Housing Program, administered locally by Kennebec Behavioral Health.\n\nThat could exacerbate issues with central Maine’s already strained homelessness services.\n\nIn Waterville, at White’s shelter, space remains extremely limited as the city continues to enforce a camping ban.\n\nWhite said 80 people have stayed at the Mid-Maine Homeless Shelter for the past several nights; the shelter was built to house 48 people. Average stay length at the shelter has skyrocketed from 37 days in 2019 to 139 days now, she said — a 276% increase.\n\nWhile the state as a whole saw homelessness numbers decline this year, Kennebec and Somserset counties saw a significant increase, up 32% from 2024 — the biggest jump in the state.\n\nIn Augusta, proposals to build the city’s only full-service round-the-clock homeless shelter have repeatedly failed due to pushback from officials and residents alike — and law enforcement struggles to manage competing concerns from business owners and homeless people themselves.\n\nA proposal to build a shelter on East Chestnut Street was effectively shot down Tuesday by the Augusta Planning Board, despite recommendations from the Augusta Task Force on Homelessness to build temporary shelter in the city.\n\nIn the longer term, the changes proposed by HUD in its grant funding proposal will likely move forward, White said, regardless of next Friday’s decision on emergency funding. \n\nIt could take a decade for homelessness services to recover from such a shift, Dean Klein, the executive director of Maine Continuum of Care, said last month.\n\n“It kicked the can down the road in terms of funding for Permanent Supportive Housing,” White said. “That’s on the chopping block, and there’s nothing anybody can really do to prevent the administration from pivoting in this way. It’s going to cause chaos. Hopefully we’re not going to have chaos in January.”","summary":"More than 1,000 disabled Mainers, including 70 in central Maine, could lose their housing if emergency relief is not provided by Jan. 1.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/12/11/feds-rescind-grant-changes-but-uncertainty-lingers-for-maine-supportive-housing-programs/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/ethan-horton-2.jpg?w=68","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 16:54:56","author":"Ethan Horton","authors":["Ethan Horton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":386927356,"title":"Shares in AI giant Oracle fall after revenue results ramp up bubble fears","text":"In September, Oracle agreed a highly sought-after contract with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which agreed to purchase $300bn in computing power from Oracle over five years.\n\nOracle chairman and chief technology officer Larry Ellison briefly became the world's richest man after the announcement.\n\nThe firm's shares have lost 40% of their value since peaking three months ago, although they are still up by more than a third since the start of the year.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Ellison struck a cautious tone.\n\n\"There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Ellison also appeared to snub Nvidia, the designer of highly-sophisticated AI chips, saying Oracle would buy chips from any maker in order to serve clients.\n\n\"We will continue to buy the latest GPUs from Nvidia, but we need to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy,\" Mr Ellison declared in a policy he called \"chip neutrality\".\n\nOracle's earnings also pulled down shares in other AI-related technology companies on Thursday.

According to the ministry, Thailand deployed tanks, heavy artillery and mechanised units, hitting both military and civilian areas. One incident cited by Cambodian officials involved alleged Thai fire on residents of Prey Chan village in Banteay Meanchey, which they say constitutes a violation of international humanitarian norms.\nOfficials also accused Thai troops of launching shells into the Khnar Temple zone, an area already highly sensitive due to previous territorial disputes and firing additional artillery around the O’Smach border corridor.\n“Cambodia calls on Thailand to cease all military operations immediately and withdraw its personnel from our sovereign territory. Continued aggressive actions jeopardise not only bilateral peace but also the stability of the wider region,” the Defence Ministry stated.\nWednesday’s clashes alone were recorded at more than a dozen points along the 817-kilometre (508-mile) contested boundary, originally drawn during the colonial era. Local media reported that the fighting was the heaviest since a five-day confrontation in July, during which both sides suffered dozens of casualties.\nCambodia’s Interior Ministry said that residential districts, schools, transport routes, Buddhist monasteries and several archaeological sites had sustained damage following what it described as “intensified shelling and F-16 air assaults” by Thai forces, reaching as far as 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) inside Cambodian territory. Authorities accused Thailand of striking civilian clusters “indiscriminately” and of inflicting further destruction on the Ta Krabey and Preah Vihear temple complexes locations recognised as significant cultural heritage.\nAs of late Wednesday, Cambodian officials reported 10 civilian deaths including an infant and at least 60 injuries.\nThailand rejected the allegations, countering that Cambodian troops had “deliberately converted” a protected heritage site into an active military position. In a statement, the Thai army insisted that its operations were conducted “in necessary response” to attacks originating from within the temple grounds. The Thai military also confirmed eight soldiers killed and roughly 80 others wounded since fighting reignited earlier in the week.\nEach country continues to hold the other responsible for the renewed outbreak of violence, which initially flared on Monday and has since spread into five provinces on both sides of the border, according to figures compiled by AFP.\nMore than half a million civilians have now evacuated border communities, leaving large areas effectively deserted.\nThe surge in conflict comes less than three weeks after President Trump presided over the signing of a ceasefire agreement between the two Southeast Asian neighbours in Kuala Lumpur, alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

The authors of the updated US National Security Strategy (NSS-2025) adopted a sharply negative view of the European Union while outlining broad prospects for political cooperation, trade ties, and cultural exchanges with Eastern European states. However, despite this seemingly generous gesture, the \"fledgling Europeans\" - with the exception of Hungary - reacted negatively to the US strategy, viewing it as a tool of discord rather than an opportunity for sovereign development, according to a study of news reports and social media in Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic conducted by Kribrum JSC on December 5-8 at the request of the TASS Analytical Center.\n\nRoom for maneuver\n\nPolish media (43 outlets, 195 reports, potential audience 16 million) generally perceived NSS-2025 as a shocking break with the transatlantic consensus. They argued that the US is effectively renouncing its role as \"global policeman,\" downgrading Europe to third place after the Western Hemisphere and Asia, presenting the \"Russian threat\" as insignificant, and demanding that Europe assume full responsibility for its own defense - including negotiating directly with Moscow to achieve \"strategic stability,\" even at the cost of freezing the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nLiberal media critical of the US strategy accused Donald Trump’s administration of \"cynically\" shifting responsibility in the Ukraine conflict onto Europe and being prepared to sacrifice NATO’s eastern flank for its own interests and rapprochement with Russia. By contrast, right-wing conservative outlets, reflecting sentiment within parts of Poland’s ruling elite, tended to view NSS-2025 as \"cold realism\" and an opportunity for Poland to become a regional leader. Even they, however, acknowledged that the new US approach significantly worsens Europe’s security landscape and requires Poland to take urgent steps to build up its own military capabilities.\n\nOn Polish social media, reactions were overwhelmingly negative: unfavorable views accounted for 65% of the total, more than triple the number of positive responses (20%). Critics saw the strategy as a threat to NATO’s eastern flank and to Poland’s security (58%), accused Washington of betraying Ukraine and downplaying the Russian threat (52%), and condemned Trump for cynicism and for rejecting the US role as \"global policeman.\" Around 38% expressed fears of a \"civilizational decline\" in Europe and an erosion of NATO, while a quarter blamed the US for undermining EU unity and transatlantic ties. Among those who viewed NSS-2025 positively, 45% believed it gives Poland a chance to become a regional leader, 35% welcomed a blow to \"Eurocrats,\" 28% praised Trump’s realism, and 20% used the opportunity to show support for nationalists.\n\nHostile document\n\nIn the Czech Republic and Slovakia, formerly the single Czechoslovakia, the perception of NSS-2025 was nearly identical, marked by shock, alarm, and condemnation.\n\nCzech media (24 outlets, 119 reports, potential audience 5.4 million) unanimously characterized the strategy as openly hostile and ideologically far-right. Proposals to quickly end the conflict in Ukraine to achieve strategic stability and shift the burden of defense onto Europe were viewed as \"cynical betrayal\" and a \"threat to transatlantic unity.\" This outrage was accompanied by concerns about the possible collapse of the European project under pressure from the MAGA (Make America Great Again) ideology.\n\nSimilarly, Slovak news outlets (15 publications, 44 reports, potential audience 1.7 million) expressed particular anger at NSS-2025’s portrayal of Europe as an increasingly weak partner facing a profound demographic, social, and military crisis. They interpreted the strategy’s criticism of European migration policies as a manifestation of a \"racist conspiracy theory.\" Many also pointed to the uncertainty created by the US president’s \"volatile nature.\"\n\nSocial media responses in both countries were similarly heated, with negative opinions far outnumbering positive ones: 70% to 15% in the Czech Republic and 71% to 16% in Slovakia. In the Czech Republic, 60% of critics viewed NSS-2025 as a threat to transatlantic unity and NATO; 55% called it \"far-right propaganda,\" and half regarded it as a \"betrayal of Ukraine\" and \"support for Russia.\" In Slovakia, 27% considered the strategy \"openly hostile to the EU and European identity.\" Accusations against the US of \"interference in European affairs,\" \"cynicism,\" and \"betrayal\" were common in both countries.\n\nThe minority who viewed NSS-2025 positively tended to agree with its criticism of the EU and used the moment to express support for local nationalists. In Slovakia, 41% saw the strategy as a sign that Europe must solve its own problems; in the Czech Republic, this share was half as large. Nearly one in five supporters also endorsed restoring stable relations with Russia.\n\nHungarian exception\n\nHungary proved to be an outlier. Its media (14 outlets, 65 reports, potential audience 2.8 million) responded to the US strategy with noticeable approval. Many publications saw NSS-2025 as aligned with Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s vision and treated it as an opportunity for strategic rapprochement between Budapest and Washington. The media also supported the softened tone toward Russia, calling it a pragmatic shift.\n\nHungarian social media displayed a reversed imbalance, with positive responses significantly prevailing. The majority of Hungarian \"Trumpists\" agreed with the document’s claims about the \"civilizational erasure of Europe\" (70%) and the \"death of European democracy\" (44%). Two-thirds praised the US president’s \"pragmatism,\" and half argued that Orban and Trump are \"on the same wavelength.\" Some 39% supported the softer stance toward Russia and China, calling it validation of Budapest’s \"Eastern policy\" and its consistent calls for negotiations on Ukraine.\n\nAmong the few critics, most expressed distrust of Trump (66%), accused him of \"betraying Ukraine\" (40%), or criticized Trump and Orban personally (20%).\n\nOverall, the study showed that, with the exception of Hungary, which has long defended its own distinct course, Eastern European states remain aligned with Western Europe’s political centers and show little readiness or desire for change. At the same time, some of them, particularly Poland, may attempt to use the situation to strengthen their regional position.","summary":"Polish media generally perceived NSS-2025 as a shocking break with the transatlantic consensus","url":"https://tass.com/world/2057291","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 14:57:09","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.055},{"id":386931050,"title":"Esta rules, hidden surcharges and World Cup advice: Everything you need to know about US travel in 2026","text":"Tourism to the US has slumped since President Trump’s second term began in January 2025.

But in a new twist to the increasingly tricky path to America, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has announced that applicants for Esta travel permits will soon need to provide details of their social media activity over the past five years.\n\nThe organisation made the move in response to an executive order from Donald Trump demanding that foreigners should be “vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible” on arrival. CBP officers may ask to examine your phone and assess your social media activity.\n\nSome high-profile deportations of travellers deemed not suitable for admission have taken place. LGBT+ travellers, as well as those who are politically active, may have particular concerns.\n\nThese are the key questions and answers.\n\nProbably – and even if you have no immediate plans to visit the US, you should consider enrolling as soon as possible for the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (Esta), to avoid the forthcoming demand to access your social media accounts.\n\nThe Esta scheme came into effect in 2009. These essential online permits are usually granted within a few hours. The fee is $40 (£30). An Esta gives permission to travel to the United States for business or tourism for stays of up to 90 days without a visa. If you are refused an Esta, you will not be told why; CBP says it “cannot tell you the reason” authorisation was denied “due to security/privacy laws”.\n\nIf you are granted an Esta it does not guarantee entry; as the Australian government advises its citizens: “You can be refused entry if you provide false information or can’t satisfy the officials you’re visiting for a valid reason.”\n\nFor Cuba, it depends on when you were on the island. At the end of his first term, on 12 January 2021, President Trump designated Cuba a “state sponsor of terrorism”. Anyone who is found to have visited Cuba on or after this date is not eligible for Esta and must apply for a visa.\n\nIf you have been to Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen, any visit since March 2011 disqualifies you from obtaining an Esta.\n\nGetting a US visa is a long, cumbersome and expensive process. \n\nSome travellers have not revealed visits to Cuba, but instead have applied using fresh passports with no evidence of a trip to the island, and have successfully obtained Esta. \n\nUS CBP says: “Social media may be used to support or corroborate a traveler’s application information, which will help facilitate legitimate travel by providing an additional means to adjudicate issues related to relevant questions about identity, occupation, previous travel, and other factors. It may also be used to identify potential deception or fraud.”\n\nIn addition, “social media may help distinguish individuals of additional concern” – such as those whose political views are at odds with those of the administration in Washington DC.\n\nIn an executive order, President Trump instructed: “It is the policy of the United States to recognise two sexes, male and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. ‘Gender ideology’ replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.”\n\nIt is widely believed that arrivals must have travel documents corresponding to their birth gender. But the CBP agency says: “A foreign traveler’s gender as indicated on their passport and their personal beliefs about sexuality do not render a person inadmissible.”\n\nMany people find it slower (I waited 90 minutes at New York JFK in May 2025) and more thorough than before. The authorities may ask to see your return ticket or one onward to a country that is not Canada, Mexico or a Caribbean nation, and demand proof you have enough money to support yourself during your stay.\n\n“Officials may ask to inspect your electronic devices, emails, text messages, and social media activity,” the Foreign Office warns. “If you refuse, they can delay or deny your entry.” \n\nLast year, there was a one in 10,000 chance of having your social media history examined. That means from every 30 wide-bodied jets arriving from abroad to the US, one passenger will have their social media scrutinised. The proportion has probably increased. CBP says: “Officers may search a traveler’s mobile phone, computer, camera, or other electronic devices during the inspection process.\n\n“All travelers are obligated to present their electronic devices and the information resident on the device in a condition that allows for the examination of the device and its contents. If the electronic device cannot be inspected because it is protected by a passcode or encryption or other security mechanism, that device may be subject to exclusion, detention, or other appropriate action or disposition.\n\n“Additionally, the traveler may face longer processing times to allow for CBP to access the contents of the device.”\n\nThere are two levels of search, according to the CBP: “A basic search generally entails an officer reviewing the contents of the device manually without the assistance of any external equipment.\n\n“An advanced search is any search in which an officer connects external equipment to an electronic device not merely to gain access to the device, but to review, copy, and/or analyse its contents.”\n\nThe CBP says only 10 per cent of device searches are “advanced”.\n\nTravel to the US via Ireland. At Dublin and Shannon airports, passengers bound for the US are “pre-cleared” by CBP officials. You check in as usual, go through one universal security check and a separate enhanced inspection, and then are examined at what is effectively the US frontier. \n\nAny problems can be addressed while you are still on Irish soil, rather than at a US airport where you are at risk of deportation. If you are going to be rejected, better for this to happen before you have flown to the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nThe vast majority of travellers will be passed for boarding, and at the end of the transatlantic flight, are treated as domestic arrivals – with no wait, unlike the tired masses queuing for CBP checks.\n\nWith soft demand, transatlantic airfares are likely to be comfortably low away from the World Cup (see below). Wait for seat sales to secure a bargain, such as the £600 return on British Airways from London to Denver I paid for a trip in July.\n\nAccommodation, though, is likely expensive. For example, at the midrange Paris Las Vegas, a three-night stay over a quiet weekend in early February with “room type assigned on arrival”, the price (even after a “$300 online discount”) is almost £700. Part of this is the $55 (£41) per night “resort fee”, covering wifi, access to the gym and local phone calls.\n\nWhile buying a package – flights and accommodation in a single transaction – could well be cheaper, check if an additional resort fee is payable locally.\n\nYou may also encounter “two-tier pricing”. Credit card handling charges are now so onerous that some shops and restaurants have lower prices if you pay with cash rather than plastic – with a surcharge of typically 3 per cent, sometimes 10 per cent, if you insist on using a card.\n\nTipping is likely to be another big expense, with 18 per cent now the bare minimum and 20 per cent more usual.\n\nWhether or not you are attending the festival of men’s football being staged jointly in the US, Canada and Mexico, there will be an impact on airfares in June and July. With millions of fans flooding in from across the globe to support their teams, airfares will be inflated and accommodation in the host cities will be at a premium. If you are not planning to follow the football, the spell from 11 June to 19 July is probably best avoided.\n\nYes: a $100 (£75) per person surcharge will be applied for foreign visitors to the 11 most popular US National Parks from 1 January 2026. This “foreigner fee” is charged on top of the normal admission fee of typically $35 per car.\n\nThe workaround is to pay $80 (£60) before the end of this year for an annual America the Beautiful National Park pass.","summary":"These are the key factors to consider before a trip to America","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/us-travel-advice-2026-world-cup-esta-rules-charges-b2882109.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/10/18/37/98D246BA-B3EB-466A-AA08-455277283D7F_1_105_c.jpeg?crop=860.3,573.5,x0,y78.8&trim=78,163,116,0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 14:33:51","author":"Simon Calder","authors":["Simon Calder"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.137},{"id":386923928,"title":"M23 consolidates control over Congo town in blow to peace talks","text":"Dec 11 - The M23 rebel group consolidated control over the strategic town of Uvira in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, residents said, as Kinshasa warned that the Rwanda-backed advance could derail U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to broker peace in the region.\n\nThe rebels' gains bring the conflict to the doorstep of neighbouring Burundi, which has had troops in eastern Congo for years, aggravating fears of further regional spillover of fighting that has already ‍killed thousands of ​people and displaced hundreds of thousands more since January.\n\nSporadic gunfire echoed on Uvira's outskirts Thursday morning. For months, the town had served as ‍the base of the Kinshasa-appointed provincial government after rebels captured the provincial capital, Bukavu, in February.\n\nRESIDENTS SEARCH FOR FOOD\n\nDespite the tension, residents ventured out in search of food after spending the previous day hiding in homes or fleeing to the ​countryside to avoid clashes. \n\n\"The ​government told us that Uvira would never fall and that the situation was under their control,\" said Godefroid Shengezi, a local teacher. “The reality today is quite the opposite.”\n\nShengezi said he had been unable to locate his three young children and feared they had crossed the nearby border into Burundi, where officials say they have received tens of thousands of refugees in recent days.\n\nThe rebel coalition called the Alliance Fleuve Congo, ‍which includes the M23, said Uvira residents were safe and could resume their activities in the town.\n\nWAR SPILLOVER FEARED\n\nUvira, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, had until this week served as the headquarters of the ​Kinshasa-appointed government in South Kivu province and its regional military base since the provincial capital, Bukavu, ⁠fell to M23 in February. Control of Uvira could open the way for the rebels to advance beyond South Kivu.\n\nThe town is positioned on the border with Burundi, just 30km (18.6 miles) from that country's largest city, Bujumbura. \n\nBurundian soldiers initially deployed to Congo to hunt down Burundian rebels there, but they have more recently aided in the fight against M23. Until early February, Burundi had between 10,000-12,000 men fighting in eastern Congo on the side of government forces, according to analysts and diplomats, though that number ​has since fallen considerably.\n\nM23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said on X on Thursday that some remaining Burundian forces had withdrawn this week while others had entrenched themselves in the mountainous Hauts Plateaux area of South Kivu province, where they were \"launching bombs and using ‌heavy artillery\" that was killing civilians.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the claim and Burundi's government ​did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA U.N. official told Reuters that while M23 wants the Burundians to leave South Kivu province completely, they are unlikely to enter Burundi itself and would instead pursue a diplomatic solution, knowing that Burundi depends heavily on Uvira for essential supplies including fuel.\n\nNearly 25,000 people crossed from Congo into Burundi between December 5 and December 8, U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq told a briefing on Wednesday.\n\nA senior army officer told Reuters that the Gatumba border post near Uvira was closed and that refugees were coming by river.\n\nPEACE PROCESS UNDER THREAT\n\nThe latest breakthrough in M23's advance in mineral-rich eastern Congo comes a week after Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame met Trump in Washington and affirmed their commitment to a U.S.-brokered peace deal.\n\nIn a statement late on Wednesday, the Congolese government called for the international community to take \"urgent measures\" to ensure compliance with ‍the deal, saying that \"Rwandan aggression\" was jeopardising it. \n\nThe United Nations said this week that some 200,000 people had fled their homes in recent days and scores of civilians had been killed.\n\nCongo's Foreign Minister Therese ​Kayikwamba Wagner told Reuters this week that the United States should consider expanding sanctions on Rwandan individuals and the military.\n\nRwanda denies backing M23 and has blamed Congolese and Burundian forces for the renewed fighting.\n\nM23 is not party to the Washington-mediated negotiations. It has ​been participating in a separate, parallel round of talks with the Congolese government, hosted by Qatar. \n\nThe fall of Uvira to M23 underscores that durable peace ‌in a region wracked by conflict for decades is still far off, said Jervin Naidoo of Oxford Economics.\n\n“The (U.S.-brokered) DRC–Rwanda deal fails to address the structural drivers of the conflict and crucially excludes M23, highlighting a fundamental flaw: lasting peace cannot be achieved without including the armed group at the negotiation table,\" Naidoo ‌said.

Yet today, they play a major role in U.S. economic policy, affecting the prices of everything from groceriesto autosto holiday gifts, as well as the outlook for unemployment, inflation and even recession.\n\nI'm an economist who studies trade policy, and I've found that many people have questions about tariffs. This primer explains what they are, what effects they have, and why governments impose them.\n\nWhat are tariffs, and who pays them?\n\nTariffs are taxes on imports of goods, usually for purposes of protecting particular domestic industries from import competition. When an American business imports goods, U.S. Customs and Border Protection sends it a tariff bill that the company must pay before the merchandise can enter the country.\n\nBecause tariffs raise costs for U.S. importers, those companies usually pass the expense on to their customers by raising prices. Sometimes, importers choose to absorb part of the tariff's cost so consumers don't switch to more affordable competing products. However, firms with low profit margins may risk going out of business if they do that for very long. In general, the longer tariffs are in place, the more likely companies are to pass the costs on to customers.\n\nImporters can also ask foreign suppliers to absorb some of the tariff cost by lowering their export price. But exporters don't have an incentive to do that if they can sell to other countries at a higher price.\n\nStudies of Trump's 2025 tariffs suggest that U.S. consumers and importers are already paying the price, with little evidence that foreign suppliers have borne any of the burden. After six months of the tariffs, importers are absorbing as much as 80% of the cost, which suggests that they believe the tariffs will be temporary. If the Supreme Court allows the Trump tariffs to continue, the burden on consumers will likely increase. \n\nWhile tariffs apply only to imports, they tend to indirectly boost the prices of domestically produced goods, too. That's because tariffs reduce demand for imports, which in turn increases the demand for substitutes. This allows domestic producers to raise their prices as well. \n\nA brief history of tariffs\n\nThe U.S. Constitution assigns all tariff- and tax-making power to Congress. Early in U.S. history, tariffs were used to finance the federal government. Especially after the Civil War, when U.S. manufacturing was growing rapidly, tariffs were used to shield U.S. industries from foreign competition. \n\nThe introduction of the individual income tax in 1913 displaced tariffs as the main source of U.S. tax revenue. The last major U.S. tariff law was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which established an average tariff rate of 20% on all imports by 1933.\n\nThose tariffs sparked foreign retaliation and a global trade war during the Great Depression. After World War II, the U.S. led the formation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, which promoted tariff reduction policies as the key to economic stability and growth. As a result, global average tariff rates dropped from around 40% in 1947 to 3.5% in 2024. The U.S. average tariff rate fell to 2.5% that year, while about 60% of all U.S. imports entered duty-free. \n\nWhile Congress is officially responsible for tariffs, it can delegate emergency tariff power to the president for quick action as long as constitutional boundaries are followed. The current Supreme Court case involves Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to unilaterally change all U.S. general tariff rates and duration, country by country, by executive order. The controversy stems from the claim that Trump has overstepped his constitutional authority granted by that act, which does not mention tariffs or specifically authorize the president to impose them.\n\nThe pros and cons of tariffs\n\nIn my view, though, the bigger question is whether tariffs are good or bad policy. The disastrous experience of the tariff war during the Great Depression led to a broad global consensus favoring freer trade and lower tariffs. Research in economics and political science tends to back up this view, although tariffs have never disappeared as a policy tool, particularly for developing countries with limited sources of tax revenue and the desire to protect their fledgling industries from imports.\n\nYet Trump has resurrected tariffs not only as a protectionist device, but also as a source of government revenue for the world's largest economy. In fact, Trump insists that tariffs can replace individual income taxes, a view contested by most economists.\n\nMost of Trump's tariffs have a protectionist purpose: to favor domestic industries by raising import prices and shifting demand to domestically produced goods. The aim is to increase domestic output and employment in tariff-protected industries, whose success is presumably more valuable to the economy than the open market allows. The success of this approach depends on labor, capital and long-term investment flowing into protected sectors in ways that improve their efficiency, growth and employment.\n\nCritics argue that tariffs come with trade-offs: Favoring one set of industries necessarily disfavors others, and it raises prices for consumers. Manipulating prices and demand results in market inefficiency, as the U.S. economy produces more goods that are less efficiently made and fewer that are more efficiently made. In addition, U.S. tariffs have already resulted in foreign retaliatory trade actions, damaging U.S. exporters.\n\nTrump's tariffs also carry an uncertainty cost because he is constantly threatening, changing, canceling and reinstating them. Companies and financiers tend to invest in protected industries only if tariff levels are predictable. But Trump's negotiating strategy has involved numerous reversals and new threats, making it difficult for investors to calculate the value of those commitments. One study estimates that such uncertainty has actually reduced U.S. investment by 4.4% in 2025. \n\nA major, if underappreciated, cost of Trump's tariffs is that they have violated U.S. global trade agreements and GATT rules on nondiscrimination and tariff-binding. This has made the U.S. a less reliable trading partner. The U.S. had previously championed this system, which brought stability and cooperation to global trade relations. Now that the U.S. is conducting trade policy through unilateral tariff hikes and antagonistic rhetoric, its trading partners are already beginning to look for new, more stable and growing trade relationships. \n\nSo what's next? Trump has vowed to use other emergency tariff measures if the Supreme Court strikes down his IEEPA tariffs. So as long as Congress is unwilling to step in, it's likely that an aggressive U.S. tariff regime will continue, regardless of the court's judgment. That means public awareness of tariffs ⁠– and of who pays them and what they change ⁠– will remain crucial for understanding the direction of the U.S. economy.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

The newsletter comes out twice a week (most of the time) and provides behind-the-scenes stories and articles about politics, media, and culture. Subscribing costs just $5 a month—but you can sign up for a free 30-day trial.\n\nFor over a decade—!!!—Donald Trump has defied political gravity. After descending that Trump Tower elevator surrounded by fake supporters who had been paid to attend his campaign announcement, Trump pulled one disqualifying move after another. He insulted war hero John McCain. He mocked a reporter with a physical disability. He made crass and crude comments. He lied relentlessly. He celebrated fringe players like conspiracy theory–monger Alex Jones. And with each of these misdeeds and missteps, the pundits declared he was kaput. But he wasn’t. Not even after the grab-’em-by-the-pussy videotape.\n\nTrump was able to survive gaffes, controversies, and scandals that would blow away any other politician. In part that was because, as one of his early advisers told me, being an asshole was part of his appeal. It was baked into the cake. How many times since he was first elected president has a commentator said—or you thought—in response to some Trump outrage, no other politicians could get away with this? That includes bear-hugging Vladimir Putin, mismanaging the Covid epidemic (which led to avoidable deaths of tens of thousands of Americans), his first impeachment, his effort to overturn a legitimate election to retain power, his incitement of political violence that aimed to destroy American democracy, and the countless instances of grift and graft he and his clan have perpetrated.\n\nIt seemed that the rules of politics and public life did not apply to Trump. Yes, he lost the 2020 election, but he resurrected himself—yet again defying the conventional wisdom following the January 6 riot that he was finished politically.\n\nTrump still survives revelations and scandals that would destroy past presidencies—swiping classified documents, paying off a porn star. But the good news is that this does not mean that the political universe has been permanently upended. In recent weeks, there have been signs that political gravity does still exist and that we are not adrift in a cosmos free of all rules.\n\nThe most obvious indicator was the off-year elections. History suggested that Democrats would fare well, given Trump’s falling approval numbers and still-too-high prices. And they did, even better than expected in many places. (See Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, and Eileen Higgins, who this week became the first Democrat to be elected Miami mayor in three decades.) Beyond those electoral returns, we are seeing other normal political occurrences.\n\nTrump is technically a lame duck president. Given his hold on the GOP, which he has turned into a cult of personality, it might be expected that he could escape this diminished status and still dominate. And, mostly, that’s so. But there have been a few whiffs of Republican restiveness. His illegal military attacks on suspected drug boats prompted a few Hill Republicans to ask questions and even suggest the need for an investigation. That might not lead to a full-fledged inquiry. But it’s the most pushback we’ve seen from the GOP. And a handful of congressional Republicans have hinted that they are concerned by the dramatic hike in health insurance premiums that’s about to hit because Trump and the GOP killed the extended subsidies for Obamacare policies. Again, there’s no open rebellion—except for Marjorie Taylor Greene—but the 100 percent obeisance of the GOP has dropped a point or two.\n\nThen there’s MAGA. As historians of political movements will note, none of them live forever. The tea party, BLM, Occupy, the nuclear freeze—eventually they lose steam and develop fractures; leadership fights and disagreements cause fissures and sometimes cannibalistic internal conflicts. We’re witnessing that with MAGA now. There have been numerous splits and disagreements these past few months, with almost a civil war over the release of the Epstein files (and that may still transpire, depending on what the Trump administration does in response to the new law that compels the release of these documents).\n\nMAGA world had a major brawl over Tucker Carlson’s friendly and supportive interview with Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist and Hitler fanboy. On the right, there’s been a pitched battle regarding support for Israel. The aforementioned Greene, once a MAGA favorite, has cast herself out of Trump’s circle of trust after tussling with him over the Epstein records and calling Israel’s war on Gaza “genocide” and voicing worry over rising health insurance premiums. The manosphere—Joe Rogan and the army of Rogan-wannabes—have groused about the ICE raids going too far, especially when they round up day laborers outside Home Depot who are simply looking for work. Steve Bannon, the grand strategist of MAGA, is not happy Trump is handing Big Tech a blank check. \n\nTo get a sense of the insane vitriol and vituperation within MAGA land these days, check out this recent tweet from Laura Loomer, the avenging angel of Trumptown:\n\nI don’t have the time, energy, or inclination to dissect and process this particular feud—for you or for me. But the point is clear: These people are nuts, and the internecine bloodlust is high.\n\nI’m sure I’m forgetting some of the other fractures that have arisen recently. But MAGA is behaving in a familiar manner, with grifters and ideologues vying for attention, money, and turf. Trump won’t be around forever, and there’s scrambling for positioning in the post-Trump era. That’s true within the GOP for those who yearn to run in 2028, presuming there will be an election, and it’s also true for those who want to claim the MAGA mantle next. These may be separate power struggles.\n\nHere’s another sign of the reassertion of political gravity. After Trump won the election a year ago, there was much blathering about a strategic realignment in politics. He had increased his share of votes among Latinos, Blacks, and young people, especially men in these categories. Republicans were giddy, believing Trump had cracked a code that would bring these traditionally Democratic voters into the GOP coalition permanently. That was then. In the elections last month, these voters switched back to the Ds, even and especially young men. No, Trump did not deliver a history-defying permanent shift in electoral politics. It now looks like there’s a regression to the mean.\n\nThat brings us to Trump’s poll numbers. Cheap analysis focuses on this standard marker. But it shows us that Trump is not a supernatural politician. In recent decades, all presidents decline in popularity after they enter office. Trump is following that pattern—and more so. His approval rating, according to the latest Gallup poll, has plummeted to 36 percent, with disapproval hitting 60 percent. Some surveys have Trump a few points higher on approval. Yet it’s evident he’s getting close to hitting his floor.\n\nMy unscientific guesstimate is that about 30 to 35 percent of the nation fully buys Trump’s bunk. They believe his bullshit—America’s about to be destroyed by migrants; radical lunatics, commies, antifa, Democrats, and the media are scheming to annihilate the nation; the Deep State is out to sabotage Trump; and only Trump, the smartest, strongest, and most noble man in human history, can save the US of A. No matter what happens, they will stand by their man.\n\nYet the rest of the nation is not cottoning to his mass deportation crusade, his economic policies, his razing of the East Wing, his revenge-infused implementation of authoritarianism, his brazen corruption, his plutocratic policies, and his never-ending nastiness. It’s not wearing well. If you do a lot of crap that’s unpopular, you won’t be popular. That’s a rather basic rule of politics, and Trump is not escaping that. And Republicans, naturally, are wigged out that one of the major historical trends of American politics will likely hold next year: The president’s party gets socked in midterm elections.\n\nIt’s far too early to make any predictions. External circumstances can always change any political equation. What happens if there’s a war in Venezuela? Or if the White House can find a trans migrant who commits a heinous crime? And we all ought to worry about Trump and his crew concocting ways to screw with next year’s elections.\n\nDon’t put on any rose-colored glasses. Trump has done so much harm and damage. According to Impactcounter.com, the ending of US foreign assistance and the demolition of USAID has led to nearly 700,000 deaths, including the deaths of 451,000 children. There’s still much harm and damage to come, here and abroad. But it is reassuring that the laws of politics remain partially intact. Trump, the GOP, and MAGA are not immune. But their opponents need to keep in mind that these vulnerabilities do not predetermine a downfall; they only provide an opportunity for a fight.","summary":"A version of the below article&#160;first appeared&#160;in David Corn’s newsletter,&#160;Our Land.&#160;The newsletter&#160;comes out twice a week (most of the time) and provides behind-the-scenes stories and articles about politics, media, and culture.

The details of the said operation was shared by POTUS Donald Trump during a press meet at the White House, with the prez calling the tanker the “largest one seized”, BBC reported. \"We have just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela - a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.US agencies lead major seizure operationAttorney General Pam Bondi released the video of the incident, and claimed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the US Coast Guard co-ordinated the seizure.“Today, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and the United States Coast Guard, with support from the Department of War, executed a seizure warrant for a crude oil tanker used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations. This seizure, completed off the coast of Venezuela, was conducted safely and securely—and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues,” she wrote on X. Tanker seizure sparks strong Venezuelan reactionThe video of the seizure shows soldiers roping down two army helicopters atop the deck of the Venezuelan carrier, and rushing through to the insides of the ship to complete the seizure. The escalation is expected to further ruffle Venezuelan prez Nicolás Maduro’s feathers, who has been on the receiving end of an offensive by the US in the past few months over its suspected involvement in funnelling drugs into the country. Live EventsCaracas called it an act of “international piracy”, condemning the operation. The BBC reported that the helicopters came aboard USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, along with 10 coast guards and 10 marines. The seized ship was recognised as ‘Skipper’ by Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech, BBC said in its report. As per BBC, the Skipper was banned by US Treasury as early as 2022, after it suspected it of facilitating oil smuggling which financed Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.FAQsQ1.

The Russian side has submitted additional proposals regarding collective security guarantees to the United States, Russia’s top diplomat Sergey Lavrov stated at a roundtable discussion on Ukraine with ambassadors.\n\nThe ongoing Russia-US talks are aimed at finding a long-term solution to end the Ukraine conflict, he noted.\n\nTASS has compiled the key takeaways from statements by the Russian foreign minister.\n\nSpeculations around Ukraine conflict\n\nRussia has recorded multiple bogus news and speculations about Ukraine, Lavrov said. \"We believe that such actions initiated by our Western colleagues are mostly aimed at hampering efforts to find a solution at talks and prolong the conflict,\" he stated.\n\nBy doing so, Lavrov continued, the Europeans are actually disrupting US President Donald Trump’s initiatives \"to find a way out that would help remove the root causes of the Ukraine crisis.\"\n\nWestern policies\n\nWestern countries are attempting to use the Ukraine conflict to distract attention from Palestine and other challenging issues facing the global community.\n\nNobody in Europe \"mentions the root causes\" of the Ukraine conflict or the need to remove those: \"They only demand an immediate ceasefire to give Ukraine and them, the Europeans, some respite and win time to at least somehow support the Kiev regime with weapons and money.\"\n\nThe West is running out of resources for waging a proxy war against Moscow.\n\nA \"blitzkrieg\" against Russia, plotted by the West with Ukrainian involvement, has failed.\n\nEurope would like to \"sow seeds of a new conflict\" right now as it has publicly indicated that it is getting ready for that.\n\nA \"militaristic frenzy\" reigns in Europe today, and if they decide to go to war, Russia is ready \"at the drop of a hat.\"\n\nThe West did not react in any way to Ukraine’s decision to suspend negotiations with Moscow, nor did it try to prod the Kiev regime into at least creating the impression of a readiness for political regulation.\n\nRussia welcomes the proactive stance and efforts by the minority in the West toward negotiations on resolving the Ukraine conflict: \"We appreciate both these efforts and willingness by a number of our partners to provide a venue for these contacts.\"\n\nThe ideas being cherished by Europe \"will not be useful\" for negotiations on Ukraine.\n\nEurope is now ready to resort to \"any kind of deception\" against Russia.\n\nRussia-US talks\n\nThe ongoing talks between Russia and the United States are dedicated to \"finding a long-term solution to remove the root causes\" of the Ukraine conflict.\n\nTrump sincerely seeks ways to resolve the Ukrainian conflict through political and diplomatic methods: \"We welcome this.\"\n\nDuring their most recent meeting in the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff cleared up all misunderstandings between Moscow and Washington: \"This was an extremely important result, because there was a certain impasse following the summit in Anchorage.\"\n\nThe Americans are interested in \"understanding the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis, and that was reflected during the meeting of Presidents Putin and Trump in Anchorage on August 15: mutual understandings were reached there, which we stand by and believe can serve as a starting point for a settlement.\"\n\nThe understanding reached by Moscow and Washington on Ukraine is that it must return to neutrality and non-nuclear and non-aligned status.\n\nSecurity guarantees\n\nRussia has submitted additional proposals regarding collective security guarantees to the United States: \"We understand that when discussing security guarantees, we cannot focus on Ukraine alone.\"\n\nRussia harbors no aggressive plans against NATO members or EU countries and is thus ready to enter into written pacts with them to this effect: \"Of course, on a collective, mutual basis.\"\n\nThe West has chosen to consider Russia as a perpetual enemy as it has \"resolutely\" refused to provide mutually binding security guarantees.\n\nThe media leaks on contacts between Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States reveal that Kiev seeks security guarantees for itself alone: \"As I have already said, if these leaks are accurate, they show that the Europeans are mainly focused on pressuring the Americans to provide security guarantees for Ukraine while ignoring all Russian security interests, and on scraping up some money for the Ukraine reconstruction fund.\"\n\nCasualties sustained by Ukrainian troops\n\nUkrainian casualties from the conflict have exceeded one million and are still mounting: \"The Kiev regime, originally established as a fiercely ideological military entity, has now devolved into a criminal gang.\"\n\nMoscow has handed over more than 11,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers to Kiev and, in return, it has received 201 Russian bodies.\n\nAbout Zelensky\n\nProlonging the conflict has become a matter of \"political, and perhaps even physical, survival\" for Vladimir Zelensky.\n\nZelensky has disregarded the protection of national minority rights, enshrined in the Ukrainian Constitution, while speaking on the inadmissibility of ceding territories.\n\nZelensky and European leaders aim to hinder Trump’s efforts toward a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict.\n\nAbout potential seizure of Russian assets\n\nThe European Union must understand that it will have to take very serious responsibility for the confiscation of frozen Russian assets in Europe.","summary":"The ongoing Russia-US talks are aimed at finding a long-term solution to end the Ukraine conflict, the Russian foreign minister

He's imposed double-digit tariffs on almost every country on earth. According to Yale University's Budget Lab, the average US tariff has shot up from 2.4 percent at the beginning of the year to 16.8 per cent, the highest since 1935.The president argues that the import taxes will protect US industries from unfair foreign competition, bring factories to the United States and raise money for the Treasury.Live Events\"President Trump's tariffs have actually secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America as well as historic trade deals that finally level the playing field for American workers and industries,\" said White House Spokesman Kush Desai. \"Democrats spent decades complaining about lopsided trade deals undermining the American working class, and now they're complaining about the one president who has done something about it.\" The taxes are paid by importers who typically attempt to pass along the higher costs to their customers.Democrats did well in elections last month in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere largely because voters blame Trump and the Republicans for the high cost of living, just as they'd blamed Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for the same thing a year earlier.Economist Kimberly Clausing of the UCLA School of Law and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, last week told a House subcommittee that Trump's tariffs amount to \"the largest tax increase on American consumers in a generation, lowering standards of living for all Americans.'' Clausing, a Treasury Department tax official in the Biden administration, has calculated that Trump's import taxes \"amount to an annual tax increase of about USD 1,700 for an average household.''

Seven in 10 Latinos who voted for Trump said they approve of his approach to immigration, down from 74% in June, the survey found.\n\n'Latinos are increasingly pessimistic' about their situation\n\nThe survey's results show weakening support among Latinos who voted for Trump in 2024 and stronger disapproval among Latinos who did not support him heading into the midterm 2026 elections, Noe-Bustamante said.\n\nIn 2024, nearly half (48%) of Latino voters backed Trump, up from 36% in 2020 and 28% in 2016, according to Pew.\n\n\"We found that Latinos are increasingly pessimistic about, yes, the Trump administration but also the direction of the country and their situation as a group,\" Noe-Bustamante said.\n\nNotably, nearly seven out of 10 Latinos said they were worse off as a group than they were a year ago, the survey found. That is the first time in nearly two decades that a majority of Latinos said that as a group, Latinos were worse off than the previous year, Noe-Bustamante said.\n\nThe survey of 8,046 adults included 4,923 Latinos and was conducted Oct. 6-16.

Janae Shamp, a Republican from Surprise, would prohibit any person or governmental entity \"from adding fluoride into a public water system or any water that will be introduced into a public water system.\"\n\n\"Adding fluoride to public water supplies amounts to mass medication of our population without informed consent or the ability to opt out,\" Shamp told The Republic in a text message. \"Unlike voluntary measures like fluoride toothpaste or dental treatments, this forces every Arizonan — from infants to the elderly — to ingest a chemical they may not need or want.\"\n\nRegina Cobb, a former Republican state representative and the current executive director of the Arizona Dental Association, called the bill \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Many studies\" show fluoride's benefits. Its prohibition in Calgary, Canada, in 2011 resulted in increased levels of tooth decay, she said. The city of Calgary reintroduced fluoride to its water this year.\n\n\"You think our AHCCCS bill is not going to go up, you're crazy, because it is,\" she said, referring to the state's health care system that's funded with state and federal money. \"So now we're going to put all of our children at risk.\"\n\nShamp's bill follows the implementation of similar bans in Utah and Florida in May. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also called for an end to community water fluoridation and told Utah officials in April \"it makes no sense to have it in our water supply.\"\n\nSince being picked by President Donald Trump to lead the country's health agency, Kennedy has been criticized by doctors and scientists over his medical conspiracy theories, including discredited links of Tylenol and vaccines to autism. His censure of fluoride came after a study showed the chemical at high levels could cause cognitive decline in children, and he directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to review its effects.\n\nThe 2024 study by the National Toxicology Program, an agency affiliated with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was \"based primarily on epidemiology studies in foreign countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico.\" A summary on the agency's website highlighted how the study wasn't able to determine if the level of fluoride recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is 0.7 milligrams per liter, is harmful to a child's IQ.\n\nBecause fluoride can be present in natural water sources and is toxic in high doses, the EPA sets a limit of 4 milligrams per liter in water supplies. An EPA review in 2015 resulted in the current standard for intentional water fluoridation meant to lower the rate of dental cavities, lowering the standard of 0.8 to 1.2 milligrams per liter that had been in place since 1962.\n\n\"The agency is thoroughly reviewing the NTP report and the other latest gold-standard science to support the EPA’s expedited reconsideration of the current standard,\" the agency told The Arizona Republic after an inquiry to EPA spokesperson Michael Alpern.\n\nShamp, an operating nurse in her second term as a state senator, has made health care a legislative priority and is a Kennedy supporter. But her ideas sometimes run afoul of mainstream science. In 2023, she chaired the Arizona Senate’s Novel Coronavirus Southwestern Intergovernmental Committee, an event that brought unscientific information to the public.\n\nIf fluoride's addition to water is supposed to protect health, \"Why not vaccinate water? Why not add multivitamins to water?\" Shamp said. \"If the policy goal is to prevent tooth decay, then offer people dental services.\"\n\nAsked about how municipal water supplies mix in chlorine, a toxic chemical that in low levels kills germs, Shamp said that was \"off topic.\"\n\nThe city of Phoenix has added fluoride to its water system since 1990, a practice that \"aligns with guidance from public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" Michael Gertzman, spokesperson for the Phoenix Water Services Department, told The Republic in an email.\n\n\"Phoenix maintains fluoride levels at 0.7 parts per million, which is the optimal concentration recommended by the CDC. The city routinely tests its water supply to ensure compliance with all federal and state drinking water standards,\" he said.\n\n Reach the reporter at rstern@arizonarepublic.com or 480-276-3237.

The episode, titled “The Crap Out”, brought back the Satan-worshipping Woodland Critters from 2014 episode “Woodland Critter Christmas”.\n\nThe story appeared to be heading for a showdown after Satan learned of Trump’s plans to abort the child, along with his infidelities with Vance, from Towelie, a fan-favorite character who dates back to 2001. Trump, Vance and Peter Thiel then joined forces with Jesus Christ in an attempt to prevent the birth of the Antichrist.\n\nBut in a last-minute twist it was revealed that the fetus had apparently killed itself while still in the womb. In a direct reference to the controversy surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein, footage of the fetus actually carrying out the act was missing.\n\nIn the episode, a doctor tells Trump and Satan: “I'm afraid you can see it all in the video. The baby got ahold of some bed sheets. There's a couple minutes missing from the ultrasound, but it's definitely a suicide.”\n\nA spoof Fox News report showed the same footage, with a reporter saying: “Fox News has analyzed the ultrasound. You can see the baby probably considering suicide right here... and then a little bit missing... and it killed itself. Obvious confirmation of suicide.”\n\nLast month, South Park co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker said in an interview that they have found politics impossible to avoid this season.\n\n“It’s not that we got all political,” Parker told The New York Times. “It’s that politics became pop culture.”\n\nStone added that speaking out against the Trump administration had become “taboo.” He continued: “Trey and I are attracted to that like flies to honey. Oh, that’s where the taboo is? Over there? OK, then we’re over there.”\n\nParker went on to clarify that their targets can come from all sides of the political spectrum.\n\n“We’re just very down-the-middle guys,” he said. “Any extremists of any kind, we make fun of. We did it for years with the woke thing. That was hilarious to us. And this is hilarious to us.”","summary":"Donald Trump got his way in the Christmas-themed ‘South Park’ finale","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/south-park-season-28-finale-epstein-trump-b2882519.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/10/19/57/South-Park-2805b-(1).jpg?crop=1224,816,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fee0Kcbs-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-11 11:19:50","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.018}]}
