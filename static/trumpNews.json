Baker wrote that Trump’s administration added free admission for Trump’s birthday while removing free entry for MLK Day and Juneteenth.The White House replied: “It’s Flag Day, you insufferable moron — which also happens to be President Trump’s birthday. But you already knew that.” Despite the pushback, critics online remained unconvinced.Online outrage buildsSocial media users swiftly condemned the move, accusing the administration of favoritism and political messaging.One user wrote: “Trump thinks he’s greater than MLK.”Another questioned the rationale behind dropping historically significant holidays: “Why remove two NATIONAL holidays that celebrate Black people, and replace them with Flag Day — which isn’t even a national holiday?”Another one pointed out inconsistencies in the explanation offered by the White House: “If it’s really about Flag Day, why is Trump’s birthday listed on the site? Why not just call it Flag Day?”Another reaction said: “Fine with adding more free days — but why cancel MLK Day? Why cancel Juneteenth?”Another argued the move sends a troubling message: “Why choose Flag Day, which is not a legal holiday, over MLK’s Birthday and Juneteenth — both of which are legal holidays?”What changed in the NPS policyAccording to the National Park Service website:Removed free-entry holidays (previously included):Martin Luther King Jr. DayJuneteenthNew additions to the “patriotic fee-free days”:June 14 (Flag Day/Trump’s birthday)July 4th weekendNPS 110th BirthdayThe website also notes that starting in 2026, free-entry days will only apply to US citizens and residents.Interior Secretary Doug Burgum defended the policy, stating: “President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first… international visitors should contribute their fair share to maintaining our parks.”New fees for foreign touristsAs part of a new “America-first” initiative:Nonresidents will pay $100 per person to enter 11 of the most-visited national parks starting Jan. 1.Annual passes will cost $80 for U.S. residents and $250 for nonresidents beginning in 2026.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/why-trump-s-birthday-outrage-as-national-park-service-drops-mlk-day-juneteenth-from-free-entry-list-11765047926157.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/06/1600x900/logo/USA--TRUMP-ACCOUNTS-0_1764810661908_1764810746720_1765049056441.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07

House tightens work permits, vetting process under 'America First' framework","text":"The White House on Saturday highlighted fresh momentum behind its immigration agenda, tying employment-related restrictions to its broader \"America First\" policy framework.In a post on X, the White House wrote, \"AMERICA FIRST.\"It added, \"President Trump is cracking down on work permits and tightening the vetting process.\n \"In line with this approach, the US government has rolled out enhanced screening requirements for H-1B visa applicants and their H-4 dependents, introducing mandatory social media checks from December 15.Under the new guidelines, applicants must change their social media accounts to a \"public\" setting so officials can review online activity as part of the visa assessment process.\n In an order issued Wednesday, the US State Department said, \"To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for H-1B and their dependents (H-4), F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to 'public'. \"The department reiterated that obtaining a visa to enter the United States is \"a privilege and not a right\", noting, \"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision.\"It said consular officers would rely on all available information to determine admissibility and assess security risks.It further noted that the United States \"must be vigilant\" to ensure that visa applicants do not intend to cause harm.\n The announcement has sparked concern among Indian nationals, who represent one of the largest groups of H-1B workers in the United States.The policy shift follows other immigration-related steps under President Donald Trump's administration, including efforts to address alleged misuse of the H-1B programme frequently utilised by US technology companies.Earlier in September, Trump issued a proclamation titled Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers, levying a one-time fee of USD 100,000 on new H-1B visa applications -- a move likely to affect Indian professionals seeking employment in the US.In another development, Washington has temporarily halted the processing of Green Card, citizenship and other immigration applications for nationals belonging to 19 \"countries of concern\" after a shooting incident involving an Afghan citizen.\n A US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) memorandum issued Tuesday directs officials to \"place on hold\" all asylum claims pending further review.The action was taken after a shooting in Washington DC that resulted in the death of US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and left US Air Force Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, critically injured.The suspect, identified as 29-year-old Lakanwal, reportedly arrived in the United States through Operation Allies Welcome, a programme set up for Afghan nationals following the 2021 Taliban takeover.\n (Except for the headline, the story hasn't been edited by

Trump blames Democrats","text":"Police in North Carolina’s Charlotte have charged a 33-year-old man after a stabbing on a city commuter train left another person critically injured. According to Charlotte-Mecklenburg police, Oscar Solorzano was charged with attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon after allegedly attacking a rider with a large knife on Friday afternoon. The victim was taken to a hospital and is reported to be in critical but stable condition.A magistrate’s filing states that Solorzano is in the US unlawfully and has previously been deported. He is being held without bond ahead of a scheduled court appearance on Monday. .preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}An arrest warrant said he appeared intoxicated during the encounter and provoked the victim into a fight. Court records show no attorney listed for him.US President Donald Trump reacted to the incident on his Truth Social account, criticising local leadership and linking the incident to immigration issues.“Another stabbing by an Illegal Migrant in Charlotte, North Carolina. What’s going on in Charlotte? Democrats are destroying it, like everything else, piece by piece!!!”Officials also noted Solorzano-Garcia’s prior criminal history, which includes arrests for violent and obstructive offenses, as well as previous removals from the US Immigration authorities have issued a detainer in an effort to prevent his release, while expressing concern about local cooperation with federal enforcement.Homeland security officials have recently deployed additional resources to North Carolina for a targeted operation focused on individuals residing in the state without legal status who have criminal records. Authorities say hundreds of federal detainers in the state have gone unfulfilled in recent years.The incident follows another violent attack on the Charlotte rail system less than four months ago, when 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed in what authorities described as a random assault captured on video. The suspect in that case, Decarlos Brown Jr., faces state murder charges and a federal indictment related to causing a death on mass transit.- EndsPublished By: Aashish VashisthaPublished On: Dec 7, 2025","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/man-charged-after-stabbing-on-charlotte-train-trump-blames-democrats-glbs-2831944-2025-12-07","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/charlotte-07315331-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=OEvkhd.1y8HHTa3zrxEsedg235iD6ueG?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 01:33:10","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.678},{"id":385728812,"title":"FM: Greece can be an honest broker in an unstable world","text":"Greece can play the role of an honest broker in a period of international upheaval, Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in a discussion with journalist Matthew Boyle as part of the “Doha Forum” in Qatar.\nGerapetritis said that under the presidency of Donald Trump, a new model of governance has been applied, which to a large extent forced Europe to reconsider fundamental parts of its strategy: the need for greater autonomy, the formulation of a more comprehensive economic policy and ensuring a fair balance in relations with the United States.\nA change in mentality has taken place in Europe over the past ten months, with a strong cooperation with NATO being a key part.\nGerapetritis said that, for the first time, Europe is thinking about its defense capabilities in a unified manner, with programs such as ReArm Europe and SAFE strengthening collective deterrence capability. He emphasized that US-EU and US-Greece relations are at an all-time high and he described the US administration's efforts for peace initiatives in the Middle East and South Caucasus as “historic.”\nOn West-China relations, Gerapetritis stressed the importance of new corridors that ensure trade and economic stability. Regarding the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC), he noted that it is also a cultural corridor that redefines Europe's strategic direction towards the East.\nGerapetritis focused in particular on Greece's relationship with the Gulf States and India. India is a country of 1.5 billion inhabitants, the largest democracy in the world and a huge market and Greece has already concluded trade agreements and is preparing a new one on worker mobility.\nOn the Middle East, the Foreign Minister said it is crucial to have a fair peace process that will allow Israel to live safely alongside the Palestinians. He said Greece is a strategic ally of Israel, while maintaining close relations with all Arab states. Greece can contribute to the future of Gaza in several ways: humanitarian missions, reconstruction and in stabilization forces, while acting as a guarantor for the protection of Christian populations.\nOn Syria, Gerapetritis stressed that the new government must be inclusive, reiterating that all populations in the region must be protected. He announced that Greece, as a member of the Security Council, will undertake international initiatives to protect religious communities.\nThe minister described Greece as an emerging energy hub of key importance for Europe. He mentioned that Greece manages 25% of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) internationally, has developed floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) infrastructure in Northern Greece and that it covers 55% of its energy needs from renewable sources. He also highlighted the electrical interconnections with Egypt, Cyprus and Israel.\nRegarding the agreements signed at the P-TEC summit, Gerapetritis noted that they upgrade Greece geopolitically, ensure Ukraine’s energy security in view of a difficult winter and strengthen the “Vertical Corridor” as a project of strategic importance. He stressed the need for full implementation of sanctions against Russia, without any circumvention, so that the energy sector remains “clean”.\nClosing, he pointed out that over-reliance on Russian natural gas has proven dangerous and that Greece, together with the rest of Europe, is moving towards a more sustainable energy model that enhances security and autonomy.\nGerapetritis met in Doha with the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The discussion focused on bilateral relations between Greece and Qatar, with an emphasis on investments, energy and trade. The two sides also exchanged views on regional developments, paying particular attention to the situation in Gaza.","url":"https://www.ekathimerini.com/politics/foreign-policy/1289061/fm-greece-can-be-an-honest-broker-in-an-unstable-world/","image":"https://www.ekathimerini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gerapetritis-1.png?v=1765063677","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 01:29:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gr","sentiment":0.135},{"id":385740772,"title":"Prince Harry Jokes That Life with the Royal Family Was ‘Like“ Downton Abbey”’ — Except the TV Show Had Less 'Drama'","text":"Prince Harry took a playful jab at the “drama” involved in growing up as a royal.\n\n The Duke of Sussex, 41, was a distinguished guest and speaker at the British-American Business Council’s 65th Annual Christmas Luncheon held in Santa Monica, Calif., on Friday, Dec. 5. During his speech, Harry compared life in the royal family to a particularly iconic British TV show.\n\n “People sometimes ask if growing up with the royal family was a bit like [show creator] Julian's [Fellowes] Downton Abbey,' Harry said. “Yeah, but only one of those worlds is filled with drama, intrigue, elaborate dinners [and] marriages to Americans — and the other is a TV show.\"\n\n Harry, who noted that the event was the \"first Christmas party” he’d attended in “a while,” also shared more serious thoughts on the nature of living in the United States as a British citizen. \n\n “For me, being British isn’t about where you physically stand, but what you stand for,” he said at one point in his speech.\n\n He also shared that celebrating the Fourth of July has been a decidedly new experience for him.\n\n \"It's a new world to me, celebrating independence from Britain, and more specifically, independence from my great, great, great, great, great, great-grandfather,” he noted.\n\n Harry also made a brief quip about the U.S.’s current immigration enforcement policies while discussing the upcoming 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. is set to host alongside Canada and Mexico.

The follow-up strike — referred to by some as a double tap — was launched after two survivors were seen clinging to the wrecked vessel.\n\nOn Thursday, Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the Navy SEAL officer who leads U.S. Special Operations Command, showed lawmakers footage of the lethal strikes and answered questions.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jim Himes, a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters the footage was “one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service.” In contrast, Tom Cotton, GOP chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the strikes “righteous” and “entirely lawful.”\n\nHegseth, on Tuesday, said the attack took place within “the fog of war” and said Bradley acted “within his authority and the law.” \n\nBeyond the double-tap controversy, Hegseth has drawn broader criticism for his campaign targeting suspected traffickers, which has resulted in at least 86 deaths. Some lawmakers and human rights organizations have labeled the attacks illegal, alleging they are being used to put pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Republicans, however, have largely backed the strikes, arguing they help stem the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.\n\nThis week, the Defense Department’s inspector general also released the findings from an investigation into Hegseth’s use of a Signal chat to post details about a strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. The report concluded that the former FOX News’ anchor’s actions could have put U.S. personnel in harm’s way. In a discussion at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Saturday, Hegseth said he doesn’t “live with any regrets” over the his use of Signal.\n\nPresident Trump has publicly backed the Pentagon chief, telling reporters Tuesday that “Pete is doing a great job.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has also defended the military’s second strike in September. However, behind-closed-doors, things could be different, The Altantic report claims.\n\n“Trump has not been happy that a number of Republicans on Capitol Hill are using Hegseth’s record as a reason to stand up to the White House, a further sign of cracks in what had until recently been unwavering GOP fealty to Trump,” the outlet said.\n\nThis week, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina told CNN that Hegseth was wrong to claim the inspector general’s report on his use of a Signal chat had exonerated him.\n\n“No one can rationalize that as an exoneration,” Tillis said. “We know that mission information was outside of the classified setting that it was trusted to be in.”\n\nOn Friday, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul called on Hegseth to testify under oath about the boat strikes.\n\n“I think that Congress, if they had any kind of gumption at all, would not be allowing this administration to summarily execute people that are suspected of a crime,” he told The Independent.\n\nStill, a number of Republicans have stood by Hegseth and have argued the Pentagon is operating fine under his leadership. And a senior administration official told The Atlantic that the president cannot afford to fire Hegseth and endure another Senate confirmation battle.\n\n“The people around the president have always sensed that Hegseth isn’t really qualified for the job,” this official said. “But he’s redeemed himself in the eyes of the president because he is truly devoted to Trump. That goes a long way. Taking Pete, with all his baggage, is just how it’s gonna be.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump has given no indication the boat strikes will slow down. Instead, he suggested the military campaign could escalate.\n\n“Very soon we’re going to start doing it on land too,” the president said on Wednesday.","summary":"It’s been a “rough week for Pete,” a senior official said.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-hegseth-controversies-white-house-b2879509.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/03/17/Trump_58799.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/An4Qvla6-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-07 01:03:20","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":385739740,"title":"Trump can use force \"as he sees fit\", Hegseth says on alleged cartel boat strikes","text":"Washington [US], December 7 (ANI): US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth on Saturday defended recent military strikes on boats linked to alleged drug cartels, saying President Donald Trump has the authority to take action \"as he sees fit\" to safeguard the nation.Speaking at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Hegseth rejected criticism of the strikes, which have reportedly resulted in more than 80 deaths and raised questions over potential breaches of international law.He argued the operations were justified to protect American citizens and likened the effort to the response following the September 11, 2001, attacks.\"If you're working for a designated terrorist organisation and you bring drugs to this country in a boat, we will find you and we will sink you. Let there be no doubt about it,\" Hegseth said during his keynote address at the Reagan National Defence Forum.\"President Trump can and will take decisive military action as he sees fit to defend our nation's interests. Let no country on earth doubt that for a moment.\"The most recent strike has brought the reported death toll to at least 87.Lawmakers have requested greater clarity about the legal basis for the strikes and whether US personnel were instructed to conduct a second strike after a September operation when officials knew there were survivors.\n\nHegseth also likened suspected drug traffickers to Al-Qaeda, though analysts have pointed out key differences between the two and the strategies needed to combat them.His remarks came soon after the administration released its national security strategy, which depicts European partners as weak and aims to reassert US power in the Western Hemisphere.During his speech, Hegseth also emphasised the necessity of countering China's rise through strength rather than confrontation.He repeated Trump's pledge to resume nuclear testing on the same level as China and Russia -- a stance that has surprised many nuclear policy experts.The event, held at the Reagan National Defence Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in California, featured senior national security figures from across the country.Hegseth used his platform to argue that Trump is Reagan's \"true and rightful heir\" in terms of pursuing a robust foreign policy.He contrasted this approach with Republican leaders after Reagan, criticising support for Middle East conflicts and failed democracy-building efforts.He also aimed at those who claim climate change poses serious risks to military readiness.\"The war department will not be distracted by democracy building, interventionism, undefined wars, regime change, climate change, woke moralising and feckless nation building,\" he said.

But the Republican has instituted a series of changes since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chairman of the board.\nTrump also has criticized the centre’s programming and its physical appearance, and has vowed to overhaul both.\nThe president placed around each honouree’s neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweller Tiffany and Co., according to the Kennedy Centre and Trump.\nIt’s a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Centre’s image and rainbow colours. The honouree’s name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honouree’s shoulders and chest and had been used since the first honours program in 1978.\nTrump honours the honourees Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Trump said, “If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.” But Strait took it off.\nThe president said Crawford was a “great star of Broadway” for his lead role in the long-running “Phantom of the Opera”. Of Gaynor, he said, “We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor”.\nTrump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a “wonderful” and “spectacular” person and “one of the true, great movie stars” and “one of the great legends.” Kiss is an “incredible rock band”, he said.\nSongs by honourees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Trump to begin the ceremony.\nThe president president said in August that he was “about 98 per cent involved” in choosing the 2025 honourees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Centre, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honourees traditionally had been announced by press release.\nIt was unclear how they were chosen. Before Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee.\n“These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we’ve seen,” Trump said. “We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom — and that was a phantom, let me tell you — or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that’s what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.” “Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,” Trump said.\nTrump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honourees on Saturday. In years past, the honourees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House.\nTrump to host the Kennedy Centre Honours Meanwhile, the glitzy Kennedy Centre Honours programme and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday at the performing arts centre for broadcast later in December on CBS and Paramount+. Trump is to attend the program for the first time as president, accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump.\nThe president said in August that he had agreed to host the show, and he seemed to confirm on Saturday that he would do so, predicting that the broadcast would garner its highest ratings ever as a result. Presidents traditionally attend the program and sit with the honourees in the audience. None has ever served as host.\nHe said he looked forward to Sunday’s celebration.\n“It’s going to be something that I believe, and I’m going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done and they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night,” Trump said.\nThe president also swiped at late-night TV show host Jimmy Kimmel, whose programme was briefly suspended earlier this year by ABC following criticism of his comments related to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September.\nKimmel and Trump are sharp critics of each other, with the president regularly deriding Kimmel’s talent as a host. Kimmel has hosted the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Academy Award multiple times.\nTrump said he should be able to outdo Kimmel.\n“I’ve watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible,” Trump said. “If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be president.” (AP) NSD NSD","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/trump-awards-medals-to-the-kennedy-centre-honourees-in-oval-office-ceremony-9754850.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/News18_World_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-07-4401653589b9d10b46b8abb07f758342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 01:00:01","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.191},{"id":385740798,"title":"Musa is Coming, Trump is Watching -By Festus Adedayo","text":"The aggregate of opinions on the street of Nigeria is that this was Tinubu’s best appointment thus far. But, what happened? How did a man who appointed, as minister of defence and minister of state for defence, two men perceived to be enablers “agbódegbà”(s) of bandits and terrorists suddenly meander into appointing another man who, by popular belief, is the best suited for the job, as minister of defence? What happened? How did that same appointor, whose judgment chose Musa, choose Mahmood Yakubu, who supervised his election, as ambassador-designate?\n\nSenate President, Godswill Akpabio, a renowned fawner of the seat of power, provided an answer last week. At the swearing-in of Musa, when Sani Musa, senator representing Niger East, gave the sycophantic proposal that Musa be made to “bow and go”, Akpabio’s fury was unexampled. For the first time in his groveling senate presidency, Akpabio was so miffed that he stood up while wedging home his point. Not even when his senator colleague alleged sexual harassment did he show that level of anger. “Even Donald Trump is on our neck… and you stand up and say he should take a bow … with over 200 Nigerian children in the bush kidnapped and being tortured?” the senate president spat.\n\nFor Akpabio, even when a dog exhibits signs of malady, it dares not jump inside a scalding fire. Trump is watching. Not only did that senatorial outburst encapsulate the about-turn from the papering-over of insecurity that Nigerians have witnessed in the last 30 months of this administration, it explains the choice of Musa. So, there is indeed an innate walzing, dancing steps inside the cripple?\n\nPermit me to digress a bit to explain this Trump phenomenon. If the grave indulges the sacrilege of flowing tears of dead patriots, decayed skulls of African anti-colonial ancestors must be shedding tears at the moment. Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde’s Amílcar Cabral. Guinea’s Ahmed Sékou Touré. Mozambique’s Samora Machel. Zambia’s Kenneth Kaunda. Ethiopia’s Menelik II. Democratic Republic of Congo’s Patrice Lumumba. Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta. Tanzania’s Julius Nyerere. South Africa’s Nelson Mandela. Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah. Nigeria’s Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. Kenya’s Mekatilili Wa Menza. Bibi Titi Mohamed of Tanzania. And many more. If you watched the December 4 peace meeting between DRC’s Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda’s Paul Kagame at the newly renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace building in Washington, DC, with petulant American president, Donald Trump, making sophisticated jokes of these African countries’ buffoonery, you could not but notice the droplets of tears down the chins of these African ancestors.\n\nEarlier, Donald Trump had picked on our brothers in Somalia. “I don’t want them in my country,” Trump had begun, in his no-smiling vile attack, “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks.” In an earlier repeated obnoxious attacks on South Africa, ostensibly borne out of his impulsive bellicose character, Trump repeatedly maintained that there is a white “genocide” unfolding in Cyril Ramaphosa’s country. Following this same trope of Africa-denigration, in the last three weeks or so, Nigeria has been a berthing bay for Trump to moor his querulous boat. Early last month, in a video he posted on his Truth Social, he had promised to “do things to Nigeria that Nigeria is not going to be happy about” as he would “go into that now-disgraced country guns-a-blazing”.\n\nIn July, the grumpy Trump had invited select African leaders to a three-day summit in Washington DC. White House referred to the summit, which had presidents of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal, as an “incredible” commercial opportunity.” All the invited African leaders’ countries possess important minerals like gold, oil, manganese, gas, wood and zircon in the bellies of their earths. At a televised lunch meeting with the African leaders, each of them festooned Trump with obsequious praise-singing. While Mohamed Ould Ghazouani of Mauritania lauded him for his “peace-making” evangelism in Africa, Senegal’s Bassirou Diomaye Faye commended his golf skills.\n\nIn D.C. last week, as Tshisekedi and Kagame sat, while he bungled their names in a mis-pronunciation orgy, Trump cracked grisly jokes at them for “killing each other”. He was before a rancorous audience which ostensibly enjoyed how he made a fool of these presidents. “Some people may be surprised. I think they’ve spent a lot of time killing each other and now they’re going to spend a lot of time hugging, holding hands and taking advantage of the United States of America economically, like every other country does.” The takeaways were “killing each other”, “taking advantage of the United States of America economically”, and, “like every other country does”. Construct an image in your mind’s eye of a daddy holding his child’s teddy bear and urging the child to walk. Not satisfied with that seemingly harmless jab, Trump then said, smiling, in what was obviously a pun, “Look at them. Look at the way they love each other.”\n\nIndeed, the two African leaders have made sport of killing each other. Embroiled in decades-long conflict which began in the 1990s, they have fought two major regional wars which took place in 1996 and 2003, leaving millions of their people dead. Preceded by the brutal Rwandan genocide of 1994, with no less than one million people killed, that event became a precursor for the 1996-1997 war between the two countries. In this war, which was kindled by a Laurent-Désiré Kabila-led Rwandan and Ugandan-backed rebel force which overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko’s, the casualty estimate was about 250,000 souls. In the second war, nicknamed “Africa’s World War,” this conflict grossed death toll of 5.4 million people who died mainly from preventable causes like disease and starvation. In this recent conflict said to have begun in 2003, persistent violence, which ravaged Eastern Congo, birthed the M23 rebels, backed by Rwanda and various armed groups. In total, about 5.4m people are estimated to have died in the conflict, earning it the unflattering cognomen of the deadliest conflict worldwide since World War II.\n\nIn March 2020, a few years before it fell into the hands of the M23 rebels, I was in Goma. By the way, Congo is reputed with huge reserves of cobalt, gold, gems, copper, timber, and uranium, the hugest in the world. Its most valuable resource is its large reserve of diamonds. Indeed, the Congo has world’s second-largest diamond reserves, at 150Mct, or 20.5% of the global total. Substantial diamond reserves can be found in Kasai Occidental and Kasai Oriental. Then known as the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908, it was the personal estate of Leopold II, who was the second King of the Belgians from 1865 to 1909. Leopold was known to have founded and was the sole owner of the Free State which he administered as a private estate, ran by a surrogate called Henry Morton Stanley. After the “peace meeting” facts emerged that America had made a go for DRC and Rwandan precious stones.\n\nBut, Frantz Fannon predicted all these. In his Black Skin, White Masks, (1952) a historical critique of the complex ways in which identity, particularly Blackness, impacts on the African and the way it is constructed and produced, Fannon dissected the feelings of dependency on white-skin persons, as well as our feeling of inadequacy in our black skin, what he called “psychopathology” of inferiority complex of the African.\n\nSo, there is no doubt that Donald Trump’s threat is strategically reshaping the minds of our leaders. And for good. Which is both lamentable and commendable. Lamentable as per the facts I stated overleaf but commendable because, though the Nigerian presidency, in answering the archetypal Frantz Fannon’s ‘Black Skin, White Mask’, has buckled up due to Trump’s bullying tirades. If we didn’t have that white-skin democratic demon, Trump, threatening to apply the Venezuelan treatment against our president, we would most likely continue to have dross as anti-insecurity leadership.\n\nLast week, the 19 Northern governors also became the Black Skin, White Masks. Perceiving the Trump fire to have crept up the mountain, it suddenly occurred to these governors that they could not continue to breathe region and religion while their their own rebellious children who have morphed to become terrorists, bandits and kidnappers, kill in hundreds. A pledge to contribute N1b each monthly towards demonstrating to Trump that they are not chummy with terrorism is a huge elephant to swallow. Akpabio too also immediately became a Black Skin, White Mask. But for Trump, he would have continued in his boot-licking sycophancy. And the president would have continued to vicariously abet terrorists by being politically right in his choice of sensitive appointees, and failing to name and shame terrorism financiers.\n\nIf there is any public officer today no one must envy, General Musa is. One is that he carries a huge-monster responsibility on his head. When there is a unanimous adulation for you, the type the retired General has harvested across board in Nigeria in the last one week, any right-thinking person should be afraid. First is that the land he steps upon is very slippery. Though he partakes in the encomium of Musa’s discovery and identification, Musa’s appointment commendations expose the president as hitherto self-serving. How could the same pot that cooked Musa be the same that cooked Badaru and Matawalle? Why would the vine (creeping plant) that ties the calabash, be the one that ties the gourd and at the same time, the one that ties the ball-like seed of a vegetable called “elégédé”? Yoruba say this as “ìtàkùn t’ó so’gbà, ló s’agbè tó tún so elégédé”. This equivocation can only be possible if within the cooking pot is the capacity for evil and good in same proportion.\n\nMusa’s appointment might have brought him on collision course with Robert Greene’s admonition in his 48 laws of power. The minister’s appointment has unwittingly made him to outshine the master. In the calculus of power, it is a lethal infraction. Trust politicians, by now, they are probably thinking he could be the right choice for the 2027 vice presidency. In which case, he would begin to harvest political enemies. This dais is different from the army where guns understand no politics.\n\nGeneral Musa (rtd) has found the favour of the world and in the world’s eyes, he is without blemish. But we must not forget that it was this same Musa, as Chief of Defence Staff, that the Canadian government denied entry visa to Canada in February of this year. It speaks to the institutional horror and complicity in the nourishment of terrorism that the Nigerian military is perceived to have been trapped. What should bother us is why and how that same Nigerian military, rated as one of the best in the world, has become a scum of the world. The answer is that it has been unequally yoked with political power and its rotten apples. Since 2009 when insurgency grew to become a hydra in Nigeria, military top-brasses have grown rotund cheeks and inflated tummies from fat defence budget. They purchase substandard armaments and sell equipment to insurgents. It is same with banditry which is fueled by illegal mining activities alleged to be the brainchild of retired generals. Unfortunately, it is the rank and file, and occasional big-epaulette like the late Brigadier-Gen Uba who Karma catches.","url":"https://www.opinionnigeria.com/musa-is-coming-trump-is-watching-by-festus-adedayo/","image":"https://www.opinionnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Christopher-Musa-1000x600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:58:22","author":"Opinion Nigeria","authors":["Opinion Nigeria"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":385739862,"title":"‘America First’: White House Signals Crackdown On Work Permits","text":"The White House on Saturday highlighted fresh momentum behind its immigration agenda, tying employment-related restrictions to its broader America First policy framework.In a post on X, the White House wrote, AMERICA FIRST.It added, President Trump is cracking down on work permits and tightening the vetting process.In line with this approach, the US government has rolled out enhanced screening requirements for H-1B visa applicants and their H-4 dependents, introducing mandatory social media checks from December 15.Under the new guidelines, applicants must change their social media accounts to a public setting so officials can review online activity as part of the visa assessment process.In an order issued Wednesday, the US State Department said, To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for H-1B and their dependents (H-4), F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to public.The department reiterated that obtaining a visa to enter the United States is a privilege and not a right, noting, Every visa adjudication is a national security decision.It said consular officers would rely on all available information to determine admissibility and assess security risks.It further noted that the United States must be vigilant to ensure that visa applicants do not intend to cause harm.The announcement has sparked concern among Indian nationals, who represent one of the largest groups of H-1B workers in the United States.The policy shift follows other immigration-related steps under President Donald Trumps administration, including efforts to address alleged misuse of the H-1B programme frequently utilised by US technology companies.Earlier in September, Trump issued a proclamation titled Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers, levying a one-time fee of USD 100,000 on new H-1B visa applications -- a move likely to affect Indian professionals seeking employment in the US.In another development, Washington has temporarily halted the processing of Green Card, citizenship, and other immigration applications for nationals belonging to 19 countries of concern after a shooting incident involving an Afghan citizen.A US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) memorandum issued Tuesday directs officials to place on hold all asylum claims pending further review.The action was taken after a shooting in Washington, DC that resulted in the death of US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and left US Air Force Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, critically injured.The suspect, identified as 29-year-old Lakanwal, reportedly arrived in the United States through Operation Allies Welcome, a programme set up for Afghan nationals following the 2021 Taliban takeover.","url":"https://zeenews.india.com/world/america-first-white-house-signals-crackdown-on-work-permits-2993048.html","image":"https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2025/12/07/1873754-article-gallery.jpg?im=Resize=(1200,900)","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:55:39","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":385740008,"title":"Elon Musk adds to Donald Trump’s widening rift with the European Union, after EU fined his social media platform X","text":"WorldEuropeDefence\n\nLondon | Elon Musk has added to strains in trans-Atlantic ties by calling for the European Union to be torn apart after the bloc fined his social media platform, X, €120 million ($210 million) for a series of digital rule breaches.His tirade against the EU, which he described as a “bureaucratic monster”, came just days after US President Donald Trump unveiled a national security strategy that allied the White House with far-right nationalist and populist parties across the continent.Loading...Andrew Tillett is The Australian Financial Review’s correspondent for Europe, based in London.

The president’s direct involvement in selecting honorees and moving the medal ceremony to the White House breaks from decades of tradition, where selections were made by a bipartisan committee and medals were presented at a State Department dinner.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nTrump also announced he would attend Sunday’s Kennedy Center Honors program, marking the first time a sitting president would participate in the event after overhauling the center’s leadership structure.\n\nThe president said he was “about 98% involved” in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center in August—the first slate selected under his leadership. The honorees had traditionally been announced via press release, and it remains unclear exactly how this year’s recipients were selected.\n\nThe new Tiffany & Co. medal features a gold disc etched with the Kennedy Center’s image and rainbow colors on one side, with the honoree’s name and ceremony date on the reverse. It hangs from a navy blue ribbon, replacing the previous large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates.\n\nKennedy Centre Honours recipient musician Paul Stanley of the rock band KISS, receives a medal from US President Donald Trump during the Kennedy Centre Honours medal presentation ahead of tomorrow’s ceremony, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, December 6, 2025.

These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation.”\n\nTrump on George Strait: “We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country.”\n\nTrump on Gloria Gaynor: “We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.”\n\nTrump on Sylvester Stallone: He called his friend a “wonderful” and “spectacular” person and “one of the true, great movie stars” and “one of the great legends.”\n\nTrump on Michael Crawford: “Great star of Broadway” for his lead role in the long-running Phantom of the Opera.\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks during the Kennedy Centre Honours medal presentation ahead of tomorrow’s ceremony, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, December 6, 2025.

Saying the strikes are justified to protect Americans, Hegseth likened the fight to the war on terror following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\n\n“If you’re working for a designated terrorist organization and you bring drugs to this country in a boat, we will find you and we will sink you. Let there be no doubt about it,” Hegseth said during his keynote address at the Reagan National Defense Forum. ”President Trump can and will take decisive military action as he sees fit to defend our nation’s interests. Let no country on earth doubt that for a moment.”\n\nThe most recent strike brings the death toll of the campaign to at least 87 people. Lawmakers have sought more answers about the attacks and their legal justification, and whether U.S. forces were ordered to launch a follow-up strike following a September attack even after the Pentagon knew of survivors.\n\nThough Hegseth compared the alleged drug smugglers to Al-Qaida terrorists, experts have noted significant differences between the two foes and the efforts to combat them.\n\nHegseth’s remarks came after the Trump administration released its new national security strategy, one that paints European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nDuring the speech, Hegseth also discussed the need to check China’s rise through strength instead of conflict. He repeated Trump’s vow to resume nuclear testing on an equal basis as China and Russia — a goal that has alarmed many nuclear arms experts. China and Russia haven’t conducted explosive tests in decades, though the Kremlin said it would follow the U.S. if Trump restarted tests.\n\nThe speech was delivered at the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in California, an event that brings together top national security experts from around the country. Hegseth used the visit to argue that Trump is Reagan’s “true and rightful heir” when it comes to muscular foreign policy.\n\nBy contrast, Hegseth criticized Republican leaders in the years since Reagan for supporting wars in the Middle East and democracy-building efforts that didn’t work. He also blasted those who have argued that climate change poses serious challenges to military readiness.\n\n“The war department will not be distracted by democracy building, interventionism, undefined wars, regime change, climate change, woke moralizing and feckless nation building,” he said.","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/national/2025/12/06/hegseth-defends-strikes-on-alleged-cartel-boats-says-trump-can-order-as-he-sees-fit/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/AKQHF4OCXBBS5CSTWKUFBNJ4IA.jpg?auth=98fbcff8b7ff6feb0a6c65f4c2539a6d72320e46f6b100fd0ca33b14a8a45cc3&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&focal=1838,556","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:37:35","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.295},{"id":385734948,"title":"Russia unleashes major drone, missile attack on Ukraine as US diplomatic talks continue","text":"Russia launched a major attack against Ukraine overnight as talks between Ukraine and the U.S. continued in Florida this week.

(Photo by Caylo Seals/Getty Images)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nLawmakers and defense experts alike gathered in Simi for the Reagan National Defense Forum, but the highlight of the weekend was a keynote speech from Hegseth, followed by an interview conducted by Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson. \n\nHegseth spoke on Trump’s use of the doctrine that America leads by “peace through strength,” pointing to the several peace deals the president helped negotiate since returning to office earlier this year.\n\nTomlinson therefore asked about the Venezuela drug boat strikes, which Trump has repeatedly framed as a cornerstone of his administration’s drug-fighting policy. \n\n“We can’t I can’t get into sources and methods and all of those things for obvious reasons, but you have to develop the intel picture and get an understanding of what you’re looking at … so once we got to the point where a strike was eminent, I had taken the decision responsibility up to my level,” Hegseth said. \n\n“Not many military decisions should be made by the Secretary of War: I believe in in deferring those decisions to local commanders as much as possible, but because of the strategic implications of the first few strikes, I wanted to hold that decision at my level, and the briefing that I received before that strike was extensive, exhaustive,” Hegseth added. \n\nWhen asked when the Pentagon would release video, citing Trump’s comment that he would have no problem with releasing it, however, Hegseth did not commit to doing so, citing concerns about compromising “sources, methods” with a release. \n\nSecretary of War Pete Hegseth is interviewed by Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson at the Reagan National Defense Forum on December 6, 2025 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. (Photo by Caylo Seals/Getty Images)\n\nTomlinson then asked Hegseth directly about the “kill everybody” order reports, Hegseth turned to the crowd and asked, “Is anybody here from the Washington Post?” and quickly added, “I don’t know where you get your sources, but they suck.” \n\n“Of course not,” Hegseth said. “Anybody that’s been in the situation room there’s or they’ve been in in in the the the war room there, Secretary’s office, no, you don’t walk in and say, kill them. It’s it’s just patently ridiculous.”\n\n“It’s meant to create a cartoon of me and the decisions that we make and how we make them. Just ridiculous,” he added, stressing that the operation followed “a very defined process, specific criteria” that involved “lawyers, intel analysts, everything.”\n\nHegseth highlighted another strike in which two people survived a strike on a submserible vessel and were stranded in the water, but in that case the U.S. forces “gave them back to their host countries.”","summary":"The Trump administration remains under intense scrutiny for the second strike that killed two survivors on a drug boat.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/hegseth-avoids-committing-release-second-strike-video-11169045","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2249782596.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:27:41","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":385733520,"title":"Trump's Axing MLK Day and Juneteenth to Make His Birthday a National Event","text":"The National Park Service (NPS) has revised its list of free admission days for 2026, adding President Donald Trump's birthday, 14 June, as a new fee-free day. The move has ignited immediate and significant controversy.The addition comes at the expense of two federal holidays dedicated to racial equality and justice: Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth, both of which have been removed from the schedule. Critics immediately condemned the move. They called it a politically motivated and racially insensitive decision, designed to elevate the president at the expense of African American history.Historical Holidays Removed to Make Room for Trump's Personal Celebration DayThe revised NPS list, set to take effect on 16 February 2026, grants free entry on holidays including Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day weekend. The most notable change is the addition of 14 June, which is now designated as 'Flag Day and President Donald Trump's birthday.'This revision cancels free admission on Martin Luther King Jr Day, which honours the civil rights leader, and Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. Other changes include the introduction of an additional $100 (£74.94) fee for foreign visitors at major sites like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Yellowstone National Parks.Administration Defends 'America-First' PolicyThe administration has defended the new park rules as a benefit to American families. 'President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,' Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a press release. 'These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share.'The NPS added that the changes are part of a commitment to 'enhancing access for American residents.' The statement explained: 'U.S. residents will continue to enjoy affordable pricing, while nonresidents will pay a higher rate to help support the care and maintenance of America's parks.'Widespread Backlash and Accusations of RacismThe decision ignited a firestorm online. Across social media, users condemned the move as a racially charged action that prioritises a political figure over crucial civil rights milestones. Many called the president 'petty' and 'narcissistic' for inserting his own birthday into the schedule.The criticism was not limited to social media. Civil rights advocates argued that the move was a deliberate attempt to marginalise the history of African Americans. By replacing holidays that commemorate the end of slavery and the fight for equality, they said the administration was forcing a celebration of a political figure at the direct expense of the nation's most significant civil rights achievements.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trumps-axing-mlk-day-juneteenth-make-his-birthday-national-event-1760866","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1770779/us-president-donald-trump-podium.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=48d2170480b2f9d7c4f6a1963388fdbb","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:25:24","author":"Louise Bonquin","authors":["Louise Bonquin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.25},{"id":385739338,"title":"Kennedy Center Honors 2025: Donald Trump honors celebrities from Sylvester Stallone to Michael Crawford — see who made the list","text":"US President Donald Trump on Saturday evening hosted the 2025 Kennedy Center honorees in the Oval Office for a medal-presentation ceremony.“This is a great evening, it’s a great honour,” Trump said. “And I’m delighted to welcome to the Oval Office – the world-famous, most famous office in the world, most powerful office in the world – our truly exceptional 2025 Kennedy Center honorees.”Trump said the honorees “inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans”, calling them “the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center honorees ever assembled”.Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell stood behind Trump as the President presented the medals. Grenell, who was appointed by Trump in February this year to head the centre, is also a special envoy to Latin America for the administration.This year's recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford, Guardian reported.The medallions to the honorees were “re-designed” by Tiffany and Co, Trump said. “They have done a fantastic job, they’re wonderful people – I know them very well because they’re right next to Trump Tower, I’ve lived with them many years,” he said.Trump never visited the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in his first term, and did not take part in its annual awards programme. But he has taken a keen interest in his second. Since taking office, he has ousted the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees and replaced them with supporters. He has promised to “fully renovate” the Kennedy Center’s infrastructure, and make it a “crown jewel” of arts and culture in the US.It was unclear how this year’s honorees were chosen, but Trump said in August when presenting the list that he had been “about 98% involved”.The Kennedy Center Honors programme and its series of tribute performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday, and will be broadcast later in December.The President said in August that he would host the show, and Trump on Saturday set expectations high: “I believe – and I’m going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done,” Trump said about Sunday’s event during the medal ceremony. “And they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings. But there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night.”Presidents traditionally attend the programme, but none has ever presented the show, a fact Trump appeared aware of as well. “We never had a president hosting the awards before, this is a first. I’m sure they’ll give me great reviews, right?” Trump quipped. “No, we’ll do fine. I’ve watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible.”“If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be President,” Trump added.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kennedy-center-honors-2025-donald-trump-honors-celebrities-from-sylvester-stallone-to-michael-crawford-see-who-made-the-list/articleshow/125812155.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125812169/125812169.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:24:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.137},{"id":385734474,"title":"Hegseth defends strikes on alleged cartel boats, says Trump can order use of force 'as he sees fit'","text":"WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended strikes on alleged drug cartel boats during remarks Saturday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, saying President Donald Trump has the power to take military action \"as he sees fit\" to defend the nation.\n\nHegseth dismissed criticism of the strikes, which have killed more than 80 people and now face intense scrutiny over concerns that they violated international law.

Engr. Onovo, a petroleum sector player, now Head, Policy Positions, Movement for Fundamental Change (MFC), in this explosive interview with EJIKEME OMENAZU, speaks on the recently declared State of Emergency on Security, among other critical issues. Excerpt:\n\nWhat is your take on the declaration of State of Emergency on Security by President Bola Tinubu?\n\n The declaration of a national security emergency by Jagaban Tinubu is very clearly empty, incompetent and deceitful. How do you first declare a national security emergency before you conceive what you want to do? What are the elements of the national security emergency? What are the objectives and what are the action plans? It is very unfortunate that in our laziness as Nigerians we are still expecting the Tinubu regime to do anything good. We all know that the regime is deceitful, incompetent, corrupt, lawless and noisy. The Tinubu regime is a bad tree that bears only bad fruits. It is completely corrupt and totally incapable of improving the security and welfare of Nigerians. In the over two years it has spent, it has destroyed democracy, it destroyed national unity; it destroyed the economy and degraded national security. The Tinubu regime is a complete catastrophe, worse than what we predicted. The only element known in the national security emergency is the recruitment of more security personnel. That cannot be done immediately as it will take time to determine the procedures, solicit applications, screen applicants, engage the successful applicants and then train them. This will take a few months so, strictly speaking, it cannot be valid as an element of the national security emergency. Tinubu’s office claims that the details will subsequently be developed. This is absurd. A clear case of the complete incompetence of the regime. They act loudly before they plan. The worst regime in the entire history of Nigeria.\n\nHow do you see the items listed by the Presidency during the declaration of State of Emergency on Security?\n\nThe only concrete item listed is the recruitment of more security personnel. The Tinubu office claims that the details will be worked out. This confirms that the announcement was made to deceive Nigerians. More fundamentally, it may be illogical to expect the Tinubu regime to fight insecurity in Nigeria when the ruling party is the direct sponsor of insecurity and terrorism in Nigeria. How can the ruling party fight its own corruption or its own terrorist networks? It is clear that the ruling party imported the terrorists. It is clear that the ruling party sponsors the terrorists. It is clear that the ruling party protects the terrorists. It is publicly clear that the ruling party lacks the political will to fight the terrorists. It is an open policy of the Tinubu regime called the “non-kinetic” approach to pamper the terrorists, appease them, pay them and protect them. Anyone still in doubt of these public facts is either unreasonable or a terrorist sympathiser or a blood thirsty terrorist. All these facts have been publicly established beyond any reasonable doubt by many authorities including; Alhaji Kawu Baraje, CON; Gen. T. Y. Danjuma; Commodore Kunle Olawunmi; US government; Amnesty International; victims; etc\n\nWhy do you think it took the threat by US President Donald Trump before the Government realised the need to tackle the nation’s insecurity head-on?\n\nThe threat of the US government is very potent and it impacts the selfish interest of Jagaban Tinubu. The Tinubu regime did not realize the need to tackle the nation’s insecurity head-on. It first denied the clear facts as usual and then tried to confuse the issues with very terrible political schemes that failed. Then, it proceeded to engage with the US government and is now pretending that it will tackle insecurity. That is to deceive the US government and the global community that it is working. It is just deceitful. The ruling party cannot fight its own terrorist networks.\n\nWhat do you think led to the sudden rise of attacks of soft spots like schools and religious houses after Trump’s threat and declaration of Christian Genocide in Nigeria?\n\n It can be the confused ruling party and its terrorist networks trying to send confused messages to Nigerians and the US government. You may have heard a Tinubu regime spokesperson named Mr. Bwala claiming that American soldiers will be killed if they intervene.\n\nThe Nigerian government and leaders have been criticising the allegation of Christian genocide in the country. To what extent is this allegation true?\n\nThe allegation is clearly very true. The incompetent, corrupt and lawless Tinubu regime does not know the UN’s definition of genocide. The UN defines genocide as, “Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group”. You can see that the Islamic terrorism in Nigeria is clearly genocide against Christians. While we must agree that they kill other Muslims too, that is, sectarian violence and not genocide. Prior to the US designation, Nigerians had publicly identified the same problem. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo raised the alarm about Islamisation a few years ago. The Plateau State governor rightly described the killings in his state as genocide. The Tor Tiv also rightly described the killings in Benue State as genocide. There is definitely a Christian genocide in Nigeria by Islamic terrorists.\n\nWhat should the Nigerian government do to ensure that its relationship with the US government does not deteriorate further over this alleged Christian genocide and declaration of Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC)?\n\nWe should be more worried about the genocide, which is at the root of the fracas. This genocide can easily be checked if the failed Tinubu regime has the political will. A simple Islamic ‘fatwa’ declared against the terrorists by the entire national Islamic leadership will unite all Muslims, Christians and Pagans to defeat the terrorists. On the relationship with the US, please note that, Jagaban Tinubu lived in the US and the US maintains a very extensive international intelligence network. They know that Jagaban Tinubu lacks basic education. They know he is close to 90 years old. They know he forfeited $460,000.00 proceeds of narcotics trafficking in Chicago, USA. Remember his FBI files. They know that Tinubu lost the election woefully and was imposed with armoured tanks. They know he was classified as the third most corrupt ruler in the world. They know he has failed catastrophically and is very unpopular. They will continue to treat him with scorn.\n\nHow do you see the recent retirement of the Chief of Defence Staff and the reshuffling of the Service Chiefs? What are the implications of this recent reshuffling?\n\n The recent retirement of the Chief of Defence Staff and some Service Chiefs after rumours of a coup plot is principally political. The new Chief of Defence Staff was the Chief of Army Staff. What difference do you expect in military operations? The Chief of Naval Staff that achieved the highest reduction in oil theft and ensured the highest official crude oil production level in many years was also retired. There are public allegations that the former Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Musa (appointed Minister of Defence a few days ago), was removed because he opposed the corrupt and soft non-kinetic approach to the terrorism in Nigeria. This supports the US position on Christian genocide.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP’s) crisis has continued to deepen with the dwindling of its states and its split into two factions. Would you say that the party is fast moving to extinction?\n\nThe party is not moving to extinction. All authentic opposition parties in Nigeria have been severely weakened by the subversion sponsored by the dictatorial, corrupt and lawless ruling party. Mr. Wike, an All Progressives Congress (APC) man in PDP clothing, is the hatchet man for the attack against the PDP. The same Mr. Wike was the cause of the Rivers State crisis and the same Mr. Wike was accused of allegedly plotting to kill the Chairman of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Mr. Dan Nwanyanwu. The same Mr. Wike, who has not explained how his children acquired mansions in Florida State, USA, has now started meeting with the former Chairman of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Abure. The PDP will not go into extinction. They will rebuild their party after we have defeated the unpatriotic, corrupt and lawless ruling party.\n\nWith the continued defections from PDP to the APC, the ruling party now controls two-thirds majority in the National Assembly. What are the implications of this?\n\nThe implications include the consolidation of the lawless, incompetent, corrupt and unpatriotic Tinubu dictatorship. It also indicates the climax and subsequent inevitable decline of the dictatorship and the mass defeat of the unpatriotic and corrupt political crooks that have dominated politics in Nigeria. You may need to be reminded that higher profile politicians have defected from the unpatriotic and failed ruling party to other parties, including a former National Chairman, HE John Oyegun; a former National Vice Chairman, Alhaji Salihu Lukman; former presidential aspirants, former governors and former ministers.\n\nWhat is your advice to the new Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Joash Amupitan?\n\nMy advice to the new INEC Chairman is to try to follow the path of integrity and not disgrace his children and end up like Mahmood Yakubu, the worst INEC Chairman since Independence. We know that it is Jagaban Tinubu that appointed him, but his loyalty must be to God and his country and not to Jagaban Tinubu or any other person without basic education.","summary":"Chief Martin Onovo, a seasoned politician is the 2015 presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party (NCP).

This year’s recipients are actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford. Trump said they are a group of “incredible people” who represent the “very best in American arts and culture” and that, “I know most of them and I’ve been a fan of all of them.” “This is a group of icons whose work and accomplishments have inspired, uplifted and unified millions and millions of Americans,” said a tuxedo-clad Trump. “This is perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class of Kennedy Center Honorees ever assembled.” Trump’s takeover of the Kennedy Center Trump ignored the Kennedy Center and its premier awards program during his first term as president. But the Republican has instituted a series of changes since returning to office in January, most notably ousting its board of trustees and replacing them with GOP supporters who voted him in as chairman of the board. Trump also has criticized the center’s programming and its physical appearance, and has vowed to overhaul both. The president placed around each honoree’s neck a new medal that was designed, created and donated by jeweler Tiffany & Co., according to the Kennedy Center and Trump. It’s a gold disc etched on one side with the Kennedy Center’s image and rainbow colors. The honoree’s name appears on the reverse side with the date of the ceremony. The medallion hangs from a navy blue ribbon and replaces a large rainbow ribbon decorated with three gold plates that rested on the honoree’s shoulders and chest. Trump honors the honorees Strait, wearing a cowboy hat, was first to receive his medal. When the country singer started to take off the hat, Trump said, “If you want to leave it on, you can. I think we can get it through.” But Strait took it off. The president said Crawford was a “great star of Broadway” for his lead role in the long-running “Phantom of the Opera.” Of Gaynor, he said, “We have the disco queen, and she was indeed, and nobody did it like Gloria Gaynor.” Trump was effusive about his friend Stallone, calling him a “wonderful” and “spectacular” person and “one of the true, great movie stars” and “one of the great legends.” Kiss is an “incredible rock band,” he said. Songs by honorees Gaynor and Kiss played in the Rose Garden just outside the Oval Office as members of the White House press corps waited nearby for Trump to begin the ceremony. The president said in August that he was “about 98% involved” in choosing the 2025 honorees when he personally announced them at the Kennedy Center, the first slate chosen under his leadership. The honorees traditionally had been announced by press release. It was unclear how they were chosen. Before Trump, it fell to a bipartisan selection committee. “These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation. The greatest that we’ve seen,” Trump said. “We can hardly imagine the country music phenomena without its king of country, or American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom — and that was a phantom, let me tell you — or rock and roll without its hottest band in the world, and that’s what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.” “Each of you has made an indelible mark on American life and together you have defined entire genres and set new standards for the performing arts,” Trump said. Trump was also attending an annual State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday. In years past, the honorees received their medallions there but Trump moved the ceremony to the White House. Trump to host the Kennedy Center Honors Meanwhile, the glitzy Kennedy Center Honors program and its series of tribute speeches and performances for each recipient is set to be taped on Sunday at the performing arts center for broadcast later in December on CBS and Paramount+. Trump is to attend the program for the first time as president, accompanied by his wife, first lady Melania Trump. The president said in August that he had agreed to host the show, and he seemed to confirm on Saturday that he would do so, predicting that the broadcast would garner its highest ratings ever as a result. Presidents traditionally attend the program and sit with the honorees in the audience. None has ever served as host. He said he looked forward to Sunday’s celebration. “It’s going to be something that I believe, and I’m going to make a prediction: this will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done and they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there’s nothing like what’s going to happen tomorrow night,” Trump said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-presents-medals-kennedy-center-honorees-oval-office-ceremony-rcna247791","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/25126-trump-kennedy-center-rc-706p-178e47.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:10:55","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.162},{"id":385737026,"title":"Hegseth says Monroe Doctrine ‘stronger than ever’ with Trump Corollary","text":"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking at Reagan National Defense Forum in California, said the “Monroe Doctrine is in effect, and stronger than ever under the Trump Corollary.” This corollary was added in the new National Security Strategy from President Donald Trump.\n\n“The War Department stands ready to take focused and to fight decisive action that advances U.S. interests,” Hegseth said Saturday in his keynote address. “This is the Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, recently codified so clearly in the National Security Strategy. After years of neglect, the United States will restore U.S. military dominance in the Western Hemisphere. We will use it to protect our homeland and access to key terrain throughout the region.”\n\nHe said the U.S. “will also deny adversaries ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities in our hemisphere.”\n\n“Past administrations perpetuated the belief that the Monroe Doctrine had expired,” Hegseth said. “They were wrong.” He went on to call the Monroe Doctrine is in effect “a common sense restoration of our power and prerogatives in this hemisphere, consistent with U.S. interests.”\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine\n\nThe National Security Strategy published this week states that “after years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere, and to protect our homeland and our access to key geographies throughout the region.”\n\n“We will deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere,” the NSS said. “This ‘Trump Corollary’ to the Monroe Doctrine is a common-sense and potent restoration of American power and priorities, consistent with American security interests.”\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine was part of former President James Monroe’s message to Congress on Dec. 2, 1823, and asserted that European powers were not to interfere in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere. It came 11 years after the end of the War of 1812, which put the U.S. against the British. \n\nWhile the Trump Corollary lays out several demands when it comes to the Western hemisphere, particularly in Latin America, experts Straight Arrow News spoke to said it’s not exactly clear what this means in terms of actual policy and implementation. \n\nAccording to the NSS, the Trump administration’s goals for the Western Hemisphere under the corollary are to “enlist established friends in the Hemisphere to control migration, stop drug flows, and strengthen stability and security on land and sea,” while also “cultivating and strengthening new partners while bolstering our own nation’s appeal as the Hemisphere’s economic and security partner of choice.\n\nStephen Rabe, emeritus professor of history at the University of Texas-Dallas, previously told SAN this is “an attempt to reassert that the United States is the hegemonic power in Latin America.”\n\n“What they mean is that the United States will be the most powerful country acting on Latin America, right?” McPherson said. “And so, what is that? Another word for Imperialism.”\n\nPart of what the Trump Corollary in the NSS includes is “targeted deployments to secure the border and defeat cartels, including where necessary the use of lethal force to replace the failed law enforcement-only strategy of the last several decades.”\n\nThe U.S. has been expanding its military presence in the Caribbean following the bombing of alleged drug boats and threats from Trump of military action in Venezuela.\n\nCriticism of boat strikes\n\nHowever, these actions, particularly the strikes on boats accused of carrying drugs, have elicited criticism from Latin American leaders as well as bipartisan members of Congress. While Hegseth defended the strikes in his remarks Saturday, saying that Trump “can and will take decisive military action as he sees fit,” some in Congress accused him of committing war crimes.\n\nAfter a closed-door congressional hearing on Thursday over the authority of Navy Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley to issue a second strike on survivors of one attack, Rep.

Saying the strikes are justified to protect Americans, Hegseth likened the fight to the war on terror following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\n\n\"If you're working for a designated terrorist organization and you bring drugs to this country in a boat, we will find you and we will sink you. Let there be no doubt about it,\" Hegseth said during his keynote address at the Reagan National Defense Forum. \"President Trump can and will take decisive military action as he sees fit to defend our nation's interests. Let no country on earth doubt that for a moment.\"\n\nThe most recent strike brings the death toll of the campaign to at least 87 people. Lawmakers have sought more answers about the attacks and their legal justification, and whether U.S. forces were ordered to launch a follow-up strike following a September attack even after the Pentagon knew of survivors.\n\nThough Hegseth compared the alleged drug smugglers to Al-Qaida terrorists, experts have noted significant differences between the two foes and the efforts to combat them.\n\nHegseth's remarks came after the Trump administration released its new national security strategy, one that paints European allies as weak and aims to reassert America's dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nDuring the speech, Hegseth also discussed the need to check China's rise through strength instead of conflict. He repeated Trump's vow to resume nuclear testing on an equal basis as China and Russia - a goal that has alarmed many nuclear arms experts. China and Russia haven't conducted explosive tests in decades, though the Kremlin said it would follow the U.S. if Trump restarted tests.\n\nThe speech was delivered at the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in California, an event which brings together top national security experts from around the country. Hegseth used the visit to argue that Trump is Reagan's \"true and rightful heir\" when it comes to muscular foreign policy.\n\nBy contrast, Hegseth criticized Republican leaders in the years since Reagan for supporting wars in the Middle East and democracy-building efforts that didn't work. He also blasted those who have argued that climate change poses serious challenges to military readiness.\n\n\"The war department will not be distracted by democracy building, interventionism, undefined wars, regime change, climate change, woke moralizing and feckless nation building,\" he said.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/pete-hegseth-defends-strikes-alleged-cartel-boats-venezuela-says-president-trump-can-order-use-force-he-sees-fit/18258694/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18258724_AP25336628389676.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:06:59","author":"David Klepper","authors":["David Klepper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.301},{"id":385735360,"title":"Viral video: Cinnabon Wisconsin employee harasses Somali couple with racist slurs, gets fired","text":"Cinnabon dismissed an employee from its Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin, franchise after a viral video captured the worker harassing a Somali couple with racist comments and slurs.

About 50 students reportedly escaped, with 265 victims still missing.\n\nMental health experts warn that the relentless violent attacks are pushing more Nigerians into depression, anxiety disorders, and substance dependence, stressing that the country’s overstretched health system may be unable to cope if the crisis worsens.\n\nThey further warned that persistent kidnappings, violent attacks, and the climate of fear gripping communities would fuel psychological distress on a scale that threatens public health.\n\nThe experts, who spoke exclusively with PUNCH Healthwise, said the resurgence of violence and kidnappings had deepened mental health implications beyond the immediate victims.\n\nThe President of the Association of Psychiatrists in Nigeria, Prof. Taiwo Obindo, explained that the psychological impact begins with anxiety, often developing into more severe conditions if not properly addressed.\n\nAccording to him, fear created by persistent insecurity shapes behaviour in significant ways.\n\n Obindo noted, “One, it generally creates anxiety. This anxiety makes people afraid to go out. Many develop phobias about leaving their homes. One of the immediate mental health conditions that emerges is internalised anxiety disorder, where people are afraid but cannot clearly pinpoint the source of their fear.”\n\nThe consultant psychiatrist stated that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is one of the most common conditions arising from insecurity and widespread violence.\n\nObindo, a Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Jos, Plateau State, noted that Nigerians do not have to be direct victims before experiencing the emotional aftermath.\n\n“The major condition that often follows is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. A person does not have to experience the incident directly; merely having knowledge of it, watching it, or hearing about it can create fear”, he said.\n\nAccording to him, PTSD triggers episodes that are activated whenever individuals encounter anything that reminds them of insecurity, such as certain locations or news reports.\n\nThe don said, “Anxiety involves irrational fear, and PTSD heightens this. Anytime the person passes through a particular place or hears a similar story, it triggers tension, heightened apprehension, poor sleep, and difficulty functioning.”\n\nThe mental health experts said many Nigerians also slip into depression during periods of insecurity, including people who have been released from abductions but lack psychosocial support.\n\nHe noted, “A lot of people also become depressed during such periods. This is not limited to those affected directly. Even those who are released may not be receiving proper psychosocial support or psychological first aid.”\n\nObindo added that family members of victims also suffer emotional distress due to fear, prolonged uncertainty, and the shock of violent incidents. \n\nInsecurity, he pointed out, not only affects psychological well-being but also places a heavy toll on physical health, particularly cardiovascular function.\n\nHe added that anxiety triggers chemicals that constrict blood vessels, placing dangerous pressure on the heart.\n\nHe said, “Living in this constant state of fear and uncertainty also affects physical health. Hypertension is one of the major outcomes. Anxiety triggers the release of certain chemicals that constrict blood vessels, forcing the heart to pump against higher resistance, which can lead to high blood pressure.”\n\nObindo said insecurity has ripple effects on families, workplaces and communities, disrupting social organisation and productivity.\n\nHe noted that economic activities are also being crippled as fear keeps people indoors, leading to reduced income and lower workplace performance.\n\nHe said, “It affects people’s economies. Traders are not selling as they should because they are afraid to go out. Workers are not functioning well at their jobs, which affects productivity, one of the pillars of mental health.\n\n“Others who still go to work operate far below their usual capacity; someone used to functioning at 70–80% may now be working at 40% or less.”\n\nOn coping strategies, he stressed the need for interventions at individual, family, community and government levels to address the mental health burden.\n\nObindo urged individuals to understand the signs of emotional distress and seek help from professionals rather than spiritual or informal sources.\n\nHe said, “If they notice persistent issues, poor sleep, poor appetite, irritability, altered thought patterns, inability to interact, they should seek appropriate care. Not from spiritualists, but from proper mental health professionals.”\n\nAlso speaking, a Clinical Psychologist at Imo State University, Prof. Nkwam Uwaoma, warned that constant exposure to violence fuels traumatic stress and phobic disorders.\n\nUwaoma explained that repeated exposure to violent incidents leads to flashbacks, panic and heightened sensitivity to triggers.\n\nHe added, “Constant insecurity leads people to become highly phobic and extremely fearful. Any slight trigger can cause panic.”\n\nAccording to him, prolonged fear disrupts brain chemistry and can cause social withdrawal, depressive disorders and dysfunctional interactions.\n\nHe said, “It can even lead to depressive disorders because repeated exposure to insecurity leaves people feeling helpless.”\n\nUwaoma added that insecurity destabilises entire families and communities, often leaving people numb and detached from empathy.\n\n“The environment becomes dangerous for mental health, and people lose confidence in life,” the psychologist said.\n\nBeyond emotional conditions, he said, insecurity also pushes many Nigerians into drug abuse as they seek escape from trauma.\n\nHe said, “When people become traumatised, they often look for an escape, and many turn to drugs. Drug abuse under such lawless and unstable conditions can further worsen insecurity in society.”","summary":"Mental health experts warn that rising insecurity in Nigeria is causing a surge in depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

The scarcity persists despite the Federal Government’s repeated assurances of increasing domestic funding and its pledge to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. JANET OGUNDEPO reports\n\nWhen Danladi Adamu woke up on January 20, 2025, he had no idea that a single announcement would drive a sword deep into his heart.\n\nThat morning, news broke that the United States Government had paused all foreign assistance, a decision that immediately threatened the flow of life-saving HIV medicines and treatment to many countries, including Nigeria.\n\nBeing a Person Living with HIV for over 25 years, the news felt like a verdict as fear engulfed him.\n\n“Those of us who follow the news closely rushed to our treatment centres immediately to confirm if the report was true,” Adamu recounted, frustration clear in his voice.\n\n “Many of us turned up even though it wasn’t our appointment day, hoping we could get extra medication before things got worse,” he told PUNCH Healthwise.\n\nThe situation created chaos and psychological trauma.\n\n‘The announcement brought a lot of psychological trauma to us. Till now, we are yet to recover,’ Adamu, who lives in Bauchi State, said.\n\nAdamu, a member of the Network of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS, expressed thanks that despite the initial panic, he and other PLHIV continued to get their drugs.\n\nHowever, the bigger challenge came when several test kit requests received no corresponding response.\n\nUnarguably, the reality of the funding cuts had finally hit them.\n\nFurther confirming the situation to PUNCH Healthwise is the Bauchi State NEPWHAN coordinator, Abdullahi Ibrahim.\n\nHe lamented that while there has been stability in the availability of ARTs, testing kits remain inadequate.\n\n“We ran out of test kits in November, and as of this month, the test kits are not available,” Ibrahim said.\n\nHe stated that this had slowed down efforts to engage in community testing, further impeding efforts to achieve the 95-95-95 global target to end AIDS by 2030.\n\n“If we are running out of these test kits, the goal that 95 per cent of the population should know their status would not be achieved.\n\n“But when we write to persons who are in charge or have the means to supply the test kits, we would be told that they are not available. This is a great problem because the spread of the virus would be more since many people now do not know they are HIV positive,” Ibrahim said.\n\nThe Bauchi NEPWHAN coordinator noted that the situation has left them to only test for HIV in pregnant women, leaving a gap in the general population.\n\nPUNCH Healthwise findings further reveal that Bauchi, one of the states in the North-eastern geopolitical zone, was not alone in the scarcity of HIV test kits.\n\nNo test kit, many problems\n\nA TB/HIV Specialist, Dr Dan Onwujekwe, asserted that testing is the entry point of HIV care, stating that the lack of access to free test kits poses a lot of problems.\n\nHe stated that the scarcity of test kits began after the funding cut announcement, stressing that since then, access to HIV testing had become a challenge.\n\nOnwujekwe said, “Testing is the entry point to HIV care. And if we don’t have these kits as the first point of access, particularly if they are not free of charge in some places, then we have a problem.\n\n“If we are not able to test and identify people with HIV and make access trouble-free, the virus is going to spread. Just like TB, that’s also related to HIV. At times, people are not able to test. We have had this shortage of test kits since the Trump administration. I don’t know whether they have corrected that. But it’s not as smooth as before. You have to identify the disease in the individuals, quantify the burden, and then other responses will follow. For both epidemics, we are in trouble if we don’t correct this issue of the deficiency of test kits.”\n\nThe funding crisis\n\nThe United States Government slashed its foreign aid budgets soon after Donald Trump took office on January 20 as the 47th US president.\n\nUnder Trump, the US government halted funding for the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a global health investment introduced in 2003. With the halt in funding for HIV response, counselling initiatives and programmes, including testing, education, and community support, have been affected in countries like Nigeria that rely heavily on foreign donors for their HIV response.\n\nAccording to UNAIDS, PEPFAR has saved more than 26 million lives and averted almost five million new HIV infections by investing in critical HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support programmes in 55 countries. As of December 2024, over 20 million people, including about 560,000 children, were receiving life-saving antiretroviral treatment through the programme.\n\nUNAIDS warned that the discontinuation of the HIV programmes would lead to an additional 6.6 million new HIV infections and 4.2 million AIDS-related deaths globally.\n\nAn estimated two million Nigerians are living with HIV, with children making up a significant and vulnerable segment of this population, according to the National Agency for the Control of AIDS.\n\nThe funding cuts, HIV experts and advocates who spoke to PUNCH Healthwise say, would further impede the progress in achieving the 95-95-95 global goal to end AIDS by 2030.\n\nThe goals seek to ensure that 95 per cent of people know their status, 95 per cent of those diagnosed get sustained antiretroviral therapy, ART, and 95 per cent of those on treatment achieve viral suppression, effectively stopping transmission and improving health.\n\nViral load suppression means that the ART has lowered the amount of HIV in the blood to an undetectable level, preventing transmission and improving immune function.\n\nHIV, the World Health Organisation says, has no cure. It is only treated with antiretroviral drugs to stop the virus from replicating in the body.\n\nSince the January 20 announcement, PUNCH Healthwise reports that the Federal Government of Nigeria, through NACA, approved a $200 million intervention fund to bridge the funding gap.\n\nThe FG also established the Presidential Initiative for Unlocking the Healthcare Value Chain to promote domestic production and boost local manufacturing of ARV and diagnostic test kits.\n\nHowever, findings by PUNCH Healthwise reveal that while PLHIV have uninterrupted access to life-saving medication, there is a scarcity of test kits for the general population, a scarcity of second and third-line drugs and paediatric ARTs.\n\nAlso, since the January 20 announcement, the fear of the withdrawal of other donors has been a constant companion of PLHIV in the country. Although the FG and states have picked up the programmes, they express concern that the services may not be as good as those provided by international donors.\n\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund has warned that 1.8 million children could die of AIDS-related causes by 2040 unless countries urgently scale up HIV services for mothers, children and adolescents.\n\nUNICEF raised the alarm in its statement to commemorate World AIDS Day 2025, lamenting that shrinking funding and persistent gaps in early diagnosis and treatment were putting millions of young lives at risk.\n\nAccording to recently published UNICEF-UNAIDS modelling, if programme coverage declines by half, an additional 1.1 million children could acquire HIV and another 820,000 could die by 2040, pushing the total toll among children to three million infections and 1.8 million deaths.\n\nUNICEF Associate Director of HIV and AIDS, Anurita Bains, said the world had been making progress before abrupt global funding cuts disrupted essential services, warning that ending AIDS in children is now in jeopardy. She said countries moved quickly to mitigate the impact of funding disruptions, but without focused action, decades of gains risk being reversed and millions of young lives could be lost.\n\nTo further examine the impact of the funding cuts on HIV response across the country, PUNCH Healthwise spoke to People Living with HIV and the coordinators of the Network of Persons Living with HIV and AIDS across the six geopolitical zones in the country.\n\nNEPWHAN is the umbrella body representing all people living with HIV in Nigeria.\n\nAll PLHIV who spoke to PUNCH Healthwise are open about their status and gave consent for their names to be used.\n\nA few test kits in the South East\n\nFindings by PUNCH Healthwise in Enugu and Anambra States also reveal inadequate test kits in the SouthEast Region.\n\nNews of the funding crisis hit a PLHIV in Anambra State, Amaka Adindu, like a sudden blow. The reality of the situation unravelled when test kits and other commodities dried up like the January harmattan wind.\n\n“In the facility, drugs that were usually given for six months began to be reduced to two weeks. The cost of transportation to the centres at that short time was distressing. The care workers paid by the donors stopped work. It was a tough time in January,” Adindu said.\n\nGradually, the drugs became more available and were dispensed for three months to clients.\n\n“But the challenge we are having now is the unavailability of test kits. Sometimes, we’re only given a few quantities, and it is usually limited to those coming to the facilities,” the Anambra NEPWHAN coordinator told PUNCH Healthwise.\n\nShe called on the government to take up and sustain HIV intervention programmes in the country.\n\nIn Enugu, the NEPWHAN coordinator, Lilian Agbo, said the funding withdrawal created a gap in the HIV programmes in the state, leading to worry and emotional trauma among PLHIV.\n\nShe stated that while the FG’s intervention helped in ensuring continuous access to drugs, the dearth of test kits in the state has posed a challenge.\n\nAgbo stated that while the combo test kits were available, they were limited.\n\nShe further noted that the cost of chemistry testing, that is, kidney/liver monitoring tests for PLHIV, has become a challenge, calling for increased government intervention.\n\nFunding crisis vs test kits South-South\n\nNEPWHAN coordinator for Rivers State, Blessing Chigozim, said the funding cut did not affect the availability and accessibility of drugs, but there has been a reduction in the number of months given to each client.\n\nAs with other states, test kits have become hard to come by.\n\n“Test kits are no longer available as they used to be. Before you can talk about those who need treatment, they need to get tested. The mandate of NEPWHAN as a network is community engagement, so the lack of test kits for the community leaves them out,” Chigozim said.\n\nShe further stated that the situation has left many residents unaware of their status.\n\nThe Rivers NEPWHAN cord stated that the community focus was on PMTCT, emphasising the need for sustainability of HIV programmes.\n\nShe also fears for the future of PLHIV if the ad hoc staff of the donor partners leaves, pleading with the government to absorb the staff working in the facilities. \n\nUNAIDS confirms situation\n\nUNAIDS country update on the impact of the US funding cuts shows that over 95 per cent of community workers received stop-work orders, though about two-thirds have been recalled. The report confirmed that while immediate access to antiretrovirals remains stable, testing and case-finding activities have stalled significantly.\n\nPUNCH Healthwise reports that activities for the 2025 World AIDS Day on December 1 were affected by the funding crisis, with a lack of test kits hindering the community testing programme, a highlight of the day’s event.\n\nTroubling situation in Jigawa, North West\n\nAside from the nationwide scarcity of test kits, the funding crisis has led to the dearth of paediatric ARTs.\n\n“The funding crisis has cut off the procurement of test kits by the partners about six months ago. The government is now the one providing test kits. The government’s response is making us afraid because the funders are leaving by March next year,” Abdullahi Ibrahim, the Jigawa State NEPWHAN coordinator, said.\n\nContinuing, he said, “There are complaints from some facilities, even in Jigawa State, that there are no drugs, most especially paediatric drugs. The partners were telling us that they were expecting a supply since last month, but have yet to get it and have no idea when it will be supplied. We have informed the Deputy Governor of the state and the partners. They assured me that the drugs would be provided before December 15.”\n\nThe Jigawa State NEPWHAN cord mentioned that PLHIV are being enrolled in the state’s health insurance programme, and a trust fund has been launched for philanthropists and companies’ corporate social responsibility programmes to contribute and ensure the sustainability of the HIV programmes.\n\nFCT faces scarcity of second-line drugs, testing kits\n\nTo feel the pulse of the funding cuts in the North Central, PUNCH Healthwise spoke with the NEPWHAN coordinator of the Federal Capital Territory, Peter Ikiti.\n\nHe mentioned that while the first-line ARTs were available, many PLHIV using the second and third line ARTs were finding it difficult to get their medications.\n\n“We do not have a problem with the first-line drug. For a very long time now, we have had an issue with the accessibility of the second and third-line drugs,” he said.\n\nSpeaking on PLHIV who are supposed to receive and use the second and third line of drugs, Ikiti said, “Everyone should be placed on first-line drugs, but in a situation where the first-line drug fails, it will now be switched over to second-line drugs, which are a bit different from first-line drugs.\n\n“And when that one also fails, it can now be migrated to third-line drugs. These are higher levels of drugs.”\n\nThe TB and HIV Specialist, Onwujekwe, explained that second-line drugs are given to PLHIV when treatment failure and resistance have been identified with the first-line drugs.\n\nThe implications of the scarcity of second and third line ARTs, Onwujekwe said, “Means people will remain on a failing regimen for longer than necessary. Thus, the virus will not be controlled, and if behavioural change is not practised, then resistance to the virus will change. And that means that in the near future or far future, we will have strains in circulation that we cannot control and treat.”\n\nThe FCT NEPWHAN coordinator further revealed that getting the testing kits has become difficult, describing the situation as “an issue of emergency action.”\n\nIkiti further lamented the disengagement of some members due to the funding cuts, stating that the source of income of such PLHIV has been disrupted, leading to malnutrition.\n\nHe accused the government of focusing mostly on treatment and prevention while neglecting care and support, which, he said, are needed to work together to achieve a holistic HIV intervention.\n\n“Then, there are the other areas of intervention that are actually carried out effectively to become a comprehensive intervention. But, unfortunately, what we see at the moment is the treatment and the prevention. Care and support actually get to the background to the level that nobody cares about those who are dying due to malnutrition, particularly for the indigent ones,” Ikiti said.\n\nThe FCT NEPWHAN urged the government to intervene and ensure indigent PLHIV have access to proper nutrition, while upscaling the availability of testing kits and second and third-line ARTs.\n\nLow funds, reduced outreach\n\nOutreach activities are important for PLHIV. Outreach programmes are part of the measures to achieve the 95 per cent of people living with HIV know their status goal.\n\nIn Borno, another North-Eastern State, the situation is slightly different. The NEPWHAN coordinator, Maina Shettima, stated that although ARTs and test kits are available, the funding cuts led to reduced outreach activities, as there “was no fuel for the cars, so they were parked and some of the drivers are no longer around.”\n\nNEPWHAN coordinator for Gombe State, Mohammed Sabo, says that although they have access to ARTs and test kits, the care workers and manpower are not available. He called on the state government to adopt short-term hired care workers to ensure PLHIV in the state have continuous access to the service providers.\n\nMixed response in South West\n\nFindings from the South West reveal that while some states have test kits and access to drugs, some are battling with “no test kits.”\n\nFor example, in Oyo State, the HIV programme suffered a major breakdown in early 2025 following the US “stop-work order,” which disrupted drug access, halted testing, locked up the state drug warehouse, and crippled service delivery.\n\nThe NEPWHAN coordinator, Faith Olawale, said that although drug supply has since stabilised, the state still faces a critical shortage of HIV test kits and can no longer conduct essential kidney and liver monitoring for patients.\n\n“Everybody is assessing treatment and other services, but in our state, we don’t have adequate kits. So, most of our members who go to the communities don’t have these kits,” Olawale said.\n\nAvailable drugs, PrEP in Lagos\n\nThe situation in Lagos State is positive. The Lagos NEPWHAN Coordinator, Mr Patrick Akpan, said that ART and test kits were available and accessible in the state.\n\nAkpan, who has lived with the virus for over 20 years, said that despite the funding cuts, the US government has not stopped giving medication.\n\n“Treatment, that is, drugs, is one of the things they retain. So it’s still coming from the American government. It is other activities that relate to prevention, like PrEP, that have been stopped.\n\n“Issues of care and support are the areas that they are not supporting. Some of the care and support meetings that we had before, all those programs like support groups where people living with HIV meet together to learn about the treatment and all that, most of them are no longer being supported. So these are some of the things that actually have been stopped,” the Lagos NEPWHAN coordinator said.\n\nPrEP is a prophylaxis that is being given to people to prevent them from contracting the virus.\n\nHe further noted that Lagos State, “has taken up the issue of PrEP and responsibility to fund it. They didn’t stop completely; they only said that it can only be given to pregnant women or discordant couples. But now the Lagos State Government has decided to open it up for everyone.\n\n“So the Lagos state government has made provision for people to walk into general hospitals and get PrEP services.”\n\nEfforts to get the comment of the NEPWHAN National Coordinator, Abdulkadir Ibrahim, were unsuccessful as PUNCH Healthwise learnt that he was attending the ICASA Conference in Ghana.\n\nLack of testing kits strains HIV control – Experts\n\nA Researcher on HIV and TB Management Control at the Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki, Prof Lawrence Ogbonnaya, said funding challenges continue to weaken Nigeria’s health system.\n\nHe stated, “Generally, there is very poor funding for health in Nigeria, and it affects what the health system can deliver. You can imagine controlling HIV/AIDS if you cannot conduct testing and know the status of people.”\n\nThe professor of Community Medicine explained that the epidemic is sustained by undiagnosed and undisclosed infections.\n\nHe emphasised that testing remains the first and most critical step in controlling the disease.\n\n“So, controlling HIV/AIDS begins with being able to test and identify that you are positive. Once a person tests positive, then the person begins treatment because science has demonstrated that early treatment helps reduce transmission. It reduces the propensity for the person to transmit to other people,” the don said.\n\nOgbonnaya said donor cuts have affected progress, saying, “So, the cutting of donors has seriously affected our work and our ability to sustain the gains we made with HIV/AIDS response. So, what we are even praying for is that our international partners will keep their promise of continuing to supply the ART drugs to those who are already on it, because it will be a real calamity and crisis if we now begin to lack drugs.”\n\n‘Lack of paediatric ARTs troubling’\n\nThe don described the lack of paediatric ARTs as troubling, stating that, “Now, concerning pediatric ARTs, generally, there is a serious under-reporting of pediatric cases of HIV. And that is because we are not able to routinely do any infant diagnosis. If a mother is positive and delivers a baby, that baby will undergo Early Infant Diagnosis to see if the baby is positive. So, we can place that child on treatment immediately.”\n\nSpeaking on the reasons for the neglect of paediatric PLHIV, Ogbonnaya criticised the lack of advocacy for children living with HIV, despite their being part of vulnerable populations.\n\n“It is usually said that pregnant women and children are vulnerable populations, but nobody is speaking for the children. Apart from those of us who are healthcare workers speaking for them, the children cannot talk for themselves,” the professor of Medicine said.\n\nHe further emphasised the need for increased funding, stating that persistent funding gaps could cause the country to lose the war on HIV.\n\n“HIV cases will increase, both among children and adults, that is the implication. And that will be a very serious matter,” the HIV/TB expert said.\n\nAlso speaking, a former Principal Investigator, AIDS Prevention Initiative Nigeria, Harvard PEPFAR, Onwujekwe, emphasised the need for government intervention, stating that the continuous reliance on donors had to stop.\n\n“We cannot always rely on donors, and these things are becoming glaring in our country,” the former Research Fellow at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos, asserted.\n\nOffering solutions, the TB/HIV specialist stressed the need for local manufacturing of the test kits, calling for an end to the dependence on imported test kits.\n\n“I don’t see why we cannot manufacture test kits by now. We must think about a holistic approach. We can’t always depend on imported test kits. By now, we should be able to produce our own test kits that are sensitive, specific, and like every other one.\n\n“It’s been over 40 years since the pandemic started. By now, we should have test kits, homemade, so that we’re not talking about imported test kits. It’s the same thing with drugs. By now, we should be having our own production of drugs. We should be self-sufficient in homemade test kits, homemade drugs, and I’m sure we have capable facilities and hands that can do these things locally. It can be done, there’s no rocket science anymore,” Onwujekwe said.\n\n NACA keeps mum\n\nEfforts to obtain NACA’s reaction were unsuccessful, as the agency’s Head of Public Relations and Protocol, Mrs. Toyin Aderibigbe, told our correspondent that the Director-General, Dr. Temitope Ilori, the official best positioned to address the issue was out of the country.","summary":"A critical HIV test shortage grips Nigeria following US aid cuts.

(And almost as bad, at least for this world’s journalists, Ashley Barrett appears to Homelander’s White House press secretary.)\n\n“You wouldn’t be the first throwing your life away in a war, but you would be the first saving the world doing it,” Karl Urban’s Butcher tells his crew in the trailer.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nCyber Monday Streaming Deals 2025: Hulu, Disney+, DirecTV and More\n\n'Gen V' Star Hamish Linklater on Trump Comparisons and 'The Boys' Villains: \"Who Do You Root For?\"\n\nThe show has a new release date of April 8, 2026, when the first two episodes bow, leading up to a series finale on May 20, 2026.\n\nThe series has become a flagship property for Prime, spawning the spinoff Gen V and being at the center of the zeitgeist for the streamer. It also has history of unintentionally being prescient, mirroring real-life events like the Jan. 6 riots, for example. Creator Erik Kripke recalled to The Hollywood Reporter last year how he and executive producers pitched the show in 2016, amid the political rise of Donald Trump, something that altered the course of The Boys.\n\n“We just wanted to do a very realistic version of a superhero show, one where superheroes are celebrities behaving badly. Trump was the, ‘He’s not really getting the nomination, is he?’ guy,” he recalled. “When he got elected, we had a metaphor that said more about the current world. Suddenly, we were telling a story about the intersection of celebrity and authoritarianism and how social media and entertainment are used to sell fascism. We’re right in the eye of the storm. And once we realized that, I just felt an obligation to run in that direction as far as we could.”\n\nKripke was joined onstage in Brazil by stars Erin Moriarty, Laz Alonso, Karen Fukuhara, Tomer Capone and Colby Minifie.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\n‘School Spirits’ Reveals First Look at Season 3, Sets January Return\n\n‘Percy Jackson’ Heads into ‘Fortnite’ Ahead of Season 2 TV Premiere\n\n‘The Testaments’ Reveals First Look at ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Sequel Series Coming in 2026\n\n‘Paradise’ Sets a Return Date, Reveals Where Sterling K.

It was the land of freedom… and people in Europe just didn’t believe that it could ever go like that.”\n\nShe said reaction to the novel was “split” and some people would tell her “that would never happen here”.\n\nShe added: “I’ve always been somebody who has never believed it can’t happen here. It can happen anywhere, given the circumstances.”\n\nAsked about the book’s longevity, she added: “Well it’s (what happens in the book) a perennial possibility, right? Then in 2016 everything changed again, and we are now in that period where The Handmaid’s Tale has become much closer.\n\n“Not the outfits. I don’t think we’re going to get the outfits, but the rest of it seems more and more plausible.”\n\nThe handmaids in the book wear red cloaks, symbolising their role as breeders, as well as white bonnets called wings, which gives them limited vision and hides the view of their full face.\n\nWomen across the US have worn red cloaks and wings while protesting against the administration of US President Donald Trump, who has taken credit for returning the abortion debate to the agenda and helping overturn the Roe v Wade ruling on abortion rights.\n\nAtwood added: “These kinds of regimes don’t last, partly because they become unsustainable. This particular one seems quite chaotic.\n\n“Also, let us not count America out. It’s first of all a lot more diverse than it might appear from a distance. Second, Americans are quite ornery.\n\n“They do not like people telling them all to line up and do what they’re told. They really don’t like that, but they don’t like being bossed around by anybody right or left.”\n\nAtwood is known for writing sci-fi and dystopian fiction, exploring topics to do with technology, identity and totalitarianism, though she has referred to these books as speculative fiction, telling The Guardian in 2003: “Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.”\n\nAtwood told Radio 4: “I wanted to be able to point to the source of whatever idea they were enacting and say, ‘Don’t say that I just made this up out of my twisted and weird imagination.’\n\n“Somebody said on Twitter, now X, ‘How does Margaret Atwood come up with this weird shit?’\n\n“I said, ‘It’s not me that comes up with this weird shit. It’s the human race.’ Which it has throughout history. So chapter and verse, it’s all happened.”\n\nAtwood has won numerous accolades and picked up the Booker Prize in 2000 for The Blind Assassin and again in 2019 for her sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale.\n\nHer other books include The Edible Woman, the Oryx And Crake trilogy, Alias Grace and Lady Oracle.\n\nDesert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 10am and is also available on BBC Sounds.","summary":"The book tells the story of subjugated women called handmaids who are forced to be natal slaves.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/margaret-atwood-donald-trump-booker-prize-science-fiction-women-b1261480.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/12/07/00/06131849-b6d5f430-0b9f-4e3d-8580-7378fbc5208c.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:01:00","author":"Hannah Roberts","authors":["Hannah Roberts"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":385732360,"title":"The Handmaid’s Tale author fears her dystopian novel can ‘now happen anywhere’","text":"Award-winning author Margaret Atwood has stated that the dystopian future depicted in her seminal novel, The Handmaid’s Tale, is becoming \"more and more plausible\" in the contemporary world. \n\nThe Canadian writer, 86, whose 1985 book and its 2019 Booker Prize-winning sequel, The Testaments, inspired the acclaimed television series, shared her evolving perspective on the story’s relevance.\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale envisions a United States transformed into the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian, theocratic regime where women are subjugated, with many forced into roles as \"handmaids\" – natal slaves tasked with repopulating a world grappling with widespread infertility. \n\nAtwood revealed that when she first conceived the plot, she considered it \"bonkers,\" recalling a time when \"America was the beacon of light.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, she elaborated: \"It was the democratic ideal. It was the land of freedom… and people in Europe just didn’t believe that it could ever go like that.\" \n\nShe noted that initial reactions to the novel were \"split,\" with many asserting, \"that would never happen here.\" However, Atwood maintained her own conviction: \"I’ve always been somebody who has never believed it can’t happen here. It can happen anywhere, given the circumstances.\"\n\nReflecting on the book's enduring impact, Atwood observed a significant shift in recent years.\n\n\"Well, it’s (what happens in the book) a perennial possibility, right?

This particular one seems quite chaotic,\" she remarked. \n\nShe also highlighted the resilience of the American populace: \"Also, let us not count America out. It’s first of all a lot more diverse than it might appear from a distance. Second, Americans are quite ornery. They do not like people telling them all to line up and do what they’re told. They really don’t like that, but they don’t like being bossed around by anybody right or left.\"\n\nAtwood, known for her exploration of technology, identity, and totalitarianism, prefers to categorise her works as speculative fiction rather than science fiction. \n\nAs she told The Guardian in 2003, \"Science fiction has monsters and spaceships; speculative fiction could really happen.\" \n\nShe reiterated this point on Radio 4, explaining her meticulous research: \"I wanted to be able to point to the source of whatever idea they were enacting and say, ‘Don’t say that I just made this up out of my twisted and weird imagination.’ Somebody said on Twitter/ X, ‘How does Margaret Atwood come up with this weird s**t?’ I said, ‘It’s not me that comes up with this weird s**t.

The silence has drawn sharp comparisons to other major artists, like Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo, who immediately demanded their music be removed from similar content.This placed a spotlight on Swift, with observers noting why the pop superstar has not voiced opposition or taken action. The White House TikTok video featuring her 'The Fate of Ophelia' track remains online. This fact has renewed discussion about Swift's lack of reaction after the recent incident involving the Please Please Please hitmaker.What's the Excuse, Taylor Swift?TikTok creator Kahlen Barry is among those who have called out Taylor Swift for her silence. In a video, Barry contrasted Swift's lack of reaction with the immediate public statements from Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo after the White House used their songs in videos promoting ICE.'So if you're still defending Taylor Swift and the way that she's been moving with this current administration, I know something about you,' Barry began. The creator pointed out that Swift is a much bigger star than Carpenter and Rodrigo combined, yet she has remained silent.'So at this point, I'm sorry. What is the excuse?' Barry asked. 'What is the excuse for Taylor Swift, who is more powerful than both of them, honestly, combined?' Barry expressed disbelief at Swift's silence, particularly given her public battle for ownership of her music, only to be 'complicit when people are using her music to fuel a very disgusting and harmful agenda.'A Contrast in ResponsesWhen Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter discovered the White House was using their songs, they both issued swift and forceful public rebukes.'Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,' Rodrigo reportedly wrote in a since-deleted comment on a video promoting self-deportation. Shortly after, the audio on the video was removed.Carpenter had a similar reaction after her song 'Juno' was used to promote ICE deportations. She called the video 'Evil and Disgusting' and stated, 'Do Not Involve Me in Your Inhumane Agenda.' The White House subsequently deleted that video.The TikTok video using Swift's song, 'The Fate of Ophelia,' remains accessible. The White House used a clip of the song, ending the video with the caption 'The fate of America.'History of Public FeudThe silence surprised many, given Swift's public feud with Donald Trump. In her 2020 documentary Miss Americana, her publicist warned her that Trump might come after her for speaking out politically, to which she replied, 'F**k that. I don't care.'Swift later endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 national election. In response, Trump reportedly took to social media and wrote, 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.' This history led many to assume she would immediately demand that the White House remove her track, but no statement has been issued.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/complicit-taylor-swift-draws-criticism-not-joining-sabrina-carpenter-olivia-rodrigo-condemning-1760857","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1768611/taylor-swift.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=fd6aae5b79a6069c119df3d5eeb32e09","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 23:57:35","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":385731460,"title":"Coast Guard nets 10 tons of cocaine in one seizure","text":"Dec. 6 (UPI) -- The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Munro seized more than 10 tons of cocaine from a drug-running vessel south of Mexico in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Tuesday.\n\nThe seizure from an open-bowed vessel that was equipped with three large outboard motors is the largest drug interdiction done at sea in nearly two decades, CBS News reported.\n\nThe interdiction began with a sniper in a helicopter targeting and disabling the drug boat's motor, which enabled the Munro's crew to board it and capture its crew and drug cargo.\n\nThe mission was carried out as part of the military's Operation Pacific Viper campaign against drug running on the open sea.\n\nAs part of the operation, the Coast Guard \"has accelerated counter-narcotics operations across the eastern Pacific and delivered historic results in the fight against narco-terrorists,\" Coast Guard officials said Friday in a post on X.\n\n\"Our maritime fighting force is leading America's drug interdiction operations, protecting the homeland and keeping deadly drugs out of American communities,\" Coast Guard officials said. \"This is where defense of America begins.\"\n\nThe amount of cocaine seized is capable of causing 7.5 million overdose deaths.\n\nThe U.S. Navy and Coast Guard initiated Operation Pacific Viper in August as part of President Donald Trump's effort to better protect U.S. citizens against illicit drugs and the cartels that smuggle them into the United States.\n\nThe Coast Guard in October reported seizing 100,000 pounds of cocaine in the eastern Pacific during the opening months of Operation Pacific Viper.\n\nIn November, the Coast Guard said it had seized more than 500,000 pounds of cocaine during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30.\n\nThe amount seized during the fiscal year is the most ever taken in a year by the Coast Guard and more than three times its average annual take of 167,000 pounds of the drug.","summary":"The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Munro seized more than 10 tons of cocaine from a drug-running vessel south of Mexico in the eastern Pacific Ocean.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/12/06/coast-guard-drug-seizure/8571765064275/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi_com/8571765064275/2025/1/d7a46c34504d3fd997dffcb7382f6e2e/v1.5/Coast-Guard-nets-10-tons-of-cocaine-in-one-seizure.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 23:53:40","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":385732810,"title":"Hegseth Defends Strikes On Alleged Cartel Boats, Says Trump Can Order Use Of Force 'As He Sees Fit'","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended strikes on alleged drug cartel boats during remarks Saturday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, saying President Donald Trump has the power to take military action “as he sees fit” to defend the nation.\n\nHegseth dismissed criticism of the strikes, which have killed more than 80 people and now face intense scrutiny over concerns that they violated international law.
