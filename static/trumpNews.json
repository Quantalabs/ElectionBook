Andrew Cuomo forced bail reform into his state budget with no debate and no regard for warnings from police, prosecutors, or victims’ advocates. \n\nWe still live with that damage today.\n\nThe federal government, under Trump’s leadership, is finally saying enough.\n\nAccountability is not cruelty — it is justice. \n\nSecured bail balances the presumption of innocence with public safety.\n\nAnd it works: Defendants return to court at far higher rates than in taxpayer-funded programs, at zero cost to the public.\n\nTrump’s order is a turning point. \n\nIt sends a clear message: America will no longer subsidize policies that endanger citizens and embolden criminals.\n\nMichelle Esquenazi is president of the National Association of Bail Agents and of the New York State Bail Association.","summary":"In New York and elsewhere, federal money was hijacked to bankroll “catch and release” no-bail policies that keep repeat offenders on the street and leave victims behind.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/28/opinion/trumps-bail-order-yanks-federal-cash-to-halt-risky-reforms/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/JTCB1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 00:26:35","author":"Michelle Esquenazi","authors":["Michelle Esquenazi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":355335258,"title":"BBC News quiz of the week: What food did Meghan reveal Harry doesn't like?","text":"This week saw Donald Trump fire the head of the US public health agency and a senior central bank official, SpaceX complete a successful test flight, and Manchester United humbled by League Two side Grimsby Town.\n\nBut how much attention did you pay to what else happened in the world over the past seven days?\n\nQuiz collated by Ben Fell.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5edp4d9yxo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ef3f/live/615a0260-8434-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 00:24:10","author":null,"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.445},{"id":355336056,"title":"World News | Trump to Address 80th UN General Assembly on Sept 23: White House","text":"By Reena Bhardwaj Washington [US], August 29 (ANI): President Donald Trump will visit New York next month to take part in the 80th United Nations General Assembly, the White House confirmed on Thursday.\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Says Confident That My Visits to Japan and China Would Further National Interests and Priorities.\n\"The President will travel to New York City on September 22 to address the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, September 23,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a press briefing.\nTrump has addressed the UNGA multiple times during his first term as US President from 2017 to 2021.\nAlso Read | Phica Scandal: Italy PM Giorgia Meloni Among High-Profile Women Whose Doctored Photos Posted on Porn Site, Police Begin Probe.\nIn 2017, Trump made his debut at UNGA, where he warned that the US might \"totally destroy North Korea\" if provoked and mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as \"Rocket Man.\"\nHe also criticised Iran's leadership and described the Iran nuclear deal as an \"embarrassment\" at that time.

Gavin Newsom estimates 4,000 stolen vehicles recovered ‘in Oakland alone’ by CHP officers","text":"OAKLAND — Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday the deployment last year of California Highway Patrol officers to combat this city’s crime problem led to the recovery of over 4,000 stolen vehicles “in Oakland alone.”\n\nNewsom lauded the success of CHP’s involvement in Oakland, where state Transportation Secretary Toks Omishakin said the available data clearly reflects that crime has declined in the city since last year.\n\nThe two were flanked by CHP leaders at a news conference in Newsom’s office, where the governor announced that new teams of officers from the state law enforcement agency would similarly be deployed to major cities and areas up and down California, including San Diego, Sacramento and the Central Valley.\n\n“We initiated that operation” in Oakland, Newsom said, “which continues to this day with tremendous success.”\n\nNewsom resisted suggestions by reporters that the press event had anything to do with President Donald Trump’s threats earlier this month to send National Guard troops to major cities in the country.\n\nTrump had gone out of his way to call out Oakland, saying the city is “so far gone” on the crime front that it was hardly worth a mention.\n\nData from the Oakland Police Department shows crime is down across the board in the city, starting with homicides — arguably the category where it is the most difficult to juke stats — and extending to other violent crime, plus property crime and burglaries.\n\nOakland has fewer police officers now than when crime was spiking in 2023, though Newsom’s deployment early last year of CHP officers provided reinforcement amid the city’s financial troubles.\n\nThe governor said he had been petitioned last year — in the very office where Thursday’s news conference took place — by then-Mayor Sheng Thao, unnamed Alameda County supervisors and members of the local Oakland clergy, to deploy CHP officers.\n\nHis estimate that over 4,000 stolen vehicles were recovered in Oakland alone was not immediately confirmed Thursday by city officials.\n\nNewsom also credited, but did not name, Mayor Barbara Lee, who the governor said had “embraced” the CHP’s involvement in Oakland. Currently, he said, the operations include DUI enforcement and seizures of illegal guns.\n\nAnd although he said the news conference Thursday was routine and unrelated to Trump’s recent threats, Newsom suggested the White House should look into deploying the National Guard in Louisiana and Tennessee, where voters helped elect Trump, if his concerns about crime are genuine.\n\nThose two states placed among the worst in rankings of violent crime rates published by the U.S. News and World Report.\n\nTrump, who deployed National Guard troops to take over policing in Washington, D.C., has not formally explored taking such a measure in Oakland.\n\nA trial concluded earlier this month in a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration by state Attorney General Rob Bonta over the deployment in June of the state military force to Los Angeles in response to protests of federal immigration raids.\n\n“We asked the court to grant a permanent injunction,” Bonta said in a release at the time, “to stop the Administration from using the military for domestic law enforcement and maintaining a standing army in Southern California.”\n\nShomik Mukherjee is a reporter covering Oakland.

But amid growing signs pointing to US President Donald Trump bringing about a generational - and adversarial - shift in American policy towards India, New Delhi is finding broad support from the Western intelligentsia in its struggle to resist the US bullying.Indications that the Trump dispensation is hell-bent on punishing India aggressively came when US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday urged Europe to align with Washington and crank up tariffs on India. \"We could use a more fulsome assist from our European partners... I don't see them threatening tariffs on the Indians,\" Bessent complained in a Fox News interview, cranking up pressure on the EU, with which New Delhi is trying to finalise a free trade agreement.Although Bessent said India and US would \"eventually come together\" because of their common democratic and market orientation, indications that ties have gone off the rails for now came when he said Trump will not budge on the tariff issue if India does not. Trump himself has remained quiet as his minions continue to vilify India, taking a cue from their boss' recent hostility towards New Delhi. Separately, the MAGA dispensation also broadened its crackdown on travel, business, and student visas - which affects Indians disproportionately because of the volume of traffic between the two countries - alleging that India was the biggest source of misuse of visas.Trump's torching of US-India ties is not going down well with regional experts who have seen bipartisan support across administrations over past 25 years for strengthening the relationship.\"The conflict in Ukraine is Putin's war, not 'Modi's war', and anyone who thinks this patently ridiculous formulation is going to provide leverage with New Delhi is beyond delusional. At this point, this is sabotage, pure and simple,\" Evan Feigenbaum, a former state department official now with Carnegie Endowment, said on Wednesday, referring to Navarro's characterisation that the Russia-Ukraine conflict is \"Modi's war\".\"It is hard to escape the conclusion that some people on the US side are arsonists who are deliberately torching 25 years of work to build US-India relations,\" Feigenbaum, among a slate of officials who had piloted the US-India nuclear deal, added.Qualified support for India also came from the Economist, which called Trump's wrecking of ties with India and his embrace of Pakistan \"a giant own-goal for America's interests that compounds its neglect of Nato in Europe\". Calling out American duplicity, the publication said New Delhi buying Kremlin crude is \"grubby\", but given that India does so through a price-cap scheme run by the West, that it sells refined petroleum products to Europe, and that much of the world, including China, also buys Russian oil, the surcharge makes it look as if India has been singled out for special punishment. \"For America to alienate India is a grave mistake. For India it is a moment of opportunity: a defining test of its claim to be a superpower-in-waiting,\" the Economist said, supporting New Delhi's China outreach and its quest for new markets, while encouraging reforms at home.Several American analysts also unloaded on the Trump approach saying the US is simply shooting itself in the foot with its belligerence towards India. \"India will sell its exports no longer to the US but to rest of the Brics. What you are doing is, in a hothouse fashion, developing Brics into an ever-larger, more integrated and successful economic alternative to the West,\" Richard Wolfe, a leftist economist and trenchant critic of MAGA policies, warned in a podcast.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays, public holidays, current gold rate and silver price.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/western-voices-back-india-against-trumps-tariff-war/articleshow/123573118.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-123573172/123573172.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 23:16:22","author":"CHIDANAND RAJGHATTA","authors":["CHIDANAND RAJGHATTA"],"language":"en","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.016},{"id":355331592,"title":"LATIKA M BOURKE: It’s time to start listening to the Democrats again, and this one in particular","text":"One of the biggest surprises of the second Trump Administration is not MAGA’s assault on the institutions and the abuse of the military to assert domestic control, but the lack of resistance to America’s slide towards illiberalism, if not authoritarianism.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is doing much of what he said. “Promises made, promises kept,” is one of his Administration’s catchphrases.\n\nHe was open about politicising the Department of Justice after being on the receiving end of legal pursuits during the Biden Administration.\n\nAnd it’s looking like payback time. Vice President JD Vance barely concealed that the pursuit of John Bolton, one of Mr Trump’s fiercest critics after serving as his national security adviser during the first term, was political.\n\n“There’s a broad concern about Ambassador Bolton,” Mr Vance told Meet the Press.\n\n“They’re going to look into it and like I said, if there’s no crime here, we’re not going to prosecute it.”\n\nNote the use of “we’re.”\n\nMr Trump has begun fusing his crackdown on illegal immigration and crime with the use of the National Guard and military to enforce it.\n\nHe deployed troops to Los Angeles to support the forcible deportations of immigrants being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are often wearing masks and have been filmed snatching people, and in some cases — US citizens and not illegal migrants — from the streets.\n\nThey are chilling and horrifying scenes that should appear in documentaries about living in dictatorships, not the country of liberty.\n\nAnd he has deployed the National Guard to Washington DC, usually called up to respond to natural disasters, to clean up the capital and rid it of crime.\n\nHis next target is the city of Chicago, the most populous city in the Democrat-governed state of Illinois and run by the black Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson.\n\n“Unlawfully deploying the National Guard to Chicago has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement when we know that trust between police and residents is foundational to building safer communities,” the Mayor said.\n\nUnless, of course, this is the plan. Civil unrest would give Mr Trump another pretext to deepen and extend the use of law enforcement and the military against the American people.\n\nAnd yet the Democrats have failed to land a punch on these alarming tendencies, except one.\n\nOutraged by the deployment of troops to LA, the Democratic Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has finally found a way to attack Mr Trump — by mimicking him.\n\nIt began with equally childish tweets issued by his official press account, written in the same style as Mr Trump’s social media posts and calling the US President “Little Hands,” an insult that has annoyed Mr Trump.\n\n“WOW !! PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS ABOUT ME, GAVIN C. NEWSOM: “HE’S A NICE GUY, LOOKS GOOD.” THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS, LITTLE HANDS. EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE TALKING ABOUT ME (AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR!). —GCN” he wrote on X, in one example.\n\nIn another post, he used Elon Musk’s AI bot on X, Grok, to troll Mr Trump’s mental state.\n\n“Do people with dementia repeat false things over and over again?” his post asked Grok.\n\n“Yes, people with dementia can repeat false statements or beliefs, a behaviour often linked to memory impairments and cognitive changes,” Musk’s chatbot responded.\n\nMercifully, someone has finally departed from Michelle Obama’s sanctimonious decree: “When they go low, we go high.”\n\nLike many of Mr Trump’s brutal and jaw-dropping but often also downright funny attacks, Mr Newsom’s similarly land, because they hit at a kernel of truth and are wrapped in humour.\n\nNot that he is laughing so much. When Mr Newsom sat down with Politico in Sacramento this week, he was serious and fired up and showed a Trump-like talent to talk at length, without a single note but with emotion and charisma.\n\nMr Newsom has understood that whatever the reign of Trump 2.0 brings, this is not the climate for business as usual; it is time to take risks.\n\n“I’m on the other side of any kind of hesitancy that I had prior,” Mr Newsom said.\n\n“I’m on the other side of giving a damn about people’s feelings about this moment because I see the threats in very vivid terms.”\n\nMr Newsom said seeing firsthand the effects of the ICE raids on his community had changed him and his approach to politics.\n\n“In every way, shape or way I have changed … and when I’m done, I have to meet this moment, so yeah, this has been very clarifying, this has been very sobering,” he said.\n\nHe is unequivocal about what America faces — in his view, a US President displaying authoritarian tendencies, preparing to rig elections through the use of a “private police force”.\n\nMr Trump has repeatedly flirted with the idea of seeking a third term, something he is constitutionally barred from seeking.\n\nWhen he hosted Ukraine’s President Volodymr Zelensky and European leaders at the White House last week, presidential assistant Margo Martin posted a photo on social media of the President showing Mr Zelensky and France’s Emmanuel Macron his “4 More years hat.”\n\nMs Martin included a crying with laughter emoji and the American flag alongside her caption.\n\nEarlier, Mr Trump had joked with Mr Zelensky about using martial law, as is imposed in Ukraine, to avoid holding elections.\n\n“So let me just say, three and a half years from now, so you mean if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections?” Mr Trump joked.\n\n“I wonder what the fake news would say about that.”\n\nMr Zelensky, who was doing his best to avoid another Oval Office humiliation, laughed in response and noted: “You like this idea?”\n\nDuring that encounter, Mr Trump also floated his opposition to mail-in voting after being advised on the matter by Russian President Vladimir Putin during their meeting in Alaska, Anchorage.\n\nMr Newsom sees no jokes.\n\n“He tried to steal the last election, he’s trying to rig it in plain sight this time,” Newsom said.\n\n“You think he’s joking about 2028? You think when he brings foreign leaders to the Oval Office and he goes to the White House store and he shows them the 2028 hats, he’s not being serious?\n\n“Who spends $200 million on a ballroom at their house and then leaves?\n\n“Pay attention, folks, this guy is not screwing around. Wake up, we’re losing this country in real-time.\n\n“This is not bloviation, this is not an exaggeration, it’s happening.\n\n“The rule of law is being replaced by the rule of Don, period, full stop.”\n\nMr Newsom said Democrats had to assert themselves with clarity and conviction.\n\n“I’m sick and tired of Democrats being on the losing end in this country and our democracy being on the losing end,” he said.\n\n“We have got to fight fire with fire.”\n\nThere are other promising signs that the left is beginning to grasp the magnitude of its failures.\n\nThis week, the centre-left think tank Third Way issued a plea to fellow travellers, urging all Democrats and their supporters to ditch immediately 45 words that make them sound “extreme, divisive, elitist, and obfuscatory, enforcers of wokeness.”\n\nIncluded in the list are: Privilege, patriarchy, LGBTQIA+, intersectionality, cisgender, chest feeding, pregnant people, stakeholders, barriers to participation, food insecurity, critical theory, systems of oppression and many other words this author was not even aware existed, let alone would be used by anyone normal in regular conversation.\n\nAnd that’s the point. Mr Newsom is actively meeting Mr Trump where he’s at — using simple language, plain-speaking and getting personal in the attacks.\n\nAnd it’s retail.\n\n“This is the guy that’s going to ruin Christmas with the tax on all the toys that’s coming in the next few months with all these illegal tariffs,” Mr Newsom warned.\n\nAnd the response from Mr Trump and his acolytes suggests Mr Newsom’s attacks are having an impact.\n\nMr Trump has reverted to calling the Governor “Newscum” and claimed he is “way down in the polls.”\n\nMr Newsom is also a regular topic on Fox News, the right-wing news channel that the Democrat regularly fact-checks.\n\nSean Hannity, a commentator supportive of Mr Trump, blasted Mr Newsom was embarrassing himself with his posts and copycat stunts. That Mr Newsom is imitating Mr Trump was evidently lost on the Fox News host.\n\nFor beleaguered, shell-shocked Democrats who have struggled to find their feet ever since an ailing Joe Biden froze on national television, the irony will be as delicious as it is bittersweet.\n\nMr Newsom’s performance makes it all the more painfully obvious that he would have been a better choice than Kamala Harris, although no one may have ultimately stopped Mr Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nMr Newsom is an obvious contender for the Democratic primary and may well get his go. A central challenge will be reframing patriotism, as Mr Trump continues to morph the demand of loyalty to the country to himself.\n\nMr Newsom is prepared for the fight, however ugly it may get.\n\n“I’m not calm and I’m not going to submit myself to niceties, not when this guy is trying to wreck our goddamn country,” he said.\n\n“This is a real and serious moment in US history, and by the way I say that as an American, not as a Democrat.\n\n“Every Republican should be ashamed about this and scared to death about not just about these authoritarian tendencies but these authoritarian actions by the President.\n\n“He is weak, he is weakness masquerading as strength and that makes him more dangerous than most people believe.”\n\nMr Newsom would be the first to hope that his predictions do not come true. But whether he and his fellow Democrats can meet that moment if they do could redefine America.","summary":"LATIKA M BOURKE: Outraged by the forcible deportations of immigrants, the Democratic Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has finally found a way to attack Donald Trump.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/world-politics/latika-m-bourke-its-time-to-start-listening-to-the-democrats-again-and-this-one-in-particular-c-19841574","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19841574/4bb4bbbe0c6bd6f49f27e5cb1e7371306169ac10-16x9-x1y0w2446h1376.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 23:12:27","author":"Amy Lee","authors":["Amy Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":355332556,"title":"Dems’ National Guard rejection: Letters to the Editor — Aug. 29, 2025","text":"The Issue: Democrats’ pushback against potential National Guard deployment in New York, Chicago.\n\nI think President Trump should send the National Guard to New York, not to assist the New York City police but rather to replace the state Assembly (“Not guardin’ state: Kathy,” Aug. 26).\n\nAdding more police doesn’t help if the laws are too lenient, or if the judges and prosecutors simply ignore them. \n\nBetter to go after the “root cause” of the problem by eliminating the group of sheltered lowlifes in Albany enacting these terrible laws.\n\nRichard Rafal\n\nIt’s ironic that Chicago and New York City don’t want National Guard troops on the ground in these crime-ridden cities, but they want more federal money to combat crime.\n\nThe leaders of these states and cities have shown they have no fiscal awareness, as the federal money gets pissed away and crime still rages on.\n\nSticking National Guard troops on the ground ensures our taxpayers’ money is put to good use and out of the hands of these soft-on-crime socialists.\n\nRepeating the same thing is insanity. \n\nChanging the way crime is attacked is the only way these cities can get better.\n\nJames Schwartz\n\nAs a true New Yorker, I see too many random acts of violence. \n\nI read about deranged people attacking others and violent criminals shooting or stabbing people in the streets or subways.\n\nLet there be boots on the ground because the police are not allowed to fully perform their duties without fear of being penalized.\n\nTime to reverse the trend with affirmative action, not words.\n\nJoseph Comperchio\n\nYou would think that Democratic mayors of high-crime cities would realize that it’s the uniform presence that is deterring crime in DC, not the National Guard.\n\nWhy don’t they ask the president for more money to hire thousands of more street cops to replace the Guard?\n\nSteven Mendelsohn\n\nSomeone please put a microphone in Jesse Jackson’s face and ask him: “If you were walking at night in the Southside of Chicago would you cross the street if a National Guard soldier was walking toward you?” I think not.\n\nMike Santavicca\n\nThe Issue: The FBI probe into ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton and raid on his Maryland home.\n\nWhere is the outcry (“Bolton’s not ‘above the law,’ ” Aug. 23)?\n\nWhen the FBI searched Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Largo for documents from the White House, the Republicans went crazy calling it unjust.\n\nWhy not apply their logic to John Bolton? \n\nHe was never president and probably had less access than Trump. \n\nCan’t wait to watch some cable shows justifying this FBI search.\n\nRaymond Mangano\n\nTrump fired John Bolton because he was a warmonger.\n\nHis foreign policy was always pro-conflict, like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, George W.

The event will mark Kim’s first participation in a multilateral international gathering, signalling a diplomatic victory for Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nKim’s visit will be his first to China since 2019, while Putin last visited the country in 2024. The upcoming parade, scheduled for September 3, commemorates the 80th anniversary of Japan’s surrender in World War II and the formal end of the conflict. It will be held in Beijing’s iconic Tiananmen Square and is expected to feature thousands of military personnel, as well as displays of China’s most advanced military hardware.\nThe meeting between Xi, Putin, and Kim comes at a time of heightened global geopolitical manoeuvring. While the United States continues trade negotiations with China, it is also working to pressure Moscow to de-escalate its war in Ukraine. US President Donald Trump will not attend the Beijing parade, though he expressed earlier this week his interest in meeting Kim, as North Korea remains a vocal supporter of Russia in the ongoing conflict.\nEarlier this year, speculation had circulated about Kim attending a military parade in Moscow’s Red Square. However, he ultimately did not attend, instead sending top military generals responsible for overseeing North Korea’s troop deployment in Russia’s Kursk region.\nThe ‘Victory Day’ parade in China will be attended by 26 world leaders, though notably absent are leaders from Western nations, with the sole exception being Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico. Among other expected attendees are Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, Iranian President Masoud Pezashkian, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also be in China next week for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

While the White House has signalled interest in the trip, it has not confirmed any dates.

But I am not king.”\n\nThe late justice was referring to the majority opinion in Texas v. Johnson, the 1989 decision he joined that found flag desecration was constitutionally protected speech.\n\nThe case revolved around a lifelong commie weirdo named Gregory Lee Johnson, who was convicted of desecrating an American flag during an anti-Ronald Reagan protest outside the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas. \n\nJohnson was sentenced to one year in jail under Texas law. The state argued that it had a compelling interest in preserving revered national symbols. \n\nIn his dissent, Chief Justice William Rehnquist argued that the flag was not merely an “’idea’ or ‘point of view’ competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas” but a symbol that binds a nation’s people.\n\nThe majority, however — rightly, in my opinion — reasoned that the “bedrock principle” underlying the First Amendment is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it “offensive or disagreeable.” \n\nThe Supreme Court has long held that First Amendment protections extend to symbolic acts.\n\nWhich brings us to President Donald Trump’s signing this week of an executive order directing the Justice Department to pursue criminal penalties against those who desecrate an American flag.\n\n“All over the world they burn the American flag,” Trump said. \n\n“The people in this country don’t want to see our American flag burned and spit on and by people that are, in many cases, paid agitators.”\n\nSorry, your free expression rights do not hinge on whether you are paid or whether you protest gratis. \n\nAnd the president has no say in how we express ourselves.\n\nAround the world, including in most European nations, the burning of flags is illegal because the law places the reverence of the state above the rights of the individual. \n\nIn truth, Trump’s executive order only asks Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute those who burn or desecrate the American flag in ways that cause “harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.”\n\nWhich is to say, Trump only wants people to believe he’s ignoring the Supreme Court. Or perhaps he wants to relitigate the issue despite long-standing precedent.\n\nThen again, I’m relatively certain the most vital purpose of the executive order is to goad Democrats into self-defeating reactions as the midterm elections approach.\n\nOn that front, Trump has a decent chance of success: A few weeks ago, the president dispatched the National Guard to Washington, DC, persuading half the Democratic Party to go on TV and argue that crime rates weren’t really a problem for average Americans.\n\nNo doubt, the president hopes the new executive order will provoke progressive Democrats to champion the finer points of burning Old Glory.\n\nIt would not be surprising if Black Lives Matter, Antifa and pro-Hamas types take the bait. One yahoo desecrating a flag was already arrested in front of the White House on Monday.\n\nDefending the ungrateful scum that burn flags is a daunting political position even on earnest principled grounds.\n\nAs the executive order points out, it is “uniquely offensive and provocative.”\n\nAnd Democrats, who’ve spent years trying to ban and curb “misinformation” and “disinformation,” including creating an aborted Ministry of Truth, possess zero credibility as ethical defenders of free expression.\n\nIn turn, many on the right who have spent years rightfully angered by the Biden administration’s administrative and bureaucratic censorship will cheer the president’s edict.\n\nThese days, increasing numbers of people are under the impression that how you get what you desire doesn’t really matter: Neutral principles be damned.\n\nIt’s something of a trope (and I have probably used it in the past myself) that popular speech doesn’t really need protection. \n\nThat’s not exactly true: As we saw during COVID-19, relatively popular ideas are also under fire. \n\nIf it weren’t popular, it wouldn’t matter as much to those in power.\n\nYet it is also certainly true that the most unpopular speech deserves the same protections.\n\nSo yes, to some extent, Trump’s edict is a distraction — but many people seem to believe presidents can unilaterally accomplish things they aren’t empowered to do.\n\nLike, for instance, banning protected speech.\n\nDavid Harsanyi is a senior writer at the Washington Examiner.

But this time could be different","text":"United States President Donald Trump first signalled his intention to target the Smithsonian Institution in March, when he signed an executive order titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.\n\nThis executive order – one of several targeting the cultural sector – vowed to remove “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology”.\n\nIt was quickly followed by an article from the White House titled President Trump is Right about the Smithsonian, with more than 20 examples of how the Smithsonian had embraced so-called “woke” ideology.\n\nTo put this all in context, the Smithsonian is the world’s largest museum, education and research complex. It was founded in 1846 as an entity independent from the US government. Today, most of its funding comes through federal appropriations. Its governing board includes the US vice president and supreme court chief justice. \n\nIt is custodian for more than 157 million items, 21 museums, 21 libraries, 14 education and research centres, a zoo, and several historical and architectural landmarks. \n\nTrump has long been a participant in the culture wars, including when he denounced “cancel culture” at a 2020 fourth of July event at Mt Rushmore. However, there is something different about his current interest in the Smithsonian. And that’s because next year is the US “semiquincentennial”: the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nLooking through history, it’s clear Trump’s attacks on the Smithsonian can’t be separated from the semiquincentennial. We’re also reminded of how the Smithsonian has both thwarted and endured political interference in the past.\n\n2026: a politically important year\n\nTrump’s heightened interest in the Smithsonian was explained in a recent letter from the White House to Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie Bunch III:\n\nAs we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation’s founding, it is more important than ever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story.\n\nIn parallel, a presidential action was released in celebration of the major anniversary. \n\nThis action established Task Force 250, which would be chaired by the president and housed in the Department of Defence. The task force’s key priorities include the development of a “national garden of American heroes” (proposed in Trump’s first term), and the protection of monuments from vandalism. \n\nWhile the presidential action identifies no specific role for the Smithsonian, taken together the statements lead to questions about political influence over the Smithsonian’s operations. \n\nDecades of political grievance\n\nMany of the Smithsonian exhibits that attracted historical censorship and controversy are now themselves approaching significant anniversaries. \n\nOne example is the 1972 exhibition, The Right to Vote, held at the Museum of History and Technology (now the National Museum of American History) to celebrate the 1965 Voting Rights Act. \n\nThe exhibition had been scheduled as a venue for President Richard Nixon’s inauguration ball. But upon inspection, Nixon’s team decided it was too controversial and had it walled off for their events.\n\nFurther political grievances were aimed at the 1991 National Museum of American Art exhibition The West as America: Reinterpreting Images of the Frontier, 1820-1920. It encouraged visitors to understand how historical paintings represent a mythical view of the past that has been used to justify the West’s expansion and development.\n\nThe exhibition led to immediate outrage from former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin. Boorstin wrote in the visitor’s book that it was: “A perverse, historically inaccurate destructive exhibit! No credit to the Smithsonian!”\n\nOther politicians became energised by Boorstin’s view that the exhibition was a disrespectful attempt to dismantle and shame the history and legacy of the American frontier.\n\nThe exhibition became the subject of heated debate in the Senate Committee on Appropriations hearings from 1990 to 1992. At issue was how American nationalism should be represented in museums. A group of senators, led by Ted Stevens, threatened to reduce the Smithsonian’s funding if it failed to present “accountability” for its use of federal funds. \n\nThe Smithsonian’s then-secretary Robert McCormick Adams insisted it was precisely because the Smithsonian was dependent on tax resources that it had a responsibility to “exemplify the nation’s pluralism”. \n\nIn reporting the brouhaha, New York Times columnist Michael Kimmelman used language that wouldn’t be out of place today. He said the controversy “raises questions about government involvement in the arts […] Is it now the job of Congress to police its constituents’ thinking about the art in those museums?”\n\nCancelled by Congress\n\nAnother instance of political interference came in the mid 1990s, in relation to a Smithsonian exhibition representing the 50th anniversary of America’s atomic bombing of Japan in WWII.\n\nThe National Air and Space Museum designed a display that included the restored B-29 bomber, a plane called the Enola Gay, that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.\n\nThe exhibition was supposed to open in 1995. However, people who consulted on its early plans criticised it for supposedly presenting a politically correct and revisionist interpretation of the events. They claimed it overplayed the horrors of the bombings, and portrayed Japanese victims without sufficient context surrounding the preceding Japanese aggression. \n\nMembers of Congress soon became aware of the concerns, adding their own threats of hearings and budget reductions. They called for the curator’s resignation, and contributed to the exhibition’s eventual cancellation.\n\nHistory repeats\n\nTrump’s attacks on the Smithsonian are part of a long political playbook in which culture has been targeted for representing an inclusive view of the American union. \n\nThe Smithsonian has weathered political attacks on its exhibitions in the past. However, there is now more attention to its institutional remit than ever before.\n\nThe recent threats from Trump, and lessons from history, highlight the importance of protecting the Smithsonian as an independent authority that withstands political interference at all costs.","summary":"There’s another, lesser-known reason Trumps attacks on the important institution have ramped up in recent months.","url":"https://theconversation.com/trump-isnt-the-first-us-politician-to-pick-a-fight-with-the-smithsonian-but-this-time-could-be-different-264022","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/687916/original/file-20250828-66-av5hdw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C455%2C5669%2C2834&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 23:05:48","author":"Australian National University,Kylie Message,Professor of Public Humanities and Director of the ANU Humanities Research Centre","authors":["Australian National University","Kylie Message","Professor of Public Humanities and Director of the ANU Humanities Research Centre"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.144},{"id":355326850,"title":"Feds charge 'Subway' sandwich tosser with misdemeanor after grand jury balks at felony indictment","text":"Prosecutors have charged the man accused of throwing a \"Subway\" sandwich at a federal officer on a Washington, D.C., street with just misdemeanor assault after failing to convince a grand jury to indict him on a felony assault charge, court records show.\n\nFormer Department of Justice employee Sean Charles Dunn is accused of tossing the sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer on Aug. 10. \n\nThat officer and other federal authorities had been deployed to Washington by President Donald Trump to crack down on what the president has claimed is a rampant crime problem in the capital.\n\nDunn was fired by the DOJ after his arrest.\n\nHe faces much less potential time behind bars if convicted of misdemeanor assault than if he were convicted of the felony prosecutors wanted.\n\nCNBC has requested comment from the office of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, which is prosecuting Dunn.\n\nDunn's defense lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, declined to comment.\n\nDunn's case is the second one in recent days in which Pirro's office has been unable to convince a grand jury to issue an indictment in a case involving alleged assaults on federal law enforcement officers.\n\nIt is extremely rare for DOJ prosecutors to fail to obtain a requested indictment.\n\nOn Monday, Pirro's prosecutors told a judge that they had been unable in three separate attempts to get grand jurors to indict Sydney Reid, who is accused of forcefully pushing an FBI agent's hand against a cement wall in late July.","summary":"Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., failed to convince a grand jury to indict Sean Charles Dunn for a felony in the sandwich tossing caper.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/doj-misdemeanor-subway-sandwich-dc-assault.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108191265-1756299459608-gettyimages-2230460542-doz7e7rkktafvlkkc2dalvajwi.jpeg?v=1756299553","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 23:05:07","author":"Dan Mangan","authors":["Dan Mangan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.511},{"id":355326690,"title":"Retrial Ordered for Three Former Memphis Officers Linked to Tyre Nichols’ Fatal Beating","text":"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — On Thursday, a judge mandated a new trial for three ex-Memphis police officers who had been found guilty of federal charges related to the deadly beating of Tyre Nichols. This decision came after defense attorneys contended that the judge overseeing their trial held a prejudiced view, believing that at least one of the defendants was affiliated with a gang.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman issued the order for a new trial for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who were found guilty in October 2024 of obstruction of justice through witness tampering in the beating death of Nichols after he fled a traffic stop.\n\nTwo other officers, Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., also were charged, but they pleaded guilty before the federal trial.\n\nLipman took over the case in June after U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris, who presided over the case and the trial, recused himself days before the sentencings for the five officers.\n\nIn a statement shared by his judicial office Thursday, Norris said, “Because of the code of judicial conduct, I cannot make a statement on this matter.”\n\nNew trial based on judge’s comments\n\nIn her order, Lipman cited a notice filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office saying Norris expressed a theory that at least one of the officers charged in the Nichols case was in a gang.\n\nThe notice discussed an incident in which Norris’ law clerk was shot in the chest during a car theft days after the trial ended. The clerk was staying at the home of another law clerk who had previously worked for Norris on the Nichols case, it said.\n\nThe notice also said that police investigators believed a group of juveniles committed the shooting; that Norris wanted those responsible to be held accountable; and that he “evidenced reasonable frustration with the police investigation.” \n\nNorris met with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and an FBI agent, who explained why no federal charges would be brought in the clerk’s shooting.\n\nDuring the May 30 meeting, Norris indicated that he believed at least one of the former officers was in a gang and that it was responsible for the shooting, the notice said. It also said the U.S. Attorney stated that Norris told those present that the clerk “had been seen by one or more of the Defendants during the trial.” \n\nAn assistant U.S. attorney who attended the meeting also said she remembered that, shortly after the law clerk was shot, Norris told her he could not meet with any member of the police department to give a statement because the department was “infiltrated to the top with gang members,” the notice said.\n\nAllegations of bias\n\nBean, Haley, and Smith filed motions seeking a new trial, arguing that Norris was biased and violated their rights to due process by presiding over the case.\n\nSmith’s lawyer said there was no “suggestion or one hint in the federal discovery process or the federal trial that any defendant or any member of the Memphis Police Department was in any way affiliated with an illegal street gang either through membership or relationship.”\n\nHaley’s lawyer wrote that “Judge Norris made the gang statements on at least two occasions, demonstrating that it is a firmly held belief, not an off-hand remark.”\n\nLipman found that while a review showed Norris’ decisions throughout the trial were “sound, fair, and grounded firmly in the law,” a new trial is necessary “because the risk of bias here is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.”\n\nA date for the retrial has not been set. Lipman ordered lawyers to submit positions on what charges they believe need to be tried.\n\nSmith’s attorney, Martin Zummach, said Lipman “did the right thing.” Bean’s lawyer declined to comment, and Haley’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request. Memphis police also declined to comment. \n\nMixed verdict in 2024 trial\n\nBean, Haley and Smith were found guilty of trying to cover up the beating by failing to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke police department rules when they did not include complete and accurate statements about what type of force they used.\n\nBean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges, however. \n\nHaley was found guilty of violating Nichols’ civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs and also conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.\n\nBean, Haley and Smith were acquitted in May of all state charges, including second-degree murder.\n\nMartin and Mills pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Nichols’ civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court with their former colleagues.\n\nMartin and Mills also avoided a state court trial after reaching agreements to plead guilty. Both testified in the federal trial, and Mills took the stand in the state trial.\n\nThe officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded weeks after Nichols died. The team targeted illegal drugs, guns and violent offenders, and it sometimes used force against unarmed people.\n\nThe Tyre Nichols case\n\nOn Jan. 7, 2023, officers yanked Nichols from his car and then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up with him, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place steps from his home.\n\nHe died three days later.\n\nVideo of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries. \n\nIt prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, nationwide protests and renewed calls for police reform. \n\nNorris was confirmed as a U.S. district judge in West Tennessee in October 2018 after being nominated by President Donald Trump. Previously the Collierville Republican served in the Tennessee Senate including as majority leader.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.

Washington has dispatched five warships and thousands of Marines toward the Caribbean country for what was labeled an anti-drug operation, though Caracas fears there is more to the deployment. The United States does not recognize President Nicolas Maduro's 2024 reelection to a third term in what which was rejected by the opposition and much of the rest of the world as a stolen vote.Venezuela Fears Regime ChangeMaduro accuses Washington of seeking regime change. Venezuela has deployed warships and drones to patrol its coastline and Maduro said he would activate 4.5 million militia members -- a number questioned by observers -- to confront \"any threat.\" President Maduro has urged civilians to join the Venezuelan militia -- a civilian backup to the standing army -- as he warns of a \"threat\" from the United States.Live EventsMaduro's government regularly accuses the opposition and foreigners of conspiring with U.S. entities such as the CIA to harm Venezuela, accusations the opposition and the U.S. have always denied. It characterizes sanctions as \"economic war.\"Venezuela on Thursday complained to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about the U.S. naval buildup, accusing Washington of violating the founding U.N. Charter. \"It's a massive propaganda operation to justify what the experts call kinetic action - meaning military intervention in a country which is a sovereign and independent country and is no threat to anyone,\" Venezuela's U.N.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has denounced the moves. The Pentagon has not indicated publicly what exactly the U.S. mission will be, but the Trump administration has said it can now use the military to go after drug cartels and criminal groups and has directed the Pentagon to prepare options.On Thursday, the White House said Trump was ready to use \"every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country.\"\"Many Caribbean nations and many nations in the region have applauded the administration's counter drug operations and efforts,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.The Trump administration designated Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and other drug gangs, as well as the Venezuelan criminal group Tren de Aragua, as global terrorist organizations in February. Part of the buildup is the USS San Antonio, USS Iwo Jima, and USS Fort Lauderdale. The ships are carrying 4,500 service members, including 2,200 Marines, sources have told Reuters.The U.S. military has also been flying P-8 spy planes in the region to gather intelligence, officials have said, though they have operated in international waters.FAQsQ1.

That’s why the diversity and equality and inclusion strategies and the focus on it are so important.\n\n“Because the lines that are being trotted out around ‘we should treat everybody equally’ – yeah, we should. Everybody should experience the same quality of service from policing or the public sector, but unfortunately they don’t.\n\n“And to level up that confidence gap, that difference in service, you have to have some dedicated resources to do that, both inside the organisation, focusing internally on your culture, and externally.\n\n“To say that you can … lessen that confidence gap, to say that you can make sure that everybody is experiencing the same quality of service without some dedicated resources to do it is just ludicrous.”\n\nKennedy’s retirement from policing, leaves her free to voice not just her concerns, but also those of other senior figures concerned by intense attacks on policing by rightwing political figures.\n\nShe said political attacks on diversity and inclusion, and groups targeting asylum hotels, were causing problems on the streets and for her workforce, leaving some people frightened: “Seeing the disorder that’s out on the streets, some of the narrative coming out around immigration status, colour of your skin, it must be really frightening out there, in our communities, but also for our own workforce.\n\n“So I do think we’re on a bit of a tipping point at this moment, and I think we need to work really hard not to go backwards.”\n\nThe toughest challenge in her four years as chief was the July 2024 murder of three schoolgirls, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, after a man burst into a Southport dance class and stabbed several children.\n\nThe next day a vigil to commemorate those murdered was soon followed in the Merseyside town by riots that spread across the country and were the worst in more than a decade.\n\nKennedy said there was a far-right and organised element. “The officers on the ground report that there was carfuls of people turning up and being dropped off … There was an element of organisation for that. So those numbers swelled very quickly … Within 25 minutes of the vigil ending, the first missiles were thrown at the mosque.”\n\nKennedy said claims those taking to the street were typical of white working-class anger were contradicted by the fact that white working-class people turned out in greater numbers to repair the attacked mosque and clear up.\n\nIn the aftermath of the murders there was a rapid and deliberate spread of false information, designed to whip up trouble, falsely claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Kennedy and her force took the unusual step on the evening of the atrocity of releasing the information that the suspect was British-born.\n\nThe chief constable said she doubted that a quicker release of information would have defused tensions that led to the riots.\n\nShe pointed to this May’s incident where a car went into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC’s Premier League title victory. The incident in Liverpool city centre led to fears of a terrorist attack, which it was not, but also a rapid and determined spread of lies online.\n\nKennedy recalled how her force released ethnicity details of a man it had arrested, but, she said: “Even when we put out that this was a white, British-born local person … because what we’d put out didn’t suit the narrative that they wanted to swell in terms of that negativity, people carried on with that misinformation.”\n\nShe said she was annoyed by politicians such as Farage, who in the aftermath of the Southport riot said the authorities might be wrongly hiding key details from the public. She said: “I was really frustrated that national politicians were making some of the statements that they were making … because of the impact that it was having in terms of trust and confidence in policing. And it wasn’t in my view based on fact, it was based on what was being said on social media.”\n\nKennedy said claims of two-tier policing were “a ludicrous statement”, and added: “Some of the statements being said by national politicians are having an impact on what is playing out on our streets and what policing, communities and partners are being left to deal with.”\n\nShe dismissed claims of asylum seekers being more likely to commit crime and said: “I’m not seeing anything out of kilter … It’s just, it’s more newsworthy.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/police-chief-attacks-reform-uk-230103057.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7y8LVIXLMmyXivWc_nKIUQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xOTIwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/845939b87a5772367191006180c6745c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 23:01:03","author":"Vikram Dodd Police And Crime Correspondent","authors":["Vikram Dodd Police And Crime Correspondent"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":355328316,"title":"Hong Kong can rival US, UAE as a crypto hub, Binance founder CZ says","text":"Hong Kong has the conditions to become a major hub for virtual assets, rivalling markets like the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but the city’s regulators must act swiftly to realise its potential, according to Zhao Changpeng, founder and largest shareholder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\nIn an exclusive interview with the South China Morning Post on Friday, Zhao, widely known as CZ, said the Hong Kong government had shown a “very clear attitude towards embracing Web3” and had the capability to move quickly.\n“We shouldn’t evaluate a place’s future potential based on its current status,” said the 48-year-old entrepreneur, regarded as the wealthiest individual in the crypto industry and ranked by Forbes as the 22nd richest person in the world, with a personal net worth of US$74.7 billion. “We should assess it based on the speed of change.”\n“There’s nothing magical about what the US, UAE or other countries are doing,” he said. “Maybe tomorrow, there could be a meeting in Hong Kong where [officials] say, ‘Look, we’re going to change some things.’”\nOne immediate change that Zhao suggested was to expand the range of cryptocurrencies permitted for trading on licensed exchanges in Hong Kong beyond the current four – bitcoin, ether, avalanche and chainlink. He said those options were “not enough” and advocated for a model similar to Japan’s, which allows exchanges to determine which tokens can be traded.\n\nBinance has not applied for a licence to operate a cryptocurrency exchange platform in Hong Kong, which currently hosts 11 licensed virtual asset trading platforms.\nWhile he no longer manages Binance due to an agreement with the US government, Zhao said he regularly advised regulators from a dozen countries and regions. He described Hong Kong’s regulatory framework as leaning towards the “conservative” end, as authorities “don’t want to make any mistakes”.\nHis comments come as Hong Kong seeks to balance its aspirations as a virtual asset hub with the need to minimise financial risks.\nThe city’s stablecoin ordinance, effective since August 1, imposes strict requirements regarding reserve management, client identification and anti-money-laundering, which has dampened earlier enthusiasm for the regulation.\nZhao acknowledged that stablecoin concepts had become “a bit too hot”, which prompted the government to take a step back. However, he said the conservative approach was reasonable: “When going from no regulation to regulation … most regulators would tend to err on the cautious side.”\n\nZhao, who was born in China and moved to Canada with his parents at age 12, has become one of the most prominent figures in the global crypto industry. He resigned as CEO of Binance in November 2023 after pleading guilty to money laundering charges in the US, and served four months in prison before his release in September 2024.\nFollowing Donald Trump’s re-election, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Zhao. The Binance founder said he was happy with the US president’s evolving stance on crypto, but denied any direct business ties to the Trump family.\n“I have never spoken with President Trump. I have never met him,” Zhao said. As for the president’s second-born son, Eric Trump, who is attending the Bitcoin Asia event in Hong Kong, Zhao said they had only met in group settings.\nZhao – who made a life-changing decision in 2014 to sell his Shanghai flat and invest everything in bitcoin – remained optimistic about crypto and blockchain technology.\n\nHe said blockchain adoption was still in its “infancy”, likening its current state to internet use in 2000. There would be explosive growth in daily applications as more people use multiple artificial intelligence agents, Zhao said, referring to software that uses AI to perform tasks autonomously on behalf of users and other systems.\nZhao said he was content with his current role as a “backbench coach”, advising on entrepreneurship and helping to develop the increasingly popular BNB Chain, a blockchain network hosting 4,000 projects.\nZhao pointed out that he did not own shares in most of the projects on BNB, although he is the largest owner of BNB tokens, holding nearly two thirds of the circulating supply.\nStill, Zhao downplayed any perceived threat that BNB Chain may pose to traditional banking systems. “If we use an old term like ‘banking’ to describe a new industry, we need to be careful,” he said. “It’s similar to trying to categorise the internet – while it is similar to magazines or radio, it is still different.”","summary":"Hong Kong has the conditions to become a major hub for virtual assets, rivalling markets like the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but the city’s regulators must act swiftly to realise its potential, according to Zhao Changpeng, founder and largest shareholder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\nIn an exclusive interview with the South China Morning Post on Friday, Zhao, widely known as CZ, said the Hong Kong government had shown a “very clear attitude towards embracing Web3” and had the...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3323465/binance-founder-cz-hong-kong-can-rival-us-crypto-hub-its-future-hinges-speed","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/28/09be7791-f0d6-4b4d-9054-ed7bd6379b7c_869b2dc3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 23:00:10","author":"Zhou Xin","authors":["Zhou Xin"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.014},{"id":355335330,"title":"Letters: Let’s support Newsom’s counter move to Texas’ power grab","text":"Support state’s counter\nto Texas power grab\n\nRe: “State’s redistricting plan is a necessary antidote” (Page A8, Aug. 24).\n\nMichelle Obama’s famous statement, “When they go low, we go high,” was applicable back in the days when there was still some measurement of decorum and decency left in politics.

This is no longer high-speed rail. Looking at the current Caltrain schedule, the fastest it can go from San Francisco to Gilroy is 1 hour 51 minutes. The fastest MetroLink from Palmdale to L.A.

The phrase “a nation of immigrants’’ is a common description for the United States, and the country has been associated with welcoming immigrants. John Kennedy used the phrase in his book, “A Nation of Immigrants.”\n\nHowever, the reality is more complex, with the U.S. by turns welcoming and restricting immigration. Immigrants have historically and continue to contribute significantly to the U.S. labor force, start businesses and enrich American communities with their cuisine and cultures.\n\nThe country also has a history of restricting immigration, such as the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Chinese Exclusion Act and the McCarran-Walter Act, which favored Europeans and contradicted the idea of an open door.\n\nDonald Trump has used anti-immigrant fervor as a theme to win his second term.

These programs were designed to protect Afghans vulnerable to Taliban retaliation.The decision has sparked criticism in Washington. Congressman Scott Peters said cutting the funds sends the “wrong message” to future partners and undermines America’s reputation as a reliable ally. He stressed that those who showed the courage to stand against the Taliban are the very people the US should protect.Civil society groups echoed these concerns. Shawn VanDiver, head of the San Diego-based AfghanEvac initiative, cautioned that thousands of Afghans will face severe risks if funding ends, leaving them exposed to Taliban revenge, Khaama Press noted.Congressional statistics show nearly 60,000 Afghans in Afghanistan are still awaiting asylum case reviews, while more than 170,000 remain in the queue for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs).Immigration lawyers have also raised alarms about the fate of women and girls, warning that a return to Taliban rule could strip them of education, employment, and basic freedoms. One lawyer described the prospect as “deeply frightening.”Critics argue that the cuts not only endanger Afghan allies but also threaten to weaken US moral authority and credibility worldwide.Without renewed commitments, thousands who once stood with American forces may be left to face an uncertain and dangerous future, Khaama Press reported. The concern came as United States President Donald Trump signed a proclamation earlier this week marking the four-year anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing in Afghanistan.

Transgender people are also several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes than those who are not transgender.What To KnowThursday's finding from the Education Department came after an investigation into Denver's East High School and marks a sharp departure from the DOE's approach under former President Joe Biden.The DOE began investigating Denver Public Schools after the high school converted a girls' restroom on its second floor to an all-gender restroom and left another restroom exclusive to boys.\"Let me be clear: it is a new day in America, and under President Trump, (the Office for Civil Rights) will not tolerate discrimination of any kind,\" Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a press release at the time.After issuing its conclusion on Thursday, the DOE gave Denver Public Schools the opportunity to revert the all-gender restrooms back to ones separated by gender or risk further enforcement actions.What People Are SayingTrainor said in a statement Thursday: \"Denver Public Schools violated Title IX and its implementing regulations by converting a sex-segregated restroom designated for girls in East High School to an 'all-gender' facility and by allowing students to use the high school's intimate facilities on the basis of their 'gender identity' rather than their biological sex.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nIn 2024, the European Union passed legislation requiring companies to exert a high level of “due diligence” to ensure that companies in the value chain met sustainability standards. The law opened the door for class action lawsuits for human rights violations, environmental damages, and the cost of climate change. Businesses became concerned the legal liabilities and reporting requirements will be overly burdensome. During recent trade negotiations, Trump highlighted U.S. business concerns, including it as a requirement for a trade agreement.\n\nAs part of the EU Green Deal, the EU adopted a series of directives to force businesses to address climate change and report greenhouse gas missions. The CSRD created requirements for businesses to report GHG emissions and other environmental, social, and governance actions. The CSDDD created additional reporting requirements, as well as legal liability, for companies in relation to their supply chain. These requirements alarmed certain U.S. based companies who could be impacted both directly and indirectly.\n\nThe cost of these proposals on businesses and the possible impact on the EU economy became a theme during the 2024 European Parliament elections. The shift to the right in EU politics embolden opponents to the European Green Deal directives. As a result, the Commission proposed a package of new directives to “reduce the burden” on businesses. The Omnibus Simplification Package was officially adopted by the Commission in February.\n\nOnce legislation is proposed by the Commission, the Parliament and the Council adopt positions. The Council announced their position in June. The Parliament is actively engaged in the process to adopt their position.\n\nThe current CSDDD requires companies to execute due diligence in ensuring that businesses along the value chain are in compliance with environmental and human rights requirements. The Parliament is debating changed to reporting thresholds and obligations of non-EU companies. Once the Parliament adopts their proposal in October, the will enter into negotiations with the Commission and Council to reach a final draft.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFor U.S. businesses, this is the opportunity to voice their concerns. The election of a like minded President gave them a powerful ally. Trump’s early engagement in renegotiating trade agreements presented the forum.\n\nIn April, Trump announced his intent to modify reciprocal tariff rates. This appeared to be a negotiation tactic, opening the door for reforms in trade agreements that some view as unfavorable to the U.S. Trump proposed a 30% tariff on the EU. Initially, EU leaders pushed back, but eventually trade talks began. At the end of July, Trump met with EU President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland. A month later, an initial trade agreement was reached. The agreement addressed multiple trade topics, including the CSDDD.\n\nIn a joint statement, released on August 21, the U.S. and the EU announced a Framework on an Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade. Addressing the CSDDD, the stated:\n\n“The European Union commits to undertake efforts to ensure that the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) do not pose undue restrictions on transatlantic trade. In the context of CSDDD, this includes undertaking efforts to reduce administrative burden on businesses, including small- and medium-sized enterprises, and to propose changes to the requirement for a harmonised civil liability regime for due diligence failures and to climate-transition-related obligations. The European Union commits to work to address US concerns regarding the imposition of CSDDD requirements on companies of non-EU countries with relevant high-quality regulations.”\n\nThe promise to “reduce the administrative burden on businesses” has been a recurring theme of von der Leyen’s second term and a driving motivation for reforms pushed by the European People’s Party.\n\nSustainability advocates quickly decried the agreement as the EU bending to the will of Trump. However, an accompanying Q&A provided by the Commission rolls back the promises, but opens the door to reforms.\n\n\"Questions and answers on the EU-US Joint Statement on Transatlantic Trade and Investment\" was published on the EU Commission’s website on August 21, but went relatively unnoticed until highlighted by ESG Dive and Responsible Investor.\n\nAddressing the deal to address the CSDDD, the Q&A clarified the Commission \"agreed to exchange views with the US on CSDDD related issues. The guiding principle of our\n\ndiscussions with the US has been to ensure that the Directive does not result in an unnecessary administrative burden, especially for small and medium size companies.\"\n\nFurther, it stated “This cooperation does not lead to any changes to EU domestic rules nor will we grant US companies more favourable treatment under this Regulation or any EU Regulation.”\n\nWhile this may provide hope to sustainability advocates, the language is carefully crafted. While it excludes the idea that the U.S. companies will get favorable treatment, it does not prohibit the exclusion of all non-EU based companies from CSDDD requirements. In fighting for U.S. business, Trump may end up with a win for all international companies.\n\nNotably absent from the Q&A was any reference to the CSRD that, in its current form, will impose sustainability reporting requirements on non-EU companies. However, the CSRD is currently being rewritten as part of the simplification process with a significant reduction in impact on U.S. based companies. This may indicate that Trump’s goals for sustainability reporting requirements align with the current proposal.\n\nHow Trump’s concerns relating to the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive will impact the debate is unclear. They will most likely not be directly addressed in the negotiations in the Parliament. Focus will remain on helping EU businesses. U.S. concerns will probably be heard behind closed doors, during the trilogue negotiations, without any public comment or input. Expect to see them reflected in the final version adopted in December.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"As part of trade negotiations with the European Union, President Trump has taken aim at the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive's impact on U.S. companies","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/08/28/trump-pushes-to-exclude-us-companies-from-eu-sustainability-due-diligence-law/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68b0c949863d623763a29d11/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 22:57:17","author":"Andrew Harnik,Contributor,Jon McGowan","authors":["Andrew Harnik","Contributor","Jon McGowan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.086},{"id":355327692,"title":"\"Putin must come to negotiating table\": EU Commission chief Von der Leyen","text":"Brussels [Belgium], August 29 (ANI): European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday spoke to US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to “come to the negotiating table,” after massive airstrikes on Kyiv that also damaged the European Union’s delegation office.She said Europe would continue to back Ukraine with security guarantees and defence support to ensure a “just and lasting peace.”In a post on X, “Just spoke with the President @ZelenskyyUa, then @POTUS Donald Trump, following the massive strike on Kyiv which also hit our EU offices.

According to Al Jazeera, they are currently being “accommodated by an international organisation” and will receive visits from local social services and the International Organisation for Migration, a UN agency.Rwanda is the fourth African nation to agree to receive deportations of non-citizens from the US, alongside Uganda, Eswatini and South Sudan. The US has declined to comment on the deportations, and the identities of the seven individuals have not been disclosed, Al Jazeera said.Deporting migrants and asylum seekers to third countries where they have no personal connection has become a growing practice under Trump. Administration officials argue the policy is necessary for migrants who cannot be returned to their countries of origin.Rights groups, however, have raised strong objections, questioning whether deportees will be safe in countries with poor human rights records. According to Al Jazeera, Eswatini confirmed that the five deportees it received in July would be held in solitary confinement for a time in prison. A lawyer representing them, Sibusiso Nhlabatsi, said in court filings that he has been denied access to his clients, as protests and a legal challenge against the deportations continue.Advocates have also criticised the policy as unnecessarily cruel, condemning deportees to countries where they may not speak the language or understand the culture. Some deportees have no criminal record, while others have already served sentences but face reincarceration in third-party countries.Earlier this month, Makolo sought to allay such concerns, stating that deportees to Rwanda would receive “workforce training, healthcare and accommodation support to jumpstart their lives.”Trump has pledged mass deportations as part of his 2024 re-election campaign, calling immigration an “invasion” led by “criminals” and vowing the “largest deportation operation” in US history.Al Jazeera noted that since taking office for a second term in January, Trump has already sent migrants to countries such as Panama and El Salvador, the latter housing hundreds of Venezuelan deportees in its Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT), a prison notorious for human rights abuses.Meanwhile, Rwanda has positioned itself as a destination for deportees, though armed groups backed by the country have themselves faced accusations of forced displacements and illegal deportations amid conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

Trump has accused her of committing mortgage fraud in 2021, before she joined the Fed board.\n\nThe case is expected to reach the Supreme Court. While the Court has previously allowed presidents to remove officials from other agencies, it has also suggested the Fed might be treated differently. Questions over the Fed’s independence have already unsettled markets, with the dollar dropping after Trump’s announcement.\n\nA Fed spokesperson said before the lawsuit was filed that the institution would follow any court ruling. Cook, appointed in 2022 by President Joe Biden, is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s governing board.\n\nTrump earlier removed Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman on the National Labor Relations Board, and has dismissed officials from agencies traditionally viewed as independent. The law that created the Fed does not define “cause” for removal, and no Fed governor has ever been removed before. Courts could look to other statutes, where cause has been interpreted to include neglect of duty, malfeasance, or inefficiency.\n\nThe mortgage issue was first raised in August by William Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. He referred the matter to Attorney General Pamela Bondi. \n\nCook’s financial disclosures list three mortgages, with two marked as primary residences, which typically qualify for lower rates. Some experts question whether loans taken before her Fed appointment could justify her removal.\n\nTrump’s administration may argue that any protection against removal conflicts with presidential powers to control the executive branch. In his August 25 letter to Cook, Trump accused her of “deceitful and criminal conduct in a financial matter” and said he lacked confidence in her integrity.\n\nCook responded that “no causes exist under the law, and (Trump) has no authority” to remove her. Her lawyers added that Trump’s “demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority.”\n\nIf Cook is removed, Trump would gain his fourth appointment to the Fed’s seven-member board. He has frequently criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates and for handling a major renovation project, though he has stopped short of trying to remove Powell before his term ends in May.\n\nThe Trump administration has also leveled mortgage fraud allegations against political opponents, including Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both of whom deny wrongdoing.\n\nALSO READ TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE","summary":"Tribune Online\n\nLisa Cook sues Trump over removal from Federal Reserve\n\n\nCook, appointed in 2022 by President Joe Biden, is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s governing board.\n\n\nLisa Cook sues Trump over removal from Federal Reserve\n\nTribune Online","url":"https://tribuneonlineng.com/lisa-cook-sues-trump-over-removal-from-federal-reserve/","image":"https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump-AND-Lisa-Cook.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 22:41:49","author":"Tribune Online","authors":["Tribune Online"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":355323702,"title":"Midterm tea leaves say Trump can  upend political history — again","text":"It is a failsafe and oft-repeated line, one we’ve all heard uttered each election cycle as a friend (or a TV talker) proclaims his undergraduate knowledge of political patterns: “The president’s party loses seats in the midterm elections.”\n\nIt’s about as profound as the trailblazing financial advice “buy low, sell high,” or hearing your overweight, armchair-quarterback pal explaining “if the offense puts more points on the board, the Jets can win.”\n\nThanks, coach!\n\nUnfortunately for both the GOP and Gang Green, these clichés almost always hold true.\n\nBut while the Jets might struggle to score this Sunday, the Republican Party under President Donald Trump is charging downfield, routinely stretching past its first-down markers.\n\nAnd fresh data this month — funding totals, handicappers’ forecasts and more — make the GOP seem better positioned for the 2026 midterms than any party in the White House since George W. Bush in 2002.\n\nApparently Democrats across the country already see the writing on the wall: They’re more eager to perform the political equivalent of taking their ball and going home than to actually play the game.\n\nTexas Republicans’ redistricting efforts got all the blame from legacy media, but it wasn’t the Lone Star State that set the example in the national tit-for-tat gerrymandering fight, nor even California’s Gavin Newsom or Illinois’ JD Pritzker, but New York’s own Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nIn 2022, Hochul’s own party’s appointees on the Court of Appeals squashed her efforts at reimagining New York’s district maps as an unconstitutional splatter of Picasso-shaped contours.\n\nTheir push to rearrange the deck chairs should come as no surprise.\n\nDemocrats are rudderless, routinely falling into the trap of standing up to Trump by defending fan favorites like carjackers in Washington, DC, antisemitic protesters at Columbia and a howling illegal immigrant accused of human trafficking.\n\nNow they’re paying the price, embattled on two fronts: voter registration and political donations.\n\nBoth indicate the 2026 midterms won’t be like 2018’s, when Nancy Pelosi flipped 41 seats to take back the House.\n\nLast week we learned that Joe Biden’s presidency saw the largest-ever mass Democratic exodus: 2.1 million voters fled its ranks over four years as Biden’s missteps on inflation and immigration were matched only by his stumblings on staircases.\n\nAt the same time, the GOP gained 2.4 million votes.\n\nBut the greater cause of fear in Democratic hearts is becoming more evident with every campaign-finance filing: The GOP’s outside fundraising arms are moving and shaking, while the Dems’ are struggling to find a spark.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund and its affiliate One Nation recently released its first set of filings under the stewardship of Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nTogether, the two raised a whopping $85 million — double their previous record for the first half of an off-election year.\n\nAnd while the Senate Leadership Fund is already spending heavily in five battleground states, its $29 million cash on hand is three times more than it reported at the same point in 2023, and five times what it had in 2021.\n\nOn the House side, it’s a similar story. The Congressional Leadership Fund and its affiliated American Action Network have raised a combined $60 million during the first half of 2025 — a record high, and nearly double the $35 million they brought in during the first half of 2023.\n\nAnd the House Republican-aligned groups have far outpaced their cross-aisle rivals: The House Democratic-aligned House Majority PAC and the nonprofit House Majority Forward have managed to scrounge up just $40 million this year.\n\nParty accounts show a widening divide as well.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee raised a paltry $8.5 million in July and is sitting on just $14 million in the bank — after shelling out more than $20 million to settle up bills racked up by Kamala Harris in her disastrous $1.5 billion presidential campaign.\n\nCan’t blame DNC donors for feeling gun-shy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican National Committee raised $13 million last month and holds $84 million on hand.\n\nThe fundraising figures indicate across-the-board GOP momentum that polling numbers and prediction models are starting to reflect.\n\nThe Cook Report, a respected political handicapper, now places 10 vulnerable Dem seats in their toss-up column, to just 8 on the GOP side; nonpartisan election-map website 270 To Win shades a two-seat advantage to Republicans.\n\nAll this, of course, must be seen in the context of Trump, the unstoppable force driving the entire spectrum of political opinion over the last 10 years. \n\nMuch to Democrats’ chagrin, Trump’s job-approval numbers are about 8 percentage points higher today than they were in August 2017.\n\nIn his time on the national stage, Trump has broken conventional political wisdom to bits.\n\nShattering the notion that his party faces certain midterm doom may just be the next move in his playbook. \n\nJoe Borelli is a managing director at Chartwell Strategy Group and former minority leader of the New York City Council.","summary":"Rudderless Democrats are embattled on two key fronts, indicating that the 2026 midterm elections won’t be like those of the past.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/28/opinion/midterm-tea-leaves-trump-can-upend-political-history-again/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-42lvmrjl9-1756417950079.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1756403917&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 22:39:34","author":"Joe Borelli","authors":["Joe Borelli"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.022},{"id":355338866,"title":"Why Cronos Is Skyrocketing Again Today","text":"Accessibility Menu\n\nSearch for a company\n\nAccessibility\n\nOur Services\nAll ServicesStock AdvisorEpicEpic PlusFool PortfoliosFool OnePodcasts HomeMotley Fool MoneyRule Breaker InvestingThe Motley Fool Foundation\n\nStock Market News\nTrending NewsStock Market NewsMarket MoversTech Stock NewsMarket TrendsConsumer Stock NewsCrypto NewsStock Market Indexes TodayMost Active Stocks TodayToday's Biggest Stock GainersToday's Biggest Stock LosersLargest Market Cap CompaniesMarket Research📨 Breakfast NewsTop Stocks to Buy NowBest ETFs to BuyBest AI StocksBest Growth StocksDividend KingsBest Index FundsNext Cryptos to ExplodeTechnologyEnergyReal EstateHealthcareConsumer GoodsMaterialsIndustrials\n\nHow to Invest\nHow to Invest MoneyWhat to Invest InHow to Invest in StocksHow to Invest in ETFsHow to Invest in Index FundsHow to Invest in BondsFinancial DictionaryStock Market 101Types of StocksStock Market SectorsStock Market IndexesWhat Are Stock Splits?What Is Compound Interest?After Hours TradingHow to Buy StockBest Brokers for BeginnersBest Brokerage AccountsGood Time to Buy StocksHow Many Shares to Buy?Portfolio DiversificationHow to Invest $100Magnificent Seven CompaniesWarren Buffett InvestmentsInvesting in ChatGPTInvesting in SpaceXInvesting in OpenAIInvesting in NvidiaInvesting in Databricks\n\nRetirement 101Types of Retirement AccountsHow to Contribute to 401k/IRA?Strategies to Save for RetirementAsset Allocation for My AgeBest IRA Brokerage AccountsWithdrawal Rules for 401(k) PlansSocial Security 101How to Maximize Social Security?Full Retirement AgeCOLAsCalculate Your SS BenefitsCollecting Spousal BenefitsMaximize Social Security BenefitHow Much Do I Need to Retire?When To Retire401(k) Plans403(b) PlansRoth IRA PlansIRA PlansHSA PlansComplete Retirement GuideBest & Worst States to RetireAverage Retirement SavingsMoving for RetirementHealthcare in RetirementUnderstanding Taxes in Retirement401(k) Minimum Distributions\n\nPersonal Finance\nBest Credit CardsCompare Credit CardsCredit Card ReviewsCredit Card Guides and ToolsBest Savings AccountsBank ReviewsBest Personal LoansPersonal Loan ReviewsBest Mortgage LendersCurrent Mortgage RatesMortgage Lender ReviewsGuide to MortgagesAuto InsuranceHome InsuranceLife Insurance\n\nAbout UsContact UsInvesting PhilosophyMotley Fool MoneyThe Motley Fool FoundationReviewsNewsroomFacebookTwitterYouTubeDiscussion BoardsCAPS - Stock Picking CommunityAdvertise With UsBecome an Affiliate PartnerPublishing StandardsAll ServicesStock AdvisorEpicEpic PlusFool PortfoliosFool One\n\nTop 10 Stocks to Buy ›\n\nTop 10 Stocks to Buy ›\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nDaily Stock GainersDaily Stock LosersMost Active Stocks\n\narrow-right\n\nDaily Stock GainersDaily Stock LosersMost Active Stocks\n\nPremium Investing Services\nInvest better with The Motley Fool.

Over the same period, Bitcoin was up 1%, and Ethereum was flat.\n\nCronos is a cryptocurrency launched and maintained by Crypto.com, a crypto website and trading exchange platform. The token has seen massive gains recently following news of an expanded partnership with Trump Media and news that the company connected to President Donald Trump is making moves to launch a new cryptocurrency treasury. As of this writing, the token is up 131% over the last week of trading. \n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nCronos keeps soaring thanks to the Trump deal\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump Media announced that it had entered into a partnership with Yorkville Acquisition Corp. that will create a large new cryptocurrency treasury company. Yorkville Acquisition is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and will be merging with Crypto.com to create Trump Media Group CRO -- a new publicly traded company built around crypto holdings.\n\nThe new company will purchase roughly $1 billion worth of the Cronos token, and investors have been bidding up the coin in response to the news. At the time of the announcement, a $1 billion position represented a roughly 19% stake in Cronos. \n\nWhat's next for Cronos?\n\nIn addition to its $1 billion Cronos treasury, Trump Media Group CRO will have $200 million in cash and $220 million cash-in mandatory exercise warrants as well as a credit offering worth up to $5 billion from one of Yorkville's affiliates. \n\nTrump Media is poised to own a majority stake in Trump Media Group CRO upon the completion of the SPAC merger. While the Cronos token seems to be attracting some powerful new allies, it remains to be seen if the cryptocurrency will be able to sustain bullish momentum or lose steam if its fundamentals are unable to support recent gains.\n\nCRYPTO: CRO\n\nToday's Change\n(0.16%) $0.04\nCurrent Price\n\nKey Data Points\n\nDay's Range\n$0.27 - $0.38\n\n$0.07 - $0.38\n\nGross Margin\n\nDividend Yield","summary":"With another round of big gains today, Cronos is now up more than 130% over the last week.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/28/why-cronos-is-skyrocketing-again-today/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/831386/gettyimages-1352607170.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 22:37:57","author":"Keith Noonan","authors":["Keith Noonan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.177},{"id":355326692,"title":"Chaos Erupts at Public Health Agency: CDC Officials Escorted from Headquarters","text":"The major public health authority in the U.S. is currently dealing with significant disruptions and is without leadership, as efforts are underway from the White House to remove its chosen director from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Thursday, three high-ranking officials were also seen being escorted out of its headquarters. \n\nSuch upheaval has sparked uncommon concern shared across political lines. The health secretary under President Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is attempting to promote anti-vaccine measures, which have been refuted by years of scientific evidence. \n\nThis disorder arises just weeks ahead of an important advisory group meeting, which Kennedy has restructured with individuals skeptical of vaccines, to provide new immunization guidelines. \n\nAmidst the chaos, two Republican senators have demanded a congressional investigation, while some Democrats contend that Kennedy should be dismissed. He is set to present his testimony on Capitol Hill on September 4. \n\nKennedy has not clarified why he dismissed Susan Monarez from her role as CDC director shortly after her appointment, though he hinted at potential further dismissals. \n\n“There’s significant unrest within the CDC, and removing some personnel over time is essential for reforming the organizational culture,” Kennedy commented during a press briefing in Texas. \n\nThe White House has only said that Monarez was “not aligned with” Trump’s agenda. There is no word on when a replacement could be named.\n\nMonarez’s lawyers said that she refused “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.” She is fighting her dismissal, saying the decision must come directly from Trump, who nominated her in March.\n\nThe saga began Wednesday night with the administration’s announcement that Monarez would no longer lead the CDC. In response, three officials – Dr. Debra Houry, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis and Dr. Daniel Jernigan – resigned from senior roles at the agency.\n\nThe officials returned to the office Thursday to collect their belongings, and staff members at the beleaguered agency had planned to gather in the afternoon to applaud them as they left the Atlanta campus. But their removal by security personnel earlier in the morning squelched those plans, according to current and former employees.\n\nHoury and Daskalakis told The Associated Press that Monarez had tried to guard against political meddling in scientific research and health recommendations.\n\n“We were going to see if she was able to weather the storm. And when she was not, we were done,” Houry said. She had been the agency’s deputy director and chief medical officer.\n\nDaskalakis resigned as head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and Jernigan from the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases\n\nIf removed, Monarez will be the shortest-serving director since the CDC was founded in 1946, exacerbating a leadership vacuum that has persisted since Trump took office. He initially chose David Weldon, a former Florida congressman who is a doctor and vaccine skeptic, but yanked the nomination in March.\n\nMonarez, a longtime government scientist, was tapped next to lead the $9.2 billion agency while she was serving as its interim director. But questions immediately emerged within Kennedy’s circle about her loyalty to the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, especially given her previous support of the COVID-19 vaccines that Kennedy has routinely criticized.\n\nKennedy rarely mentioned Monarez by name in the way he did other health agency leaders such s Mehmet Oz of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or Marty Makary of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nA flashpoint has been Kennedy’s handling of the CDC’s advisory vaccine committee, which he has tried to reshape since taking over the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe panel is expected to meet next month, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said any recommendations issued then will be “lacking legitimacy.”\n\n“Serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed,” said Cassidy, who heads the Senate committee overseeing Kennedy’s department. He added that “these decisions directly impact children’s health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted.”\n\nCassidy, a doctor, provided crucial support for Kennedy’s nomination after saying Kennedy had assured him that he would not topple the nation’s childhood vaccination program.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is a group of outside experts who make recommendations to the CDC director on how to use vaccines. The recommendations are then adopted by doctors, school systems, health insurers and others.\n\nKennedy is a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement, and in June, he abruptly dismissed the entire panel, accusing members of being too closely aligned with manufacturers. He replaced them with a group that included several vaccine skeptics and then he shut the door to several doctors organizations that had long helped form vaccine recommendations.\n\nHoury and Daskalakis said Monarez had tried to make sure scientific safeguards were in place.\n\nFor example, she tried to replace the official who coordinated the panel’s meetings with someone who had more policy experience. Monarez also pushed to have slides and evidence reviews posted weeks before the committee’s meetings and have the sessions open to public comment, Houry said.\n\nHHS officials nixed that and called Monarez to a meeting in Washington on Monday, Houry said.\n\nDaskalakis described the situation as untenable.\n\n“I came to the point personally where I think our science will be compromised, and that’s my line in the sand,” he said.\n\nSeitz and Megerian reported from Washington.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But I was told, ‘That's not a big priority right now,'\" he continued. Harrison explained he wanted to do a brand study for the Democratic Party because he felt it was broken. He said he hoped to get people from nonprofit and corporate spaces to look at the Democratic Party as a political brand. \"I was told, 'No, we're not going to spend time on that.'

Harrison argued that the Democratic Party should have stood by Biden in an interview with The Associated Press after former Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Harris replaced Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket after he exited the race. After the interview was released in January, Harrison objected to a headline that said, \"The DNC’s outgoing chair says Democrats should have stuck with Joe Biden in 2024.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"This headline isn't right. Stuck ‘by’ and stuck ‘with’ are two different things,\" he wrote on X. \"Yes, I believed we should have stuck by and defended President Joe Biden when he was our nominee, and at the same time when Joe Biden stepped down I was damn proud to fight for Vice President Harris to be our next POTUS.\" Biden's office and the DNC did not immediately return a request for comment.

The group behind it remain a mystery","text":"A $1.2 billion contrract has been awarded to build a migrant detention facility in Texas, but little is known about the Virginia company that was awarded the deal. \n\nThe contract was awarded to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a Virginia-based company, last month to build and operate the 5,000-bed, short-term detention facility at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas as the resident Donald Trump seeks to conduct the “largest deportation operation” in the country's history. The Army is contributing $232 million to the project, which is expected to be completed by the end of September 2027, according to a Defense Department contract notice.\n\nBut, the group that won the deal remains shrouded in mystery. \n\nThe company doesn’t appear to have experience with detention, but focuses on supply chain management and other services, including for the U.S. military, Bloomberg reported. It’s received contracts worth about $29 million from the Defense Department over the past five fiscal years, according to government records seen by the outlet, but nothing near the detention center scale.\n\nThe company was founded in 2008 and is described as a 39-person “veteran-owned, small disadvantaged business specializing in the entire acquisition-logistics lifecycle,” according to its ZoomInfo profile.\n\nAcquisition Logistics’ website requires a login. The address listed as the company’s headquarters leads to a residential home. The company’s CEO Ken A. Wagner hasn’t spoken publicly about the $1.2 billion deal and didn’t respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nEven the solicitation notice, seen by the AP, mandated some privacy, requiring the contractor to inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials about requests and calls from members of Congress or the press, the outlet reported.\n\nThe lack of information about the company has concerned some experts and officials, especially after the equally swift construction of “Alligator Alcatraz,” a Florida facility that has been plagued by lawsuits and allegations of inhumane conditions. A federal judge ordered the facility’s operations to be wound down and required all detainees to be relocated within 60 days.\n\n“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” Texas Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss, told the AP. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”\n\n“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” said Joshua Schnell, an attorney specializing in federal contracting law.\n\nWithin days of the contract being awarded, construction began at Fort Bliss. Three white tents, each about 810 feet long, have been put up, according to satellite imagery.\n\nThe use of military bases as detention centers harkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Fort Bliss and other Army camps, Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, told the outlet. Military facilities are particularly susceptible to abuse and neglect because they’re not easy for loved ones to access, she said.\n\n“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.” \n\nThe decision to award the contract to the small business is unusual. The majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies such as Geo Group and CoreCivic. \n\nThe bidding was open only to small firms, the AP reported, noting that the company received “preferential status” because of its designation as a Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.\n\nThe Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications. The Independent has asked the Army for more information.\n\nGemini Tech Services filed a protest to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, challenging the award and alleging Acquisition Logistics “lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work,” a source familiar with the complaint told the AP.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to Gemini for comment.","summary":"The sprawling 5,000-bed detention facility in Texas is estimated to be completed in September 2027","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/army-texas-detention-center-company-unknown-b2816139.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/28/12/Trump_Immigration_Fort_Bliss_04181.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Jy1ysWQB-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-28 22:23:12","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":355328614,"title":"Zelenskyy Calls Russian Strike An 'Attack On Trump,' As Senior Aides Head To US","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Russia's missile and drone attack on Kyiv, which killed at least 21 people, \"a strike by Russia\" against US President Donald Trump, who himself was \"not happy\" about the assault, the White House said.\n\n\"Russia is now striking at everyone in the world who wants peace,\" Zelenskyy said on August 28 in his nightly video address.\n\n\"It is a strike against Ukraine...And it is also a strike by Russia against President Trump,\" who has grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of progress toward a cease-fire and has threatened Moscow with new sanctions and tariffs.\n\n\"We heard in Washington that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is supposedly ready to end the war...But instead, he chooses ballistics over any real steps toward peace,\" Zelenskyy added.\n\nZelenskyy said he expects a framework for security guarantees for Ukraine to be outlined as soon as next week.

Trump's latest masterstroke has exposed Democrats as incapable, unserious and woefully out of touch: MARK HALPERIN","text":"Less than two weeks after President Donald Trump deployed federal law enforcement officers in Washington, DC, a miracle has happened.\n\nWe have heard a squeak of gratitude from the city's Democratic mayor.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Mayor Muriel Bowser admitted: 'We greatly appreciate the surge of officers that enhance what [the Metropolitan Police Department] has been able to do in this city.'\n\nAnd guess what? It's working. Carjackings alone have dropped 87 percent she said, adding: 'We know that when carjackings go down, when use of guns goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer, so this surge has been important to us.'\n\nTrump brought the National Guard onto the streets of the nation's capital on August 11 and, whatever one thinks of Trump's show of force, the effect has been unmistakable.\n\nWhen the state looks muscular, the streets tend to behave. It's not a political philosophy or social experiment so much as a maxim of human physics: mass meets motion.\n\nThe facts and feet on the ground — officers on corners, tactical vans prowling corridors where carjackers once trolled — assert themselves more persuasively than any cable news panel discussion, Capitol Hill lecture or social media squabble.\n\nOne might think every leader of every political stripe would celebrate the news of a safer city and more secure citizens. But rather than singing cautious praise for the effort, many Democrats are still squawking off-key.\n\nConsider Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson's recent appearance on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.' Joe Scarborough tried, more than once, to coax a simple acknowledgement that adding more officers can be part of a solution.\n\nThe mayor pirouetted around the premise like a ballet dancer in a bull ring. It was archetypal comic-tragic television, the kind that makes jaws drop and coffees go cold. Mayor Johnson's refusal to admit a logical fact did not read as principle; it read as an allergy to common sense.\n\nTo many viewers around the country, especially in those swing state suburbs, the implication was crystal clear: If Johnson can't admit we might need more cops in Chicago, what on earth is he doing in the mayor's job? What are Democrats possibly thinking?\n\nThe political reality is that voters want order, and the Democratic Party is, for the most part, once again proving itself incapable of reading the room.\n\nAccording to a new AP-NORC survey, 53 percent of Americans back the president's actions to tackle violent crime. A majority — 55 percent — say it's acceptable for the US military and National Guard to assist local police in major cities.\n\nThe public is more cautious about Washington seizing full control of city departments, however; only about one-third support such an extreme measure.\n\nStill, the underlying tone is unmistakable: 80 percent consider crime in big cities a serious problem. The same survey records Trump's highest approval rating to date, up five points in the past month.\n\nIn politics one doesn't need unanimity; one needs a working majority plus momentum. Those numbers give Trump both, although it is important to note that other surveys, with the questions posed differently, present a less favorable view.\n\nTrump's critics call his act authoritarian theater; his supporters call it taking the problem seriously. Fair-minded citizens should demand careful guardrails — body cameras, clear rules of engagement, independent review — because all humans are flawed and power is a complex tool.\n\nAs a country, we can and should debate and demand civil liberty safeguards, oversight, education, and the dangers of mission creep. That's civic hygiene.\n\nBut it is unserious and insincere to pretend that, in the city that writes our laws, a stronger law enforcement presence won't deter lawbreakers.\n\nDeterrence isn't theoretical. Thieves and carjackers perform their own risk-reward calculation on the curb, not in a grad seminar.\n\nIf high-crime zones are flooded with tough, trained people who carry legal authority and the tools of the trade, the probabilities and outcomes change.\n\nFor decades, Democrats won city halls with a promise to keep neighborhoods livable.\n\nNow, too many of their party leaders present public safety as an impossible philosophical labyrinth, a precious landscape dotted with politically incorrect rhetorical minefields, rather than as a basic street-level, quality of life necessity.\n\nRepublicans, and Trump in particular, thrive when opponents make the simple look complicated.\n\nHistorians of the future may someday unravel how Trump keeps drawing adversaries who obligingly help him make his point. For now, we can only shake our heads in wonder.\n\nDemocrats could meet this moment with something sturdier than semantic hedging. They could state unequivocally that crime is a bad thing. That protecting innocent citizens is, constitutionally, an important governmental role. And that law enforcement can be infused with empathy and paired with community trust, youth jobs, drug treatment and moral rectitude.\n\nThe capital's crackdown may not be durable; criminals adapt, and big cities are ever-shifting, gargantuan organisms. Yet politics is measured in months, not millennia.\n\nIf voters believe the streets feel safer this summer because a president made them feel watched and seen, Democrats will again learn a lesson they used to teach: governing means choosing and choosing safety is not a moral compromise.\n\nToo many Democratic leaders are reaching for euphemism, as if plain talk about policing might break the spell of progressive credibility.\n\nBut the secret is out, the spell has been broken, and Americans are stepping over the shards and demanding safety.","summary":"Trump's critics call his act authoritarian theater; his supporters call it taking the problem seriously.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15044585/Trump-masterstroke-Democrats-secret-MARK-HALPERIN.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/28/21/101642909-0-image-a-23_1756412253682.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 22:22:21","author":"Editor,Mark Halperin","authors":["Editor","Mark Halperin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":355332940,"title":"US Targets Venezuela Over 'Soles' Cartel.

While some of US President Donald Trump's right-wing led allies in South America -- Argentina, Ecuador and Paraguay -- have echoed his designation of \"Soles\" as a terrorist organization, many have doubts such a group even exists.Venezuela itself, and neighbor Colombia, insist there is no such thing as \"Cartel de los Soles.\" Some experts agree, saying there is no evidence of the existence of an organized group with a defined hierarchy that goes by that name. The Trump administration in July described the \"Cartel de los Soles\" as a \"Venezuela-based criminal group headed by Nicolas Maduro and other high-ranking Venezuelan individuals.\"It said the cartel \"provides material support to foreign terrorist organizations threatening the peace and security of the United States, namely Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel\" -- two major drug trafficking groups.Washington upped a bounty to $50 million for the capture of Maduro on drug charges.Yet in March, the latest US State Department report on global anti-drug operations made no mention of the \"Cartel de los Soles\" or any connection between Maduro and narco trafficking.The United States did not recognize Maduro's 2024 re-election, rejected by the Venezuelan opposition and much of the world as a stolen vote.\"There is no such thing, so Maduro can hardly be its boss,\" Phil Gunson, an analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, told AFP of the so-called \"Cartel de los Soles.\" And while there was no doubt of \"complicity\" between people in power and organized crime, \"direct, incontrovertible evidence has never been presented\" for the existence of an organized cartel by that name in Venezuela.According to the InSight Crime think tank, the name was ironically coined by Venezuelan media in 1993 after two generals were nabbed for drug trafficking. The sun is a symbol on the military uniform epaulettes of generals in the South American country.\"Rather than a hierarchical organization with Maduro directing drug trafficking strategies, the Cartel of the Suns is more accurately described as a system of corruption wherein military and political officials profit by working with drug traffickers,\" InSight Crime said on its website.Maduro denies any connection to the drug trade, although two nephews of his wife have been convicted in New York for cocaine trafficking. The United States says its Caribbean deployment is focused on combating drug trafficking, but Caracas fears there is more to it.Venezuela has deployed warships and drones to patrol its coastline, and Maduro announced he would activate 4.5 million civilian militia members -- a number questioned by observers -- to confront \"any threat.\"According to Mariano de Alba, a London-based geopolitics expert, the US deployment was likely not an attack force.\"If the Trump administration really wanted to provoke regime change\" as claimed by Maduro, it would more likely rely on \"surprise action,\" de Alba told AFP.","summary":"Washington cited Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's alleged role in the \"Cartel de los Soles\" as it dispatched five warships and thousands of Marines toward the Caribbean country for an anti-drug deployment.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/us-targets-venezuela-over-soles-cartel-does-it-exist-3781882","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4618405/us-offering-reward-50-million-arrest-venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=8e034bcf1c5c3bcf1437502c6a077dd3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 22:21:11","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.032},{"id":355329210,"title":"Internet forum 4chan sues UK regulator in US over free speech","text":"LONDON :U.S. internet forums 4chan and Kiwi Farms have filed a legal case in the United States against Britain's media regulator Ofcom, saying its enforcement of the country's online safety law violated Americans' right to freedom of speech.\n\nThe suit escalates a clash between tech groups and regulators in Britain and the European Union. The regulators say they are trying to protect users online, while critics, led by U.S. President Donald Trump, accuse them of threatening free speech and targeting U.S. companies. \n\n4chan, an irreverent site that hosts content, including pornography and conspiracy theories, is being investigated over its compliance with the new British law.\n\nOfcom said in June it had received complaints about potential illegal content on 4chan, and that the platform had not responded to a statutory information request.\n\nKiwi Farms, which has hosted harassment campaigns, has also received demands from Ofcom to comply with the law, according to the filing. \n\nThe suit from the two sites said Ofcom sent \"threatening communications\" to U.S.-based internet companies that interfered with their constitutional rights and operations.\n\nLawyers for the sites said they operated in compliance with U.S. laws, and their editorial decisions were protected by the First Amendment. \n\n\"Foreign governments, particularly those in Europe, which have not managed to build technology sectors of their own have, for the past half-decade or more, sought to control the American Internet, and hobble American competitiveness, through a range of legislative and nonlegislative initiatives,\" the suit said. \n\nOfcom said it was aware of the lawsuit. \n\n\"Under the Online Safety Act, any service that has links with the UK now has duties to protect UK users, no matter where in the world it is based,\" a spokesperson said. \n\n\"The act does not, however, require them to protect users based anywhere else in the world.\"\n\nBoth sites said they had no presence, operations or infrastructure outside of the United States.\n\nUnder the act, however, links with Britain can mean having a significant number of UK users.\n\nAction that Ofcom can take for non-compliance includes fines of up to 10 per cent of qualifying worldwide revenue.\n\nTerry Green, partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman UK, said the suit, irrespective of its merits, was a critical moment.\n\n\"Ofcom's response to this lawsuit will be crucial as this has the risk of being replicated across the United States and even globally,\" he said.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/internet-forum-4chan-sues-uk-regulator-us-over-free-speech-5321266","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--D1Z-6IzY--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-08-28t221622z_2_lynxmpel7r13c_rtroptp_3_cyber-results.jpg?itok=3J3j","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28

shooting suspect","text":"Police are investigating online videos apparently posted by the shooter who killed two children and injured 17 other people at a Catholic church in Minneapolis, which describe an obsession with school shootings and show a rambling written statement and numerous guns painted with slurs, mass killers' names and political messages.\n\nMinneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara identified the suspected shooter as Robin Westman, who died from a self-inflicted wound after firing into Annunciation Catholic Church during a morning Mass.\n\nWestman, 23, graduated from Annunciation's grade school in 2017, according to a yearbook photo obtained by CNN.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Police share direct message to Dezi Freeman\n\nAuthorities are now evaluating a series of bizarre videos posted to YouTube by a user identified as \"Robin W\" to authenticate them and potentially learn more about the motivations in the attack, police sources told CNN.\n\nThe videos, which have been taken down, were uploaded on Wednesday (Thursday AEST).\n\nO'Hara said the shooter had posted a \"manifesto\" that was timed to be published on YouTube, and that investigators were going through it to \"try and develop a motive from that\".\n\nIn the videos, two of which were titled with Westman's full name, the person recording the video pages through a handwritten notebook and displays a shooting target with an image of Jesus and a collection of guns, magazines and ammunition laid out on a bed.\n\nVarious messages and racial and religious slurs were written on the weapons, including \"psycho killer\" and \"suck on this!\"\n\nAntisemitic messages were also scrawled on the guns, with one reading \"6 million wasn't enough\".\n\nAnother magazine had the message, \"kill Donald Trump\".\n\nREAD MORE: 'I've punched blokes in the mouth': Katter threatens 9News journo\n\nIn a voiceover of one video, the person filming also claimed to have met and to support Brandon Herrera, a pro-gun YouTuber who lost a Republican primary for a Texas congressional seat last year.\n\nHerrera condemned the attack in a social media message posted on Wednesday afternoon, saying the shooter would \"burn in hell.\"\n\nAnother of the gun magazines shown in the videos lists the names of six notorious mass shooters, including Adam Lanza, whom the suspect wrote they had a \"deep fascination\" for.\n\nLanza gunned down 26 people – including 20 children – at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012.\n\nThe name of Robert Bowers, who was convicted of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, is also legible on the side of one of the weapons.\n\nThe rambling notebook – which was written partially in English and partially using English words in Cyrillic script with some Russian words – expresses feelings of self-hatred and wishes to die.\n\nREAD MORE: The grim reality facing authorities in the hunt for accused cop killer\n\nOther entries described the author becoming \"morbidly obsessed\" at a young age with Lanza and other past school shooters.\n\n\"I'm so sorry\" is written in large letters on one page. The person filming whispered \"I love my family\" while recording that page, and said \"I don't know what else to say\" at another point in the video.\n\nThe notebook also included a diagram of the inside of a church that seems to match the layout of Annunciation Church.\n\nThe person recording showed themselves stabbing a knife into the drawing while saying, \"ha, nice.\"\n\nThe writings in the notebook, along with images on the weapons, express a wide embrace of racism and antisemitic views – although the author claims those extremist ideas aren't expressly the reason behind the attack.\n\n\"In regards to my motivation behind the attack I can't really put my finger on a specific purpose. It definitely wouldn't be for racism or white supremacy,\" the notebook reads.\n\n\"I don't want to do it to spread a message. I do it to please myself. I do it because I am sick.\"\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Any hope of peace falls apart as deadly strike threatens all-out war\n\nCody Zoschak, a senior manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a research group that tracks extremism online, told CNN that the videos seemed similar to writings published by Solomon Henderson, who fatally shot a fellow student and injured one other person before killing himself at a Nashville high school earlier this year.\n\n\"He was associated with similar online subcultures and nihilistic violence; he had a very confusing mix of materials in his manifesto, and generally we saw a lot of efforts to misdirect and or troll,\" Zoschak said.\n\nThe suspect's last known address was at Westman's father's home about a 20-minute walk from Annunciation, on a quiet block of craftsman bungalows.\n\nThe elder Westman and a woman were seen by several neighbours sitting on the curb on Wednesday, looking stricken as law enforcement officers from various agencies went through their house.\n\nJim White, 57, who lives across the street, described them as a friendly couple who, when they learned White was working on a landscaping project, gave him hundreds of cement blocks to create a planter that now adorns his front lawn.\n\n\"They are very nice neighbours, very good people,\" he said.\n\nNeighbour Terry Cole said he didn't remember seeing the suspected shooter often in the neighbourhood.\n\nCole briefly choked up while speaking with a CNN reporter.\n\n\"They are a wonderful couple — a good part of this neighbourhood,\" he said. \"People take care of each other here. It's just such an absolute shock.\"\n\nThe suspected shooter's mother worked at Annunciation from 2016 through 2021, according to social media posts.\n\nWestman attended the Minnesota Transitions Charter School for two months at the beginning of the 2017 school year, after graduating from Annunciation, a spokesperson for the charter school confirmed, but it's unclear whether the suspect graduated from high school.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Judge doubles sentence for missing kayaker who faked his own death\n\nIn 2019, the suspect's mother filed to legally change the suspect's name from Robert Paul Westman to Robin M.

The president is passionate about golf and attended the LIV Golf tournament, which was hosted at Trump National Doral Club in April. \n\nAside from tournaments, Trump has spent a considerable amount of time golfing on the weekends. An online tracker keeping tally of the number of days Trump has golfed estimates the president has golfed 55 out of the 221 days he’s been in office.\n\nTrump also enjoys attending other sporting events; he’s made appearances at the Super Bowl, the Daytona 500, the NCAA wrestling championships, the FIFA World Cup, and two UFC fights. \n\nOften, the president makes a show out of attending – teasing it online and occasionally joining winners on stage. Earlier this month, the president appeared to pocket a FIFA Club World Cup medal after the president of FIFA gave it to him to look at. \n\nAlready the most raucous event in golf, this Ryder Cup has more anticipation than usual because the venue is a public course with a reputation for having the rowdiest fans.\n\nIn his post, Trump added that he wanted Keegan Bradley, the Team USA captain, to also play on the American Ryder Cup Team. \n\n“Keegan Bradley should DEFINITELY be on the American Ryder Cup Team - As Captain!!! He is an AMAZING guy,” Trump wrote. \n\nHowever, Bradley said he would not select himself to play in the matches even though he qualifies, in keeping with a tradition since Arnold Palmer in 1963.\n\nBradley, 39, is the youngest American captain since Palmer was 34. Whether he should play and maintain captain duties has been the subject of much debate, and Bradley has added to the intrigue by winning twice in the last year.\n\nHe shot 63 on Saturday — a few hours before Trump's post on Truth Social — to get into fourth place with a chance to win the season-ending FedEx Cup.","summary":"Trump is an avid golfer and already attended the LIV tournament, hosted at his golf club, earlier this year","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-golf-ryder-cup-attend-b2816116.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/28/20/01/GettyImages-1612472233.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1usmiv51-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-28 22:12:28","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.011},{"id":355335020,"title":"White House slams Pritzker, blue cities as crime fight escalates: 'Decline is a choice'","text":"There is no reason for Americans to live in fear as President Donald Trump floats mobilizing National Guard troops to other cities to address crime like he has in Washington, the White House insists.

To the Greeks, any man who worked for another man, even in return for payment was considered a slave and the lowest of the low. A proper Greek served only himself and was the master of at least one slave. Slavery in Jesus' time in the Roman Empire was endemic, the empire ran on slaves, but they would earn their freedom and full Roman citizenship under Roman law\n\nAnd I think that the Greek version holds true to today.\n\nLook at all the brave and free Americans that claim they would gladly take a stand and smash Trump and his MAGA takeover of America.\n\nBut if only they were bound and shackled to their job, their debt, their rent\n\nPoor things, they have no say or control over their lives at all. This wasn't their choice and their nothing they can do about it\n\nThat to me is a slave\nThe fact is these slaves can cast off their shackles, but prefer the comfort of slavery. It's easy and only require they keep sitting there doing their day to day and hoping someone e will show up to liberate them and deal with their oppressors for them\n\nWell, I think we all know how this ends\nBut remember, it's not your fault, there's nothing you couldn't done, you had no choice\n\nDisplayed 4 of 4 comments\n\nEnable JavaScript for Fark in order to vote for entries.\n\nLog in (at the top of the page) to enable voting.\n\nView Voting Results:SmartestandFunniest\n\nRedisplay/refresh comments\n\nIf you're having problems voting, quoting, or posting comments, try disabling any browser add-ons that might disable Javascript (NoScript, AdBlock, etc).See our FAQ.\n\n Forgot password?\n\nCreate an account to make comments\n\nRemember me\n\nIf you can see this, something's wrong with your browser's CSS support.
