Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy TERRY ZELLER and DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:28 GMT, 2 February 2025 |Updated:01:02 GMT, 2 February 2025 \n\nThe New York Times has issued a strong rebuttal to allegations made by Justin Baldoni in his amended lawsuit against Blake Lively.\nOn February 1, Baldoni filed an amended version of his $400 million defamation suit accusing his It Ends With Us co-star of giving the news outlet early access to her sexual harassment complaint.\nIn the updated suit, Baldoni's legal team claims that an analysis of the article's HTML source code revealed references to a 'message-embed-generator' with a date of '2024-10-31,' though the article in question was not published until December 2024.\nIn response, The New York Times issued a statement rejecting the allegations, particularly a claim that the publication had gained 'early access' to Lively's civil rights complaint.\nA spokesperson for The Times said in a statement, per JustJared, 'The Baldoni/Wayfarer legal filings are rife with inaccuracies about The New York Times, including, for example, the bogus claim that The Times had early access to Ms. Lively's state civil rights complaint. \n'Mr. Baldoni's lawyers base their erroneous claim on postings by amateur internet sleuths, who, not surprisingly, are wrong.'\n\nThe New York Times has issued a strong rebuttal to allegations made by Justin Baldoni in his amended lawsuit against Blake Lively; (seen in August 2024)\n\nIn response, The New York Times issued a statement rejecting the allegations, particularly a claim that the publication had gained 'early access' to Lively's civil rights complaint; (seen in August 2024)\nThe spokesperson further addressed the specific allegation regarding the article's date, noting that the sleuths had pointed to a version of Lively's state complaint published by The Times that showed a 'December 10' date, despite the complaint not being filed until more than a week later. \nHowever, they clarified, 'The problem: that date is generated by Google software and is unrelated to the date when The Times received it and posted it. A look at the metadata from the posted document correctly shows it was posted after Ms. Lively filed it with the California Civil Rights Department.'\nIn the revised legal filing submitted late Friday, Baldoni’s legal team said, 'Of course, it may be the case that the New York Times just happened to load a new tool for embedding text messages within an article as part of routine system upgrades, only to stumble six weeks later upon the perfect opportunity to show off this new graphic tool in an article that relied heavily upon cherry-picked and misleadingly reframed text messages.\n\n Justin Baldoni claims Blake Lively 'plotted with NYT for months' \n'But the simpler explanation is that the New York Times had already begun building its defamatory article no later than October 31, 2024, including developing a slick new graphic display module to prominently feature the misleadingly edited and context-stripped text messages centered in the article,' the suit continues.\nThe amended complaint also includes an updated timeline, dating back to January 1, 2019, when Baldoni first reached out to Colleen Hoover, author of It Ends with Us, about adapting her novel into a film. \nThe timeline details his communications with both Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, as well as events surrounding the book’s release and public reception, followed by the ongoing legal dispute.\nThe news comes as Baldoni launched his own website dedicated to defending himself against Lively's sexual harassment allegations. \nIn an attempt to share his side of the story, the actor, 41, who is seeking to offer transparency to the public amid his legal battle, shared a website containing his amended complaint and a timeline of relevant events related to the case.\nBaldoni attorney, Bryan Freedman, told DailyMail.com that Baldoni's amended his lawsuit due 'to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light.' \n'This fresh evidence corroborates what we knew all along, that due to purely egotistical reasons Ms. Lively and her entire team colluded for months to destroy reputations through a complex web of lies, false accusations and the manipulation of illicitly received communications,' Freedman continued. \nHe concluded: 'The ongoing public interest in this case online has ironically shed light on the undeniable facts pertaining to The New York Times and how heavily Ms. Lively and her representatives were not only deeply involved in the attempted take down and smear campaign of Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and their teams but that they themselves initiated it.' \n\nJustin Baldoni launched his own website dedicated to defending himself against Blake Lively 's sexual harassment allegations; seen on December 04, 2024\nEarlier this month, in a filing DailyMail.com, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, it was reported that Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, were doubling down on their efforts to gag Baldoni and his lawyers. \nIn a letter to the judge presiding over the case on Monday, the couple's attorney urgently requested a conference to highlight their 'growing concerns' over what they describe as Freedman's alleged 'extrajudicial misconduct'.\n\n Blake Lively is spammed with porn amid Justin Baldoni lawsuit drama \nThe filing cites Freedman's recent media appearances as well as a report of a new website being created by Baldoni's team to 'strategically release selected documents and communications' between the two feuding co-stars.\nThe report, published by the Daily Mail last week, revealed Baldoni's lawyers are in the process of building a website on the case that will allow anyone to see numerous snippets of unedited footage from the film, including anything which 'speaks to' Lively's original complaint about the actor.\nFreedman has publicly warned: 'We have all the receipts – and more.'\nBut the couple's attorney Michael Gottlieb has claimed the website and Freedman's public comments are part of a campaign to 'influence proceedings and the public perception' of the case with 'inflammatory content'.\n'He further has made it clear that his priority is to 'torpedo Blake Lively's career for good' by, among other things, creating a website to release strategically selected documents and communications between Ms. Lively and Mr. Baldoni,' Gottlieb states in the letter. \n'The planned website will release what Mr. Freedman self-servingly proclaims will be 'full unedited WhatsApp, text and email exchanges between Lively and Baldoni,' although neither the media nor public will have any way of knowing which communications Mr. Freedman has selectively omitted from disclosure, including communications that Mr. Freedman and his clients may have deleted.'\n\nIn an attempt to share his side of the story, the actor, 41, who is seeking to offer transparency to the public amid his legal battle, shared a website containing his amended complaint and a timeline of relevant events related to the case (Lively seen in 2021)\n\nThe website (pictured above) contain legal documents that share his side of the story\nGottlieb goes on to argue that the website will 'presumably not include' communications that Freedman and Baldoni have had with media sources, meaning it will be 'incomplete, biased, and prejudicial by design'.\nHe also claims Freedman's 'efforts to spin' Lively's request for a gag order as an attempt to silence them out of fear, in a bid to 'impugn' her character.\nA source familiar with case claimed that the website will promote transparency in the case and denied it would contain selective material.\n'There is nothing that will be selective on the website. The aim here is to do the exact opposite of what they did – to not be selective, to not cherry pick, and to not doctor text messages which they did when they gave them to the New York Times,' the source told DailyMail.com on Monday.\nLively and Baldoni's feud first emerged in rumors of discord on the set of the domestic abuse drama that heated up during the promotional campaign that accompanied its release last August. \nAccording to Baldoni, the bitterness between the film's two stars was so bad he and his family were banished to a cinema basement for the premiere on Lively's orders.\n\nThe decision to publish the site on Saturday comes after the star amended his $400 million suit accusing Lively of giving The New York Times advance access to her sexual harassment complaint; Baldoni and Lively pictured on set last year\n\nBaldoni attorney, Bryan Freedman, told DailyMail.com that Baldoni's amended his lawsuit due 'to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light' (pictured in 2024) \nIn December, the drama exploded into a legal fight when Lively sued claiming sexual harassment.\nAt the same time, the New York Times released a story based on Lively's legal filing that accused Baldoni of orchestrating a negative publicity campaign against her and put the harassment claim front and center.\nIn turn, Baldoni sued the Times for defamation and, last week, launched a lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds that accused her of using their celebrity power to hijack his film and attempt to torpedo his career.\nAnother twist in the tale came earlier this week, when DailyMail.com obtained raw footage showing the slow dance montage scene during which Lively claimed Baldoni had sexually harassed her by nuzzling her neck and declaring: 'It smells so good'.\nIn her civil rights complaint filed last month, the actress insisted nobody overheard the comment because the romantic montage was silent and the microphones were switched off.\n\nThe film at the heart of the feud, based on the 2016 bestseller by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and was a box office hit. It follows Lily Bloom, a florist played by Lively, who falls in love with a charming but abusive neurosurgeon played by Baldoni\nBut DailyMail.com revealed Baldoni's sound equipment was on – and exclusively obtained an explosive video showing all three takes that smashes Lively's claims into smithereens.\nThe tapes show how friendly the two stars were before it all went so wrong. They laugh and joke around – even joshing about the size of Baldoni's nose and talk about how they spend their time with their spouses.\nThey include a complete record of the conversation in question that makes clear the comment about her smelling so good was in response to Lively talking about her spray tan as they film a romantic dance.\nBaldoni tells Lively he's probably getting his beard on her and she responds by saying she's probably getting spray tan on him.\nThen he quips back 'it smells good' before both laugh and she tells him the scent actually comes from her body makeup.\nAnd while the montage does show Baldoni nuzzling Lively's neck as part of the scene in which they play lovers, the conversation between them is all business with the pair spending most of it talking about lighting and their other halves.\n\nBaldoni (seen last year) and Lively's legal fight began after she sued him for sexual harassment just days before Christmas\nThe raw footage clip comes complete with audio and was passed to DailyMail.com by the actor's production company Wayfarer and Freedman who has previously said Baldoni has 'nothing to hide'.\nOur exclusive footage is among the many recent revelations in a lengthy saga that began with talk of rancor behind the scenes of It Ends With Us.\nIt exploded into a legal fight just before Christmas when the former Gossip Girl sued Baldoni for sexual harassment.\nAt the same time, the New York Times released a story based on Lively's legal filing that accused him of orchestrating a negative publicity campaign against her and put the smell claim front and center.\nIn turn, Baldoni sued the Times for defamation and, last week, launched a $400million lawsuit against Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds that accused her of using her celebrity power to hijack his film and attempt to torpedo his career.\nJustin BaldoniNew York TimesBlake Lively\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Baldoni accused of 'bogus claim' as New York Times DENIES 'early access' to Blake Lively's complaint\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLily Collins' husband Charlie McDowell hits back at criticism about couple's 'path to having a baby' through surrogacy\n\nThe Masked Singer viewers left stunned as the identities of TWO celebrities are revealed ahead of the semi final\n\nJustin Baldoni publishes explosive new website telling 'his side' of Blake Lively lawsuit\n\nWhy Renee Zellweger could be about to join the club of 'v.v. smug marrieds' after her British ex-mechanic boyfriend AND his parents joined her on the Bridget Jones red carpet...\n\nKim Kardashian turns heads in Beverly Hills as she shoots scenes for new Ryan Murphy project\n\nSomething for everyone!

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated that, according to the Pentagon’s “initial assessment,” no civilians were harmed in the operation.\n\n“These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our allies,” Trump wrote on Saturday. “The strikes destroyed the caves they lived in and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.”\n\nTrump claimed that the US military had been tracking the unnamed attack planner for years, but former President Joe Biden and “his cronies wouldn’t act quickly enough to get the job done.”\n\n“I did it! The message to ISIS and all others who would attack Americans is that ‘WE WILL FIND YOU, AND WE WILL KILL YOU!’” the US president added.\n\nThe Pentagon did not identify the neutralized “planner” but insisted that the airstrikes had degraded the group’s ability to “plot and conduct terrorist attacks” and served as a “clear signal that the United States always stands ready to find and eliminate terrorists.”\n\nThe operation was reportedly carried out in coordination with Somali authorities, who confirmed that President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud had been “informed of the US strike.”\n\n“I extend my deepest gratitude for the unwavering support of the United States in our shared fight against terrorism,” Mohamud said, praising Trump for his “bold and decisive leadership.”\n\nThe Islamic State in Somalia emerged in 2015 after a faction split from the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab group. While al-Shabaab remains the dominant terrorist organization in the region, IS has been attempting to expand its influence, particularly in the northern parts of the country.\n\nAt the end of his first term, Trump ordered a near-total withdrawal of US troops from Somalia. The latest airstrikes mark one of the first military actions he has ordered in the African nation since beginning his second term on January 20, 2025.","summary":"President Donald Trump has ordered precision airstrikes in Somalia targeting an alleged senior Islamic State terrorist attack “planner“ \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/612034-trump-orders-airstrikes-somalia/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.02/article/679ebf7085f540190116b282.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:44:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.016},{"id":286161284,"title":"Singapore’s president cites global ‘mistakes’ as inflation worries World Economic Forum","text":"Global inflation has yet to die and advanced economies outside China cannot be complacent at a time of fickle consumers and trade tensions, according to the last Davos panel of 2025.\nLuminaries from International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva to BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink acknowledged that, for all the efforts by central banks to tame consumer prices, policymakers cannot afford to take their eye off the ball.\n“Most of the body of the genie is in the bottle, kind of getting stuck there,” the IMF managing director said. “But the legs are kind of hanging still out. We need to push it all the way down.”\nThe remarks chimed with concerns aired frequently during the past week in and around the World Economic Forum, a period coinciding with the first four days of Donald Trump’s new term. While his arrival as US president excited finance executives, it has largely caused global economists and central bankers to wince at the possible fiscal, inflation or growth consequences.\nThat contrasts with the cautious optimism that featured during last year’s Davos finale, where participants exuded nervousness at the possibility of a Trump comeback but did wonder aloud if the global inflation shock may fade. Fink isn’t convinced.\n“I believe the bond market is indicating that inflation may be higher than we think,” he said Friday. “The genie may be coming out of the bottle.”\n\nMarket gauges of future inflation expectations have been rising for some time. The 10-year US break-even rate, the difference between inflation-linked and nominal yields of similar maturities and a proxy for the average rate of price rises over the period, has climbed by nearly 50 basis points since September to around 2.5 per cent. Inflation swaps have also climbed.\nSingapore’s President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a veteran economist and former finance minister of his country who was also on the panel, observed a longer-term backdrop that has stoked consumer prices.\n“Central banks and fiscal authorities have made mistakes in the last 15 years that set us on a somewhat higher plane of inflation for the medium term than we otherwise would be,” he said.\nThe emphasis in Davos contrasted slightly with that from the IMF itself just a week ago. It upgraded its global growth forecast then for this year, spurred by stronger-than-expected US demand and moderating inflation worldwide, and said that backdrop should let central banks continue cutting borrowing costs.\nWorries about consumer prices have still abounded throughout the week. As the forum began, former Swiss central bank chief Philipp Hildebrand – vice chair of BlackRock – worried that inflation could turn out to be “stubbornly sticky” and predicted “not many, if any” US rate reductions. Ken Rogoff, once a chief economist at the IMF, said that the “odds of a hike as good as the odds of a cut”.\n\nThat’s not an outlook Trump is likely to welcome. Speaking by video to the forum on Thursday, he pledged to the biggest tax cut in US history, repeated threats of tariffs, called on Saudi Arabia and Opec to “bring down the cost of oil”, and added that when that happens, “I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately.”\nThe Saudi Arabian economy chief, Faisal Alibrahim, didn’t rise to that demand when speaking on the panel. Meanwhile Fink, though perhaps less hawkish than Hildebrand or Rogoff, said the outlook does not promise much in the way of easing from the US Federal Reserve.\n“They still have room to cut,” he said. Still, “the economy is very strong” and “I see probabilities” that the Fed might need to “revert and go back up”, he added.\nFor her own part, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, also speaking on the panel, expressed “strong confidence” that inflation is going down.\nThat chimes with the sanguine view shown by several of her ECB colleagues in Davos, suggesting they and peers aren’t yet flinching in the face of Trump’s threats. While the Europeans have reiterated signals of successive cuts in borrowing costs, on Friday, the Bank of Japan followed through with a rate increase to the highest level in 17 years.","summary":"Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a veteran economist and ex-finance minister, said that inflation would be lower if not for 15 years of mistakes.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3297047/singapores-president-cites-global-mistakes-inflation-worries-world-economic-forum","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/02/21bebf4a-c752-4ed1-ad49-41e45d7f94a9_ffd6c55b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:42:08","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":286159868,"title":"Lawmaker Demands Answers To Reports Musk Seeking Treasury Payment Access","text":"Democrat lawmakers have demanded an explanation from the Trump administration as to why tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is reportedly seeking access to sensitive payment systems in the Treasury Department.Newsweek reached out by email to the White House and the Treasury on Saturday afternoon for comment.Why It MattersMusk and DOGE have aggressively pursued every avenue available in an effort to cut what they view as immensely wasteful federal spending. The most ambitious effort involved the attempt to freeze all federal spending on grants, totaling several trillion dollars.President Donald Trump initially ordered the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to freeze federal grants and loans on Monday, but by Wednesday had rescinded the order following immense confusion and backlash.What To KnowConfusion erupted at the Treasury Department on Friday as career staffer David A. Lebryk announced his retirement.The reason for his exit was not announced, but reports from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Hill, citing anonymous sources, claimed that it was due to an ongoing clash between Lebryk and DOGE personnel who wanted to gain access to \"sensitive payment systems\" at the Treasury.Musk, following Lebryk's resignation, wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the DOGE team \"discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.\" Musk has yet to provide evidence for those claims.While the Treasury has not commented on Lebryk's resignation, some lawmakers have publicly demanded answers from the department – namely, Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat, who issued a letter newly-confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.In the letter, dated January 31, Wyden directly addressed the reports of Musk and DOGE personnel attempting to \"gain access to systems that control payments to millions of American citizens, including Social Security, Medicare and tax refunds.\"\"A confrontation over access apparently resulted in the abrupt resignation of David Lebryk, a career non-partisan Treasury official who recently had been named acting Secretary of the Treasury by President Trump,\" Wyden wrote. \"These reports are particularly concerning given incidents earlier this week in which Medicaid portals in all 50 states were shut down along with other crucial payment programs, following the Trump Administration illegally issuing an order to freeze all grant and loan payments.\"Wyden stressed that he was \"deeply concerned\" about \"the possibility that Elon Musk and a cadre of unknown DOGE personnel are seeking to gain access\" to those systems. Wyden demanded answers to a number of queries related to the report, namely whether Musk and DOGE have gained access to the system, what authority the department granted that access, and which systems would be impacted.What People Are SayingRepresentative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, also a Democrat, on Friday wrote on X: \"Elon Musk, the richest man on Earth, is rooting around in Social Security and Medicare payment systems. He's reaching his hands into our pockets and firing anyone who tries to stop him. This reeks of corruption — it must stop.\"Jeffrey Tucker, president of the non-profit think tank Brownstone Institute, wrote on X: \"Wow wow!

This is the means by which the deep state has maintained control for decade after decade, with changing administrations as veneer.\"Daniel Tannebaum, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote on X: \"Absolutely nothing good comes from having uninformed and likely uncleared people fiddling with the payment rails for the entire government. Saying this as someone who worked in the space, not all sensitive agencies telegraph the purpose of payment...\"What Happens NextThe White House and Treasury have yet to comment on the reports of Musk and DOGE attempting to access the payment systems, but more lawmakers may demand such information in the coming days – especially if the possibility of another fund freeze appears likely.","summary":"Democrat Ranking Senate Finance Committee member Ron Wyden raised the alarm after a career staffer resigned from the Treasury Department.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/lawmaker-demands-answers-reports-musk-seeking-treasury-payment-access-2024751","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2579032/elon-musk-doge-treasury-department.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:39:45","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.442},{"id":286163086,"title":"US introduces duties due to migrants, drugs — Trump","text":"WASHINGTON, February 2. /TASS/.

The tariffs also if sustained could cause inflation to significantly worsen, possibly eroding voters’ trust that Trump could as promised lower the prices of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos and other goods.\n\nTrump declared an economic emergency in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. But energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10% rate.\n\nThe tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, setting a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth. A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale laid out the possible damage to the U.S. economy, saying the average U.S. household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes. Economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen — and the situation could be worse if Canada, Mexico and China retaliate.\n\nFor the moment, Mexico plans to stay cool-headed as it weighs its options.\n\nMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, appearing Saturday at an event promoting a government housing program outside Mexico City said, “I’m calm, I’ve been saying since yesterday, because I know that Mexico’s economy is very powerful, very strong.”\n\nA senior administration official, insisting on anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize any disruptive increases on the price of gasoline or utilities. That’s a sign White House officials understand the gamble they’re taking on inflation. Price spikes under former President Joe Biden led to voter frustration that helped to return Trump to the White House last year.\n\nThe order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries.\n\nThe Trump administration put the tariffs in place to force the three countries to stop the spread and manufacturing of fentanyl, in addition to pressuring Canada and Mexico to limit any illegal immigration into the United States.\n\nThe official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addition.\n\nThe order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties.\n\n“It doesn’t make much economic sense,’’ said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. trade official. “Historically, most of our tariffs on raw materials have been low because we want to get cheaper materials so our manufacturers will be competitive … Now, what’s he talking about? He’s talking about tariffs on raw materials. I don’t get the economics of it.’’\n\nThe Republican president is making a major political bet that his actions will not significantly worsen inflation, cause financial aftershocks that could destabilize the worldwide economy or provoke a voter backlash. AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of the electorate in last year’s election, found that the U.S. was split on support for tariffs.\n\nWith the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics.\n\nThe president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil and natural gas, as well as against copper, pharmaceutical drugs and imports from the European Union — moves that could essentially pit the U.S. against much of the global economy.\n\nIt is unclear how the tariffs could affect the business investments that Trump said would happen because of his plans to cut corporate tax rates and remove regulations. Tariffs tend to raise prices for consumers and businesses by making it more expensive to bring in foreign goods.\n\nMany voters turned to Trump in the November election on the belief that he could better handle the inflation that spiked under Biden. But inflation expectations are creeping upward in the University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment as respondents expect prices to rise by 3.3%. That would be higher than the actual 2.9% annual inflation rate in December’s consumer price index.\n\nTrump has said that the government should raise more of its revenues from tariffs, as it did before the income tax became part of the Constitution in 1913. He claims, despite economic evidence to the contrary, that the U.S. was at its wealthiest in the 1890s under President William McKinley.\n\n“We were the richest country in the world,” Trump said Friday. “We were a tariff country.”\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has told Canadians that they could be facing difficult times ahead, but that Ottawa was prepared to respond with retaliatory tariffs if needed and that the U.S. penalties would be self-sabotaging.\n\nTrudeau said Canada is addressing Trump’s calls on border security by implementing a CDN$1.3 billion (US$900 million) border plan that includes helicopters, new canine teams and imaging tools.\n\nTrump still has to get a budget, tax cuts and an increase to the government’s legal borrowing authority through Congress. The outcome of his tariff plans could strengthen his hand or weaken it.\n\nDemocrats were quick to say that any inflation going forward was the result of Trump, who is about to start his third week back as president.\n\n“You’re worried about grocery prices. Don’s raising prices with his tariffs,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York posted on X. “You’re worried about tomato prices. Wait till Trump’s Mexico tariffs raise your tomato prices. … You’re worried about car prices. Wait till Trump’s Canada tariffs raise your car prices,” he wrote in a series of posts.","summary":"PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday signed an order to impose stiff tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China — fulfilling one of his post-campaign commitments to voters that also carries the risk of...","url":"https://nation.lk/online/trump-imposes-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-raising-prospect-of-higher-costs-for-us-consumers-294271.html","image":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TrumpyBigly.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:30:07","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":286162964,"title":"Jennifer Lopez is determined to make 2025 her year following painful divorce from Ben Affleck","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Feb 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaptain Rebecca Lobach is identified as third Black Hawk pilot who died in collision with American Airlines flight in DC\n\nLily Collins' husband Charlie McDowell hits back at criticism about couple's 'path to having a baby' through surrogacy\n\nFresh doubts are raised over conviction of 'killer' nurse Lucy Letby - as unearthed papers show she was off duty for third of cases\n\nJustin Baldoni publishes explosive new website telling 'his side' of Blake Lively lawsuit\n\nHow the police investigation into the Wimbledon Prep school crash became a distressing farce: As Land Rover driver Claire Freemantle is re-arrested, we reveal the failures - and why key witnesses were NEVER spoken to\n\nPrincess of Wales makes emotional plea for a 'more compassionate, united Britain'\n\nPeter Kay hit with court summons over bitter land dispute with neighbour that could see comedian lose access to part of his Irish holiday bolthole\n\nLOUISE THOMPSON: I'm flaky, can take weeks to reply to a WhatsApp and am notorious for cancelling plans.

Lopez said singing and dancing on screen was her childhood dream, and 'this is the first time I actually got to do it' \n\nThe cinematic victory comes after Lopez's painful divorce from Ben Affleck after just two years of marriage (Pictured in Los Angeles in May 2023)\n\nThe actress is teaming up later this year with Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein for the Netflix rom com Office Romance (Pictured in New York City in October 2024)\nWhen Oscar buzz for her performance was brought up, the actress, who was reportedly disappointed not to have been nominated for her work in Unstoppable, said, she didn't 'even want to begin the conversation,' adding, 'Of course, I would love [the film] to get the recognition that I believe it deserves.' \nAs she still licks her wounds from a very turbulent 2024 which began with poor reviews for her passion project This is Me... Now, followed by a cancelled concert tour and culminated with her public divorce from Affleck, JLo is keeping herself open to romance, at least on the small screen.\nShe is teaming up with Netflix and Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein for Office Romance.\nIn a 2018 episode on his Films To Be Buried With podcast, the writer and actor opened up at his respect for the actress, saying, 'F–king hell … I love her.'\nJennifer LopezBen Affleck\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJennifer Lopez is determined to make 2025 her year following painful divorce from Ben Affleck\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLily Collins' husband Charlie McDowell hits back at criticism about couple's 'path to having a baby' through surrogacy\n\nThe Masked Singer viewers left stunned as the identities of TWO celebrities are revealed ahead of the semi final\n\nJustin Baldoni publishes explosive new website telling 'his side' of Blake Lively lawsuit\n\nWhy Renee Zellweger could be about to join the club of 'v.v. smug marrieds' after her British ex-mechanic boyfriend AND his parents joined her on the Bridget Jones red carpet...\n\nKim Kardashian turns heads in Beverly Hills as she shoots scenes for new Ryan Murphy project\n\nSomething for everyone!

The tariffs also if sustained could cause inflation to significantly worsen, possibly eroding voters' trust that Trump could as promised lower the prices of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos and other goods.\n\nTrump declared an economic emergency in order to place duties of 10 percent on all imports from China and 25 percent on imports from Mexico and Canada. But energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10 percent rate.\n\nThe tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, setting a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth. A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale laid out the possible damage to the U.S. economy, saying the average U.S. household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes. Economic growth would slow and inflation would worsen — and the situation could be worse if Canada, Mexico and China retaliate.\n\nFor the moment, Mexico plans to stay cool-headed as it weighs its options.\n\nMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, appearing Saturday at an event promoting a government housing program outside Mexico City said, “I’m calm, I’ve been saying since yesterday, because I know that Mexico’s economy is very powerful, very strong.”\n\nA senior administration official, insisting on anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize any disruptive increases on the price of gasoline or utilities. That's a sign White House officials understand the gamble they're taking on inflation. Price spikes under former President Joe Biden led to voter frustration that helped to return Trump to the White House last year.\n\nThe order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries.\n\nThe Trump administration put the tariffs in place to force the three countries to stop the spread and manufacturing of fentanyl, in addition to pressuring Canada and Mexico to limit any illegal immigration into the United States.\n\nThe official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addition.\n\nThe order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties.\n\n“It doesn’t make much economic sense,’’ said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. trade official. “Historically, most of our tariffs on raw materials have been low because we want to get cheaper materials so our manufacturers will be competitive ... Now, what’s he talking about? He’s talking about tariffs on raw materials. I don’t get the economics of it.’’\n\nThe Republican president is making a major political bet that his actions will not significantly worsen inflation, cause financial aftershocks that could destabilize the worldwide economy or provoke a voter backlash. AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of the electorate in last year's election, found that the U.S. was split on support for tariffs.\n\nWith the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics.\n\nThe president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil and natural gas, as well as against copper, pharmaceutical drugs and imports from the European Union — moves that could essentially pit the U.S. against much of the global economy.\n\nIt is unclear how the tariffs could affect the business investments that Trump said would happen because of his plans to cut corporate tax rates and remove regulations. Tariffs tend to raise prices for consumers and businesses by making it more expensive to bring in foreign goods.\n\nMany voters turned to Trump in the November election on the belief that he could better handle the inflation that spiked under Biden. But inflation expectations are creeping upward in the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment as respondents expect prices to rise by 3.3%. That would be higher than the actual 2.9% annual inflation rate in December's consumer price index.","summary":"Order includes mechanism to raise rates if the impacted countries retaliate against U.S","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-b2690560.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/02/0/00/AP25030754565213.jpeg?trim=0,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/e1wyQqss-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:20:59","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":286157526,"title":"Elon Musk’s DOGE Team Has Full Access to Treasury Payments System: What Does This Mean?","text":"According to a report by The New York Times on Saturday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE representatives full access to the federal payments system. The report cited individuals familiar with the decision but did not disclose further details.\nElon Musk suggested on Saturday that his government efficiency group’s efforts to gain greater control over the Treasury Department’s distribution of trillions of dollars in payments were aimed at addressing fraud and illicit transactions.\nDeparture of David Lebryk\nMusk, a billionaire adviser to President Donald Trump, made his remarks on X, responding to reports regarding the sudden departure of David Lebryk, Treasury’s top career official. Lebryk reportedly clashed with Musk-affiliated officials over whether to grant them access to Treasury’s sensitive payment system.\n“The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups,” Musk wrote, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.”\nHowever, Musk did not provide any evidence to support his claim that Treasury employees were directed to approve payments to fraudulent or terrorist organizations.\nTreasury’s Safeguards Against Improper Treasury Payments\nThe Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS), which oversees Treasury’s payment system, has a dedicated payments integrity office responsible for identifying, preventing, and recovering fraudulent or improper payments. Treasury data indicates that these efforts have prevented nearly $155 million in improper payments and facilitated the recovery of approximately $350 million.\nDemocratic lawmakers have expressed concerns over attempts by Trump’s political appointees and Musk’s DOGE team to exert greater influence over a federal payments system traditionally managed by nonpartisan career officials.\n“To put it bluntly, these payment systems simply cannot fail, and any politically motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a letter to Bessent on Friday evening.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the leading Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has called for a congressional investigation into the matter.\nFederal Fraud Prevention Measures for Improper Treasury Payments\nThe federal government has existing safeguards to prevent improper payments. The Do Not Pay portal, for instance, allows agencies to verify whether a recipient is deceased, blacklisted from government contracts, sanctioned, incarcerated, or otherwise ineligible for payments.\nDuring the Biden administration, Treasury introduced artificial intelligence tools to detect fraudulent and improper payments. In October, the department reported that these efforts had prevented and recovered over $4 billion in the 2024 fiscal year.\nScrutiny of Improper Payments\nDespite these measures, improper payments in federal programs remain a longstanding issue, drawing scrutiny from government watchdogs and congressional lawmakers. The problem has worsened in recent years, particularly with the expansion of relief programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated last year that the federal government could be losing between $233 billion and $521 billion annually due to fraud.\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, federal agencies reported $236 billion in improper payments. The majority originated from Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, pandemic relief loans for small businesses, the Treasury’s earned income tax credit, and Social Security payments.\nAlso Read: Trump's Tariffs On China, Canada And Mexico Kick In: What To Know","summary":"The Treasury Department’s payment system is at the center of a political storm after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE representatives full access.

The decision could lead to higher prices for a wide range of products, including automobiles and avocados, with unclear timelines for implementation.\nUncertainty Around the Tariffs' Details\nThe exact timing and conditions under which the tariffs will be lifted remain uncertain. During a call with reporters on Saturday, a senior administration official explained that there would be \"a wide range of metrics\" involved in assessing the situation.\n\"In Donald Trump’s golden age, we will have only legal immigration, and we will have zero Americans dying from Chinese, slash Mexican, slash Canadian fentanyl,\" the official stated.\nTo alleviate potential disruptions, Canadian energy products, including gasoline and home heating oil, would face a lower tariff rate of 10%. The official emphasized that this measure was designed to minimize negative impacts on fuel prices.\nFentanyl and Trade Deficits as Justificationsfor Tariffs\nTrump's decision to impose tariffs was motivated by his claims that Canada, Mexico, and China were allowing fentanyl to enter the U.S. More than 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023, with nearly 70% of these deaths attributed to opioids, including fentanyl. Additionally, Trump cited the trade deficit as a reason for the tariffs, noting that the U.S. imports more from these countries than it exports.\nEconomists have predicted that the tariffs will drive up costs for consumers, impacting everything from vehicles to electronics, produce, and lumber. Tariffs are effectively a tax on imports, paid by U.S. companies bringing foreign goods into the country. While some businesses may look for alternative sources, others with no viable options will face higher fees.\nWidespread Impact on US Economy\nFor instance, U.S. grocery stores will incur increased costs for fruits and vegetables from Mexico, homebuilders will face higher prices for Canadian lumber, and automakers will pay tariffs each time a component crosses the border during production. Companies must decide whether to absorb the costs or pass them onto consumers, potentially affecting their profits.\nGiven that the U.S. imports more from Mexico than any other country, the impact on the U.S. economy could be widespread.\nTrump Promised Tariffs Duirng Campaign\nTariffs have been a cornerstone of Trump's political platform, and he has positioned them as a solution to protect American industries. Trump argues that levies make foreign goods more expensive, thereby encouraging companies to produce goods domestically. Additionally, he has proposed using tariff revenue to fund other policy priorities.\n\"This is a beautiful, beautiful example of promises made, promises kept by President Trump,\" said the senior administration official.\nHowever, economists argue that the tariffs imposed during Trump's first term, particularly those on China, largely failed to achieve the intended goals. Instead, they led to higher import prices, a net loss of manufacturing jobs, and a reduction in corporate investments. Additionally, the revenue from China's tariffs was primarily used to compensate American farmers who were impacted by retaliatory tariffs from China. Beijing also failed to meet many of its commitments from the trade deal negotiated during Trump's first term.\nChallenges to the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)\nThe newly imposed tariffs also threaten the stability of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), one of Trump's signature trade achievements. The USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), had largely facilitated tariff-free trade between the three countries. While the agreement isn't up for review until July 2026, the new tariffs could undermine the deal well before that date.\nThe White House stated that Trump would impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Despite the provisions of the USMCA, Trump argued that he possesses the legal authority to regulate imports in times of national emergency, a declaration he made on his first day of his second term.\nAlthough most of Trump's tariff rhetoric during his campaign was focused on China, his attention has since shifted to Canada and Mexico. Both countries have vowed to retaliate, potentially making American products less competitive in their markets and negatively impacting U.S. businesses that rely on exports. Key U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico include cars, oil and gas, electronics, industrial equipment, and agricultural products.\nAlso Read: Tariffs Against Mexico, Canada, and China to Begin on February 1: Here Is What White House Said","summary":"President Donald Trump has signed new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, escalating the potential for a trade war with key U.S. partners.

But imports that were loaded onto a vessel or onto their final mode of transit before entering the U.S. prior to 12:01 a.m. Saturday would be exempt from the duties.\n\nTrump has declared the national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act to back the tariffs, which allow the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.\n\nHowever, they are untested for broad tariffs, according to trade lawyers.\n\nWhite House officials said there would be no exclusions from the tariffs and if Canada, Mexico or China retaliated against American exports, Trump would likely increase the U.S. duties.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said in an X social media post that Canada \"now has no choice but to hit back and hit back hard.\"\n\n\"As Premier of Ontario, the federal government has my full support for a strong and forceful response that matches U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar,\" Ford said.\n\nNova Scotia's Premier Tim Houston said he directed that all alcohol imported from the U.S. be removed from the province's store shelves.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has previously threatened strong retaliation if Trump imposed tariffs, was expected to speak later on Saturday.\n\nMexico's Economy Ministry said it did not have an immediate comment. But a senior Mexican official told Reuters that Mexico would respond with retaliatory tariffs later on Saturday.\n\nThe White House officials said that Canada specifically, would no longer be allowed the \"de minimis\" U.S. duty exemption for small shipments under $800. The officials said Canada, along with Mexico, has become a conduit for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals, into the U.S., via small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents.\n\nUS trade war\n\nTrump, who golfed at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday before signing the order, was not scheduled to speak to reporters about the tariffs.\n\nTrump threatened the tariffs to press for strong action to halt the flow of the opiate fentanyl and precursor chemicals into the U.S. from China via Mexico and Canada, as well as to stop illegal immigrants crossing U.S. borders.\n\nLess than two weeks into his second term, Trump is upending the norms of how the United States is governed and interacts with its neighbours and wider world.\n\nOn Friday, he pledged to proceed with the levies despite acknowledging they could cause disruption and hardship for American households.\n\nEconomic impact\n\nA model gauging the economic impact of Trump's tariff plan from EY Chief Economist Greg Daco suggests it would reduce U.S. growth by 1.5 percentage points this year, throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in \"stagflation\" at home.\n\n\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock - a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse - while also triggering financial market volatility,\" Daco wrote on Saturday.\n\nThat volatility was evident on Friday, when the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both slumped after Trump vowed to fulfill his threats. U.S. stock prices also fell and Treasury bond yields rose.","summary":"Economic forecasts suggest the tariffs may reduce U.S. growth by 1.5 percentage points and trigger stagflation, impacting both Canada and Mexico by potentially pushing them into recession","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/trump-imposes-25-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico-10-on-china/article69171638.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/i7pv53/article69171640.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-02-01T042915Z_1490794562_RC25LCA3DYKI_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TARIFFS-MEXICO.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:17:25","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.032},{"id":286159226,"title":"‘The Medical System Is Failing’: Why America’s Health Crisis Is Spiraling Out of Control","text":"Health care costs are soaring while Americans’ health deteriorates, says former food and pharmaceutical consultant Calley Means, who points to rising rates of autism, childhood prediabetes, and other conditions. \n\n“We are 4% of the world population but produce 75% of pharmaceutical profits, and are 60th in life expectancy,” Means said during an interview on “The Kevin Roberts Show.” \n\nMeans is the co-founder of a company focused on preventative measures in health care and the co-author, with his sister Casey, of “Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health.” \n\nHe noted that 50% of teenagers are overweight or obese, and 77% of military-aged Americans are ineligible for service due to health issues. \n\nMeans, an ally of Robert F.

Their New HR Chief Dodged Them","text":"On Friday, staff at what was formerly the United States Digital Service and is now part of Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative met with Stephanie Holmes, who identified herself as a part of the DOGE team and as the staff’s new HR representative.\nThroughout the meeting, which started at noon ET, dozens of USDS employees lobbed questions at Holmes related to last week’s “Fork in the Road” email offering federal workers “deferred resignations,” according to documents detailing the meeting obtained by WIRED and corroborated by sources in attendance. The questions covered issues ranging from the future of staff projects to whether the return-to-office mandates would apply to fully remote workers, as well as the exact nature of the offer the federal government was making employees.\nHolmes—who did not immediately respond to a request for comment—could fully answer only a few of the questions. She said, when asked, that the offer was “lawful,” and later said, “We believe the offer is lawful,” and could provide little additional guidance beyond that. At one point, she was asked if there would be a more formal way to accept the buyout than replying to an email with the word “resign” in the subject line. One employee expressed concerns that outside actors could send resignation emails on staffers’ behalf by spoofing their email addresses.\n“I assume that, if folks do decide to go through with the deferred resignation, there’s some kind of actual agreement that we sign,” one employee said. “Can we get a copy of that ahead of time to preview? Can we get a copy of the agreement if there is an agreement?”\n“I don’t know,” Holmes replied. “But will circle back on that.”\nThe confusion comes as the February 6 deadline looms for federal workers to accept the deal. In the email—which was very similar to one Musk sent Twitter employees in 2022—the sender, identified as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), suggests that workers who choose not to resign could still lose their jobs later down the line. Holmes was asked if she could commit to a specific time to provide the DOGE workforce with additional details on the deferred resignation deals.\n“No,” Holmes said. “You know, I think the information that you’re going to have about this is available to you right now, and again, you’re just gonna have to make a personal decision based on the information that’s available to you right now.”\nThe same employee responded, saying, “I apologize for the interjection, but there are a variety of things that this room has brought up that are contradictory or challenging to understand … I’m just wondering why you are unable to commit to providing those specifics right now.”\n“Yeah, I appreciate your question and I don’t mean to be repetitive or appear to be argumentative in any way, but again, I would just encourage you to not lose sight of the big picture here,” Holmes says. “The benefits of accepting the deferred resignation is that you will be guaranteed not to be subject to reduction in force and you’re exempt from the return to office mandate. So I would just encourage you to focus on the generous aspects of the offer.”\n\nAre you a current or former government worker with insight into what's going on? We'd like to hear from you.

Trump appointed Elon Musk as the head of DOGE, which would take great lengths to cut spending across government agencies. As of publication, DOGE faces at least three lawsuits challenging its designation as a federal agency.\nWhile Musk has installed lieutenants at its top levels and is now using it as a lever to exercise control over the federal government, prior to the recent executive order, the US Digital Service was a relatively small agency with about 200 employees. Its mandate was to help untangle dysfunctional technology across the government, in service of which it had the ability to enter government agencies and access their software and technical systems.\nOn Saturday, 404 Media first reported that Holmes, an employment attorney and consultant, was being brought in as the head of HR for DOGE. In her previous work, Holmes developed her own brand of “non-woke” and Christian DEI for clients to deploy.\n“Working in the HR space and seeing the DEI efforts and progressive ideology that HR was pushing into corporate America was particularly concerning to me, and I didn’t see any other alternatives for employers in the HR space. I care a lot about these issues and saw a problem I wanted to help fix,” 404 Media reported Holmes said in a speech at a Federalist Society event.\nThe resignation uncertainty extends to other government agencies as well; senior leaders at OPM were reportedly told Friday to prepare for cuts of up to 70 percent of the agency’s workforce and programs.\nOn Friday evening, a senior OPM staffer sent an email to staff, obtained by WIRED, explaining that they did not have information on the details of potential cuts.\n“You may have seen news reports that OPM leaders have been asked to prepare plans to significantly reduce future staffing at the agency,” the email read. “I do not have any definitive answers at this time about overall future staffing levels, potential change to our organizational structure, or the impact on specific positions. I understand that this uncertainty is very unsettling. Please know that when I have more information to share, I will.”","summary":"\"I think the information that you’re going to have about this is available to you right now,” Stephanie Holmes told workers at Elon Musk's DOGE who pressed for detail on offers of “deferred resignation.”","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hr-elon-musk-resignation-fork-road-leaked-staff-meeting/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/679e9758d817cb38afac5685/16:9/w_4000,h_2250,c_limit/2194353521","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:03:31","author":"Makena Kelly","authors":["Makena Kelly"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":286158450,"title":"Starmer must ‘fire starting gun’ on customs union as he meets EU leaders – Davey","text":"Sir Keir Starmer must “fire the starting gun” on creating a new customs union with the EU, the Prime Minister has been told ahead of a meeting with European leaders.\n\nSuch a move will put “rocket boosters” on the UK economy and will “strengthen our hand” against Donald Trump’s US, which is threatening tariffs against trade partners, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey told the BBC.\n\nOn Monday, the Prime Minister will join European Council leaders at an informal retreat ahead of an EU-UK summit later this year.\n\nThe focus of the dinner he will attend is expected to be defence co-operation.\n\nBut the Lib Dems have called for him to begin talks with the trade bloc on deeper ties.\n\nThe Government has ruled out joining the customs union or single market, declaring them both “red lines” in its negotiations with European leaders.\n\nHowever, it has left open the possibility of joining a continent-wide trade deal called the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean (PEM) convention, as Sir Keir continues with his aim to “reset” the UK-EU relationship.\n\nThe deal, which would allow tariff-free movement of some goods across Europe, as well as some nations in North Africa and the Levant, should be a “first step” to re-joining the customs union, the Lib Dems have said.\n\nTheir leader Sir Ed has written to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, calling on her to commission the Office for Budget Responsibility to assess the impact of a new customs union with the EU on the UK economy.\n\n“The Chancellor is tying herself in knots trying to think up new ways to grow our economy,” Sir Ed told the BBC.\n\n“But there’s a solution right under her nose: a new UK-EU customs union deal that boosts trade for British businesses and raises vital tax revenue for our public services.”\n\nWhile the Lib Dems are pushing Sir Keir to go further in deepening ties with the EU, the Tories have called on him to not accept further EU influence as he seeks to strengthen the relationship.\n\nThe Prime Minister must meet five “tests” to uphold Brexit, Kemi Badenoch said.\n\nAmong the Tory leader’s tests are commitments to: no “backsliding” on free movement or the compulsory transfer of asylum seekers; no new money paid to the EU; and no reduction in fishing rights.\n\nShe also urged Sir Keir not to take any rules from the EU as he engaged with the bloc, including dynamic alignment on trade standards, or allowing the European courts to have jurisdiction over UK law.\n\nNato must have “primacy” when it comes to European security, the Tory leader said in her final test for the PM.\n\n“Five years ago the Conservatives broke the deadlock and got Brexit done,” Mrs Badenoch said.\n\nShe added: “We delivered the biggest democratic mandate in our country’s history. Keir Starmer and his Labour party opposed us every step of the way – they tried to cancel the referendum and stop us taking back control.\n\n“Now Keir Starmer and the Labour Government are trying to reopen the divisions of the past and edge us back into the EU. So I’m setting Keir Starmer five tests to make sure he doesn’t undo Brexit.\n\n“These tests will ensure we seize the opportunities of the future and use our independence to grow the British economy. Under my leadership, the Conservatives will always stand up for Britain and fight for our hard-won freedoms.”\n\nA Labour spokesperson described the Brexit “tests” as “yet more hypocrisy from Kemi Badenoch and the Conservatives who had eight years to make a success of Brexit but failed”.\n\nThey added: “After running an open border experiment that resulted in record high net migration, the Conservatives completely botched the job on Brexit – a record so bad that Kemi Badenoch herself publicly criticised Conservatives’ ‘mistakes’ on Brexit in her first speech as leader.”","summary":"Sir Ed Davey said a deal with the EU could strengthen the UK against the risk of American trade tariffs.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-rachel-reeves-lib-dems-european-b1208575.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/02/00/8d1ef779353febe7c3782fa59a66aac5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM4NTM2NDM2-2.78703562.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:01:44","author":"David Lynch","authors":["David Lynch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":286161286,"title":"India-US ties likely to get a boost as Trump announces Modi’s imminent US visit","text":"US President Donald Trump’s plan to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington later this month could boost bilateral ties between the two countries, analysts said, but only if New Delhi is ready to make concessions on thorny issues such as tariffs and immigration.\nTrump announced on Monday that Modi would visit sometime in February, telling reporters the two countries’ relationship was “very good” and “productive” after a call in which he urged India to buy more American security equipment and work towards “fair” trade.\nDelhi has yet to announce a specific date for Modi’s visit, though local media reports suggest mid-February.\nThe swift arrangement of this visit early in Trump’s new term showed India’s active engagement with Washington and that “the Trump administration continues to value India as a partner”, said Harsh Pant, an international relations professor at King’s College London.\n“So I think the relationship will continue to take off from where Mr Biden left it,” he said, referring to the previous US administration.\nHowever, analysts said that Modi must be prepared to negotiate on high import tariffs by India, an issue that Trump had underscored repeatedly.\nTariffs will remain a concern and in some of the critical sectors, where America may have a problem, it will be interesting to see how India deals with it\nHarsh Pant, international relations analyst\nDelhi had a trade surplus of US$32 billion with Washington in 2023-24, with trade between the two countries exceeding US$118 billion, which Trump has expressed concern in the past.\n“Tariffs will remain a concern and in some of the critical sectors, where America may have a problem, it will be interesting to see how India deals with it,” Pant said.\nThe Indian government is considering options such as reducing tariffs, trade deals, and importing more goods from the US to negate the tariff threat if it becomes a reality, according to a Bloomberg report.\nDuring his election campaign, Trump vowed to impose a 60 per cent import tariff on goods from China and 10 per cent on other countries.\nVivek Mishra, Deputy Director – Strategic Studies Programme at the Observer Research Foundation, said it would be a good strategy for Delhi to lower tariffs on some sectors to secure long term ties. “There is no point in imposing retaliatory tariffs. Where do you go with the US with such actions?” he asked.\nTrump’s tariff threats during the US presidential polls were probably a “carrot and stick” strategy aimed at securing better deals, especially from nations which had a trade surplus with the US, Mishra said.\n\n“It is pretty much expected that he [Trump] will ask what India brings to the table,” he said.\nTrump’s invitation to Modi also suggested that any fears he would not prioritise the Indo-Pacific were unfounded, and he was likely to continue Biden’s focus on the region, despite having his “own itch” about areas of emphasis, he added.\n“It is also suggestive that there will be a China focus on the region,” Mishra said, adding that he expected Trump to allow core team members – such as the level of secretary and undersecretary – to make independent decisions on the long-term strategy for the Indo-Pacific.\nDelhi is also likely to relent on issues relating to immigration that are a core focus of the new US administration, according to analysts.\n“I don’t see the Trump administration making any compromises on immigration,” Mishra said.\nTrump has already enacted far-reaching measures targeting those who violated US immigration law, including sealing the US asylum system for those without documents.\nIndia’s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar has expressed support for the repatriation of undocumented citizens, while advocating for legal mobility.\nThe new US administration was expected to tighten requirements for work visas, which could affect Indian immigrants and potentially dent revenues from exports of services like information technology, analysts said.\n\nSensitive issue of immigration\nTrump’s supporters are split over the immigration issue. People like tech billionaire Elon Musk support H-1B visas – which allows skilled professionals to work in the US – while former White House strategist Steve Bannon is among those who want curbs on overall immigration levels.\nThe matter has emerged as a significant topic among the influential American Indian community, many of whom voted for Trump because he was seen as pro-business.\n“It’s been a very bitter feud. India will have to be careful how it handles things. Indians are proud of the Indian contribution to American life, but it’s also causing tension, especially on social media,” said British political and security analyst Christopher Blackburn.\nHowever, overall, he expects Modi’s trip to reinforce US-India ties through negotiations.\n“I’m sure Modi and his team will manage to work out a deal. There will be a lot of horse-trading behind the scenes in numerous sectors. Defence and tech [are] very important for the strategic partnership,” Blackburn said. “I think we will see increased cooperation, not confrontation.”\nIndia has historically been heavily dependent on Russia for military equipment supplies, although in recent years, Delhi has turned to Western partners such as the US and France for weapons and critical parts such as fighter jet engines.\nAccording to analysts, India is likely to seek to reinforce an India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies, including artificial intelligence and production of semiconductors with defence applications.","summary":"Trump’s invitation for Modi’s US visit signals a strengthening of ties, but India must address tariffs and immigration issues to ensure productive negotiations.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3296959/india-us-ties-likely-get-boost-trump-announces-modis-imminent-us-visit","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/31/c94426dd-7c1c-4ec6-be94-2197fbc5471b_71ad71fd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:00:13","author":"Biman Mukherji","authors":["Biman Mukherji"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":286162306,"title":"Why the right wants small government—no matter how dangerous it is","text":"The crash of an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people above Ronald Reagan National Airport, near Washington, D.C., and is the worst U.S. aviation disaster since the November 2001 crash of a jet in the Queens borough of New York City.\n\nAmong those who perished on Wednesday were figure skaters and their families and coaches returning from a competition, as well as the three military service members aboard the helicopter.\n\nThe tragedy is once again raising the question of the role that key federal agencies and officials play in protecting the lives of Americans. The Federal Aviation Administration provides oversight of the airline industry, airports, and related matters.\n\nBut the position of FAA administrator was vacant from Jan. 20—the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration—until the day after this week’s accident, when Trump finally appointed an acting chief of the agency. Why was the position vacant? The previous administrator, Michael Whitaker, resigned roughly a year and a half into his five-year term after a pressure campaign by Trump financier and multibillionaire Elon Musk.\n\nAdditionally, Wednesday’s crash occurred against the backdrop of actions by Trump and his administration to slash the size of the government and roll back civil rights initiatives meant to diversify the federal workforce and the nation at large.\n\nTrump effectively disbanded an aviation safety committee that had been in operation since 1989. He also issued a directive halting a program to encourage the growth of a diverse workforce within the aviation industry, including for the key position of air traffic controller.\n\nNow it has emerged that staffing levels at the control tower at Reagan National were “not normal” at the time of the accident, according to an internal preliminary report from the FAA.\n\nIn his Thursday press conference discussing the crash—instead of addressing the core of these issues, including his role in possibly hobbling the government response—Trump instead blamed a frequent conservative punching bag: diversity.\n\nConservatives like Trump have for years insisted that the government needs to operate like a business, and that the size of the federal government (including its budget and the size of the workforce) must be curtailed. This message has frequently been touted by Republican politicians, but it has been repeated endlessly in conservative media outlets, like Fox News.\n\nConservatives have so embraced the notion that government must run like a business that Trump, whose businesses have repeatedly failed, has been the leader of the party since 2016.\n\nThe right has railed against government-based solutions as harbingers of communism and socialism, and that effort has led to even some Democrats, like former President Bill Clinton, making an argument against “big government.”\n\nBut America is a massive nation. There are more than 341 million Americans behind the largest economy in the world, with the most powerful military in the history of humankind. American policy on both domestic and foreign issues has a ripple effect felt in every other nation in the world. It simply isn’t practical for a nation of that size and scope to operate in the conservative dream of a government in the 1800s.\n\nWhile it remains unclear what specific role the government played in Wednesday’s plane crash, it is a matter of historical fact that massive crises have been caused or exacerbated through government inaction. \n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, the government failed to alleviate the suffering of millions of Americans under Republican President Herbert Hoover. More recently, under Republican President George W. Bush, big business was allowed to put the global economy at risk while profiting from the mortgage bubble. And under Trump, the purported business skills that were touted during his stint as host of NBC’s “The Celebrity Apprentice” were absent as he failed to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat has worked have been the initiatives and legislation the right has decried as “big government.”\n\nUnder President Franklin Roosevelt, the New Deal became law, leading to massive government expenditure to fight the Great Depression and World War II. Landmark programs like Social Security were created to provide government backing for the retirement of seniors.\n\nLater, President Lyndon Johnson put in place his Great Society agenda, expanding the safety net with programs like Medicaid to meet the needs of low-income earners needing health care. That was not being addressed by the profit-motivated private sector.\n\nIn more recent history, President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in response to the Great Recession, and saw unemployment significantly decline during his eight years in office. And President Joe Biden passed the American Rescue Plan to stimulate the economy following the massive losses that had occurred on Trump’s watch during the pandemic.\n\nDespite the conservative fixation on small government and operating the government like a business, it simply has not worked. There are too many moving parts, and too many lives are at stake for the government to operate like a business working toward a quarterly earnings report.\n\nWhen the government is too small or not given enough resources to operate, disaster has been the result—over and over again. Yet, despite the carnage, conservatives are unlikely to change their rhetoric and world view because they would have to admit they were wrong all along.","summary":"The crash of an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people above Ronald Reagan National Airport, near Washington, D.C., and is the worst U.S. aviation disaster since the November 2001 crash of a jet in the Queens borough of New York City.\n\n\n\nAmong those who perished on Wednesday were figure skaters and their families and coaches returning from a competition, as well as the three military service members aboard the helicopter.\n\n\n\nThe tragedy is once again raising the question of the role that key federal agencies and officials play in protecting the lives of Americans.

Why does it matter to China?","text":"In the flurry of the first few days of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, it was easy to miss.\nWhile signing a string of executive orders following his inauguration last month, Trump said North Korea had been “a tremendous threat” when he first became US president in 2017 but suggested that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would be happy to see his return.\n“He liked me; I liked him. We got along very well,” he said. “He is a nuclear power, but we get along.”\nIn doing so, Trump appeared to have tacitly acknowledged North Korea as a nuclear power, departing from the policies of previous administrations – including his own.\nWhile Trump’s remarks appeared to be an impromptu address and not formal recognition, they followed similar remarks by US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth on January 14, who referred to North Korea as a “nuclear state” during his confirmation hearing.\nTrump’s comments suggested a possible shift from Washington’s long-held position – that is, refusing to recognise Pyongyang as a nuclear power despite its possession of nuclear weapons – amid the president’s signals of eagerness to revive nuclear talks with North Korea.\nHowever, analysts said Trump’s approach to Pyongyang was likely to upset Beijing if he pursued bilateral nuclear talks with North Korea and bypassed China.\nDespite a White House official stating this week (JAN 28) that the Trump administration would pursue “complete denuclearisation of North Korea”, the experts said Washington might instead pursue nuclear disarmament or reduction, leading to the possibility of nuclear proliferation in the region.\nThere are other signs that this could be the case.\n\nAfter his re-election in November, Trump’s picks for close White House officials included those who had previously helped him negotiate with Kim.\nIn November, Alex Wong, former deputy assistant secretary of state for North Korea, whom Trump said had helped with denuclearisation negotiations at his summit with Kim, was named deputy national security adviser.\nTrump last month also picked William Harrison, an aide who was involved in planning summits with the North Korean leader, to be assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for operations.\nThen on January 13, the South Korean spy agency the National Intelligence Service (NIS) said Trump regarded his summit with Kim as a key achievement during his first term and therefore might seek a “small deal” with Pyongyang, such as disarmament steps or a nuclear freeze, should he conclude that complete denuclearisation was unrealistic within a short period.\nAnd during an interview with Fox News that was broadcast on January 23, Trump said he would “reach out” to Kim anew after the two men had developed a working relationship during Trump’s first term.\n\nAccording to the analysts, Trump’s remarks about North Korea’s nuclear status are not likely to be officially realised given the potential impact on the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nHowever, the Trump administration’s North Korea policy could allow direct bilateral concessions on Pyongyang’s possession of nuclear weapons, which would likely concentrate on nuclear disarmament or reduction, instead of the “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation” (CVID) that Trump demanded during his first term.\nNational Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said on Tuesday that Trump would pursue the “complete denuclearisation of North Korea” but the president himself had not confirmed that this was his policy. Analysts said Trump considered that approach “unrealistic” and would prioritise preventing the North Korean nuclear and missile programme from harming the US.\nBut China might resist such a harm-prevention strategy because US acknowledgement of North Korea as a nuclear state could raise the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Indo-Pacific region – namely in South Korea and Japan – and complicate China’s security environment.\nThe possibility of South Korea gaining its own nuclear weapons has grown more likely with the nomination of Elbridge Colby as Trump’s undersecretary of defence for policy. Colby has said in past media interviews that “all options” should be on the table to ensure South Korea’s security, including its nuclear armament against the North, as part of an effort to concentrate the role of US Forces Korea in containing China.\nVictor Cha, president of the geopolitics and foreign policy department and Korea chair at the Washington-based think tank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said Trump regarded negotiation with Pyongyang as a “business opportunity”.\nAt the same time, concerns among South Korean “strategic elites” about the reliability of Washington and an inability to stop North Korea’s nuclear programme might “undeniably” increase calls for Seoul’s nuclear armament.\n“I don’t think Donald Trump’s goal is denuclearisation. I think his goal is to stop the threat to the US homeland, which means to at least stop [or] slow down the nuclear weapons programme and slow down the intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBM] programme,” said Cha, who also served as a deputy head of the US delegation for the 2007 denuclearisation agreement with North Korea.\n“I think he’d be happy with a ban on testing and flight testing of ICBMs, which doesn’t get rid of the weapons … In his mind, there’s no threat from North Korea if he’s good friends with the leader.\n“All of this is really anathema when you look at it from a South Korean perspective.”\nCha said Beijing “does not want to be left out of any agreement on the Korean peninsula”, where a bilateral Trump-North Korea negotiation would “throw China off balance”.\n“I think they wouldn’t like it. They’re already off balance because North Korea and Russia are so close, but they would be even more off balance, even isolated, if Trump were to have a negotiation with North Korea.”\nHowever, China might see an opportunity. Cha said the momentum of the Biden administration’s successes in organising alliance networks such as the Quad, the trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan, and Aukus would slow under Trump.\nAndrew Yeo, a senior fellow and the SK-Korea Foundation chair of Korea studies at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, echoed the view that while China would be open to the US having a dialogue with North Korea, it might be concerned about being “cut out” from a meeting between Trump and Kim.\n“On North Korea policy, if [Trump] were to return tactical nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, that would really upset China. And certainly China will retaliate in some way,” Yeo said.\n“Because of the complexities of the Russia and North Korea connection, and … also the US, Japan, [South] Korea trilateral having tightened, I think it’s a lot harder to have that engagement on a bilateral basis without bringing in other players.”\nKang Jun-young, a professor of Chinese studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, said that while it was too early to discern the meaning behind Trump’s remarks, the general atmosphere seemed to be that “Trump also thinks that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons and will not give them up”.\nHe said Hughes had said that Trump would pursue complete denuclearisation of North Korea because, while the Trump administration believed such a goal was unrealistic, acknowledgement of North Korea’s nuclear weapons would lead to “various complications”.\nAccording to Kang, if Washington admitted that Pyongyang had nuclear weapons, the dialogue was likely to focus on disarmament and reduction, instead of denuclearisation, which would push China and South Korea to revise their existing North Korea policy – which focuses on denuclearising the Korean peninsula – possibly creating a “nuclear domino effect”.\n“If the US recognises North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons while excluding China [from dialogue], it will lead to South Korea’s development of nuclear weapons [and] Japan’s development of nuclear weapons,” Kang said.\n“So it will be the starting point, and China cannot help but oppose that … Because of this, northeast Asia has the potential to become quite complicated.”\nPark Won-gon, a political-science professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Washington now regarded the complete denuclearisation of North Korea as “unrealistic”, citing both Democrats and Republicans removing the denuclearisation goal from their party platforms last year.\n“Given this situation, it doesn’t seem easy to prioritise North Korea’s denuclearisation,” Park said. “That’s why the step-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament seems inevitable.”\nIn 2018 and 2019, Trump held three in-person meetings with Kim in Singapore, Hanoi and Panmunjom – the border area between South and North Korea – becoming the first sitting US president to hold summits with a North Korean leader and set foot in the country.\nWhile Trump described his talks with Kim as falling “in love”, their meetings produced no concrete results. Washington insisted on CVID while Pyongyang demanded full sanctions relief.\nSince then, there have been no formal talks between the two countries, despite the Biden administration stating it was open to negotiation without preconditions.\nMeanwhile, North Korea advanced its nuclear weapons programme, carrying out a record 37 missile tests in 2022, and promoted the development of cutting-edge weapons systems, such as hypersonic missiles.\n\nThis month, North Korean state media claimed the country had test-fired a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile (IRBM) that flew at 12 times the speed of sound and was overseen by Kim, marking the first missile test since November 5.\nIt also fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast less than a week before Trump’s inauguration.\nIn December, Pyongyang declared it would take the “toughest” response strategy towards Washington, asserting that the military cooperation between South Korea, the US and Japan was evolving into an invasive nuclear military bloc, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\nAccording to KCNA, Kim said his country should “more reliably ensure the strengthening of self-defence war deterrence through accelerated progress in defence science and technology and radical development of the defence industry” against the “abominable anti-republic military provocations of the US and its followers”.\nIt signalled that he intended to continue advancing the nuclear programme despite Trump’s return. On January 25, North Korea reportedly carried out a “strategic” sea-to-surface cruise missile test, a move seen by analysts as an attempt to gauge Washington’s willingness to resume dialogue as well as a comment on recent US-South Korea joint military drills.\nRamon Pacheco Pardo, an international relations professor at King’s College London, said Kim would agree to restore the negotiation with Washington if he could “see any tangible benefit from re-engaging with Trump”.\n“For Kim, re-engaging with the United States would allow him to reduce dependency on Russia and China. So there are potential economic and diplomatic benefits that the United States could offer that would make it appealing for Kim to accept any offer from Trump to sit down and talk again.”\nRelations between Beijing and Pyongyang have been strained by North Korea’s decision to send arms and troops to help Russia with its invasion of Ukraine in exchange for advanced weapons technology and food aid from Moscow.\nChina has remained a bystander to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and promoted peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, while it has opposed the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, including North Korea’s advancement of nuclear weapons and Washington’s trilateral military cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo.\nAs a response to the North Korean military build-up, former US president Joe Biden pursued nuclear deterrence through increased strategic asset presence in the Korean peninsula via the Nuclear Consultative Group that brought Seoul into discussions on Washington’s nuclear policies in East Asia.\nAt a summit at Camp David in August 2023, the leaders of the US, South Korea and Japan also pledged stronger trilateral cooperation and a more “systematic manner” of implementing joint trilateral exercises.\nThat alliance policy is in question with Trump’s return, despite US Secretary of State Marco Rubio underscoring “the critical importance of furthering trilateral cooperation” during a phone call with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on January 22.\n\nPark, from Ewha Womans University, said there could be a greater likelihood of a “dual freeze” as proposed by China that might see South Korea and the US reduce or stop joint military exercises and the deployment of strategic assets while North Korea, in return, could declare a moratorium on ICBMs and a seventh nuclear test.\n“There is a possibility that both sides will come to an agreement because Trump has been very critical of the strategic assets in the joint training exercise for quite some time now, and this is being discussed in conjunction with the issue of cost,” Park said.\nCha said Trump believed South Korea did not need US troops, creating a dilemma for Seoul, as the US president could shift the focus of US Forces Korea from North Korea to China to respond to the Taiwan contingency, increasing South Korea’s danger of being “entrapped in a US-China conflict”.\nHe added that while Trump would not be opposed to the trilateral cooperation, he would not want to pay for their joint exercises, which he considered “expensive”.\n“So it will either be that Koreans and Japanese will have to pay for US exercising, or they’ll just do the meetings without exercising,” Cha said.\n“[That] is not good. That doesn’t really help with readiness. It’s just a political show.”","summary":"White House official says US will pursue ‘complete denuclearisation’ but analysts believe Trump will instead pursue disarmament or reduction.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3296930/trump-says-north-korea-nuclear-power-why-does-it-matter-china","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/01/1bd1aaef-9106-4bf2-b5bc-9fa6e66da9e4_834ada77.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 00:00:09","author":"Seong Hyeon Choi","authors":["Seong Hyeon Choi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":286162280,"title":"Decoding the Budget: Two Cheers, the third depends on Trump effect","text":"The middle class swooned with delight at the tax cuts in the budget, but the stock markets barely moved. Why so? Because finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's speech about a bright future was silent on the sharp, continuing fall of Indian stock markets and the rupee ever since it became clear that Donald Trump was going to become US President and disrupt global relations. He is expected to announce high tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China on Saturday night, and on steel, aluminium, chips, oil and gas soon after. His words will matter more for markets than anything Sitharaman said, showing how large his shadow falls on India. This is just his first tariff barrage: nobody knows how far he will go.His unpredictability is killing animal spirits in the world economy, and in India too. Global money is rushing to the ultimate safe haven, the US, leaving emerging markets like India stranded. The schemes announced by the FM to spur growth may be more than nullified by the Trump effect. Remarkable Achievement The best thing in her budget is the reduction of the fiscal deficit to 4.4% of GDP, fulfilling a promise of reduction from 9.2% made five years ago. To have combined that with rising capex and GDP growth of 7% is a remarkable achievement, even if it owes a lot to record RBI dividends.Yet one cannot give three cheers because India's fiscal problems are far from over. Interest payments for the second year in a row will be 44.9% of the Centre's tax revenue, an outrageously high ratio. It is far higher than the 39.7% ratio in 2018-19, before Covid. If Trump's belligerence slows the world economy and India with it, Sitharaman's growth and revenue expectations will be seriously impaired. Many analysts make the mistake of thinking that her budget will stimulate consumption thanks to tax cuts of ₹1 lakh crore. Yes, but these tax cuts are offset by a stagnation of capex, which will barely rise from ₹11.1 lakh crore to just ₹11.2 lakh crore this year. Consumer goods companies may gain at the expense of capital goods and infrastructure companies. But remember that a cut in the fiscal deficit is anti-stimulus, not pro-stimulus. At the macro level, the fiscal contraction is larger than and matters more than income tax cuts for the middle class. This is not a boom budget. It marks a milestone in fiscal consolidation, which, however, has a long way to go.In many countries the tax exemption limit is around the per capita income. India's per capita income is ₹2.3 lakh, so the tax exemption limit of ₹12 lakh is five times higher. In the US, the per capita income is $82,000 but tax exemption limit is $14,600, almost one-sixth of the per capita level. Okay, the USA may not be the best comparator. But India's exemption limit is now by far the highest in South Asia. Pakistan's tax exemption limit is the equivalent of ₹1.87 lakh, one tenth India's rate. It is another matter that Pakistan is far worse than India in checking tax evasion.Year after year, official documents speak of the need to expand the tax base. But raising the tax exemption limit from ₹7 lakh to ₹12 lakh will contract the tax base substantially. In numbers, the bottom of the taxpayer pyramid is far larger than the peak, and it is the base that the budget has eroded. This may be good politics but not good economics.It is also good politics for Sitharaman to show much she wants to do for Bihar, which has a state election later this year. So her budget speech promised new greenfield airports for the state apart from expanding Patna airport, help for the West Kosi Canal, a tourism focus on Buddha (which must include Bodh Gaya), a National Institute for Food Processing, a Makhana support mission for a product Bihar is famous for, and an expansion of Bihar's IIT.She promised a new income tax bill next week, puzzlingly close to her budget. Why was it not included in the budget? We will soon know. Its focus will apparently be in procedures and simplification, to reduce disputes and litigation. Sitharaman announced the elimination of seven tariff rates in addition to the seven eliminated last year, leaving only eight rates. This is still too many, but fewer is better than more.She also promised trust-based regulatory reforms. A committee will review all regulations of permits, licences and clearances in all non-financial areas, to overhaul those that currently assume guilt unless otherwise proved. The Jan Vishwas Act 2023 decriminalised more than 180 legal provisions, and Sitharaman promised a new Bill to decriminalise 100 more.These are solid long-term measures. They will not immediately excite investors or the middle class. But they will ultimately have more impact than mere tax cuts.","summary":"Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's budget, though celebrated for the tax cuts by the middle class, did not impress stock markets due to the global economic uncertainty caused by anticipated tariffs from former President Donald Trump.

For the first time since 1945, Europe was convulsed and disfigured by devastating conventional war.\n\nThe world's main fear is, of course, a nuclear conflict, which would end everything. But the misery created by non-nuclear combat is terrible.\n\nWe have seen massacres, streams of refugees forced from their homes by terror, and appalling destruction of cities. \n\nUncounted numbers of young men have been killed, maimed or disfigured. Whole stretches of countryside have been turned into churned-up, uninhabitable desolation.\n\nThe people of Ukraine have also had to endure the privations of war, and ever-worsening reductions of the electric power necessary to maintain modern civilisation. And yet they have not given up.\n\nA new state, born less than 34 years ago out of the collapse of the Soviet Union and still taking shape, has been hardened by battle and suffering into a self-conscious, deeply patriotic nation. \n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has borne himself with dignity and courage, never flinching from a hard task forced upon him by events. Let us not forget that he came from outside Ukraine's political class, and that his original platform was one of peace, not war.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has sunk deeper into a grim autocracy. President Vladimir Putin has never even admitted that his 'Special Military Operation' is an invasion, and has almost entirely stamped out free speech as he persecutes any who dare to oppose him. \n\nHis armed forces have inflicted a great deal of damage and loss, but they have also suffered terrible casualties, as many crammed new cemeteries in Russia testify.\n\nSo what are we to do now? Britain's role has from the start been important. We have armed, aided and encouraged Ukraine in its battle to fight off its far larger, far richer and far more ruthless neighbour. \n\nSome of our military equipment has been highly effective on land and sea in destroying key parts of the Putin war machine. But by ourselves we cannot supply all the needs of Kyiv.\n\nWhat we can do, as a pillar of Nato and as the USA's oldest and most reliable friend, is to urge our American and European allies to stay in the fight. We should strongly advocate their continuing and powerful support to ensure that Putin does not get away with his brutal, expansionist adventure.\n\nIn The Mail on Sunday today, a highly experienced military and political figure, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, says bluntly that Ukraine is fighting with one arm tied behind its back.\n\nSir Iain, a Sandhurst-trained former Army officer, knows what he is talking about. On a recent visit he noticed that front-line Ukrainian troops were having to improvise with antique British equipment dating from half a century ago.\n\nSir Iain correctly points out that American interest has recently shifted to other theatres of war, especially Taiwan and Israel. \n\nBut he also says a Western failure in Ukraine would increase the danger in both these places. Aggressive tyrants all over the world are waiting to see the outcome. They would be hugely encouraged by a Putin triumph.\n\nMuch depends on the attitude taken by the newly re-elected US President Donald Trump, who once said he could end the Ukraine war in 24 hours. It seems that he is not so sure now.\n\nBritain should be doing all it can to persuade him that Ukraine's struggle for independence and freedom is worth fighting and winning.","summary":"It is now almost three years since Russia outraged international law and decency in a barbaric, lawless invasion of its neighbour, Ukraine.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14350857/A-Putin-victory-green-light-tyrants-everywhere.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/01/23/94764253-0-image-m-137_1738453657881.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 23:51:41","author":"Editor,Mail","authors":["Editor","Mail"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.042},{"id":286163624,"title":"Minnesota immigrant groups organize in Twin Cities in response to federal crackdown threats","text":"St. Paul city, school and state representatives pledged Saturday not to cooperate with federal immigration agents, and an official with the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office vowed to fight President Donald Trump on actions he said amounted to “executive overreach.”\n\nThe remarks came during a forum on immigration safety at Neighborhood House in St. Paul, where dozens gathered to hear public officials discuss how local government is responding to Trump’s plans for mass deportations.\n\nCity Council President Mitra Jalali said the community is less safe when residents feel they don’t have access to basic city services.

Democrats say Trump has no legal authority to eliminate a congressionally funded independent agency, and that the work of USAID is vital to national security.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans say much of foreign aid and development programs are wasteful. They single out programs they say advance liberal social agendas.\n\nThe fear of even tougher administration action against USAID comes two weeks into the administration’s shutdown of billions of dollars of the United States’ humanitarian, development and security assistance.\n\nThe U.S. is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid by far. It spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance, a smaller share overall than some other countries.\n\nAdministration officials had no comment Saturday when asked about concerns expressed by lawmakers and others that Trump may be planning to end USAID as an independent agency.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy created at the height of the Cold War to counter Soviet influence. USAID today is at the center of U.S. challenges to the growing influence of China, which has a successful “Belt and Road” foreign aid program of its own.\n\nCongress passed the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961, and Kennedy signed that law and an executive order establishing USAID as an independent agency.\n\nUSAID staffers spent Friday and Saturday in chat groups monitoring the fate of their agency, giving updates on whether the agency’s flag and signs were still up outside agency headquarters in Washington. As of late Saturday afternoon, they were.\n\nIn a post on X, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said presidents cannot eliminate congressionally appropriated federal agencies by executive order, and said Trump was poised to “double down on a constitutional crisis.”\n\n“That’s what a despot — who wants to steal the taxpayers’ money to enrich his billionaire cabal — does,” Murphy said.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, advising Trump in a campaign to whittle down the federal government in the name of efficiency, endorsed posts on his X site calling for dissolving USAID.\n\n“Live by executive order, die by executive order,” Musk tweeted in reference to USAID.\n\nTrump placed an unprecedented 90-day freeze on foreign assistance on his first day in office Jan. 20. The order, a tougher-than-expected interpretation of Trump’s freeze order on Jan. 24 drafted by Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump’s first term, shut down thousands of programs around the world and forced the furloughs or layoffs of many thousands.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has since moved to keep more kinds of strictly life-saving emergency programs going during the freeze. Aid groups say confusion surrounding what programs are still allowed to operate is contributing to paralysis in global aid organizations.\n\nRubio said Thursday, in his first public comments on the matter, that USAID’s programs were being reviewed to eliminate any that are not in the U.S. national interest, but he said nothing about eliminating it as an agency.\n\nThe shutdown of U.S.-funded programs during the 90-day review meant the U.S. was “getting a lot more cooperation” from recipients of humanitarian, development and security assistance, Rubio said.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have fought over the agency for years, arguing whether humanitarian and development aid protects the U.S. by helping stabilize partner countries and economies, or is a waste of money. Republicans typically push to give State more control of USAID’s policy and funds. Democrats typically build USAID autonomy and authority.\n\nA version of that legal battle played out in Trump’s first term, when Trump tried to cut the budget for foreign operations by a third.\n\nWhen Congress refused, the Trump administration used freezes and other tactics to cut the flow of funds already appropriated by Congress for foreign programs. The General Accounting Office later ruled that it violated a law known as the Impoundment Control Act.\n\nAP photographer Carolyn Kaster contributed to this report.","summary":"Trump and congressional Republicans say much of foreign aid and development programs are wasteful.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/01/usaid-website-goes-offline-in-trump-administrations-2-week-old-freeze-on-foreign-aid-worldwide/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Foreign_Aid_Migration_42232.jpg?w=1024&h=671","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 23:34:23","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":286152764,"title":"US duties on energy resources from Canada to be 10% — White House","text":"WASHINGTON, February 2. /TASS/.

It's a nice idea.\n\nBut guess what? Those grown-up kids who made us feel miserable as we helped to haul all their belongings out of the house for a new life have an uncanny habit of moving back in. The idea of children actually leaving the nest, rather than having a quick flutter outside and returning, is truly only for the birds.\n\nAsk any middle-class parent of twentysomethings whether the end of university and, hopefully, the start of first jobs means they will have no need of their old bed, and you will be met with a Gen Z-style eye-roll – but from the parents.\n\nMy own 29-year-old is currently living (or should I say staying) with us. Each time he moves out, I look at the room which was his childhood bedroom with a sense of nostalgia mixed with excitement about what I might do next with it.\n\nAnd then, before I have resolved that issue, he's back. It's a treat to have your adult child around the place and certainly the conversations are more interesting than the monosyllabic grunts of the teenage years. But some parent/child behaviours are preserved in aspic, and not always in a good way.\n\nThose who invest in a new home and a new life often get a nasty shock when they find the spare room they've designated as a home office or – what bliss! – a dressing room, suddenly has to turn into their adult child's bedroom, again. Not that I imagine Gwyneth Paltrow will be having to contend with a space problem when her children, Apple and Moses, boomerang back.\n\nNew cold war over what's in the fridge\n\nContinuing this subject: can we talk about how different generations regard food hygiene?\n\nWhen I poke around my 97-year-old mother's fridge, I am appalled by some of what I find. There's cheese that could march on Moscow, lettuce that redefines the term limp, jars of sauce with crust that could serve as a lid. But any attempt of mine to throw the stuff out is met with a stiff refusal and the comment: 'It's perfectly fine if you just cut the rind/skin off.'\n\nAs a child, I remember onions would be kept until they had trees growing out them and potatoes were studded with sprouting growths like acne. But, amazingly, my son considers that my own behaviour verges on being equally unsafe.\n\nA packet of feta left just slightly open, with the outer edges going a bit yellow, is unacceptable. A cucumber that hasn't been resealed in clingfilm is deemed unusable. If the open pesto jar is a week old, it's for the bin.\n\nSome friends of mine have a house with an old fridge full of so many odds and ends of food that their adult children were desperate to club together to buy them a new one – just so it would be emptied of what they regarded as toxic matter.\n\nIf it goes on like this, each generation being fussier about food hygiene than the next, our great-grandchildren, will be brought up on the kind of rehydratable food used by astronauts to survive in space. No possibility of germs lurking there.\n\nBeing told to relax? That stresses me out\n\nLast week, I was sent to review a magnificent Swiss health spa. There I was, swaddled in a soft white dressing gown, with nothing to do but be looked after. But every therapist – from the facialist to the nutritionist to the medical doctor to the masseur – looked at me in a concerned way and told me I needed to relax.\n\nWho has ever found being told to relax anything other than extremely irritating and immensely stressful? We are constantly bombarded with the importance of relaxing and ways to do it – mindfulness, yoga, sound baths, alternate nostril breathing. All designed to transport us to this supposed Nirvana of relaxation.\n\nBut what does being relaxed mean anyway? And, really, what's the point? Who ever won the war by relaxing?\n\nPump up the volume – the bouffant is back\n\nBig hair is back, but it's got nothing to do with the return of Donald Trump, despite what some fashion commentators say. Sitting in the hairdressers over recent months, I was transfixed by the sight of young women having their long hair, for years kept poker-straight, wrapped in curlers and emerging with hairstyles that make Dolly Parton's wigs look as flat as Norfolk. Less Republican, more country music style, à la Miley Cyrus. How long until Dyson comes up with a set of heated rollers?\n\nMarianne's special place in my heart\n\nOne of the very first records I owned was a 45rpm of This Little Bird by Marianne Faithfull.\n\nWith her death last week comes a small personal loss of that little girl I once was, sitting on the floor playing the single on a small portable record player. Some figures establish themselves as stepping stones in the memory map of life. Marianne was one of those.\n\nBamboozled... by a four-legged blighter\n\nIf anyone is interested on an update on the mouse situation I wrote about last Sunday, I can report that I have just spotted two of the blighters, as I type.\n\nBut I have no idea where they've scarpered. Clearly their network of tunnels in the kitchen is as cleverly disguised as Hamas's under Gaza.","summary":"ALEXANDRA SHULMAN'S NOTEBOOK: What better way to deal with the empty-nest stage of life than to do as Gwyneth Paltrow has done, and move house?","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14350771/Gwynnie-boomerangs-set-hit-you.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/01/23/94763897-0-image-m-103_1738451897350.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 23:29:41","author":"Alexandra Shulman,Editor","authors":["Alexandra Shulman","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.073},{"id":286154624,"title":"Donald Trump set to impose tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada - which could disrupt nearly £1.7trillion in annual trade","text":"Donald Trump set to impose tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada - which could disrupt nearly £1.7trillion in annual trade\n\nPODCAST: On Welcome to MAGAland - Trump’s response to the tragic D.C plane crash, plus is project 2025 really a myth?\n\nBy CAROLINE GRAHAM IN LOS ANGELES\n\nPublished: 23:11 GMT, 1 February 2025 | Updated: 23:27 GMT, 1 February 2025\n\nDonald Trump was last night set to impose stringent tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada in what many fear will spark a global trade war.\n\nPresident Trump was set to announce tariffs of 25 per cent on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10 per cent on Chinese products, which could disrupt more than $2.1 trillion (£1.69 trillion) in annual trade between those nations and America.\n\nOn Friday Mr Trump told reporters he would impose the tariffs as ‘punishment’ on three of the US’s largest trade partners for allowing drugs and migrants to flood into the US.\n\nThe levies – on products such as computer chips, steel, oil, gas and cars – ‘will bring a tremendous amount of money in for our country and bring a rebirth in American manufacturing’, he said. Canada is America’s biggest foreign supplier of crude oil, followed by Mexico.\n\nMark Carney, frontrunner to replace Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister, has vowed that his country will hit back.\n\nThe former governor of the Bank of England said: ‘President Trump probably thinks Canada will cave in. But we are going to stand up to a bully, we’re not going to back down. We’re united and we will retaliate.’\n\nMr Trump put tariffs at the centre of his election campaign, citing an era more than a century ago when tariffs were a cornerstone of US trade policy and revenue.\n\nHe said: ‘It was a beautiful time. I love big, bold beautiful tariffs. They protect American businesses and encourage Americans to buy homegrown goods. I will use them as a way to punish those who continue to allow our country to be flooded with killer drugs like fentanyl and those who allow illegal aliens to pour over our borders.’\n\nMr Trump has warned he will impose future tariffs on the European Union as punishment for its ‘horrible treatment of America’ but has yet to mention the UK in any of his plans.\n\nDonald Trump said he would impose tariffs of 25 per cent on goods from Canada and Mexico, and 10 per cent from China\n\nCrates of avocados in Mexico. Mr Trump's move threatens to derail the $1.6 trillion trade between the US and its neighbouring countries\n\nSir Keir Starmer has said he is anxious to secure a trade deal with the US and sources in Washington tell the MoS that ‘talks are ongoing about Sir Keir coming to the White House for in-person talks’.\n\nMr Trump’s tariffs threaten to disrupt the $1.6 trillion trade between Canada and Mexico and the US each year.\n\nProfessor David Ortega, an economist at Michigan State University, said they could end up punishing American consumers by driving up prices.\n\nHe said: ‘Tariffs drive up the cost of goods domestically by increasing production costs and reducing competition. The higher costs get passed on to consumers with low-income households bearing the brunt of the burden.’\n\nSir Keir Starmer has said he is keen to secure a trade deal with the US, with talks ongoing about the PM visiting the White House for talks, according to sources\n\nChina has threatened to retaliate against the measures, which critics say will result in American consumers being punished by higher prices\n\nChina, Canada and Mexico have all threatened to retaliate against the measures. Canadian officials have outlined plans to impose higher taxes on orange juice from Florida and electric cars made by Tesla, a company owned by Mr Trump’s ‘First Buddy’, Elon Musk.\n\nMr Trump put tariffs on Chinese imports during his first term in office and ended up bailing out US farmers who saw export revenues plunge by $10 billion after China retaliated.\n\nOn Monday the President insisted his tariffs would be a useful ‘bargaining tool’ with other governments.\n\n‘We have the biggest piggy bank, we can’t lose,’ he said.\n\nMexicoDonald TrumpCanadaChina\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump set to impose tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada - which could disrupt nearly £1.7trillion in annual trade\n\nAdd comment","summary":"On Friday Mr Trump told reporters he would impose the tariffs as 'punishment' on three of the US's largest trade partners for allowing drugs and migrants to flood into the US.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14350733/Donald-Trump-set-impose-tariffs-China-Mexico-Canada-disrupt-nearly-1-7trillion-annual-trade.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/01/23/94763723-0-image-m-135_1738451329521.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 23:27:11","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.182},{"id":286153966,"title":"Trump orders steep tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada, China","text":"US President Donald Trump on Saturday (Feb 1) ordered 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10 per cent on goods from China starting on Tuesday and declared that they would remain in place until a national emergency over the drug fentanyl and illegal immigration to the US ends.\n\nEnergy products from Canada will have only a 10 per cent duty, but Mexican energy imports will be charged the full 25 per cent, officials told reporters.\n\nA White House fact sheet on the duties said they would remain in place \"until the crisis alleviated\", but it did not provide details on what actions the three countries would need to take to win a reprieve.\n\nThe moves follow through on a repeated threat Trump has made since shortly after winning last year's presidential election, and they likely will trigger retaliation and risk igniting a trade war that could cause broad economic disruption for all countries involved.\n\nTariff collections are set to begin at 12.01am EST (0501 GMT) on Tuesday, according to Trump's written order.

The tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, setting a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth.\n\nA senior administration official, insisting on anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize any disruptive increases on the price of gasoline or utilities. That’s a sign the White House understood as outside economists have warned that the import taxes could dramatically increase inflation, a possible problem for Trump as he promised to tame inflation after public unhappiness with price spikes under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries.\n\nThe White House said Trump’s order also includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if the countries retaliate against the U.S., as they have threatened. Both Canada and Mexico have plans, if needed, to impose their own tariffs in response.\n\nThe Trump administration put the tariffs in place to force the three countries to stop the spread and manufacturing of fentanyl, in addition to pressuring Canada and Mexico to limit any illegal immigration into the United States.\n\nThe official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addition.\n\nThe order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties.\n\nThe Republican president is making a major political bet that his actions will not worsen inflation, cause financial aftershocks that could destabilize the worldwide economy or provoke a voter backlash. AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of the electorate in last year’s election, found that the U.S. was split on support for tariffs.\n\nWith the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics.\n\nThe president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil and natural gas, as well as against copper, pharmaceutical drugs and imports from the European Union — moves that could essentially pit the U.S. against much of the global economy.\n\nIt is unclear how the tariffs could affect the business investments that Trump said would happen because of his plans to cut corporate tax rates and remove regulations. Tariffs tend to raise prices for consumers and businesses by making it more expensive to bring in foreign goods.\n\nMany voters turned to Trump in the November election on the belief that he could better handle the inflation that spiked under Democratic President Joe Biden. But inflation expectations are creeping upward in the University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment as respondents expect prices to rise by 3.3%. That would be higher than the actual 2.9% annual inflation rate in December’s consumer price index.\n\nTrump has said that the government should raise more of its revenues from tariffs, as it did before the income tax became part of the Constitution in 1913. He claims, despite economic evidence to the contrary, that the U.S. was at its wealthiest in the 1890s under President William McKinley.\n\n“We were the richest country in the world,” Trump said Friday. “We were a tariff country.”\n\nBrad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted on the social media site X that the tariffs “if sustained, would be a massive shock — a much bigger move in one weekend than all the trade action that Trump took in his first term.”\n\nSetser noted that the tariffs on China without exemptions could raise the price of iPhones, which would test just how much power corporate America has with Trump. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook attended Trump’s inauguration last month.\n\nRecent research on Trump’s various tariff options by a team of economists suggested the trade penalties would be drags on growth in Canada, Mexico, China and the U.S. But Wending Zhang, a Cornell University economist who worked on the research, said the fallout would be felt more in Canada and Mexico because of their reliance on the U.S. market.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Canadians that they could be facing difficult times ahead, but that Ottawa was prepared to respond with retaliatory tariffs if needed and that the U.S. penalties would be self-sabotaging.\n\nTrudeau said Canada is addressing Trump’s calls on border security by implementing a CDN$1.3 billion (US$900 million) border plan that includes helicopters, new canine teams and imaging tools.\n\nMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has stressed that her country has acted to reduce illegal border crossings and the illicit trade in fentanyl. While she has emphasized the ongoing dialogue since Trump first floated the tariffs in November, she has said that Mexico is ready to respond, too.\n\nMexico has a “Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides,” she said.\n\nTrump still has to get a budget, tax cuts and an increase to the government’s legal borrowing authority through Congress. The outcome of his tariff plans could strengthen his hand or weaken it.\n\nDemocrats are sponsoring legislation that would strip the president of his ability to impose tariffs without congressional approval. But that is unlikely to make headway in a Republican-controlled House and Senate.\n\n“If this weekend’s tariffs go into effect, they’ll do catastrophic damage to our relationships with our allies and raise costs for working families by hundreds of dollars a year,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. “Congress needs to stop this from happening again.”\n\n— By JOSH BOAK, Associated Press","summary":"Trump is declaring an economic emergency to put duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada — America’s largest trading partners — except for a 10% rate on Canadian oil.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/nation/2025/02/trump-imposes-tariffs-on-mexico-canada-and-china-likely-raising-costs-for-us-consumers.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/HIIZ4B32ZZCMLLNYQ5RE22II2U.jpg?auth=6f54cb9eedf1306c714a9b869186ce61375a0f7603e49b7bd451ec2ec3f52ea4&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 23:22:42","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":286149288,"title":"Trump imposes tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China linked to fentanyl crisis","text":"Feb. 1 (UPI) -- The Trump administration is following through on its promise to impose 25% tariffs on certain goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on Chinese items on Saturday, all linked to the fentanyl crisis.\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday announced the tariffs would take effect Saturday.

Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs against European Union nations.\n\nTrump signed three executive orders on Saturday imposing tariffs of 25% on all goods from Mexico and Canada, the New York Times reported. Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Canadian oil exports, as well as a 10% tariff on items from China.\n\nThe Times reported that Trump’s tariffs were scheduled to go into effect on Tuesday. An official told the newspaper that these tariffs contained a retaliation clause that would ratchet up American tariffs if Mexico, Canada or China tried to place their own tariffs on US goods in response.\n\nTrump is imposing the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The president cited the US opioid crisis when imposing his executive order, laying much of the blame for drug trafficking on Canada.\n\nThe country “played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs”, Trump claimed.\n\nTrump’s office said that Chinese officials had failed to prevent drug precursors from being shipped to Mexico and used by cartels. He also alleged that Mexican drug traffickers have an “intolerable allience with the government of Mexico”.\n\nIn a fact sheet on the tariffs, Trump also cited the “threat posed by illegal aliens” in his decision.\n\nTrump’s decision to levy a 10% tariff rate on Canadian energy products seems to be some sort of recognition that tariffs can spur higher prices. The White House has contended that tariffs will not fan the flames of inflation.\n\nGoods from these three countries comprise more than one-third of imports into the US, including apparel, medicine, electronics and steel, the newspaper reported. Despite Trump’s warning that they would be met with ramped-up tariffs, Canada and Mexico said they would meet his plan with tariffs on US imports.\n\nCanada reportedly said it would impose tariffs on Florida orange juice and whiskey from Tennessee, as well as Kentucky-made peanut butter. All three states are represented by Republican senators and voted for Trump in 2024, the Times notes.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico, said that her country should move forward with a “cool head” and a planned retaliatory response, per the Times. The newspaper noted that Trump did not engage in any serious negotiations with these countries before issuing his decision.\n\nEconomists have repeatedly sounded the alarm that higher tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods for Americans, exacerbating an increased cost of living. Trump did recognize on Friday that his tariffs could prompt “temporary short-term disruption”.\n\nHe said he hoped that Americans would understand why he was imposing them. “Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” Trump claimed. “They cause success.”\n\nThe Tax Foundation, a conservative group, has estimated that Trump placed $80bn in tariffs on approxiately $380bn worth of products in 2018 and 2019. The foundation described this as “one of the largest tax increases in decades”.\n\nJoe Biden’s administration kept the majority of these tariffs in place, and increased tariffs on an additional $18bn of Chinese goods, including semiconductors and electric vehicles.","summary":"Decision could set the stage for a damaging trade war between the US and three of its top trade partners\n\nDonald Trump has signed an order authorizing tariffs after vowing to impose dramatic taxes on goods from Canada, Mexico and China.\n\nThe decision could set the stage for a damaging trade war between the US and three of its top trade partners.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned of difficult times ahead, while Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has emphasized ongoing dialogue but indicated Mexico has \"Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"What Is A Tariff?When countries import goods, their governments often impose taxes called tariffs on these products.These fees are typically paid by businesses bringing goods into the country, though the costs often reach consumers through higher prices. Tariffs serve multiple purposes: they can protect domestic industries, generate government revenue, or pressure other nations to change policies.In today's global economy, most nations have moved away from heavy tariff use, preferring free trade agreements that reduce these barriers. However, governments may still implement tariffs for specific policy goals or in response to international disputes.This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.","summary":"Trump orders 25 percent tariffs on Mexico/Canada imports, 10 percent on China, citing border security and fentanyl concerns under emergency powers.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-signs-tariffs-mexico-canada-china-emergency-2024745","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2579029/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 23:10:31","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.014},{"id":286148104,"title":"Captain Rebecca Lobach is identified as third Black Hawk pilot who died in collision with American Airlines flight in DC","text":"The U.S. Army has identified the third pilot of the H-60 Black Hawk Helicopter that collided with an American Airline CRJ-700 passenger jet on Wednesday as it was on approach to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing 67 people.\n\nCaptain Rebecca M.

The tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, setting a showdown in North America that could potentially sabotage economic growth.\n\nA senior administration official, insisting on anonymity to brief reporters, said the lower rate on energy reflected a desire to minimize any disruptive increases on the price of gasoline or utilities. That’s a sign the White House understood as outside economists have warned that the import taxes if sustained could dramatically increase inflation, a possible problem for Trump as he promised to tame inflation after public unhappiness with price spikes under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe order signed by Trump contained no mechanism for granting exceptions, the official said, a possible blow to homebuilders who rely on Canadian lumber as well as farmers, automakers and other industries.\n\nThe White House said Trump’s order also includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if the countries retaliate against the U.S., as they have threatened. Both Canada and Mexico have plans, if needed, to impose their own tariffs in response.\n\nThe Trump administration put the tariffs in place to force the three countries to stop the spread and manufacturing of fentanyl, in addition to pressuring Canada and Mexico to limit any illegal immigration into the United States.\n\nThe official did not provide specific benchmarks that could be met to lift the new tariffs, saying only that the best measure would be fewer Americans dying from fentanyl addition.\n\nThe order would also allow for tariffs on Canadian imports of less than $800. Imports below that sum are currently able to cross into the United States without customs and duties.\n\nThe Republican president is making a major political bet that his actions will not worsen inflation, cause financial aftershocks that could destabilize the worldwide economy or provoke a voter backlash. AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of the electorate in last year’s election, found that the U.S. was split on support for tariffs.\n\nWith the tariffs, Trump is honoring promises that are at the core of his economic and national security philosophy. But the announcement showed his seriousness around the issue as some Trump allies had played down the threat of higher import taxes as mere negotiating tactics.\n\nThe president is preparing more import taxes in a sign that tariffs will be an ongoing part of his second term. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil and natural gas, as well as against copper, pharmaceutical drugs and imports from the European Union — moves that could essentially pit the U.S. against much of the global economy.\n\nIt is unclear how the tariffs could affect the business investments that Trump said would happen because of his plans to cut corporate tax rates and remove regulations. Tariffs tend to raise prices for consumers and businesses by making it more expensive to bring in foreign goods.\n\nMany voters turned to Trump in the November election on the belief that he could better handle the inflation that spiked under Democratic President Joe Biden. But inflation expectations are creeping upward in the University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment as respondents expect prices to rise by 3.3%. That would be higher than the actual 2.9% annual inflation rate in December’s consumer price index.\n\nTrump has said that the government should raise more of its revenues from tariffs, as it did before the income tax became part of the Constitution in 1913. He claims, despite economic evidence to the contrary, that the U.S. was at its wealthiest in the 1890s under President William McKinley.\n\n“We were the richest country in the world,” Trump said Friday. “We were a tariff country.”\n\nBrad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted on the social media site X that the tariffs “if sustained, would be a massive shock — a much bigger move in one weekend than all the trade action that Trump took in his first term.”\n\nSetser noted that the tariffs on China without exemptions could raise the price of iPhones, which would test just how much power corporate America has with Trump. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook attended Trump’s inauguration last month.\n\nRecent research on Trump’s various tariff options by a team of economists suggested the trade penalties would be drags on growth in Canada, Mexico, China and the U.S. But Wending Zhang, a Cornell University economist who worked on the research, said the fallout would be felt more in Canada and Mexico because of their reliance on the U.S. market.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Canadians that they could be facing difficult times ahead, but that Ottawa was prepared to respond with retaliatory tariffs if needed and that the U.S. penalties would be self-sabotaging.\n\nTrudeau said Canada is addressing Trump’s calls on border security by implementing a CDN$1.3 billion (US$900 million) border plan that includes helicopters, new canine teams and imaging tools.\n\nMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has stressed that her country has acted to reduce illegal border crossings and the illicit trade in fentanyl. While she has emphasized the ongoing dialogue since Trump first floated the tariffs in November, she has said that Mexico is ready to respond, too.\n\nMexico has a “Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides,” she said.\n\nTrump still has to get a budget, tax cuts and an increase to the government’s legal borrowing authority through Congress. The outcome of his tariff plans could strengthen his hand or weaken it.\n\nDemocrats are sponsoring legislation that would strip the president of his ability to impose tariffs without congressional approval. But that is unlikely to make headway in a Republican-controlled House and Senate.\n\n“If this weekend’s tariffs go into effect, they’ll do catastrophic damage to our relationships with our allies and raise costs for working families by hundreds of dollars a year,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. “Congress needs to stop this from happening again.”","summary":"The White House said the president's order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if the countries retaliate, as they have threatened.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/01/trump-imposes-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-raising-prospect-of-higher-costs-for-us-consumers/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trump_65213-e1738451357936.jpg?w=1024&h=577","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 23:00:28","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":286150068,"title":"Recovery crews return to the Potomac debris after the deadly plane and helicopter crash","text":"ARLINGTON, Virginia (AP) — Recovery crews and divers searched the Potomac River for remains and cleared wreckage Saturday from the midair collision of a passenger jet and Army helicopter that killed 67 people.\n\nA Coast Guard cutter outfitted with a crane waited by the wreckage as occasional recovery team members slipped into the water amid a group of smaller emergency boats.\n\nNo one survived the Wednesday night collision.

The tariffs will take effect on Tuesday.\nThe White House said in a statement announcing the disruptive moves that the administration was drawing on emergency powers to counter the influx of opioids and other drugs that “threatens the very fabric of our society”.\n“This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl,” Trump said in a posting on X, formerly known as Twitter. “We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all.”\nThe levy on imports of Canadian oil would be reduced to 10 per cent under the move, seen as part of a bid to moderate politically explosive prices at US gas pumps.\nThe three nations are America’s biggest trading partners and together account for nearly half of all US imports.\nWhile the announced import taxes are below levels of up to 60 per cent Trump said he would impose during his election campaign, they still sow uncertainty across vast swathes of the global trading system, analysts said.\nThe Trump administration justified the move as part of a strategy to force major US trading partners to take more decisive action on the fentanyl crisis and escalating migration at US borders.\nAll three trading partners have threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs of their own, but the White House said Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if the countries retaliate.\nThe moves against Canada and Mexico – two of US’ closest allies – could undercut a continentwide free-trade agreement Trump negotiated and signed in 2018 and suggest that no one is exempt from Trump’s tariff threats.\nThe moves left many questions about timing and implementation. Speaking with reporters in the White House on Friday, Trump said Washington would target computer chips, steel, aluminium, copper, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas imports as early as mid-February.\nHe added that he “absolutely” wants to hike tariffs on the European Union as well, which has “treated us so horribly”.\n“That’ll happen fairly soon,” Trump said, speaking with reporters in the Oval Office.\nAt a separate briefing on Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the tariffs were necessary because the three countries had offered inadequate help to Washington in addressing domestic concerns. Immigration, in particular, has been a long-running political issue that Trump pledged to fix during his election campaign.\nTrump prides himself on being a deal maker with a history of ramping up pressure to build leverage in advance of an agreement. But analysts warn that this transactional approach to governance can erode trust in alliances forged over decades.\nCanada has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs, including an export tax on oil aimed at undercutting Trump’s bid to avoid higher prices. Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, has suggested her country could impose its own retaliatory tariffs without providing specifics.","summary":"White House says move necessary to staunch flow of fentanyl and migrants to US.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3297045/trump-signs-executive-orders-imposing-steep-tariffs-china-canada-and-mexico","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/02/fcb39cb5-2c6e-4248-a732-5060186a53c4_a94b9142.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 22:59:57","author":"Mark Magnier","authors":["Mark Magnier"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":286149756,"title":"Trump hits Canada, Mexico and China with tariffs that take effect Tuesday, but Canadian energy imports get lighter levy","text":"Fortune 500\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nSEARCHSubscribe Now\n\nFORTUNE 500\n\nPersonal Finance\nReal Estate\n\nTop Business Schools\nTop Information Technology and Data Schools\nTop Health Schools\n\nFORTUNE 500\n\nMOST POWERFUL WOMEN\nGREAT PLACE TO WORK LISTS\nBEST MBA PROGRAMS\nMORE RANKINGS\nFortune Company List\n\nNewsletters\n\nFebruary/March 2025\nDecember 2024/January 2025\nOctober/November 2024\nAugust/September 2024\nJune/July 2024\nApril/May 2024\n\nCEO Initiative\n\nFinance·tariffs and trade\nTrump hits Canada, Mexico and China with tariffs that take effect Tuesday, but Canadian energy imports get lighter levy\n\nPresident Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. \nChip Somodevilla—Getty Images\n\n100 Best Companies\nFortune 500\n\nFortune 500 Europe\n\nMost Powerful Women\n\nWorld’s Most Admired Companies\nSee All Rankings\n\nEnvironment\nFortune Crypto\n\nNewsletters\n\nCEO Initiative\nConferences\nPersonal Finance\n\nCustomer Support\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCustomer Service Portal\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nSingle Issues for Purchase\nInternational Print\n\nCommercial Services\n\nFortune Brand Studio\nFortune Analytics\nFortune Conferences\nAdvertising\nBusiness Development\n\nEditorial Calendar\nPress Center\nWork at Fortune\nDiversity and Inclusion\nTerms and Conditions\n\n© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Harrison did not seek another term after the 2024 election when Trump became the first Republican to win the popular vote in two decades and made modest gains with core Democratic constituencies — African Americans, Latinos and working-class voters, among them.\n\nMartin offered a warning to Trump and his Republican allies after the vote was announced: “We’re coming. This is a new Democratic Party. We’re taking the gloves off.”\n\nMartin now becomes one of the most important players in the Democratic Party’s comeback attempt as Trump pushes the limits of presidential power. Martin promised bold changes, but he said he could not discuss specific actions until the party conducted a post-election review to determine what went wrong in November.\n\nIt is unclear how long the process might take. Martin said it would be completed “as quickly as possible” and then released publicly.\n\nThe party leadership election played out in suburban Washington as more than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory assembled at the DNC’s winter meeting.\n\nMartin’s ascendance comes less than two weeks after Trump’s inauguration and as Democrats struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. At the same time, public perception of the Democratic Party has hit rock bottom.\n\nJust 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party.\n\nMartin, 51, easily defeated Wisconsin party chair Ben Wikler, who had earned the backing of leading Democratic donors and leaders in Congress, including the top Democrats in the House and Senate.\n\nUltimately, Martin’s relationships with DNC members helped him overcome Wikler’s higher-profile alliances. Martin is one of the longest serving state party chairs, having led the Minnesota Democratic-Labor-Farmer Party since 2011.\n\nThe Democrats inside the cavernous hotel ballroom cheered Martin’s election, but not every one was convinced that he alone can lead the party’s resurgence.\n\nJeanna Repass, the Kansas Democratic chair who was running for DNC vice chair, described Martin as “a workhorse” instead of “a champion.”\n\n“Your workhorse pulls the plow, and you need that. But we don’t have that voice, that champion, to get out in front of us,” Repass said. “Donald Trump, for all of his faults, is able to get up there and lie with impunity and do it convincingly, and I don’t hear or see that voice in our party.”\n\nMartin on Saturday promised to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party’s anti-Trump rapid response system. He has pledged not to shy away from Democrats’ dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day party.\n\nStill, Martin became the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011.\n\nAlso in the race were Martin O’Malley, a former Maryland governor and Biden administration official; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ last presidential campaign.\n\nCandidate Marianne Williamson, an activist and author, surprised DNC members before voting began by endorsing Martin as “our best chance to cut the cord with the billionaire-funded corruption that will otherwise obstruct and limit our possibilities.”\n\nFundraising was one of the few issues that differentiated the front-runners.\n\nSome candidates criticized Wikler for relying on billionaires to fund his campaign. George Soros and Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn cofounder, each gave Wikler $250,000, according to federal filings.\n\nMartin received a donation from a billionaire as well — Vance Opperman, a Minnesota-based businessman, donated $100,000. Martin has defended the party’s need to accept money from wealthy donors to keep up with Republicans. He has said he would not take contributions from people who do not share his values.\n\nThe Democrats’ connection to such wealthy contributors could undermine one of the party’s central arguments against Trump, who has tapped more than a dozen billionaires for prominent roles in his nascent administration, none more prominent than Elon Musk.\n\nSome of Martin’s competitors were more willing to make sweeping changes.\n\nShakir called for a reliance on small-dollar donors, much more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. Shakir, the only Muslim seeking the chair role, was alone during a recent candidate forum in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC.\n\nShakir earned just two votes, however. Martin got 246, Wikler 134 and O’Malley 44.\n\nSome Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party.\n\n“As positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I’m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, ‘We’re in real trouble because I don’t see a desire to change,’” Repass said.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2025/02/01/democratic-party-ken-martin-national-chair","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f44371f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6192x3535+0+297/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F88%2F197ed763422fa45b12d89502b3a8%2Fdemo","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 22:54:49","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":286154628,"title":"EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy reveals the reason why she decided to quit the soap after nearly 32 years","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Feb 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaptain Rebecca Lobach is identified as third Black Hawk pilot who died in collision with American Airlines flight in DC\n\nLily Collins' husband Charlie McDowell hits back at criticism about couple's 'path to having a baby' through surrogacy\n\nFresh doubts are raised over conviction of 'killer' nurse Lucy Letby - as unearthed papers show she was off duty for third of cases\n\nJustin Baldoni publishes explosive new website telling 'his side' of Blake Lively lawsuit\n\nHow the police investigation into the Wimbledon Prep school crash became a distressing farce: As Land Rover driver Claire Freemantle is re-arrested, we reveal the failures - and why key witnesses were NEVER spoken to\n\nMI5 HQ gave me cancer - it has knocked 23 years off my life and now I am terminally ill I am suing for £200,000\n\nTerrifying moment man gets out 'sniper rifle' on Elizabeth Line Tube platform wearing full camo gear - as experts say 'it's a surefire way to get yourself shot'\n\nLOUISE THOMPSON: I'm flaky, can take weeks to reply to a WhatsApp and am notorious for cancelling plans.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy JESSICA JANES FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:22:45 GMT, 1 February 2025 |Updated:22:54 GMT, 1 February 2025 \n\nEastEnders Natalie Cassidy has opened up for the first time about her decision to leave the BBC One soap after more than three decades.\nThe actress, 41, who has played the role of Sonia Fowler since she was 10-years-old, will exit as part of the show's 40th-anniversary celebrations - a decision she made last summer. \nIn her first interview since announcing the news, Natalie explained that turning 42 this year made her feel it was time to 'be brave' and explore new opportunities. \nShe told The Sun: 'I'm 42 this year, I just feel like it's time to be brave. You don't want to get to 70 and think, 'I never tried that'.' \nNatalie also expressed her deep love for the show, saying: 'I've loved this programme with all my heart. I started at ten, it's in my bones, it's in my heart.' \nThe decision to leave came after a heart-to-heart with EastEnders boss Chris Clenshaw six months ago.\n\nEastEnders Natalie Cassidy has opened up for the first time about her decision to leave the BBC One soap after more than three decades\n\nThe actress, 41, who has played the role of Sonia Fowler since she was 10-years-old, will exit as part of the show's 40th-anniversary celebrations - a decision she made last summer\nThe star said: 'I'd been thinking about it for a little while. I had a wonderful chat with Chris back in the summer. It's just exciting.' \nWith the anniversary episodes set to feature a dramatic explosion at the Queen Vic, rumours are circulating that Sonia could die in the blast. \nHowever, Natalie is keeping quiet about her character's fate, who has recently been accused of killing Debbie Colwell. \nShe admitted that, since making the decision to leave, she's had to remind herself not to overthink what's coming next for Sonia. \nShe said the fate of Sonia is in the hands of the boss and the storyliners and she will just have to take a deep breath and let it play out. \nNatalie joined EastEnders in 1993 as part of the Jackson family, which included her on-screen sister Bianca (Patsy Palmer), brother Robbie (Dean Gaffney), and mother Carol (Lindsey Coulson). \nShe left the show in 2007 but made brief returns between 2010-2011 and in 2014.\nReflecting on her early years on set, Natalie shared a memory of being given a new bomber jacket, which she had to 'dirty up' for school to make it look worn. \n\nIn her first interview since announcing the news, Natalie explained that turning 42 this year made her feel it was time to 'be brave' and explore new opportunities (pictured 2022)\n\nShe told The Sun: 'I'm 42 this year, I just feel like it's time to be brave. You don't want to get to 70 and think, 'I never tried that'' (pictured last year)\n\nWith the anniversary episodes set to feature a dramatic explosion at the Queen Vic, rumours are circulating that Sonia could die in the blast\n\n Natalie Cassidy's 'unmissable' EastEnders exit set to shake up Walford as the Sonia Fowler actress quits soap after 32 years \nOver the years, some of the show's biggest stars, including June Brown, Pam St. Clement, Barbara Windsor, and Letitia Dean, mentored her. \nBut it was her close friendships with legendary actresses June (Dot Cotton) and Wendy (Pauline Fowler) that truly shaped her experience. \nShe admitted that when she was 18-years-old she would have a glass of red wine with June in the Ivy, when she was in her seventies, and the pair even went on holiday together. \nThough Natalie now lives with her two daughters and fiancé Marc Humphreys, she still gets recognized wherever she goes. \nShe hilariously admitted that people in her local area are now used to seeing her in her pyjamas as she runs errands. \nLooking back at her 32 years on the show, Natalie highlighted some of Sonia's biggest storylines, like giving birth as a teenager and her boyfriend Jamie dying on Christmas Day. \nBut one of her favourite moments was filming the hen party scene at Stacey Slater's house as all of the women were together and she believes the show thrives on strong, matriarchal women. \nNatalie CassidyEastenders\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEastEnders star Natalie Cassidy reveals the reason why she decided to quit the soap after nearly 32 years\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLily Collins' husband Charlie McDowell hits back at criticism about couple's 'path to having a baby' through surrogacy\n\nThe Masked Singer viewers left stunned as the identities of TWO celebrities are revealed ahead of the semi final\n\nJustin Baldoni publishes explosive new website telling 'his side' of Blake Lively lawsuit\n\nWhy Renee Zellweger could be about to join the club of 'v.v. smug marrieds' after her British ex-mechanic boyfriend AND his parents joined her on the Bridget Jones red carpet...\n\nCurtis Pritchard's ex-girlfriend Sophie Sheridan says he is 'obsessed with fame' and claims he 'walked over her like a doormat'\n\nSomething for everyone!
