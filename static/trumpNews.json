The list includes not one but two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump, the murder of a health insurance executive, the murder of two Israeli Embassy staffers, the murder of Catholic schoolchildren in Minneapolis, the shooting of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the firebombing of a pro-Israel march in Colorado, and the burning of Tesla vehicles. If one looks a little further back to 2017, there was the assassination attempt by a leftist gunman who shot Republican members of Congress while they practiced for their annual baseball game against Democrats.\n\nSome of these incidents have been properly condemned by Democratic officials, and the killing of Kirk has been met by elected Democrats with dignified and appropriate comments. These restrained responses suggest two things. First, Democrats may feel chastened by the enormity of what has just taken place, recognizing that the murder of a young married father of two who spent his life talking calmly and reasonably in an effort to persuade college students defies their usual efforts to turn any shooting into a debate about the ready availability of guns. Second, one hopes it also betokens an understanding that members of their party have been guilty of treating past incidents cynically or with levity and that they have grievously polluted our politics with a casual attitude toward violence.\n\nAfter the attempted assassination of Trump, some Democrats belittled the event and made a punchline of jokes, as was the case with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). Other incidents, notably Luigi Mangione’s killing of a healthcare executive, have been outright celebrated by many on the Left, including by prominent late-night talk show hosts, as has the burning of Teslas and Tesla car lots. Few Democrats bothered even to comment on a conspiracy to kill ICE agents in Texas.\n\nAmericans simply must not ignore how Democrats’ rhetoric is fueling this wave of atrocities.\n\nOn MSNBC, just minutes after Kirk was shot, but before his death was confirmed, Texas Democrat Matthew Dowd chose to blame the victim, saying, “He has been one of the most divisive younger figures in this, who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech, aimed at certain groups. And I always go back to, hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which often then to hateful actions.” That’s very nearly, “It’s his own fault; he had it coming.”\n\nIt escapes Dowd, who might be the least self-aware man on the planet, that Democrats are the principal purveyors of hateful words, which they aim at conservatives and their ideas. They simply will not accept that people of good faith can disagree with them. And their hateful words have been followed by hateful actions.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential candidate, called Trump a “fascist” who was seeking “unchecked” power.\n\nGov. Tim Walz (D-MN), the Democratic Party’s 2024 vice presidential candidate, called Trump’s government a “Gestapo.” He has called Trump a “wannabe dictator” and advised Democrats, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner, maybe it’s time for us to be a little more fierce.”\n\nGov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), a leading contender for the Democratic Party’s 2028 presidential nomination, pandered to his base by comparing Trump’s government to Nazi Germany and advised his followers, “If we don’t want to repeat history, then for God’s sake, in this moment, we better be strong enough to learn from it.”\n\nWhen failed Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke called Trump a Nazi on Newsom’s podcast, Newsom nodded along in agreement, which isn’t surprising because Newsom has also compared Republicans to Nazis.\n\nAs this publication noted just days ago, after the Catholic school shooting in Minnesota, “You can only call Trump and the Republican Party ‘Nazis’ and ‘threats to democracy’ so many times before your supporters start taking you seriously.”\n\nMany Democrats have taken their leaders’ reckless words as gospel truth rather than the hideous lies that they are. A recent Rutgers University study found that 55% of self-identifying “liberals” believe killing the president is a justifiable means of pursuing their political goals. A large survey published by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression this week found that over a third of college students said violence was at least sometimes acceptable to stop speeches on college campuses.\n\nWhich is what Kirk was doing when he was shot on Wednesday — he was speaking about controversial topics on a college campus.\n\nThe Democratic Party is adrift without a positive vision for the future of the country beyond rent control, defunding the police, and government-run grocery stores. But it is impossible to deny the link between its histrionic rhetoric toward conservatives and the pattern of political violence we are now witnessing.\n\nWe hope Democrats will take the shooting of Kirk as a reflection point to tone down the demonization of people who disagree with them politically.","summary":"Charlie Kirk was a national leader of young conservatives.

Obama called Kirk’s assassination “despicable” but urged the public not to rush to judgment about the motive behind the shooting.\n\n“We don’t yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy.

Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie’s family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 10, 2025 \n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker took a sharper tone, blaming President Donald Trump for fostering the political climate that led to the shooting. He pointed to Trump’s rhetoric and his pardons of Jan. 6 rioters and said they were signals to those willing to carry out attacks. (RELATED: JB Pritzker Blames Trump’s ‘Rhetoric’ For Charlie Kirk’s Assassination)\n\nTrump announced Kirk’s death on Truth Social, calling him “legendary” and praising his bond with young Americans. He described Kirk as deeply loved, especially by himself, and offered condolences to Kirk’s wife Erika and his family, writing, “Charlie, we love you!”\n\nThe statements came just hours after Kirk was gunned down, with authorities saying the shooter fired from an elevated position approximately 200 yards away as Kirk spoke to students in the campus courtyard. Authorities said the shot that killed Kirk came from a rooftop and described the suspected gunman only as wearing dark clothing.\n\nSurveillance footage captured a figure near the scene, but officials said the video quality was poor. Investigators are still working to identify the shooter and determine a motive.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Those that entered Poland were part of a huge overnight attack on Ukraine, during which Russia launched 415 drones.\n\nAs Europe braces for an imminent war with Russia, countries are turning their borders into defensive swampland and stockpiling essential goods such as food, water and medicine in preparation for a crisis.\n\nSeveral members of the 27-nation bloc are taking the drastic measures in anticipation of an invasion by the Russian president - with the Polish incursion showing that Putin seems to be already turning his sights beyond Kyiv.\n\nThe defence ministries of Finland and Poland are calling for the restoration of their nation's bogs and marshes, making it impossible for Russian tanks to attack as any advance would be prevented by their heavy vehicles sinking into swampland.\n\nIt comes as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned on Monday that Putin's 'imperialist plan wouldn't end with the conquest of Ukraine but would rather be just the start'. \n\nMeanwhile, Brussels has launched a 'stockpiling strategy' to ensure the continuity of key goods across Europe in the face of potential crises such as energy blackouts, pandemics, climate change and World War.\n\nThe EU is also pushing for every household to have a three-day survival kit, including matches, ID documents in a waterproof punch, bottled water, energy bars and a flashlight.\n\nAnd France's government has told its health bodies to expect for a 'major engagement' by March 2026 by asking hospitals to prepare for a potential flood of military patients from home and abroad.\n\nIt comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's said Putin could attack a NATO country within the next five years, as he criticised the alliance for a slow spending ramp up in June. But the threat could emerge much sooner, with Healey remarking that 'Putin hit a new level of hostility against Europe' after the Polish incursion.\n\nRussia says it did not plan to attack any targets in Poland, but Warsaw's defence minister hit back at any theories about an accidental malfunction. 'Russian drones have veered into Polish airspace before - not just drones but also cruise missiles,' Radoslaw Sikorski said.\n\n'When one or two drones does it, it is possible that it was a technical malfunction, but in this case there were 19 breaches, and it simply defies imagination that could be accidental.'\n\nWhen it comes to battle on land, there is a precedent in Ukraine for using the natural capability of viscous wetlands to ward off deadly Russian onslaughts.\n\nAs Russian soldiers marched towards Kyiv in February 2022, Ukraine took a desperate measure. To repel Putin's advance, the armed forces blew a hole in the soviet-era Kozarovychi Dam on the Irpin river north of Kyiv, flooding 2,800 hectares of land. \n\nThe last-ditch attempt to shield the city paid off. As the land transformed into an impenetrable, black swamp, advancing Russian tanks found themselves 'stuck in the mud' as US President Donald Trump claimed last month.\n\nNow, there are mounting calls in Europe to accelerate the restoration of bogs and marshes as a measure to combat climate change and to bolster defence.\n\nPeatlands are unique ecosystems that naturally store large amounts of carbon dioxide. But if drained, they exude centuries' worth of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing towards global warming. \n\nAfter World War II, huge quantities of wetland were converted into profitable farmland. Nearly half of all peatlands in Europe are degraded, mostly due to artificial drainage - causing a toll on the environment.\n\nEU countries reported 124 million tons of greenhouse gas pollution from drained peatlands in 2022, close to the annual emissions of the Netherlands. Some scientists say even this is an underestimate.\n\nThat's why the bloc is prioritising restoring 30 percent of degraded peatlands over the next five years, and 50 percent by 2050 - to slow climate change, promote biodiversity, and now, ready border nations for potential war with Russia.\n\nAs part of Poland's £1.9 billion Eastern Shield development project for defence infrastructure, swamplands and forests close to its borders with Russia will be expanded.\n\n'The natural environment in the border areas is an obvious ally of any actions enhancing the elements of Eastern Shield,' a spokesman for Poland’s ministry of defence said. \n\nOn top of plans to expand swampland to deter Putin's troops, this summer the country added protective minefields to a 20-kilometre stretch of land bordering Russia and Belarus. The size of the armed forces stood at about 190,000 personnel at the end of last year, including ground, air, naval, special forces and territorial defence forces. Poland plans to increase this to 300,000 troops within a few years.\n\n'Drained peatland makes up 10 percent of Finland’s agricultural land, but it produces more than half of the agricultural greenhouse gas emissions,' Kristiina Lang, a research professor and peat specialist at the Natural Resources Institute of Finland told France24. \n\nIn Finland, there are some obvious locations that could be considered for large-scale rewetting, such as swathes of land drained for forestry that failed to grow any trees. \n\n'It's very logical to wet these large areas again,' Lang said. 'And if we need to rewet part of our peatlands anyway, then why not close to the eastern border?'\n\nScientists argue that restoring bogs on NATO's eastern flank would be a relatively cheap and effective measure to achieve EU climate targets and defence goals in one fell swoop.\n\nBut there are environmental downsides and complications associated with the plan to revive Europe's swamps. For one, people with privately-owned land in areas that have been earmarked for rewetting will be opposed to the move. \n\nMoreover, when Ukraine flooded the Irpin basin in a desperate attempt at defence, it was hugely ecologically destructive in the nearby residential areas, and the release of sewage and heavy metals harmed the environment.\n\nGovernments in the Baltic states which share a 600-mile border with Russia and Belarus have shown little interest in the project so far, apart from Lithuania, which said defence-linked wetland restoration 'is currently under discussion', according to Politico.\n\nThe Baltic country has recently revealed plans to dig a 30-mile-wide ribbon of defences on its borders with Russia and Belarus that will include minefields and bridges set to blow up in case Moscow invades.\n\nFor the past year, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been fortifying their borders, adding obstacles and redoubts to existing fences amid Russia's mounting aggression.\n\nWhen complete, the Baltic defence line is estimated to be more than 940 miles long and will limit Russia's ability to launch attacks from its own territory, Kaliningrad and Belarus.\n\nLithuania, in particular, began setting up dozens of so-called 'engineering parks' filled with 'counter-mobility' equipment.\n\nThese initially included razor wire, concrete roadblocks, Czech Hedgehogs (a type of anti-tank barrier), as well as dragon's teeth (concrete pyramids).\n\nBut Lithuania has now said that it is looking to further layer its defences, stretching them wide enough to protect Vilnius, the capital. Lithuania's border with Kaliningrad and Belarus is over 590 miles long. \n\nThe new ribbon will be made of three layers. The first, estimated to be three miles wide, will begin with an anti-tank ditch next to the border fence. This will then be followed by an embankment, strips of dragon's teeth and minefields, and then two layers of strongpoints for defending infantry.\n\nThe second and third layers will see bridges primed with explosives that can be detonated at will, as well as more lines of infantry. \n\nEstonia approved a four-year €2.8 billion (£2.4 billion) additional defence funding bill earlier this year, pushing the Baltic country to an average defence spending of 5.4 per cent of GDP through to 2029.\n\nMerz told a conference of Germany's ambassadors that 'we are experiencing daily and with increasing intensity hybrid Russian attacks, including on our infrastructure' and pointed to Moscow's 'provocations in the North and Baltic Seas'.\n\nGermany has been Ukraine's second-biggest supplier of military aid since Russia's invasion began in 2022 and has been on high alert for sabotage plots directed from Moscow.\n\nMerz has moved to ramp up Germany's defence capacities in the face of Trump's questioning of the future strength of the transatlantic alliance and wants Germany to have Europe's 'strongest conventional army'.\n\n'We have historic tasks,' Merz said on Monday, namely 'building a new security architecture which should last for several decades to come'.\n\n'What we referred to as the liberal world order is under pressure from many sides, including within the political West,' he said.\n\n'A new conflict between systems has broken out between liberal democracies and an axis of autocracies.'\n\nThe EU this year launched a broad readiness push to bolster its militaries and try to ensure it can defend itself by 2030.\n\n'The goal is very simple to make sure that essential supplies that keep our societies running, especially the ones that save lives, are always available,' EU crisis management commissioner Hadja Lahbib said. \n\nMeanwhile, French hospitals have been ordered to make preparations for an imminent war. \n\n'Among the risks identified is the hypothesis of a major engagement where the health issue would consist of taking care of a potentially high influx of victims from abroad,' the ministry of health said in a statement. \n\n'It is therefore a question for our health system of anticipating the care of military patients in the civilian health system'. \n\nBritain, despite having more recent memory of armed conflicts than many of its allies on the continent, has fallen behind in civil planning. \n\nIn November, the chief of the UK defence staff said that Britain simply does not have 'some of the civil aspects or planning aspects' that other allies have 'as part of their traditions'. \n\nAdmiral Sir Tony Radakin told the Berlin security conference that 'we are having those conversations to learn from our colleagues and see what might be appropriate for ourselves'.\n\nOther countries are more prepared. In November last year, Sweden announced that it would be sending out five million pamphlets to its population just north of 10 million, urging preparedness for the possibility of a lasting conflict.\n\nNATO chief Mark Rutte sounded the alarm in July about a major conflict that he anticipates would be started by simultaneous invasions from Xi and Putin.\n\nHe claimed that combined attacks from the Russian and Chinese leaders would trigger a World War nightmare and bring the planet to the brink of Armageddon.\n\nAccording to the NATO chief, China would start by seeking to grab Taiwan - while ensuring the Kremlin dictator simultaneously attacks NATO territory, amid fears Putin is eyeing the Baltic republics.\n\nBritain could send fighter jets to bolster NATO's air defence over Poland after Russian drones were shot down over the eastern European country.\n\nDefence Minister Healey said that 300 UK armed forces personnel are stationed in Poland at the present time, and until July, the UK also had six RAF Typhoon jets over the country, as part of NATO's air policing responsibilities. Following the drone incursion, he said he asked the Armed Forces 'to look at options to bolster NATO's air defence over Poland'.\n\nRAF jets were not involved in shooting down Russian drones in Poland's airspace, but NATO secretary Rutte has said the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and Germany played a major role.\n\nSpeaking at PMQs earlier today, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: 'I've been in touch with the Polish Prime Minister this morning to make clear our support for Poland, and will stand firm in our support for Ukraine with our partners, and through our leadership of the coalition of the willing, we will continue to ramp up the pressure on Putin until there's a just and lasting peace.' \n\nShocking images show the devastation inside a Polish home torn apart after being struck by a Russian drone. The roof has been completely destroyed, leaving a gaping hole that exposes the rooms below to the sky.\n\nThe owners survived by sheer luck, but had they been inside at the time, their deaths could have triggered NATO’s Article 5 and brought Europe to all-out war.\n\nThe collective defence clause treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, raising the terrifying prospect of major conflict.","summary":"Poland's prime minister condemned the violation of the country's airspace, saying: 'This situation brings us all closer to open conflict, closer than at any time since the Second World War .'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15084723/europe-plan-stop-putin-floods-borders-new-defences.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/09/11/101969139-0-image-m-21_1757412344884.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/10/8591439336208221242/1024x576_MP4_8591439336208221242.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:39:32","author":"Editor,Imogen Garfinkel","authors":["Editor","Imogen Garfinkel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.035},{"id":359392370,"title":"Charlie Kirk's brave final words before he was assassinated in Utah","text":"Ring-wing influencer Charlie Kirk eerily spoke about gun violence seconds before he was shot dead at a Utah Valley University rally. \n\nThe conservative activist, 31, was assassinated while taking questions from the crowd at the Orem college on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nA member of the spirited audience stepped up to the microphone to debate Kirk, who was sitting under a tent, on the matter of mass shootings. \n\n'Do you know many transgender Americans have been shooters over the last 10 years?' the challenging audience member asked. \n\nIn response, the political influencer asserted, 'too many,' as the crowd roared. \n\nThe same person told Kirk the number is five, following up to ask if Kirk knew 'how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years.'\n\n'Counting or not counting gang violence?' Kirk asked. These would be his last words. \n\nHis answer was cut off when the single gun shot rang and struck him - sending terror through the masses as blood spilled from his neck while he tipped back in his chair. \n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Kirk had died as few hours later. \n\n'The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie,' the president wrote on Truth Social. \n\nThe FBI has detained the alleged shooter, according to Director Kash Patel. \n\n'Thank you to the local and state authorities in Utah for your partnership with [the FBI],' he wrote.\n\nUtah Governor Spencer Cox has also confirmed that a 'person of interest' is in custody and is being questioned by authorities.\n\nGeorge Zinn, 71, was arrested immediately after Kirk was shot, but investigators ruled he was not the assassin. He was booked on obstruction of justice. \n\nAuthorities have deemed the tragic event a 'political assassination' and believe the suspect acted alone. \n\nOfficials said the fatal shot was fired from the top of the Losee Center, about 200 feet away from where Kirk was speaking. \n\nKnown for his fierce pro-Trump stances, traditional values and lively debates at college campuses across the country, Kirk was visiting UVU as a part of his American Comeback Tour. \n\nA petition trying to bar Kirk from the school garnered more than 7,000 signatures. \n\nThe Turning Point USA founder spoke out against rampant crime and denounced mass shootings while maintaining his pro-Second Amendment stance.\n\nHe has spoken about the divisive subject in depth over the years, discussing how he believes the mass shooting crisis could be tackled while preserving the right to bear arms. \n\n'We should have an honest and clear reductionist view of gun violence, but we should not have a utopian one,' Kirk said at a May 2023 Turning Point USA event. \n\n'You will never live in a society where you have an armed citizenry and not a single gun death. That is nonsense, it's drivel. \n\n'But I think it's worth it. I think it's worth to have a cost of unfortunately some gun deaths every single year, so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God given rights.' \n\nHis comments on the matter came about one week after three children and three adults were killed by a shooter at the Christian Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nIn May 2022, Kirk spoke out against a shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, which left 19 children and two adults dead. \n\nHe called the massacre an 'act of evil' during an episode of his podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show. \n\n'There’s moments in time. And there are stories that happen where you just take a pause and the evil that is committed is just so overwhelming,' he said. \n\n'It almost like ruins your day and it just impacts everything you do. And it kind of dominates the conversation for the time being between your friends and family members.'\n\nKirk was known for fostering discussions and debates, especially among America's youth and young adults. \n\nHe was never one to shy away from controversy, with many clips of his fiery run-ins with liberal college students going viral online. \n\nThe Trump ally's death has sent shock waves through the nation, with prominent political figures across party lines speaking highly of the commentator and denouncing acts of politically-driven violence. \n\n'This is a dark day for our state, it’s a tragic day for our nation,' Republican Governor Cox said. \n\n'I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination.' \n\nOne of the first Democrats to speak out against the atrocity was California Governor Gavin Newsom, who once invited Kirk on his show, This is Gavin Newsom Podcast. \n\n'The attack on Charlie Kirk is disgusting, vile, and reprehensible. In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in EVERY form.' \n\nKirk leaves behind his wife Erika Frantzve, with whom he had a three-year-old daughter and a son, 16 months. \n\nIn honor of the passionate podcast host, Trump declared that all American Flags across the nation will be lowered to Half Mast until Sunday evening.","summary":"Charlie Kirk shared a final sentiment tackling a controversial topic just as he was assassinated at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15086277/Charlie-Kirks-final-words-assassinated-Utah-dead.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/11/00/102025201-0-image-m-31_1757546961530.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/10/7500015732182368874/1024x576_MP4_7500015732182368874.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:37:01","author":"Editor,Sonya Gugliara","authors":["Editor","Sonya Gugliara"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":359392362,"title":"Video captures figure lying in wait and then fleeing rooftop after Charlie Kirk shooting as local police under fire for security blunders","text":"Haunting video has revealed a figure lying flat on a rooftop just moments before Charlie Kirk was fatally shot - then frantically fleeing as chaos erupted at the Utah event. \n\nThe chilling footage surfaces as witnesses claim there were no security measures in place at the Utah Valley University event, where 31-year-old Kirk was speaking on Wednesday afternoon. \n\nThe conservative commentator was struck in the neck by a single bullet while addressing the crowd about mass shootings.\n\nAn elderly man was initially taken into custody by police following the shooting but was later released after being confirmed not to be the gunman. \n\nHours afterward, a second 'person of interest' was detained, however, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed to X that this individual was also released after interrogation -meaning the manhunt for the shooter continues. \n\nSecurity protocols and local police at the event are now facing fierce backlash as haunting footage emerges of an unknown figure lurking on the roof. \n\n'I was expecting when I got here that I'd have to pass through some kind of security, but that just wasn't a thing,' witness Tyler McGettigan told NBC News.\n\nMcGettigan arrived at the event equipped with a valid ticket featuring a scannable code, yet remarkably, his ticket went unchecked as he entered the amphitheater where Kirk was scheduled to speak. \n\n'No one checked the barcode or the QR code,' he told the outlet. 'There was no checkpoint to get in. It was literally anyone could walk in if they wanted.' \n\nJustin Hickens, who said he was about 20 yards from the shooting, told NBC there were no metal detectors at the event entrance. The only security he observed was a small group of personnel stationed near Kirk himself. \n\nAnother attendee, Raydon Dechene, echoed concerns about the minimal security, noting that there were no bag checks - a detail that 'felt off' to him, as reported by CNN.\n\nDespite a crowd of over 3,000 attendees, only six officers were on duty, according to University Police Chief Jeff Long.\n\nDuring a press conference, Long described the event as taking place 'in kind of a bowl area here on the central campus,' where Kirk was positioned in a lower section surrounded by buildings. \n\nIn addition to Kirk’s personal security team, plainclothes police officers were already present within the crowd.\n\n'We trained for these things. And you think you have things covered. And these things, unfortunately, they happen. You try to get your bases covered,' Long said. 'And unfortunately, today we didn’t, and because of that, we had this tragic incident.' \n\nIn the new video footage shared on X, a figure is seen lying flat and motionless on the roof of the Losee Center - roughly 200 yards from Kirk - just moments before the shot rang out. \n\nAnother video shared to X, captured in the moments after the shooting from what appears to be inside a campus building, pans across the room - and in a brief moment, an individual can be seen sprinting across the same rooftop. \n\nThe only footage of the suspect came from campus CCTV, which authorities immediately began analyzing.\n\n'We do have that we're analyzing it, but it is security camera footage, so you can kind of guess what the quality of that is,' Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said. \n\n'We do know dressed in all dark clothing. We don't have much better description,' he added.\n\nJust after 12pm, Kirk was answering his second question on the topic of mass shootings - specifically, whether he knew how many had involved a transgender shooter. \n\nHe responded and began to take another question - but before he could answer, a shot rang out. \n\n'We just saw Charlie Kirk’s neck turn to the side and it appeared that he had been shot in the neck,' reporter Emma Pitts told The Guardian. 'There was blood, immediately a lot of blood.'\n\nThe father-of-two, known for his fierce MAGA views and thrilling debates with college kids across the country, collapsed immediately after being hit by gunfire.\n\nStudents at the event were seen running and screaming in shock after witnessing the bloody scene unfold in front of their eyes. \n\nZachary Morris, who attended the event with his 3-year-old daughter, described a wave of confusion followed by 'mass panic' in the crowd the moment the shot was fired.\n\n'All I could think was that I gotta get my daughter out of there,' the father told the NYT.\n\nSara Tewell, a student at Utah Valley University, told ABC News: 'Blood was gushing everywhere.' \n\n'A friend and I ran into a building and ran out and down the street just trying to get to safety,' she added. \n\nConservative activist Greg Adams was also at the event, seated at ground level near the back of the crowd when he heard the single deadly shot - and described the gory aftermath as nothing short of shocking. \n\n'I went down to where he was sitting afterwards. There was blood all over the area,' Adams told Daily Mail. 'You can see all the blood that was pooled and the scatter from around the shot.'\n\nAdams also told the outlet that he believes the shooter 'staged themselves' in or on a building to secure a clear shot. \n\n'It would be hard for them to just pull a rifle out and get a steady shot off from a crowded walkway,' he added. \n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Kirk’s death on Truth Social nearly five hours hours later, offering his sympathies to his wife and family.\n\n'The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,' Trump wrote. 'No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.'\n\n'He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us,' he added. \n\nAmid the chaos that followed, a suspect was almost immediately apprehended at the scene - only to be later cleared, as the real shooter remained at large, triggering a frantic manhunt involving four law enforcement agencies. \n\nThe elderly man detained at the scene was identified as George Zinn, but he was later ruled out as matching the shooter’s description, according to NBC. \n\nReports suggested that Zinn made remarks about the shooting as he was being detained, while separate footage showed him repeatedly urging the crowd to 'shoot him.'\n\n'How dare you, you f***ing monster!' one yelled as Zinn walked away with his trousers down. \n\nStudent Sawyer Carr, 18, told the Daily Mail that Zinn was seated just a few rows behind him at the event and claimed that Zinn took responsibility immediately after the shooting.\n\n'He claimed he did it. He started yelling it. But he didn’t even have a gun,' Carr said.\n\n'He was only a few rows behind me,' he added. 'It definitely wasn’t him. He didn’t have anything on him.'\n\nDuring a later press conference, Utah Governor Spencer Cox confirmed that while Zinn was cleared as the shooter, he was still charged with obstructing justice. \n\nAdams, who organizes for the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, said that Zinn had previously volunteered for him and described him as a 'nice guy.'\n\n'He’s really active in everything, conservative and libertarian events,' he told Daily Mail. 'He’s a nice guy. I’ve never had any issue with him.' \n\nThen, on Wednesday evening, FBI Director Patel revealed that authorities have taken a person of interest into custody. \n\n'The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,' Patel wrote to X.\n\nDuring a press conference, Utah Governor Spencer Cox reiterated that authorities did have 'a person of interest in custody, who is being interviewed right now.'\n\n'I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination,' Cox said, though he did not disclose how he determined the suspected shooter’s motive. \n\nCox also stated that there was no evidence indicating the involvement of a second shooter.\n\nBut just over an hour after news of the second suspect was made public, Patel revealed that the individual had been released.\n\n'The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement,' he wrote to X. 'Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency.","summary":"Haunting video revealed a figure lying flat on a rooftop just moments before Charlie Kirk was fatally shot - then frantically fleeing as chaos erupted at the Utah event.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15086283/Video-captures-figure-fleeing-rooftop-charlie-Kirk-shooting-police-fire-security.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/11/00/102025519-0-image-m-20_1757547857038.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:36:46","author":"Editor,Josh Boswell,Kelly Garino","authors":["Editor","Josh Boswell","Kelly Garino"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":359391914,"title":"World News | French President Macron Meets Qatari Emir, Reiterates His Commitment to Sovereignty of Qatar After Israeli Strikes","text":"Paris [France], September 11 (ANI): French President Emmanuel Macron met Qatari Prime Minister Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and strongly condemned the Israeli airstrikes in Doha, Qatar, saying the attacks were \"unacceptable\" and warning against the spread of the Gaza conflict to the broader region on Wednesday.

However, the group confirmed that its negotiating delegation survived.Among those killed were the son of Hamas' chief negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya and the director of his office. A Qatari security official also reportedly died in the attack, CNN reported.\nAs per CNN, the strikes hit West Bay Lagoon, a high-end residential district in Doha where, according to Qatar's foreign ministry, members of Hamas' political bureau had been residing. At the time of the strike, Hamas said its representatives were reviewing a US-backed ceasefire proposal. While Al-Hayya was believed to be the main target, he was not among the dead.\nFollowing the strike, Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the attack, calling it a \"cowardly\" and \"criminal assault\" that violated international laws and norms.\nThe Ministry stated that the strike posed a serious threat to the safety of Qatari citizens and residents and emphasised that such actions were a blatant violation of Qatar's sovereignty and security.\n\"The State of Qatar strongly condemns the cowardly Israeli attack that targeted residential buildings housing several members of the Political Bureau of Hamas in the Qatari capital, Doha.

Instead, Iryna Zarutska met a brutal fate that she wouldn't have even expected from the Russians.\n\nThe young, beautiful and kind-hearted blonde who loved animals and dreamed of becoming a veterinary assistant had found a job in a pizza parlour in Charlotte, North Carolina, after emigrating with her mother and two siblings in 2022.\n\nAccording to her family, she was a 'gifted and passionate artist' who'd 'quickly embraced her new life in the United States'.\n\nThen, on a Friday evening last month, she was returning home by train after a work shift when a deranged homeless man sitting right behind her pulled out a pocketknife and savagely stabbed her in the neck repeatedly.\n\nCCTV footage from the light railway carriage showed her killer suddenly standing up, entirely unprovoked, then slashing the slightly-built refugee three times as she sat engrossed in her phone.\n\nIt shows the immediate aftermath of the six-second attack as – pulling up her legs to protect herself – she cowered away from the man in confusion and abject terror. \n\nAs he walked casually away, removing his blood-stained hoodie before getting off the train, fellow passengers tried to help the slumped Ms Zarutska but she was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe bleak poignancy of her story – Iryna's father cannot even attend her funeral as he is in Ukraine – and the horrific randomness of the violence displayed in the video has appalled millions across the world. \n\nThe level of outrage the murder has provoked makes many believe it may signal a turning point in America's handling of violent criminals.\n\nThe August 22 killing has also become a major political issue after President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans blamed her death on the Democratic Party's obsession with criminal justice reforms, which allow violent offenders to repeatedly walk free and continue to commit crime.\n\nOther critics, including Elon Musk, have turned on the US media which they accuse of ignoring Ms Zarutska's murder because she's white and her alleged killer, Decarlos Brown Jr, is black.\n\nBrown is just the sort of repeat offender who has flourished under Democrat-controlled Charlotte's 'cashless bail' rules – now adopted in 'blue' cities across the US – that allow judges to free alleged criminals without making them put up bail.\n\nThe 34-year-old suspect, who according to his family suffers from mental health issues, has previously been arrested and released at least 14 times. Most of the charges, which included robbery with a dangerous weapon and threatening behaviour, were later dropped.\n\nHe served five years in prison for armed robbery, after which he went to live with his mother. She says he is a diagnosed schizophrenic who never should have been at large but insists she had to turn him out of her home when he became unstable and psychotic.\n\nShe had tried to get him sectioned in a psychiatric institution.\n\nHe'd been free to roam at will on a 'written promise' to the court that he would return for his next hearing – after being arrested for making a false 911 emergency call in January. \n\nBrown's father and older brother had both been imprisoned for violent crimes. His brother, Stacey, is serving 27 to 36 years in prison for murdering a 65-year-old man during a 2014 robbery.\n\nHis sister Tracey told the Daily Mail she had tried to get Brown admitted to hospital several times over the past few years, as his mental health crumbled, but doctors kept discharging him after just 24 hours.\n\nShe shared a recording of her phone conversation with him in jail – in which he told her the government had implanted 'materials' in his brain which 'stabbed the lady'.\n\nRepublicans, however, are less impressed by the accused's mental health problems and more concerned about protecting innocent victims like Iryna Zarutska. \n\nTo drive home this point, Trump's Department of Justice has charged Brown with a federal crime, causing death on a mass transportation system, which makes him eligible for the death penalty.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi said the department would seek the maximum penalty and that he would 'never again see the light of day as a free man'.\n\nShe said that Ms Zarutska's 'horrific murder is a direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people'. Some have noted online that Iryna was the only white person sitting in Brown's vicinity on the train but he has not been charged with a hate crime.\n\nIt was on Monday that Trump stepped into the growing furore over the killing when he branded the murderer a 'lunatic' and called for the US to do more to confront 'evil people' and violent crime.\n\nHe attacked the 'cashless bail' system, which he wants to end across the US, and blamed his political opponents in North Carolina for the death, saying 'her blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail'.\n\nThe White House published an accompanying statement, saying the fatal attack was the consequence of politicians, prosecutors and judges who are 'prioritising woke agendas'.\n\nThis is a familiar complaint of conservatives who, with some success, have painted Democrats as soft on crime – and particularly when the perpetrators are black or Hispanic.\n\nIt's also a similar belief that America's mainstream media prefers to play down ethnic-minority crime. \n\nIn the latest case, critics noted that major news outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and BBC didn't report on the murder for several weeks – despite it being covered in the state's local media and on other sites including DailyMail.com.\n\nElon Musk – a former member of Trump's administration and frequent critic of Left-wing politics on his social media platform X – joined other conservatives in contrasting the vast media coverage of Minneapolis black man George Floyd's 2020 killing by a white policeman with that of Ms Zarutska's. \n\nOthers – more relevantly – compared the media's slow response to the Zarutska murder with the uproar when a white ex-Marine, Daniel Penny, accidentally killed a mentally-disturbed black homeless man in a chokehold after he threatened passengers in a New York subway car in 2023. \n\nLast December, a Manhattan court acquitted Penny of homicide.\n\nMusk reposted a comment on X giving a long list of media outlets who'd ignored the Zarutska murder but reported on Daniel Penny, the New York Times – which had topped the list and whose motto is 'All the news that's fit to print' – finally published a story.\n\nIn what appeared to be an excuse for the delay, the newspaper reported that the 'brutal killing did not capture widespread attention until the security footage was released on Friday'.\n\nHowever, opponents are not convinced. 'If Iryna were black and her killer was white, the media would be rioting non-stop,' said Benny Johnson, an American conservative podcaster who is reportedly influential with Trump. 'But because she's white, they stay silent.'\n\nCharlotte's mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, was initially criticised after she called for compassion for mentally ill people such as Brown who, she said, 'appears to have suffered a crisis'.\n\nLyles has since said the killing was 'a tragic failure by the courts and magistrates', and pledged to increase patrols and police numbers on public transportation.\n\nTrump and his allies are undoubtedly ramping up fear of crime as a weapon to beat the Democrats, but years of misguided 'progressive' policies have certainly made it easy for them.\n\nMeanwhile, Iryna's family have been left to wonder how life might have been if they'd stayed in Kyiv.\n\n'We are heartbroken beyond words,' they said in a statement on Tuesday. 'Iryna came here to find peace and safety, and instead her life was stolen from her in the most horrific way.","summary":"Iryna Zarutska was returning home by train after a work shift when a deranged homeless man sitting right behind her pulled out a pocketknife and savagely stabbed her in the neck repeatedly.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15086529/murder-white-Ukrainian-refugee-black-serial-criminal-America.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/11/00/101898425-0-image-m-44_1757547798458.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/09/2468516959614121473/1024x576_MP4_2468516959614121473.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:35:26","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":359397048,"title":"Charlie Kirk, US conservative leader and Turning Point USA founder, shot dead at 31","text":"U.S. right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk was part of a constellation of influencers who helped amplify Republican President Donald Trump's agenda, galvanizing conservative youth and rising to international prominence with often inflammatory rhetoric focused on such issues as race, gender and immigration. Kirk, an Illinois native who co-founded the conservative student group Turning Point USA at the age of 18 and went on to become a rising star in the Republican Party under Trump, had just returned to the United States from an overseas speaking tour when he was shot to death on Wednesday. He was 31 years old. The shooting came as Kirk, the president of Turning Point, was addressing a large outdoor crowd on the Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah. On Sunday, he headlined an event in Tokyo organized by the far-right Sanseito party, which made big gains in Japan's upper house election in July. He also recently spoke in South Korea. Kirk had 5.3 million followers on his X account and drew an audience of more than 500,000 monthly listeners to podcasts of his radio program, \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\" He also authored or contributed to several books, including \"Time for a Turning Point\" and \"The College Scam.\" Influence built on college campuses In addition to founding Turning Point USA in 2012 with conservative activist Bill Montgomery, Kirk launched Turning Point Action in 2019 as a non-profit advocacy group backing conservative candidates for office. Turning Point USA, an organization dedicated to advancing conservative causes on college campuses, was instrumental in driving youth support for Trump in the November 2024 election. Kirk's Turning Point events were raucous, a mix of a political rally, tent revival, rock concert and a professional wrestling match. Speakers would take the stage backed by ear-splitting anthems and bright pyrotechnics before often high-spirited crowds of thousands. \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie,\" Trump wrote on his online platform Truth Social in announcing Kirk's death. \"He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\" Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff in Kirk's honor. Kirk was provocative, taking aim at Muslim politicians, including Minneapolis mayoral candidate Omar Fateh and Islam as a whole. He expressed xenophobic views of the Islamic world and Islamic culture, pointing to Europe to make his case. He said in April, \"Islam has conquest values. They seek to take over land and territory, and Europe is now a conquered continent.\" During an August podcast episode, Kirk accused Democratic lawmaker Jasmine Crockett, who is Black, of being part of an \"attempt to eliminate the white population in this country.\" \"The great replacement of white people is far more sinister than any redistricting project,\" Kirk said. The son of a counselor at a mental-health clinic and an architect, Kirk saw his political career propelled with a 2012 op-ed he wrote for conservative media outlet Breitbart that caught the attention of Fox News, according to a February New York Times report. Fox then booked Kirk to discuss the national debt, the Times reported. That appearance led to a speech at Benedictine University, where he met Montgomery, a local Tea Party activist. Montgomery encouraged Kirk to spread his message to college campuses, and registered the name Turning Point USA for Kirk in July 2012. Kirk is survived by his wife Erika, a former Miss Arizona USA beauty pageant winner, and their two children.","summary":"Kirk was shot and killed while addressing a large outdoor crowd at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, shortly after returning from an overseas speaking tour that included events in Japan and South Korea","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syyxwcyoel","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/10/Hkh8tL1jxe/Hkh8tL1jxe_0_0_3000_2000_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:33:42","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.151},{"id":359392372,"title":"How a dossier containing this picture of Epstein and Mandelson landed on my desk and laid bare the scandal that's now engulfing ambassador, writes GUY ADAMS","text":"Towards the end of August 2019, a dossier containing previously unpublished images of Jeffrey Epstein landed on my desk.\n\nTaken by a woman drawn into Epstein's orbit during the early 2000s, they shed remarkable light on the financier's existence prior to his conviction for child sex offences in 2008.\n\nWe had shots of Jeffrey riding quad bikes on his private island, playing tennis with bikini-clad opponents on his personal court, and cavorting with Ghislaine Maxwell and various scantily-clad companions on a sun-dappled tropical veranda.\n\nThere were photos of girls relaxing at his ranch in New Mexico, swimming in his pools and walking on his white-sand beaches. \n\nOne poor youngster, who appeared to be a teenager, was standing in a guest bedroom at one of his luxury homes. A Perspex box filled with condoms could be seen on the bedside table.\n\nIt was, however, an image of a fully-clothed man that stopped me in my tracks. For the man had a very familiar face. He was the former Labour cabinet minister, Peter Mandelson.\n\nThe British politician could be seen chatting to Epstein while he tried on a white leather belt during a joint shopping trip that (according to the photo's date-stamp) had taken place at a swanky fashion boutique somewhere in the Caribbean on December 27, 2005.\n\nAll of which raised some big questions. For Mandelson's friendship with the paedophile financier had, until this point, been shrouded in mystery.\n\nWe knew that the duo had met in the 1990s and been acquainted ever since. Talk of ill-judged meetings and sleazy business deals had been doing the rounds for years.\n\nBut while a leaked copy of Epstein's 'little black book' of contacts was known to contain at least ten numbers for Mandelson, including a fax and mobile number for his Brazilian-born romantic partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva, no one was entirely sure how deep the links actually ran.\n\nPictures can tell a thousand words, however. Here, finally, was an image of the two powerful men together; and its cosy nature suggested that their relationship was far more intimate than had previously been thought.\n\nLittle wonder that the Daily Mail's decision to publish it on the front page – it hit news-stands weeks after Epstein had died in a New York prison in 2019 – made headlines around the world. \n\nFor it ignited a scandal that has been bubbling away, on and off, ever since. This week, the temperature once more rose thanks to the release of a tranche of other photographs showing Mandelson, now Britain's ambassador to Washington, fawning over the paedophile via a ten-page birthday message.\n\nIn one image, the politician wears a fluffy white bathrobe; in another he gazes out to sea in Bermuda shorts. Each of the souvenir photos, in an album created in 2003 to celebrate Epstein's 50th, carry hand-written captions in which he dubs the sex offender 'my best pal', saying 'we love you!'\n\nReleased by Democrats in US Congress, they emerged alongside tranches of fresh emails proving, crucially, that Mandelson decided to maintain a close (and at times mutually profitable) friendship with Epstein for several years following his widely-reported 2008 conviction on child sex offences.\n\nIn other words, our current man in Washington behaved in a very similar fashion to his morally-bankrupt friend Prince Andrew, whom he lobbied to make UK trade ambassador: choosing to accept hospitality and talk business with the sleazy financier while apparently ignoring his appalling crimes.\n\nMandelson even sent Epstein cheery messages, urging the warped financier to 'fight for early release,' saying 'everything can be turned into an opportunity'.\n\nAfter Epstein was released, the duo discussed business projects in a host of fantastically corrupt regions, including the Congo, Vladimir Putin's Russia and Communist China.\n\nAt one point in 2010, while serving as business secretary in Gordon Brown's Labour government, Mandelson even worked with Epstein to broker a £1 billion deal in which the taxpayer-owned bank RBS sold an energy-trading arm named Sempra to American firm JP Morgan. The whopping conflict of interest was never disclosed.\n\nThis week's at times grotesque revelations have left the politician who once famously said New Labour were 'intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich, as long as they pay their taxes' teetering on the brink of what would be a third resignation from office.\n\nLike both his previous falls from grace – one involving an undisclosed loan from Labour donor Geoffrey Robinson, the other revolving around his relations with the billionaire Hinduja brothers – it involves a comically misjudged relationship with a very wealthy man. This one stretches back decades.\n\nMandelson appears to have first met Epstein in the 1990s, around the time Prince Andrew also fell into the financier's orbit. They were introduced by Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year term for child sex trafficking. And their friendship first became public via a 2002 report in New York magazine.\n\nIt stated that the 'British Cabinet minister' had attended an intimate dinner party at Epstein's New York home alongside a motley collection of guests including Donald Trump, magician David Blaine and Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google. \n\nIt added that food had been cooked by celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito, at a cost to Epstein of $50,000. Strangely, Mandelson — then a serving MP — did not see fit to declare the expensive hospitality he received in the Commons register of interests, though he did register other events he attended during a 2002 visit to New York.\n\nNeither does he seem to have declared a free stay on Epstein's private island, Little St James, at around the same time. Details of that trip didn't emerge until 2011 when the paedophile's former housekeeper, Cathy Alexander, told an interviewer she recalled Mandelson's then boyfriend Reinaldo getting sunburned, saying he whined about it 'like a baby'.\n\nEpstein's butler, Valdson Vieira Cotrin, has also spoken of Mandelson visiting Epstein's Caribbean home – nicknamed 'paedo island' – around the same time, though he doesn't seem to have recalled meeting Reinaldo on that trip.\n\n'I remember his [Mandelson's] face and do recall travelling with that man in Mr Epstein's private jet with him from his island. We flew from Saint Thomas to New York. It was soon after I started working for Monsieur, in the early 2000s. I remember he had a trade position at the time.'\n\nIt wasn't the only hospitality Mandelson enjoyed from Epstein around this time. The financier's most high-profile victim, the late Virginia Guiffre, who was part of his domestic harem between 2000 and 2003 (and was famously photographed with Prince Andrew) once told an interviewer: 'I never heard of Jeffrey knowing Tony Blair, but he did know Peter Mandelson, I remember him [Mandelson] being at the house in New York and I was introduced to him at a dinner party.\n\n'He and Jeffrey talked business. I assumed they were in business together. I was never asked to give him [Mandelson] a massage.'\n\nWe have already discussed the 2003 birthday album and 2005 shopping trip. Fast forward to January 2007, six months after Epstein had been charged with a single count of soliciting sex with a minor. \n\nMandelson for some reason saw fit to turn up at the financier's flat in Paris, where he was photographed singing 'happy birthday' as his chum blew out the candles on a birthday cake.\n\nThen, in 2009, when Epstein was on day-release from prison, Mandelson phoned the financier to ask for help in securing a meeting with Jamie Dimon, the head of U.S. investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nAn anonymous friend later told Channel Four that Epstein had called Mandelson 'Petie', adding: 'I must say I was astonished that a British Cabinet minister at that time, probably the most powerful man other than the prime minister, was calling Jeffrey in jail to seek an appointment with a very powerful banker in New York.'\n\nMandelson has previously hired lawyers to say he has 'no memory' of making such a call. However emails later emerged proving that Epstein had invited him to stay at his £56 million townhouse on 71st Street in New York in July later that year, using the visit to get Dimon to come over for a chat.\n\n'Peter will be staying at 71st over weekend, do you want to organize either you, or you and Jamie, quiertly [sic], up to you,' read one email Epstein sent to Jes Staley, his personal banker. Come January 2010, and Epstein was orchestrating more meetings for Mandelson. \n\n'I've set up you and Peter to meet in Davos with Darling,' reads a second email he sent to Staley. 'Davos' refers to the World Economic Forum. 'Darling' was the then UK Chancellor, Alastair Darling.\n\nTwo months later, in early March, Mandelson twice visited Epstein's New York home, once more while he was under house arrest for child sex offences.\n\nThe financier's private calendar, later made public by a US court, says that on March 1, Lord Mandelson was due at 7.30pm while his personal assistant Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, referred to as 'Peter's friend', was due at 1pm.\n\nLord Mandelson had travelled to the US to give a speech at New York University. A Cabinet Office document shows he also held 'various bilaterals with senior officials' during the two-day trip, which cost taxpayers £8,628. It failed to mention his meeting with a convicted paedophile.\n\nDays later, the Labour politician emailed Epstein, again seeking help from the financier's banker, Staley: 'Can Jes send me email on issues re Dodds/Volcker.' The request appears to relate to US regulations in the wake of the financial crisis.\n\nNot long afterwards, came the 2010 election, which resulted in a hung parliament. In the aftermath, Epstein emailed Mandelson about reports suggesting he was trying to engineer a 'dramatic last-minute deal to keep Labour in office'. The billionaire told his pal: 'I like to see my suggestions come to fruition.'\n\nThe bid was, of course, in vain. But with Mandelson now out of office, and in need of gainful employment, his relationship with the wealthy child sex offender continued to blossom.\n\nIn mid-May, Epstein and Staley tried to secure him a job at Deutsche Bank ('let's talk tomorrow about petie. and deutschbank' reads one email) and in June Mandelson wrote to Epstein seeking his help in persuading JP Morgan to attend a conference in Shanghai where he was due to give a highly-paid speech praising the repressive Communist State's banking sector.\n\nBy October, Epstein was trying to persuade Staley to get his British chum a job at Cazenove, a London stockbroker ('Would it make sense to have peter have a relationship with cazenov?') while simultaneously seeking his help in arranging a deal in Moscow.\n\n'Petie is just back from Russia,' Epstein told Staley. 'When Lord Mandelson can help please let me know,' came the reply.\n\nA week later, Putin sold $59 billion of Russian state assets via a deal in which JP Morgan acted as adviser. Around the same time, Mandelson also travelled to the Congo to advise on a mining deal backed by JP Morgan, keeping Epstein and Staley briefed about his activities.\n\n2011, meanwhile, saw Mandelson again travel to Paris to see Epstein ('peter in paris with me,' Epstein wrote to Staley) and in 2012 he seems to have spent roughly five nights at Epstein's New York home. In 2013 they were exchanging messages about Israel.\n\nAnd in 2014 Mandelson agreed to be one of the 'founding citizens' of TerraMar, a now-defunct ocean charity set up by Ghislaine Maxwell with Epstein's financial support.\n\nAll these encounters happened, let us not forget, when Mandelson should have been fully aware he was pursuing a friendship with a convicted paedophile. That may explain why details were always kept from public records, which usually capture every meeting a Minister of the Crown undertakes during their official duties.\n\nWhen the inevitable happened, and the whole thing started to become public, Mandelson chose to obfuscate. For example, back in 2019, when I informed Mandelson's office that the Daily Mail had obtained the photo showing him shopping with Epstein, a 'close friend' was enlisted to deny anything untoward. \n\nThe duo barely knew each other, the Daily Mail was told, with the friend insisting they had met on 'no more than five or six occasions' over the years, and pointing out 'obviously Peter's a gay man, so one saving grace is that no one can suspect him of having slept with any of Epstein's girls'.\n\nSix years later, we now know, of course, that the 'five or six' figure was wholly untrue. Meanwhile Mandelson continues to use his sexuality to defend himself against claims of impropriety, telling a podcast last night that 'perhaps it is because I am a gay man' that he never fully twigged about his chum's predatory behaviour. \n\n'All the time I was an associate of his, I never saw the wrongdoing. I never saw any evidence of criminal activity,' he claimed. 'I never sought and nor did he offer any introductions to women in the way that allegedly he did for others… when I was associated with him those years ago, as I did with my then partner and now husband, we never, ever saw any evidence or sign of this activity, which has since come to light.'\n\nIn other words, Mandelson would like to have us believe his homosexuality somehow blindsided him to Epstein's horrific offending.\n\nIt's a bold claim, given that the high-profile billionaire was a convicted child sex offender, whose vile crimes had been widely reported, during at least five of the years Mandelson was staying at his home and pursuing business deals with him.\n\nPerhaps the 'best friend' Epstein called 'Petie' can conjure up an excuse that actually passes the sniff test in the days and weeks to come.","summary":"Towards the end of August 2019, a dossier containing previously unpublished images of Jeffrey Epstein landed on my desk.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15086565/dossier-Epstein-Mandelson-desk-scandal-GUY-ADAMS.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/11/00/101964943-0-image-m-23_1757546893655.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/10/7029245156208062895/1024x576_MP4_7029245156208062895.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:33:38","author":"Editor,Guy Adams","authors":["Editor","Guy Adams"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.11},{"id":359392364,"title":"College dropout, Christian, political provocateur: How Charlie Kirk, 31, built a grassroots movement into a $100M behemoth... and it all started with a life-altering rejection letter","text":"For once, it wasn't Charlie Kirk who was creating the controversy.\n\nHe left that to his host.\n\nIn March 2025, Kirk appeared as the first guest on California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's podcast and they parried.\n\n'Would you say no men in female sports?' Kirk pressed, flipping the script on his interviewer.\n\n'I completely agree with you on that,' conceded Newsom. 'It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair.'\n\nThe Left was outraged, upset over Newsom's admission and, perhaps more, by the way he legitimized Kirk, who had come a very long way.\n\nFrom 18-year-old college dropout, to builder of a $100 million-a-year political action group, to close ally of President Donald Trump and now - at just 31 years old - interrogator of a likely Democratic White House hopeful, the future for Kirk was, indeed, promising. \n\nBut on Wednesday, Kirk, was shot and killed while appearing at an event for his organization, Turning Point, on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.\n\nThe gathering of hundreds of students was part of his movement's 'America Comeback Tour.' A campaign for which he was always the star.\n\nThe presumed political assassination has sparked bipartisan shock and outrage - even in a country riven by political violence. \n\nThe shooting comes two days after the start of the trial of a man charged with attempting to assassinate Trump. Ryan Routh, 59, aimed a rifle at Trump through a fence at his West Palm Beach golf course in September 2024.\n\nAnd that incident followed just two months after the first attempt on Trump's life: in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet whiz past Trump's head, clipping his right, leaving the presidential candidate bloodied but defiant.\n\nKirk, a devout Christian, said at the time that Trump was saved by divine intervention, suggesting a 'gust of wind' may have 'pushed that bullet ever so slightly.' He added that 'the Holy Spirit in scripture is often associated with a gust of wind. God's hand is on Donald Trump.'\n\nOn Tuesday night, less than 24 hours before his midday appearance in Utah, Kirk, as usual, was in the midst of the action.\n\nHis latest remarks, delivered on his chart-topping conservative podcast, were being dissected by a CNN panel.\n\nKirk had claimed that a black man who fatally stabbed a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina on August 22 had been motivated by race hatred. Van Jones, a liberal CNN commentator, strongly rejected Kirk's argument, calling it 'race-mongering' and 'hate-mongering.'\n\nIn his final post on X, Kirk wrote: 'If we want things to change, it's 100% necessary to politicize the senseless murder of Iryna Zarutska because it was politics that allowed a savage monster with 14 priors to be free on the streets to kill her.'\n\nIndeed, it was Kirk's personal mission to take the rhetorical fight to his – and more recently, Donald Trump's – political opponents.\n\n'Trump won,' Doug Deason, a major Republican and Turning Point donor, told the New York Times in February. 'But would he have won it without Charlie? I don't know.'\n\nFor his part, Kirk wasn't bashful about claiming credit for his work.\n\n'High school boys are the most conservative that they have been in the last 50 years,' he told a room of political backers at Turning Point's annual donor meeting in December.\n\nThe 2024 exit polls, he pointed out, showed that compared with 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had lost up to 24 percentage points of support among voters under 30 in six of seven swing states.\n\n'The youth vote won Trump the White House,' Kirk boasted.\n\nThough, perhaps surprisingly, Kirk was initially on the fence about Donald Trump.\n\nAs late as the Republican National Convention in 2016, Kirk was quoted saying that he 'was not the world's biggest Donald Trump fan.' He was won, he says, by the younger generation of Trumps - Don Jr, Eric and Lara Trump – who saw the articulate and passionate youngster's potential and working to bring the then-22-year-old into the fold.\n\n'I traveled the country for about 70 days straight carrying Donald Trump Jr.'s bags and getting his Diet Cokes,' Kirk told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in February 2019. 'Helping book flights and taking pictures and coordinating media, essentially being the youth director of the campaign and also being Don Jr.'s body man.'\n\nThe president also took note. He began to see Kirk as the voice of a pro-Trump generation, and a vital link to younger voters.\n\nKirk's passions - backing conservative Christian values; raging against the indoctrination of students and DEI initiatives - fed into Trump's own policy platform.\n\nIt was Kirk who first coined the term 'China Virus' to describe COVID-19; a term Trump would co-opt with great relish. And Trump regularly retweeted Kirk's musings and invited the young activist to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.\n\nKirk, in turn, transformed his proximity to the president into a media and activism powerhouse. He published five books, and launched his own podcast and YouTube channel, which has 3.8 million subscribers.\n\nBorn to a mental health counselor mother and architect father in the northwestern suburb of Arlington Heights, Kirk always said his family was conservative, but not particularly political.\n\nA young Kirk was an Eagle Scout, and dreamed of getting into West Point, the US military academy which trains officers.\n\nIn a 2015 speech to the Conservative Forum of Silicon Valley, he said getting into the Army was his 'No. 1 dream in life', but that he was passed over in favor of 'a far less-qualified candidate of a different gender and a different persuasion.'\n\nThe rejection appears to have been pivotal: around that time, in 2012, he wrote an opinion piece for the right-wing website Breitbart railing against the indoctrination of teenagers by liberal textbooks.\n\nKirk then enrolled at Harper College, a community college in the Chicago suburbs, but dropped out on the encouragement of Bill Montgomery, a conservative businessman who became Kirk's mentor, and with whom Kirk co-founded Turning Point in 2012 at the age of 18.\n\nKirk took TPUSA, as it became known, and grew it into a machine focused on 'freedom, free markets, and limited government.'\n\nAlong the way, he made powerful friends and courted deep-pocketed allies: Foster Friess, an evangelical Christian businessman, gave TPUSA its first mega donation, with Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus's foundation soon opening its checkbook.\n\nThe DeVos family - relatives of Trump's first education secretary Betsy DeVos - donated heavily, and wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, Ginni Thomas, sat on TPUSA's board.\n\nIn 2016 the two nonprofit entities, Turning Point USA and the political-action organization Turning Point Action, reported a total revenue of $4.3 million: by 2023, that had rocketed to $92.4 million.\n\nSuch was Kirk's power that, at the inauguration in January, a Daily Beast reporter tweeted: ''Charlie Kirk has better seats than every member of Congress. Tells you how little Trump thinks of Congress,' one GOP lawmaker tells me.'\n\nSenator Jim Banks, a Republican of Indiana, replied 20 minutes later: 'Charlie Kirk has done more than most members of congress combined to get us to this point today.'\n\nKirk leaves behind his wife, former beauty queen Erica Frantzve Kirk, 36, whom he married in May 2021 – and their two children, a three-year-old daughter and a 16-month-old son.","summary":"From college dropout to builder of a $100 million-a-year political action group, to close ally to Trump and interrogator of a likely Democratic White House hopeful.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15086671/Charlie-Kirk-shot-killed-turning-point.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/11/01/102026573-0-image-a-35_1757550553966.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:33:16","author":"Editor,Harriet Alexander","authors":["Editor","Harriet Alexander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":359393300,"title":"‘Nothing short of horrific’: Mass. politicians react to fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk","text":"Massachusetts politicians denounced political violence after right-wing activist and MAGA ally Charlie Kirk was fatally shot Wednesday during a political event at a Utah college.\n\n“Violence has no place in our politics — ever,” Gov.

Around 3,000 people were attending. Officials said the shot appeared to come from a nearby building about 100 to 200 yards away.Kirk’s private security rushed him to the hospital, but he did not survive. He founded Turning Point USA when he was only 18. He became known for campus debates and was a close ally of US President Donald Trump. After his death, Trump posted online:“The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.”Utah Governor Spencer Cox later addressed the public. He called the attack “a political assassination” and confirmed a person of interest was in custody. He urged Americans to stop “hating” each other and condemned those who celebrated Kirk’s death.As sourced via the BBC, FBI Director Kash Patel also said a suspect had been caught. The FBI promised full resources for the investigation.Governor Cox said Kirk’s death was another sign of rising political violence in the United States.

She had prepared for it carefully, qualifying ninth.But on lap 12, a 15-car crash brought the race to an end.

It has evacuated tens of thousands of American citizens from Afghanistan. It has been designated a U.S. “major non-NATO ally.” It has even lavished a $400 million jumbo jet on President Donald Trump for use as Air Force One.\n\nNone of that protected this quiet peninsula in the Persian Gulf from coming under an Israeli aerial attack yesterday [Macau time] as it mediated U.S.-backed negotiations to end the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIsrael struck a meeting of Hamas’ exiled political leadership in Qatar’s capital of Doha, sending plumes of smoke and debris rising over a city of air-conditioned World Cup stadiums and luxury malls typically shielded by U.S. interceptor batteries.\n\nSince Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel ignited its war in Gaza, the Israeli military has targeted Hamas leaders far afield.\n\nBut while Tehran and Beirut were seen as fair game, Israel had refrained from striking Hamas’ political office in Qatar, the key mediator and U.S. ally that Israeli leadership relied on as a back channel to the Palestinian militant group.\n\nIsrael made a dangerous gamble, analysts say, poisoning Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks, sending political shock waves through the region and raising doubts about historical U.S. security guarantees for its Gulf Arab allies.\n\nIt didn’t immediately pay off for Israel: Hamas claims its senior leadership survived the strike.\n\n“This is a broader shock for the international order, raising questions about sovereignty and the free rein being given to Israel,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House. “The reliability of the United States in the Middle East will be questioned.”\n\nUS roils its alliance with Qatar\n\nQatar has long come under fire for hosting Hamas and faced rising pressure to evict its top leadership.\n\nBut it was a U.S.-supported arrangement that allowed Hamas to open its political office in Doha in 2012 as Washington sought to establish indirect lines of communication with the Palestinian militant group it designates as a terrorist organization.\n\nHosting Hamas and other armed groups, such as the Taliban, has helped Qatar carve out an influential position in global conflict mediation. Qatari officials believed that the emirate’s designation as a major U.S. non-NATO ally and its Al Udeid Air Base, regional headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, lent it security cover that would restrain Israel.\n\nIsraeli strikes shattered that illusion on Tuesday, crashing into central Doha despite all the U.S. missile batteries and radar systems tracking aerial threats from Al Udeid.\n\nThe U.S. said Israel alerted it before striking. Whatever warning the White House said it passed to Qatar was too little, too late: Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said his country was only notified as the bombs were falling.\n\nShock reverberates across Gulf Arab states\n\nThe apparent U.S. disregard for Qatari security and sovereignty rattled nerves across the sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf, which, despite past ideological disputes over Qatar’s Islamist sympathies, marshaled a strong show of unity.\n\n“The security of the Arab Gulf states is indivisible, and we stand heart and soul with the sisterly Qatar, condemning the treacherous Israeli attack,” said Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to the rulers of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAlthough the U.S. remains the only country willing to station thousands of troops across the Persian Gulf, the perception of Washington as an unreliable ally to Gulf Arab nations has grown in recent years, analysts say. The UAE and Saudi Arabia in particular have sought to diversify their relationships, growing closer to China and Russia.\n\nGulf Arab countries — with small militaries and oil-dependent economies uniquely vulnerable to shocks of any kind — now see Israel’s belligerence as a source of growing concern, even more so than Iran’s.\n\nWhile Emiratis and Saudis view political Islam as a threat and loathe Hamas, experts say they’d prefer a detente with their weakened rivals to the continuation of an ever-widening war that could trigger strikes on their soil.\n\n“The Gulf states are not secretly happy about the strikes on Hamas,” said Vakil. “They see Israel’s continued military activities as destabilizing for the region. Traditionally, Iran was the most serious threat, but now — with Iran weakened but not defeated — it’s Israel they are worried about.”\n\nIsrael’s Abraham Accords thrown into doubt\n\nThat doesn’t bode well for Israel’s ambitions to expand the so-called “Abraham Accords,” which established ties between Israel and four Arab countries, first among them the UAE and Bahrain in 2020.\n\nBefore the Israel-Hamas war, there were signs that regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia might join as well, regarding such an alliance as a bulwark against Iran and its unruly regional proxies.\n\nBut Israel has since pummeled Iran and its allies. Its devastating campaign in Gaza has ignited anger across the Arab world, prompting Saudi Arabia to revive its insistence on Palestinian statehood as a condition for normalizing ties with Israel.\n\nTuesday’s strike now dashes any lingering hopes that Israel might have of cozying up to other Arab countries, analysts say.\n\n“For all intents and purposes, normalization is dead for Gulf Arab states today,” said Dina Esfandiary, the lead Middle East analyst at Bloomberg Economics, a research group. “How do you normalize with the country that’s attacking one of your brothers?” ISABEL DEBRE","summary":"The tiny, gas-rich Gulf Arab state of Qatar hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East.

He was 31.\n\nAs Trump remade the Republican Party, Kirk embodied the party’s newfound populist conservatism in the social media age. Trump has credited Kirk with galvanizing and mobilizing the youth vote for him.\n\n“No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie,” the president wrote. “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.”\n\nKirk’s sudden death Wednesday sent shockwaves across the political spectrum, with Republicans and Democrats calling for an end to political violence at a time of heightened concern about deadly attacks and the targeting of public officials.\n\nLast year, a gunman attempted to assassinate Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. In April, a man was arrested in connection with an arson at the Pennsylvania governor’s house as Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family slept inside. In June, a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were assassinated in their home.\n\nKirk, himself a college dropout, was influential with college students and young voters — not only in helping to elect Trump to the presidency but also to inspire a new movement of conservative activists. His involvement began in the wake of the tea party movement and grew with Trump’s ascendance.\n\nHaving co-founded Turning Point in 2012 at the age of 18, Kirk was a prominent supporter of Trump who courted young voters and used his network of nonprofits to seek to turn out voters on campuses and churches for Trump in 2024.\n\nKirk frequently traveled to college campuses, speaking and taking questions from audience members in exchanges that often led to viral videos. Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley University on Wednesday was the first of a 14-city fall “American Comeback Tour.” He was answering a question about mass shootings when gunfire rang out.\n\nAmong those in attendance was former US Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican. He said on Fox News he was at the event with his wife, daughter and son-in-law. He said Kirk “came out, he was throwing hats, riling up the crowd.”\n\n“I was watching Charlie. I can’t say that I saw blood. I can’t say that I saw him get hit, but I did see him fall immediately backwards into his left,” he said.\n\nThe American Comeback Tour had Kirk’s signature “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where he would urge those who disagreed with him to debate an issue.\n\nKirk traveled with a private security contingent, a Turning Point USA aide traveling on the tour told CNN, whether he was speaking to large rallies like the one in Orem, Utah, or at smaller events.\n\nThe president and dozens of other Kirk allies – as well as Democrats who had sharp disagreements with him – posted calls for prayer online in the wake of the shooting.\n\nKirk most recently appeared in the Oval Office in May, attending the swearing-in ceremony of Judge Jeanine Pirro as US attorney for Washington, DC.\n\nKirk argued Trump was saving the American dream\n\nKirk was known for debating college students about abortion rights, which he opposed; climate change, which he downplayed; and transgender rights, which he rejected. He frequently sought to rally young people around traditional gender roles. He also backed Trump’s mass deportation efforts.\n\nKirk spoke at the last three Republican conventions. In 2024, he said that marriage and home ownership were elusive for too many young Americans, and faulted former President Joe Biden.\n\n“Under Biden, our young people own nothing and they are miserable. Donald Trump refuses to accept this fake, pathetic, mutilated version of the American dream,” he said. “Donald Trump is on a rescue mission to revive your birthright, one your grandparents and those before them gave everything to hand down to you.”\n\nKirk was an outspoken advocate for gun rights.\n\nAt an April 2023 Turning Point USA Faith event, he said that “you will never live in a society when you have an armed citizenry and you won’t have a single gun death.”\n\nBut, Kirk added, “I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.”\n\nHaving once advocated for the separation of church and state, Kirk embraced more religious themes in recent years and often spoke about politics in apocalyptic terms.\n\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2020, he praised Trump for understanding “the seven mountains of cultural influence” — a reference to a Christian nationalist movement that calls on believers to exert influence in government, media, education, business, arts and entertainment, family and religion.\n\nOn the campaign trail with Trump in Georgia last year, Kirk referred to the contest against then-Vice President Kamala Harris as “a spiritual battle” and said the election was “civilizational defining.”\n\n“These next 12 days will define the future of our republic,” he said in the late October rally. “The forces of darkness have tried everything they possibly can.”\n\nHe started in politics as a teenager\n\nKirk got his first experience in politics as a student at Wheeling High School in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, when he volunteered for the winning 2010 Senate campaign of Republican former Sen. Mark Kirk.\n\nHe earned national attention in 2012 when, as a high school senior, he wrote in Breitbart News that high school students were being indoctrinated by liberal textbooks. He briefly attended Harper College, but dropped out to become a full-time conservative activist, and went on to argue that college is unnecessary for many people.\n\nKirk and retired businessman and conservative activist Bill Montgomery co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012. The two had met when Kirk was 18, at a speaking engagement at Benedictine University that followed his Breitbart piece. The organization was quickly backed by a roster of major Republican donors, including Foster Friess.\n\nHe went on to become a best-selling author and well-known media personality who hosted a daily three-hour show.\n\nIn 2021, Kirk married Erika Frantzve, with whom he shared two young children.\n\nPeople who knew Kirk described him as an intense thinker with an analytic mind.\n\nHe was seen as understanding the pulse of the young conservative movement and the “Make America Great Again” base. He had a direct line to Trump and could count on the president valuing his opinion even if they disagreed.\n\nRepublicans had floated the idea of Kirk eventually running for office in Arizona, which his group worked to flip back to Trump’s column last year.\n\nHe reveled in debating people with whom he disagreed – with video of his fights with liberals often being shared by both sides in the argument – and believed he could change minds through conversation, something his allies and fans noted Wednesday.\n\n“If you actually watch Charlie’s events — as opposed to the fake summaries — they are one of the few places with open and honest dialogue between left and right,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

And we must pick up the baton where Charlie left it, fighting for the things he believed in so passionately.”\n\nThe Reagan Foundation said a new date for Shapiro’s library event would be announced in the future.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Shapiro was set to appear at the library to discuss his new book, \"Lions and Scavengers: The True Story of America (and Her Critics),\" on Wednesday night","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/10/reagan-foundation-cancels-ben-shapiro-speaking-event-after-fatal-shooting-of-charlie-kirk/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2188244111.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:11:05","author":"Gqlshare,Kristy Hutchings","authors":["Gqlshare","Kristy Hutchings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.082},{"id":359393036,"title":"South Korea asks US to let detained workers leave without handcuffs","text":"WASHINGTON: South Korea asked its ally the United States on Wednesday (Sep 10) to allow hundreds of Korean workers to leave the country quickly and without handcuffs after they were detained in an immigration raid on a Hyundai construction site in the state of Georgia.\n\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun made the request at a White House meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n\"Cho strongly requested the special attention and support of the US administration so that detained Koreans can leave the US quickly without physical restriction by handcuffs, etc., as they are not criminals,\" South Korea's foreign ministry said.\n\nAbout 300 South Koreans were arrested last week along with 175 others at the site of the US$4.3 billion Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution project to build batteries for electric cars in Georgia.\n\nSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency reported the South Korean workers will leave the detention centre early on Thursday by bus and depart the US on a chartered plane that had been flown to pick them up around noon that day, after a delay.\n\nIt cited an unnamed source familiar with the matter.\n\nCho proposed South Korea and the US discuss creating a new visa category to prevent future issues, South Korea's foreign ministry said.

But the U.S.-brokered peace deal they were meeting to consider is almost certainly dead.\n\nThe diplomatic calculation is not difficult.\n\n“When one party bombs the negotiating team of the other party, it’s hard to see a path forward,” Dana Shell Smith, the former U.S. ambassador to Qatar, told us. Qatar, the tiny Gulf nation that has housed Hamas political leaders for years at the request of the United States, and had been the indispensable mediator in ongoing talks to end the nearly two-year-old war, was uncharacteristically livid in its condemnation of the Israeli strike. Even if peace talks continued, Qatar seems unlikely to play go-between after the Israeli missile strike on its sovereign territory.\n\n“This is terrible for regional stability, terrible for U.S. interests, and above all, terrible for the remaining hostages” Hamas holds in Gaza, Smith said.\n\nIsraeli officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to share candid assessments agreed. Although none we spoke with mourned the members of the Iranian-backed terrorist group who had potentially been killed, they failed to see the strategic benefit of an operation that all but assures the hostages will not go free anytime soon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may yet pay a political price for the operation, particularly if it did not actually kill senior Hamas leaders as intended, one senior Israeli official said.\n\nA former Mossad officer captured the sentiment among Israeli security experts, and no doubt many exhausted Israeli citizens, who are desperate for an end to the war but unsure how to find any lasting peace with Hamas: “The targets are evil. The world is a better place without them. The timing is political and stupid.”\n\nThe families of those hostages still in Gaza—alive or dead—will be left to wonder why Netanyahu took such drastic action when it appeared only days ago that negotiations might pay off. Indeed, Hamas leaders were meeting in Doha to consider the latest proposal that President Donald Trump had put on the table, which envisioned a hostage release.\n\n“Why do this when the president himself said he’s negotiating?\" asked Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen held by Hamas. “The prime minister is playing Russian roulette with the hostages.” (Israeli officials have determined that Itay was killed defending civilians near the border of Gaza on October 7, and that Hamas has possession of his remains.)\n\nOfficially, the Qatari government has not abandoned its role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas. But Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Abdulrahman al-Thani left little doubt that his government cannot view Israel as a trustworthy partner.\n\n“Stability in the region will not be achieved unless there is intense diplomacy and diplomatic work,” he said in a briefing with journalists, “and will never be achieved through wars or conflict.”\n\nPublicly, Trump has said he was “very unhappy” with the Israeli strike. Privately, U.S. officials told us, the president and his advisers were furious.\n\nThe Israeli strike “could potentially disembowel” the White House’s ongoing work on a truce, one U.S. official told us. Some of the president’s most senior aides believe that may have been Netanyahu’s exact intent. Israeli forces are poised to enter Gaza City, which Netanyahu has declared the last remaining stronghold of Hamas, and they have ordered residents to evacuate.\n\nThe week had begun with signs of progress in U.S. efforts to secure a cease-fire and a release of hostages. On Monday, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s all-purpose envoy, met in Miami with Ron Dermer, Netanyahu’s top adviser. They were joined by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a key participant in the planning for postwar Gaza. Kushner’s involvement, after months of back-and-forth with the Israelis, was intended to signal Trump’s personal interest in getting a deal, U.S. officials told us.\n\nThe same day, the Qatari prime minister joined Hamas leaders in Doha to consider Trump’s latest proposal, which involved the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for a cease-fire and an end to the Israeli military’s operations in Gaza City, among other terms.\n\nYesterday, Hamas leaders reconvened in Doha to discuss the U.S. proposal. Trump officials were confident that they could get the two sides to reach an agreement.\n\nAt midday, as Hamas officials were meeting, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine received a call from his Israeli counterpart that an attack from Israel was imminent. The U.S. would learn only minutes later that by the time Caine had received the call, the missiles were already in the air. “There was nothing we could do,” one defense official told us. “There wasn’t enough time to intercept.”\n\nCaine called the White House, which was the first time Trump officially learned about the attack, according to White House officials. Caine also called Navy Admiral Brad Cooper, the commander of U.S. Central Command, who was traveling in Egypt. By the time the two men spoke, the attack was over.\n\nPentagon officials provided conflicting accounts of when troops on the ground in Doha learned about the attack. Roughly 10,000 troops are based in Qatar, home to al Udeid Air Base, which houses the largest U.S. military installation in the Middle East. Despite the size of the attack and its proximity to so many troops and scores of military aircraft, the United States never engaged its air defenses, officials told us.\n\nMilitary personnel offered various explanations as to why. Troops manning U.S. Patriot missile air defenses may have never seen the impending attack, because their systems were aimed at protecting U.S. infrastructure, not Doha’s diplomatic section, where the strike hit. The Qatari military didn’t engage their air defenses either, U.S. defense officials told us.\n\nToday, a feeling of resignation set in across the Pentagon that peace talks were over and relations with Qatar would never be the same. Many U.S. military personnel remember how essential Qatar was to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan four years ago, allowing thousands of Americans and Afghans to land in the Gulf state and for military cargo planes to take off minutes apart in order to bring more people out. The Qatari prime minister focused his anger on Netanyahu, not Trump. But many in the region wondered whether the U.S. president could have done more to stop his Israeli counterpart.\n\nOne Pentagon commander who sought to be diplomatic about the Israeli attack shook his head and described it as “brazen.” A more frustrated commander at Central Command headquarters, in Tampa, Florida, blurted, “What the fuck?”\n\nTrump now finds himself in a bind, U.S. officials told us. He doesn’t want to be seen as defending Hamas or criticizing Israeli efforts to eliminate the people accused of plotting the October 7 attacks. Publicly, the White House took issue only with the manner and location of the attack. But privately, Trump advisers don’t see the logic of assassinating senior Hamas officials, because they know that the organization will be restocked with “guys who are just as strong and as heinous,” as one U.S. official put it.\n\nEven if the strike had been successful, Hamas was unlikely to capitulate in its war with Israel. Early reports that Israel may not have killed the intended targets only added to Trump’s frustration.\n\nSome in the administration and in Israel held out hope that Israel’s rogue attack could cause the president to put Netanyahu’s government on a tighter leash, or to try to convince the prime minister that taking Gaza City won’t create the conditions for victory and that he needs to accept other terms.\n\nBut when it comes to Netanyahu, hope has never been a winning strategy. Speaking of the Israeli prime minister, one defense official told us, “There is a real frustration with a partner that seems to be acting for personal political gain at the expense of our partnership with other nations.”","summary":"The Israeli strike on Hamas in Doha may have missed its target, while also extinguishing any hope of a deal.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/09/israels-qatar-strike-hamas-negotiations/684171/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/EAuh_PRzuwFrEs3lyguFuopLWzs=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/09/2025_09_QatarIsraelStrikes/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:10:00","author":"Isaac Stanley-Becker,Shane Harris","authors":["Isaac Stanley-Becker","Shane Harris"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":359388650,"title":"Modi-Trump talks vital for trade and global stability, says USIBC chief Atul Keshap","text":"USIBC President Atul Keshap stressed the importance of Modi-Trump dialogue amid trade disputes and global instability, calling India a growing global leader and urging stronger cooperation to balance tariffs with peace and prosperity.Dialogue between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump is critical for resolving trade tensions and addressing global instability, US-India Business Council (USIBC) President Atul Keshap has said.In an exclusive interview with ANI, Keshap stressed the need for both governments to remain engaged despite frictions. “It’s always better when we talk.

Spencer Cox announced Wednesday evening. \n\nHowever, they were later released, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed. \n\n'The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency,' Patel said in a statement. \n\nKirk's death will likely darken what is already expected to be a somber day on Thursday.\n\nThe president is scheduled to head to the Pentagon to mark the 24th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nVice President J.D. Vance will appear at New York's Ground Zero memorial service. \n\nTrump's schedule later in the day was expected to be more lighthearted. \n\nThe president was to travel to New York and appear at Yankee Stadium for a game between the New York Yankees and the Detroit Tigers. \n\nSo far, Trump's schedule hasn't been modified and it wasn't immediately clear if Kirk's death would have an impact on his plans for Sept. 11.\n\nAttendees heading to the Yankees game were already expected to have to go through enhanced security measures due to Secret Service being on-site and the security level may be raised further due to what has already been labeled by officials as a 'political assassination.' \n\nThe Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether Trump's security would be beefed up in the wake of the Kirk shooting. \n\nTrump survived a similar assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024. \n\nThe gunman's bullet whizzed by the now-president's ear. With a fist-pump in the air for the ages, he famously survived and went on to win re-election.\n\nKirk was the head of Turning Point USA, a group aimed at getting young Americans interested in conservatism. \n\nHe was a close friend of the president and the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., and hosted droves of MAGA heavyweights at his TPUSA events over the years. \n\nJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, credited Kirk for building and fostering the MAGA movement in 2016.\n\n'Charlie represented the best of MAGA. Firm in his beliefs, compassionate, curious, and respectful. He had huge allotments of courage, charisma and character,' Kushner posted. \n\n'He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us,' Trump wrote about Kirk on Truth Social Wednesday afternoon.","summary":"President Donald Trump scrapped a Wednesday night dinner in 'The Rose Garden Club' after the horrific murder of prominent conservative Charlie Kirk.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15086393/trump-cancels-rose-garden-dinner-charlie-kirk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/11/00/102024099-0-image-a-6_1757545329212.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:09:29","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":359388956,"title":"Elite sniper breaks down Charlie Kirk assassin's sick plot... and reveals tiny detail everyone's missed: The gun.

So I guess the threat was low apparently.\n\n'That's a buffet for someone who wanted to kill someone. It looked like a fishbowl, like an amphitheater, and high ground is money for shooters. Shooting down is easy.'\n\nHe continued: 'When you have events like that you look at the security, if you push 250, 300 yards, it's an easy shot.\n\n'And not to mention out in the open, wind is low out in the country. It's not like in the city where a bullet flying past the buildings will move more.'\n\nHe added: 'Any bloke can go to the range three or four times and make that shot. I would start looking at range time if I was police.\n\n'They should get all the videos, who's got what rifle and who isn't properly trained so don't know how to control their blood pressure and adrenaline.\n\n'They're probably just an internet shooter, not a sniper or trained soldier.'\n\nRanstad also dispelled claims the shooter was using an easily-accessible AR-15, commonly used in school shootings across America.\n\nHe said he thought it was likely a more powerful rifle, based on the sound during the shot heard across multiple videos.\n\nHe continued: 'It sounded like a high-powered rifle, possibly bolt action. I heard the crack and saw him shot so I'm thinking long rifle.\n\n'I don't think it is that far of a shot for a high-powered rifle. I think it was maybe a 308 bolt action, or 762.'\n\nHe went on: 'I don't think it was an AR, the crack had too much base in it, not a crack like an AR.'\n\nBut Ranstad suggested the shooter may have made a small error during his attack, which makes him think he was not highly trained.\n\nHe said the reason Kirk was hit in the neck, rather than the head or chest as a trained soldier would aim for, was down to his failure to control external factors.\n\nThe ex-Delta soldier said: 'He was probably aiming for the head but didn't take into consideration the wind and the bullet pulled a bit.\n\n'He didn't take into consideration the drop or angle by the looks.'\n\nHe continued: 'Him getting shot in the neck means I think he went for the head, but his adrenaline would have been going crazy, probably got a trigger pull.'\n\nHe added: 'I think he was right handed from the videos, so probably had a bad trigger pull.'\n\nSickening videos captured the moment Kirk rocked back as the bullet lodged into his neck and blood burst out from his body.\n\nThe huge crowd immediately started screaming and rushed to flee the 'fishbowl' area where the debate was taking place.\n\nRanstad said: 'In my opinion he was dead on the spot. I've seen arterial bleeds like that and you have seconds.\n\n'They didn't do any quick clot as they probably didn't have any on them. It works but you've got to be so quick with it. The way he kicked back left, yeah he was done.\n\n'Even that angle with him up top on the concrete wall looking down at Charlie, it looked like it came from that guy's left.'\n\nThe shooting sparked a huge manhunt with the FBI descending on the scene and local cops piling into the area.\n\nAn elderly man was seen being led away in cuffs muttering to himself, but police later said he was not connected to the case.\n\nLater on Wednesday evening officers revealed they had taken another man into custody in connection with the case. He was also quickly released.\n\nRanstad said the fact that only one shot was fired and the suspect disappeared for a number of hours suggested he had a solid exit plan after the killing.\n\nHe said: 'He probably had an exfil plan. Normally it's crazy people who shoot 30 rounds. This was one shot, that was it.'\n\n'In my opinion they had a plan. If you think about it, one shot, he's not caught... when I saw the old dude I knew it wasn't him.'\n\nHe added: 'I pray for Charlie and I lowered my flag to half mast.' \n\nKirk leaves behind his wife Erika Frantzve, with whom he had a three-year-old daughter and a son, 16 months. They had their fourth wedding anniversary in May.\n\nDonald Trump led the tributes for the late political commentator. 'The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,' Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n'He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. I’ve been a big supporter—as all of you have, in most cases—of what we’ve seen the first eight or nine months of the Trump administration. But we’re heading up with about a year—a little over a year—until the midterms. And although the Trump positives are still pretty good, I’d just like to outline two or three things the president, if he wanted to take my humble advice or your advice, might wanna watch out for.\n\nThe first is tariffs. What everybody said would happen didn’t happen. That we would have a stock market collapse. We’d be in a recession. Hyperinflation. But one of the strengths of his argument for tariffs was that there was a moral argument, that certain countries had asymmetrical—I shouldn’t say certain countries, the majority of countries were using the United States to expand their economies, while we offshored and outsourced. And the result was an unsustainable $1.2 trillion annual trade deficit that hemorrhaged a lot of jobs.\n\nBut there were some countries, not very many, that ran sizable surpluses. One was the U.K., one of our closest allies. Another was President [Javier] Milei of Argentina. We have a surplus in trade with Argentina. We have a surplus in trade with Brazil. And we have a surplus in trade with Australia. They’re not big surpluses, but they’re not deficits.\n\nSo, it would be wise, I think, to recalibrate our trade policies with our close friends that we are running surpluses with and they have small deficits with us. In other words, their systems are not manipulating the so-called free-trade protocols of the world in a way that China is, or Germany is, or Canada, or Mexico. I think that would help the president a great deal.\n\nThe second is that I don’t think it’s wise to go into Chicago. And I’ll tell you why. Everybody mourns for the loss of life, the hundreds of people who are slaughtered there every year, the inability of democratic-elected city councils, Mayor [Brandon] Johnson, etc. But if you go into Chicago, then the argument goes, you’ll go into Los Angeles, then you’ll go into Baltimore, or you’ll go into Detroit.\n\nAnd there’s a logic to it that President Donald Trump has had phenomenal success in Washington, D.C., but here’s my concerns for the Trump administration. You have a federal mandate because Washington is not in a state. It’s in the District of Columbia, and it’s outlined as such in the Constitution. So, the president has a 30-day legal authorization.\n\nAnd by placing the National Guard and federal troops there, he’s radically decreased crime and he has won over, sort of, a very liberal mayor, not the City Council. But he can expand on that in various ways and show everybody in the country what an activist president who’s worried about the loss of life can do for a city. And he has legal jurisdiction.\n\nBut I’m afraid that if he goes into Chicago, he is going to be ambushed by the City Council. He’s going to be ambushed by the mayor. He’s going to have all of this opposition. And I don’t think anybody is going to work with him. Even the police—while they would secretly side with Trump to stop the violence—they know that he might not be there. “He” being federal troops. And therefore, they would face retaliation when he left.\n\nAnd so, I think it would be wiser to use Washington as an iconic example of what these other cities should do as they watch the effect of federal troops to lower these horrendous violence and murder rates.\n\nAnd finally, there’s a third concern I have. And that is, while I think it’s important to stop all of the importation from Latin America into the United States—and Donald Trump has blown up a trafficker’s boat in international waters that killed 11 people. But they were obviously intent on bringing toxic fentanyl and other types of opiate drugs into the United States. He’s been doing a great job in jawboning China not to send fentanyl products into Mexico. He’s threatened the cartels. But we don’t have a good history, necessarily, of going into Latin America.\n\nAnd again, it’s kind of a quagmire that if we go in to try to chase down narcotraffickers, most of them, not all, but most of them are synonymous with the governments there. And we’re not gonna get a lot of help. And they may say they will help us, but it’s a headache that he does not need right before the midterm.\n\nJust let me recap. I’m not criticizing the administration. I’m just suggesting there’s two or three areas that I’d be very cautious. One is losing the moral argument for tariffs. Let’s not put tariffs on countries that run surpluses in our favor.\n\nLet’s not, necessarily, go into these big cities—especially the Chicago of Barack Obama, Rahm Emanuel, Mayor Johnson, an 80% left-wing city that is not going to cooperate and will resist, and a Democratic Party that would rather see crime increase rather than work with or support federal intervention by Donald Trump.\n\nAnd finally, I think, while it’s wise to interdict drugs coming into the country, even in international waters, let’s not put U.S. troops anywhere in Latin America. We don’t have a good history there, and we don’t need an optional foreign intervention in the Western Hemisphere at this particular time.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Kirk was tragically struck in the neck by gunfire and subsequently passed away in hospital after being transported there in critical condition. Donald Trump announced the heartbreaking news via his Truth Social platform, reports the Express . He stated: \"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.

The prominent conservative commentator was renowned for conducting public debates at universities nationwide. Mr Kirk, 31, was addressing students when gunfire erupted at the institution on Wednesday, authorities confirmed. A bullet was discharged at 12:20 local time whilst Kirk was responding to a student's inquiry. Footage captures him instantly falling to the ground with visible bleeding from his neck area. US Vice President JD Vance has recently shared on social media. \"Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord,\" he writes. The conservative campaigner uploaded content to his TikTok profile mere moments before the attack today, Wednesday September 10. He addressed the audience: \"That's a lot of people, Utah. Gather up. \"I'm going to be here for a couple of hours, get comfortable.\" University shuts down as hunt for gunman continues. Utah Valley University has been closed for the remainder of the day whilst the suspect remains on the run. A spokesperson for Utah Valley University has withdrawn an earlier statement claiming that a suspect in the shooting of Mr Kirk had been apprehended. In a statement given to Deseret News in Utah, university spokesman Scott Trotter said: \"We can confirm that Mr Kirk was shot, but we don't know his condition. The suspect is not in custody. Police are still investigating Campus is closed for the rest of the day.\" Video captured by witnesses shows crowds of people running from the scene after the dramatic shooting occurred. According to authorities, Kirk was shot from approximately 200 yards away, on the far side of the quad where he was delivering his speech. Kirk's family were all present at the university campus alongside him. \"Pray for [Kirk] his wife Erika, their two children, and all who were present at Utah Valley University,\" Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin posted on X.","summary":"A chilling video has emerged showing a sniper lurking on the roof of the Losee Centre at Utah Valley University, following the shooting of Charlie Kirk during a Turning Point USA event on Wednesday","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/chilling-video-reveals-rooftop-sniper-35884766","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35884764.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_A-sniper-was-pictured-on-the-roof-of-the-Losee-Center-at-Utah-Valley-University-as-Kirk-was-shot.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:06:25","author":"Jeremiah Hassel,Michael D.

Trade discussions restart next week, ending the pause following the US’ additional 25% tariff on India over Russian oil purchases. The stage is also set for a telephone conversation between the two leaders in the near future. India and the US are natural partners, Modi said on Wednesday in response to Trump’s conciliatory post, in which he described the Prime Minister as a “dear friend,” and suggested fresh momentum in stalled trade negotiations.“India and the US are close friends,\" Modi wrote on X. “I am confident our trade negotiations will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership. Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest.”“I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump. We will work together to secure a brighter, more prosperous future for both our people,” he said, reciprocating Trump’s message on the upcoming phone call.Early on Wednesday, Trump said on Truth Social that he was “pleased to announce India and the US are continuing negotiations to address the trade barriers between our two nations.” Live EventsUrging EU Towards 100% Levy“I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks,” the US President said. “I feel certain there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our great countries!”Chief trade negotiator Rajesh Agarwal will head to Washington next week to resume talks with US counterparts. The situation was still evolving and it remained to be seen whether the US would offer some relief on tariffs in the coming months, according to a person in the know.Meanwhile, there are reports that Trump has urged European Union officials to consider imposing tariffs of up to 100% on Chinese imports and to extend similar measures to India.Trade tensions have ratcheted up since the US levied 25% tariff on Indian imports, which he later doubled to 50% for India’s refusal to halt Russian oil imports. Several Trump administration officials — including White House adviser Peter Navarro, who is still targeting India and BRICS — alleged that India’s Russian oil purchases were helping Moscow finance the war in Ukraine.POSITIVE MESSAGINGHowever, the recent measured tone adopted by Trump and the US commerce secretary is in sharp contrast.On Saturday, Modi “deeply” appreciated and “fully” reciprocated Trump’s “positive assessment” of the India-US partnership, hours after the US President hailed their “special relationship,” signalling attempts by both sides to dial down tensions.“I will always be friends with Modi, he is a great prime minister, he’s great,” Trump had said. “There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion.” External affairs minister S Jaishankar had emphasised the point, saying, “PM Modi attaches enormous importance to our partnership with the US. He has always had a very good personal equation with President Trump. But the point is that we remain engaged with the US...”Trump’s praise for the PM on Saturday came less than 24 hours after he commented, “Looks like we-’ve lost India and Russia to the deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!”What may have spurred the new moderate tone, according to a person with an understanding of the situation, was the informal huddle among the leaders of Russia, India and China at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin. It had sparked a debate in pro-Trump media as well as the Make America Great Again camp on the future of India-US ties.India has remained firm on its policy of strategic autonomy and maintained that its oil imports from Moscow are based on domestic requirements and the need to keep global oil prices stable.Last week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said India will continue to import crude oil from Russia, stressing that energy decisions are based on national interests and economic logic, not external demands. The Reserve Bank of India has started diversifying its holding in the US treasuries, along with purchase of gold, she said.Over the past 10 days, Trump has, very significantly, not taken credit for brokering the India-Pakistan ceasefire, an issue that has been a big bone of contention with New Delhi.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onus tariffsnarendra modidonald trumprussian oil\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Just 23 at the time, he had secured a seat closer to the president-elect than most members of Congress. For Kirk, the founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA, it was more than a front-row view. It was a signal of his ascendance as Trump’s unlikely conduit to America’s youngest voters. For a college dropout who had spent his early twenties hustling donors and recruiting students to his fledgling group, Turning Point USA, the moment was proof of his meteoric rise. He was no longer just a activist with a knack for soundbites. He was inside Trump’s orbit, positioned as the bridge between the MAGA movement and America’s youngest conservatives. Since then, Kirk has built a sprawling youth-focused political machine. Turning Point, founded in 2012, has exploded into a multimillion-dollar operation with glitzy conferences, influencer pipelines, and a digital footprint that rivals legacy media. For conservative students, its events have become something between a political rally and a cultural festival, offering not just red hats and speeches but a sense of belonging. “Young people don’t want to be lectured by the left anymore,” Kirk likes to tell crowds. “They want a fight.” It’s a message that has helped Turning Point frame Trumpism not as a dry policy agenda but as a cultural rebellion. On campuses where students complain of progressive orthodoxy, Kirk’s organization promises a counter-tribe: unapologetically pro-Trump, anti-woke, and steeped in memes and soundbites tailored for TikTok and Instagram. That strategy has made Kirk indispensable to Trump. While the Republican establishment has long struggled to connect with younger voters, Kirk boasts of targeting “low-propensity” participants — students and young adults who may not have voted before. Through Turning Point’s conferences, his podcast, and a constant churn of online clips, he’s helped funnel Trump’s message into the feeds of millions. However, it hasn’t always been smooth. Kirk has drawn fire from both sides as liberals accuse him of stoking culture-war resentment, while some conservatives bristle at his close ties to Trump and his willingness to threaten primary challenges against uncooperative Republicans. Earlier this year, he was among the loudest critics of Ronna McDaniel, the ousted Republican National Committee chairwoman. “We are the vanguard of this movement,” Kirk had told donors, according to a report by The New York Times, positioning his youth network as a force too powerful to ignore. But Trump himself has taken notice and offered validation. He has praised Kirk privately for “keeping the kids in line” and has regularly amplified his content online. Within Trump’s circle, Kirk is treated less like an outsider activist than a trusted envoy. “People close to him view him as one of the most effective outside allies,” one Republican operative admitted to NYT. What sets Kirk apart is his knack for turning politics into an event. At Turning Point summits, the atmosphere feels closer to a music festival: pyrotechnics, booming soundtracks, and selfie-friendly backdrops. Big-name conservatives and MAGA influencers mix on stage, while student attendees broadcast clips across their social feeds. Critics argue that Kirk isn’t actually expanding Trump’s youth coalition so much as energizing a narrow slice of already conservative students. Polls consistently show Democrats winning by wide margins with Gen Z and Millennials. But in a close election, even mobilizing a fraction of young conservatives can matter, and Kirk has shown a rare ability to capture and organize them at scale. At 31, Kirk remained at the center of Trump’s youth strategy. His gamble, skipping college to launch Turning Point, paid off in influence far beyond campus politics. During Trump’s 2024 presidential bid, Kirk’s youth army served as both a cheering section and a ground force. However, Kirk’s life was cut short on Wednesday when he was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University. President Trump mourned Kirk, a close ally, in a post on social media. “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,” he wrote, adding, “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"Kirk’s life was cut short on Wednesday when he was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/charlie-kirk-shot-dead-uvu-event-donald-trump-youth-army-article-152765955","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-152765959,thumbsize-120414,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/152765959.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 23:56:08","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.195},{"id":359384082,"title":"Bureaucrats’ jobs-report fiasco is a national shame — and heads must roll","text":"President Donald Trump was right to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics last month — and after the fiasco that burst into public view Tuesday, he has cause to clean house at the bureau from top to bottom.\n\nThe BLS now admits that between April 2024 and March 2025, it overestimated the number of jobs created in the American economy by a mind-blowing 911,000, or nearly a million.\n\nThat’s not just a mistake. It’s a national embarrassment that calls into question everything the BLS says — and why it says what it does.\n\nHow convenient that the BLS made the economy look stronger during the last year of Joe Biden’s presidency — right on the heels of another series of blunders, when BLS overstated nearly 1.2 million jobs reported between April 2023 and March 2024.\n\nAdded together, it smacks of a political hit job: Build up Biden but tear down Trump. The president has suggested as much.\n\nOf course, the problem could be sheer incompetence, or the bureau’s willful refusal to adjust its methods in the face of shifting data.\n\nThe BLS has known for years that its monthly workplace surveys, hit by sharply declining response rates, are woefully lacking.\n\nThis is insulting to the American people, but it’s also unsurprising: I’ve matched the bureau’s workforce against voter files and discovered that about 60% of BLS staffers are Democrats — nearly three times the number of Republicans.\n\nA balanced agency this is not.\n\nDid leftist bias lead the BLS to manipulate jobs numbers in favor of Democrats? It stands to reason.\n\nBut whether or not they were intentional, the bureau’s terrible errors prevented the economic policies that would have encouraged the job creation America urgently needs.\n\nNo one pays more attention to the BLS jobs numbers than the Federal Reserve, and in the last year of the Biden administration, the Fed didn’t cut interest rates in large part because the BLS said the labor market was strong.\n\nBut it wasn’t strong — it was incredibly weak, to the point that almost no net jobs were created during Biden’s final year in office.\n\nHad the Fed known the truth, it almost certainly would have started cutting interest rates earlier this year, maybe even as early as February.\n\nThen the jobs market would have actually picked up — and by now, the economy would be significantly stronger.\n\nInstead, jobs haven’t grown fast enough, held back by wrongheaded Fed policies shaped by false BLS data.\n\nThe legacy media is pointing fingers at Trump for the lackluster job growth of the past few months, gleefully accusing his tariffs of killing employment.\n\nBut this ignores the massive blame that clearly belongs to the BLS. Its faulty data has stifled job growth, even as the Trump economy has delivered results in other key areas.\n\nReal household income is already far higher in this administration’s first six months than it was in Biden’s four years, for example.\n\nImagine if the Fed had cut rates six months ago, as we now know the economy clearly needed: Wages would be even higher, thanks to the hundreds of thousands of new jobs that would have been created.\n\nThis economy could still boom, but only if some serious changes are made in Washington, DC.\n\nTo start, the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates this month — and by a bigger margin than usual.\n\nThe Fed has to make up for its months of inaction, based on jobs numbers that weren’t even close to accurate.\n\nEven better, Congress should consider legislation by Sens. Rick Scott and Ted Cruz that would stop the Fed from paying massive amounts of interest on banks’ own reserves, which keeps interest rates higher than they would otherwise be. \n\nThen there’s the BLS. Trump has good reason to fundamentally reform this borderline-failed agency that has hurt the economy to an extraordinary degree.\n\nHe’s appointed EJ Antoni as BLS commissioner, and the Senate should confirm him as soon as possible.\n\nThe media will continue attacking the president with claims that he’s politicizing the BLS — but that ignores how politicized, or how inept, the BLS has already become.\n\nMeanwhile, the bureau itself needs a good scrubbing.\n\nMaybe if more unelected leftist bureaucrats lose their jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will finally learn how to count real ones.\n\nHayden Dublois is data and analytics director at the Foundation for Government Accountability.","summary":"Whether or not they were intentional, terrible errors at the Bureau of Labor Statistics prevented the economic policies that America's workers urgently need.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/10/opinion/bureaucrats-jobs-fiasco-a-national-shame-heads-must-roll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-7ymke94ch-1757547245088.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1757532874&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 23:55:49","author":"Hayden Dublois","authors":["Hayden Dublois"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.52},{"id":359385414,"title":"Reagan Foundation cancels Ben Shapiro speaking event, after fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk","text":"The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley has canceled an event with conservative political commentator and activist Ben Shapiro — which was scheduled for the evening of Wednesday, Sept. 10 — after learning that fellow conservative activist Charlie Kirk had been fatally shot earlier in the day.\n\nShapiro was set to appear at the library to discuss his new book, “Lions and Scavengers: The True Story of America (and Her Critics),” on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, however, announced the event’s cancelation after Kirk, 31, was shot and killed during a speaking engagement in Utah.\n\n“The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is saddened to hear of events that took place today at Utah Valley University. Our prayers are with Charlie Kirk and his family,” the foundation wrote on social media. “As a mark of respect, we are cancelling our program and book signing with Ben Shapiro this evening.”\n\nKirk, the co-founder and CEO of the youth organization Turning Point USA, rose to prominence for confronting liberals in academia, eventually winning over an influential set of conservative financiers. He was an early backer of President Donald Trump, going on to serve as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr. during the elder Trump’s 2016 campaign.\n\nSoon, Kirk was a regular presence on cable TV, where he leaned into the culture wars and heaped praise on the then-president. He often espoused far-right political talking points, including racist, homophobic, and transphobic beliefs.\n\nHe was also a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, notably saying during a 2023 TPUSA faith event: “I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”\n\nShapiro and Kirk, meanwhile, operated within the same political sphere. Shapiro said on social media Wednesday that he was “utterly stunned and heartbroken” about Kirk’s death.\n\n“Charlie was a good man who believed in right and wrong, who stood by his Biblical values,” Shapiro said. “All of us will miss him, and I can’t imagine the pain of his beautiful young family, and we all must pray for them. And we must pick up the baton where Charlie left it, fighting for the things he believed in so passionately.”\n\nThe Reagan Foundation said a new date for Shapiro’s library event would be announced in the future.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Shapiro was set to appear at the library to discuss his new book, \"Lions and Scavengers: The True Story of America (and Her Critics),\" on Wednesday night","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/10/reagan-foundation-cancels-ben-shapiro-speaking-event-after-fatal-shooting-of-charlie-kirk/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LDN-L-REAGAN-30-1104-DC-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 23:51:59","author":"Gqlshare,Kristy Hutchings","authors":["Gqlshare","Kristy Hutchings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.082},{"id":359394156,"title":"Conservative Activist Charlie Kirk Is Killed in Utah, ‘Person of Interest’ in Custody","text":"Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot Wednesday at an event at a Utah college, officials said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Kirk was shot and killed as he was speaking at Utah Valley University. The shooting quickly drew reaction from leading political figures, including some victims of political violence.\n\nVideos posted to social media show Kirk speaking into a handheld microphone at the university’s Sorensen Center courtyard, sitting under a white tent emblazoned with the slogans, “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong.”\n\nA single shot rings out and Kirk reaches up with his hand as a large volume of blood gushes from the left side of his neck. Stunned spectators gasp and scream. Some run away.\n\nA “person of interest” was in custody Wednesday evening, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said, though no charges were immediately announced.\n\nMoments before the shooting\n\nVideo shows Kirk had been taking questions from an audience member about mass shootings and gun violence.\n\n“Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” an audience member asked.\n\nKirk responded, “Too many.”\n\nThe questioner followed up: “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?”\n\n“Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked.\n\nThen a single shot rang out.\n\nThousands turned out for Kirk’s appearance and police were also present\n\nJeff Long, chief of Utah Valley University Police Department, says six officers working at Kirk’s campus event and more than 3,000 people were in attendance.\n\nThe police chief says his officers coordinated their operation with Kirk’s security team, and plainclothes police officers were also present.\n\nAt the time he was shot, Kirk was speaking to the throng in a low area surrounded by campus buildings.\n\nLong said law enforcement tries to get the “bases covered.” But he added, “unfortunately today we didn’t, and because of that we have this tragic incident.”\n\nStudents, meanwhile, told The Associated Press they saw no metal detectors or bag checks. The amount of security appeared consistent with other speaking engagements on Kirk’s national tour.\n\nFBI appeals to the public for information about the shooting\n\nThe FBI’s Salt Lake City office has added an online form to its website where the public can report information about Kirk’s killing.\n\nThe form says the FBI is “seeking information regarding the shooting at Utah Valley University that took place on September 10, 2025.”\n\nIt asks the person submitting the form to include their name and contact information and then includes a section for information about the incident.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. says Kirk wasn’t a threat to anyone\nIn a lengthy social media post, President Trump’s son says Kirk wasn’t just a friend, but was “like a little brother to me” and a “true inspiration.”\n\nTrump Jr. said Kirk “changed the direction of this nation” because “there is no question that Charlie’s work and his voice helped my father win the presidency.”\n\nHe said Kirk was civil and kind, and listened and responded with respect.\n\n“The only ‘threat’ he ever posed was that he was incredibly effective. He was a powerful messenger of truth, and people heard that truth. That’s what made him a target.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress mourn Kirk\n\nDemocratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan appeared visibly upset while speaking to reporters on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. She said that she cried when she found out that Kirk had died.\n\n“All of us have got to work together and deescalate the heat and the rhetoric in this country, she said. Dingell added: “And remember we’re Americans, and you can disagree in a way that doesn’t end in the horrible way today did.”\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin expressed condolences to Kirk’s family, adding, “What a nightmare this whole thing is.”\n\n“It’s a very dark time with the political violence spiraling out of control and gun violence a threat to everybody,” Raskin continued.\n\nUtah governor says Kirk’s death carries a tragic message for the state of the country\n\nGov. Spencer Cox said that Kirk had come to the Utah Valley University campus to represent his conservative views and debate. Targeting people for their ideas threatens the country’s “constitutional foundations,” he said.\n\n“We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be,” he said. “I don’t care what his politics are. I care that he was an American.”\n\nCox said the first of the inalienable rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence is “life, and today a life was taken. Charlie Kirk was first and foremost a husband and a dad to young children. He was also very much politically involved. And that’s why he was here on campus. Charlie believed in the power of free speech and debate to shape ideas and to persuade people.”\n\nPresident of the university where Kirk was killed calls his death tragic\n\nUtah Valley University President Astrid Tuminez posted on X that the school is “shocked and saddened” by Kirk’s death.\n\nShe expressed her condolences to his family and said they are grieving with the many people from the school who saw the “unspeakable tragedy” unfold.\n\n“We firmly believe that UVU is a place to share ideas and to debate openly and respectfully. Any attempt to infringe on those rights has no place here,” the statement said.\n\nKirk backers leave flowers at Turning Point headquarters\n\nThe flags outside Turning Point USA’s Phoenix headquarters have been lowered to half staff.\n\nBouquets of flowers delivered by well-wishers are piling up by the main door to one of at least three buildings that make up Turning Point’s campus. The organization’s presence has grown steadily in a quiet neighborhood at the base of South Mountain park.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush says violence must be ‘purged from the public square’\nBust lamented the killing and said “an open exchange of opposing ideas should be sacrosanct” on a college campus, where Kirk was shot.\n\nIn his statement, Bush added: “Members of other political parties are not our enemies; they are our fellow citizens.”\n\nThe Republican ex-president closed the statement by asking God to bless Kirk and his family and “guide America toward civility.”\n\nAnother former president, Democrat Bill Clinton, wrote on X that he was saddened and angered by the killing, adding he hoped “we all go through some serious introspection” and “redouble our efforts to engage in debate passionately, yet peacefully.”\n\nKirk follower says he went to Turning Point USA’s headquarters to give large donation in person\nRetiree Alex Lane said news of Kirk’s killing prompted him to head to the organization’s Phoenix headquarters and hand the organization a $10,000 check.\n\n“I hope and trust that they’re going to continue with the message that he had,” Lane, 54, told The Associated Press while standing outside the headquarters. Lane said he was a follower of Kirk’s and had given to Turning Point before, but never such a large sum.\n\n“It’s a huge loss, there’s no question about it,” Lane said. “But I think the important thing for people to understand is that (Kirk’s message) is going to continue. The assassin didn’t stop it. If anything, I think it will bring more attention to his message.”\n\nLawmakers reflect on Kirk’s influence\n\nMultiple Republicans in Congress knew Kirk personally and were devastated by his death.\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida spoke on the Capitol steps, reflecting on his influence on her political journey. Luna said she was planning to go to medical school before Kirk recruited her to work as his national Hispanic outreach director. She attended events where Kirk debated students, like the one he hosted today.\n\n“That conversation needs to happen,” Luna said. “You can’t squelch that.”\n\nKirk killed with single shot in supposed targeted attack, authorities say\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox called the killing a “political assassination.”\n\nA “person of interest” was in custody Wednesday evening, Cox said, though no charges were immediately announced.\n\n“This is a dark day for our state,” Cox said.\n\n“We are actively looking for anyone and everyone who has any information related to the shooting,” he said.\n\nUtah authorities said the shooter wore dark clothing and fired from a roof on campus some distance away.\n\nRFK Jr., son and nephew of assassinated leaders, laments another loss\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to invoke his family’s losses as he reacted to Kirk’s killing.\n\n“Once again, a bullet has silenced the most eloquent truth teller of an era,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He called Kirk a “relentless and courageous crusader for free speech.”\n\nKennedy’s father, for whom he was named, was assassinated in 1968 as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe elder Kennedy was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War before many elected leaders in Washington. He also had been an advocate for civil rights legislation as attorney general during his brother’s presidency and after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963.\n\nKirk fans pay their respects at the Turning Point headquarters in Phoenix\n\nOne man delivered flowers and wiped tears from his face as he left. He said he was too broken up to speak to reporters.\n\nOn the sidewalk, 14-year-old Samuel Monahan embraced his parents in prayer.\n\n“This is what happens when we’re without God,” said Monahan.\n\nThe teenager said he admired Kirk for being a man of God who cared about people. The country is so polarized, he said, “but it didn’t have to be that way because we all bow our heads under one flag and under one God.”\n\nFormer President Obama condemns Kirk’s ‘despicable’ killing\n\n“This kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy,” former President Barack Obama wrote on X.\n\nHe said he and former first lady Michelle Obama will pray for Kirk’s wife and two young children.\n\nChaffetz says he’s angry about Kirk’s death\n\n“It makes me mad. I’m so mad that this happened in our backyard. It’s an embarrassment,” the Utah Republican former member of Congress told Fox News Channel.\n\nChaffetz was at the event where Kirk was shot.\n\n“We’re better than this, but there’s somebody out there who is evil, absolute total, complete evil and they need to be taken down,” he said.\n\nKirk’s appearance at Utah Valley University marked the kickoff of his national college tour\n\nHe was calling it “The American Comeback Tour.” And he was featuring his “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where Kirk sat, as he was Wednesday, and fielded questions from students, including those who disagreed with him.\n\nHe also had appearances slated for Colorado State University, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Virginia Tech University, Utah State University, the University of North Dakota, Montana State University, Indiana University Louisiana State University and the University of Mississippi over the next two months.\n\nThe scene around campus\n\nArmed officers are walking around the neighborhood bordering the campus, knocking on doors and asking for information on the shooter.\n\nOfficers have been seen looking at a photo on their phones and showing it to people to see if they recognize a person of interest.\n\nMayor urges people to report anything suspicious\n\nMayor David Young of the north-central Utah city of Orem says several local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are investigating and that the suspect in Kirk’s shooting remains at large.\n\nYoung says police in Orem and at Utah Valley University are among many agencies involved in the investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities have told anyone at Utah Valley University to ‘secure in place’ after Wednesday’s shooting. The campus was closed, and a post on the school’s emergency information page told those still on campus to call officials to be escorted out.\n\nAn increase in violence against public officials\n\nKirk’s killing follows instances of political violence in the United States in recent months, including the assassination of a Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June and the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington in May.\n\nThough little is known about the shooter or the motive in this case, it can’t be ignored that polarization and normalization of violence have become threaded through U.S. politics, said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of public communication at American University.\n\nBraddock pointed to data from Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative, which shows that threat and harassment incidents against local officials also have been gradually increasing.\n\n“We’re moving in a very dangerous direction, and I think we have been moving in this direction for quite some time,” Braddock said.","summary":"Charlie Kirk, the CEO and co-founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was fatally shot Wednesday at an&#8230; Continue reading Conservative Activist Charlie Kirk Is Killed in Utah, ‘Person of Interest’ in Custody\n\n\nThe post Conservative Activist Charlie Kirk Is Killed in Utah, ‘Person of Interest’ in Custody appeared first on The National Herald.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/conservative-activist-charlie-kirk-is-killed-in-utah-person-of-interest-in-custody/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Charlie-Kirk-Shot9-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 23:51:56","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.528},{"id":359389394,"title":"Breitbart Business Digest: Producer Prices Fall Again, as the Tarifflation Narrative Collapses","text":"Tarifflation Narrative Falls Apart\n\nThe August producer price index (PPI) report delivered yet another blow to the doomsayers who predicted President Donald Trump’s tariffs would ignite inflation. Instead of climbing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said producer prices for final demand fell 0.1 percent in August.\n\nEconomists had expected a 0.3 percent gain, once again showing that Wall Street’s establishment economists are still attached to the tarifflation narrative. Year-over-year, PPI rose just 2.6 percent, far below forecasts of 3.3 percent.\n\nThe revision to July also tilted the trend lower, with the prior 0.9 percent jump reduced to 0.7 percent. Reality has undercut the claim that tariffs would produce a cascade of price hikes.\n\nMargins Collapse Again and Goods Prices Barely Budged\n\nThe biggest drag on prices came from services, where prices dropped 0.2 percent. The most important driver was a 1.7 percent plunge in “trade services,“ the Bureau of Labor Statistics measurement of markups wholesalers and retailers charge. Businesses are clearly absorbing higher costs rather than passing them on. If tariffs were a “national sales tax” on consumers, as Kamala Harris and countless Wall Street economists claimed, these margins should be holding steady or rising. Instead, they are shrinking—just as they did in April and June.\n\nFinal demand goods edged up just 0.1 percent, thanks to declining energy prices. Excluding energy and food prices, final demand goods prices climbed 0.3 percent. Service prices fell 0.2 percent.\n\nPrices of personal consumption goods were completely flat for the month, indicating that consumers are not being squeezed by tariffs. Personal home electronic equipment prices were flat. Household appliance prices fell 0.5 percent. Car prices climbed just 0.2 percent. Household furniture prices rose 0.2 percent, and commercial furniture prices were flat. Clothing prices for men and boys declined 0.1 percent, and clothing prices for women and girls were flat.\n\nThis is not inflation but relative price shifts between categories. If tariffs are driving some prices higher, these are being more than offset by declining prices elsewhere. As the Council of Economic Advisers has noted, many analysts and pundits are confusing relative price changes with inflation. There will always be some of the former. What we’re not seeing is the latter.\n\nEven further back in the supply chain, the story is the same. Processed goods prices rose 0.4 percent, but unprocessed goods fell 1.1 percent, driven by a 2.8 percent drop in crude oil. Intermediate services ticked up 0.3 percent. These are modest, mixed signals—nothing like the sweeping surge that tariff critics promised. The inflationary story stops at the warehouse door.\n\nFrom Lonely Argument to Mainstream View\n\nFor months, we’ve argued that tariffs are not hitting consumers with higher prices but squeezing margins for businesses and exporters. That was a lonely position to defend for the first half of this year. Now it’s fast becoming the conventional wisdom.\n\nOn CNBC’s Squawk Box Tuesday, Mohamed El-Erian said:\n\n“There’s the exporter, the importer, and the consumer. And so far the consumer is carrying the least of the burden. … They’re finding out that they cannot pass through as much of the price increases as they want. And that is particularly true for those who sell to lower income consumers. So what we’re getting is that this has to be absorbed, either by the exporter or importer…What we’re learning is that the final impact on the consumer is much less than people expected.”\n\nThat’s exactly what the PPI shows: margins squeezed, costs absorbed, and consumers shielded. The tarifflation narrative is dead.\n\nThe Case for a Bigger Fed Cut\n\nThe Fed has long insisted it is “data dependent.” If that’s true, the latest data leave little choice but to ease more aggressively.\n\nProducer prices fell instead of rising. Payroll growth was far weaker than previously thought. Benchmark revisions wiped out nearly a million jobs.\n\nOn CNBC, Mohamed El-Erian put it bluntly: these numbers point to a 50-basis-point rate cut. The Fed can keep pretending tariffs are fueling inflation, or it can recognize what the data show: costs are being absorbed, inflation is contained, and growth is slowing.\n\nThe time has come for a big cut in rates, followed by a series of cuts to bring rates down from their currently restrictive stance.","summary":"The August producer price report delivered yet another blow to the doomsayers who predicted President Donald Trump’s tariffs would ignite inflation.\n\n\nThe post Breitbart Business Digest: Producer Prices Fall Again, as the Tarifflation Narrative Collapses appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/09/10/breitbart-business-digest-producer-prices-fall-again-as-the-tarifflation-narrative-collapses/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/09/bbd-tariffs-9-10-25-getty-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 23:50:31","author":"John Carney","authors":["John Carney"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.427},{"id":359389416,"title":"RFK Jr. on Assassination of Charlie Kirk: ‘Once Again, A Bullet Has Silenced the Most Eloquent Truth Teller of an Era’","text":"Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

That is nonsense. It’s drivel. But I am -- I think it’s worth it.

But while many simply expressed their grief for Kirk and his family, and politicians on both sides of the aisle condemned the killing, some public figures used the moment to make incendiary claims. \n\nOn Wednesday evening, FBI Director Kash Patel announced on X that “[t]he subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.” (By that point, far-fetched conspiracy theories about Kirk’s death were already emerging, including claims that Kirk was assassinated by the Israeli government.) But Patel subsequently posted that the person in custody had “been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.”\n\nThe complete lack of information about the shooter’s identity and motive did not stop some figures from stoking outrage, particularly against “the left,” whom—despite lacking any evidence as to the shooter’s identity—they blamed for the killing. Former DOGE head and Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted to his 225 million followers, “The Left is the party of murder.”\n\nConservative activist and Trump confidant Laura Loomer sent a barrage of posts to her 1.7 million followers. In one, she called for the Trump administration to “shut down, defund, & prosecute every single Leftist organization,” adding, “The Left is a national security threat.” After Kirk’s death was confirmed, she wrote: “They sent a trained sniper to assassinate Charlie Kirk while he was sitting next to a table of hats that said 47.” It is unclear which “they” she was referring to. \n\n“More people will be murdered if the Left isn’t crushed with the power of the state,” Loomer added.\n\nFormer White House staffer and current podcast host Katie Miller, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, wrote on X that liberals “have blood on your hands.” And Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) went so far as to blame the killing on the Democrats.\n\nSean Davis, the CEO and co-founder of the Federalist, an influential conservative publication, posted on X: “I hope that Trump also orders the extermination of the entire anarcho-terrorist network that has been terrorizing Christians in this nation unabated for more than a decade.”\n\nIn a separate post, Davis wrote, “When Democrats lose elections they couldn’t steal, they murder the people they were unable to defeat.” \n\nThe knee-jerk arguments that the killing was somehow orchestrated by the left called to mind the baseless blaming of Democrats following the attempted assassinations of President Donald Trump last summer. As our colleague Mark Follman noted at the time, allies of Trump, including his sons, repeatedly and falsely blamed Democrats for the attempts—claims that threat assessment and law enforcement experts warned could give rise to more political violence. \n\nOthers blamed Kirk’s killing on an unnamed group of opponents. On Fox News, host Jesse Watters claimed: “Whether we want to accept it or not, they are at war with us. And what are we going to do about it? How much political violence are we going to tolerate?” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) wrote, “They just shot Charlie Kirk.” (It was unclear whom Watters and Greene were referring to.) \n\nAndrew Tate, the British-American masculinity influencer turned far-right culture warrior, kept his message simple: “Civil war,” he wrote. Anti-abortion activist and president of Students for Life Kristan Hawkins also invoked civil war and seemed to imply that Kirk’s killing was a result of his opposition to abortion. “We all know the work we do to protect Life comes at a cost,” Hawkins said. In another X post, she wrote: “This is a new civil war. One that we must fight with love to restore a Culture of Life.” \n\nChaya Raichik, the creator of the far-right Libs of TikTok Twitter account, quickly began sharing posts that were meant to show left-wing and progressive people, including many who aren’t public figures, celebrating Kirk’s killing. In her own post on X, she wrote: “THIS IS WAR.” \n\nSome commenters claimed the killing was proof that “the left” could not be stopped. Darryl Cooper, a far-right activist who posts and podcasts under the name “Martyr Made,” told his 350,000 X followers, “Fascism is just the word used by freaks and degenerates when normal people realize that the Left won’t stop unless it’s forced to.”\n\nTexas firebrand pastor Joel Webbon, a self-proclaimed Christian nationalist, told his 51,000 followers, “The Left will not stop until they are forced to. The Right must gain power, keep power, and wield power righteously. @realDonaldTrump, you have been appointed by Providence. You are commanded by Scripture to be a TERROR to those who do evil. Give them hell.”\n\nWilliam Wolfe, another Christian nationalist and a former Trump administration official, posted a video of the shooting with the comment: “The. Left. Must. Be. Destroyed.” In a separate tweet, he wrote, “The Democrats and the Left must be crushed. The goal for Republicans in the next ten years shouldn’t just be to win elections, but to destroy the Democrat Party entirely and salt the earth underneath it.”\n\nMany of the most incendiary tweets called for the Trump administration to use every available tool for legal and political retribution. Conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who made a name for himself opposing critical race theory, called for swift action. “The last time the radical Left orchestrated a wave of violence and terror, J. Edgar Hoover shut it all down within a few years,” he posted to his 832,000 followers on X. “It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos.”\n\nWithout directly calling for retribution, other MAGA figures made it clear Kirk’s killing would forever change their own political trajectory. “Congratulations,” wrote conservative activist Ryan Fournier, a co-founder of the group Students for Trump. “You have now made a radical out of me.
