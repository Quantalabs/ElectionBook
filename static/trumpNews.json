Theo Reuters, thẩm phán McAfee cho rằng các cáo buộc đó thiếu chi tiết và không cho phép các bị cáo có đủ thời gian để chuẩn bị bào chữa. Toàn bộ cáo buộc trên đều rơi vào phạm trù \"xúi giục vi phạm lời thề khi nhậm chức\". Dù thẩm phán McAfee vẫn giữ nguyên số cáo buộc còn lại, đây vẫn là tin vui cho ông Trump. Tuy vậy, cựu tổng thống hiện vẫn đối mặt tổng cộng 88 cáo buộc trong 4 phiên tòa hình sự.\n\n Ông Trump tại bang Georgia hôm 9.3. Ảnh Reuters\n\nNgày 15.3, thẩm phán McAfee dự kiến công bố quyết định về việc liệu có loại trừ công tố quận Fani Willis của hạt Fulton khỏi vai trò công tố viên trong vụ xử ông Trump hay không. Điều này do bà Willis bị phát hiện có quan hệ tình ái với công tố viên đặc biệt Nathan Wade được bà thuê để điều tra ông Trump vào năm 2022. Trong trường hợp bà Willis bị loại khỏi vụ án hình sự, đó sẽ là chiến thắng vang dội cho cựu Tổng thống Trump, vì tòa sẽ tước quyền truy tố của cả văn phòng công tố hạt Fulton và giao cho bên khác. Diễn biến này gần như sẽ tiếp tục gây trì hoãn vụ xử, nhiều khả năng phải dời đến năm sau mới có thể bắt đầu.\n\nCả hai ông Biden-Trump về đích, sẽ tái đấu giành ghế Tổng thống Mỹ\n\nCòn ở bang Florida, trong vụ xử tài liệu mật bị phát hiện ở nhà riêng ông Trump, thẩm phán Aileen Cannon hôm qua nghe đoàn luật sư đại diện ông Trump trình bày các lập luận nhằm thuyết phục chủ tọa bác vụ xử.\n\n Chiến lược của ông Biden\n\nTrong khi đối thủ đảng Cộng hòa phải ứng phó các phiên tòa hình sự, Tổng thống Joe Biden tiếp tục chiến dịch tranh cử tại các bang chiến địa. Ông Biden hôm 13.3 đến bang Wisconsin, tập trung nỗ lực tìm kiếm các lá phiếu trong cộng đồng phụ nữ ở vùng ngoại ô, cử tri da màu và cử tri nói tiếng Mỹ La tinh ở vùng Trung Tây nước này.\n\n Ông Biden vận động tại bang Wisconsin hôm 13.3.

Nhà lãnh đạo đán.h giá các dự án này có thể giúp cải thiện đời sống của những cộng đồng da màu, Mỹ La tinh và người Hoa ở các tiểu bang, trong đó có Wisconsin.\n\nKết quả khảo sát gần đây của USA Today/Đại học Suffolk (Boston, Massachusetts) cho thấy ông Trump dẫn trước với cách biệt không quá xa so với Tổng thống Biden. Theo đó, 40% số người được hỏi ủng hộ ông Trump, trong khi 38% chọn ông Biden.\n\n Thế đa số của đảng Cộng hòa bị suy yếu ở Hạ viện\n\nTừ ngày 22.3, thế đa số của đảng Cộng hòa tại Hạ viện Mỹ sẽ mỏng đi với quyết định từ chức của hạ nghị sĩ Ken Buck đại diện bang Colorado, theo Fox News. Đây là quyết định bất ngờ vì ông Buck rời Hạ viện sớm hơn vài tháng, trước khi nhiệm kỳ cuối cùng của ông chấm dứt. Ông Buck không tiết lộ nguyên nhân từ chức. Sau khi nghị sĩ Buck ra đi, đảng Cộng hòa chỉ còn 218 ghế, dẫn đến cách biệt vô cùng mong manh so với 213 ghế của đảng Dân chủ. Như vậy, để tiếp tục duy trì thế đa số tại Hạ viện, đảng Cộng hòa chỉ có thể mất đi 2 ghế trong cuộc bầu cử vào tháng 11 tới.","summary":"Đài WPR ngày 10.5 đưa tin Tổng chưởng lý bang Wisconsin (Mỹ) John Kaul vừa tiến hành vụ kiện thứ 16 chống lại chính quyền của Tổng thống Donald Trump","url":"https://vietgiaitri.com/bang-wisconsin-kien-chinh-quyen-ong-trump-lan-thu-16-20250512i7439575/","image":"https://t.vietgiaitri.com/2025/5/4/bang-wisconsin-kien-chinh-quyen-ong-trump-lan-thu-16-600x432-c3d-7439575.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 01:14:07","author":"Khánh An","authors":["Khánh An"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vn","sentiment":-0.812},{"id":320286500,"title":"John Fetterman 'Of Course' Being Wooed by GOP Amid Liberal Backlash—Senator","text":"Arizona Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego says that Republicans are actively attempting to sway Pennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetterman to the right, bluntly stating \"of course\" when asked if the GOP is trying to sway Fetterman their way.These comments come as Fetterman faces growing criticism from fellow Democrats and questions about his health, while receiving unusual public support from Republican senators.Newsweek reached out to Fetterman's office via email on Sunday for comment.Why It MattersThese cross-party dynamic highlights growing tensions within the Democratic Party and potential realignment pressures in Congress.While Fetterman has repeatedly stated he will not change parties, the situation reflects broader ideological fractures, particularly around issues like Israel policy and tax legislation, that could impact Democratic unity during a politically divisive period.What To KnowDuring an interview with Politico on Saturday, Gallego characterized the Republican outreach to Fetterman as \"f***-f*** games,\" a Marine Corps term for pointless exercises, while arguing Democrats should keep Fetterman \"in their corner\" despite disagreements.\"There needs to be space for Fetterman and for other senators in our caucus,\" Gallego said. \"He still is a senator that fights for working-class people.\"The Club for Growth, a conservative group, has launched television advertisements in Pennsylvania praising Fetterman as \"standing up for every working family in PA\" and urging him to support President Donald Trump's tax cuts.Fetterman has still voted against the budget blueprint that would extend these tax cuts and confirmed Friday he remains opposed to these efforts.Despite this pushback, multiple Republican lawmakers, including Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and Senator Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania, have publicly defended Fetterman against what they characterize as unfair attacks regarding his health and political stances.This GOP defense comes after reports that current and former staffers are concerned about Fetterman's mental and physical health following his stroke in 2022.Fetterman's health has been a focal point since he suffered a stroke just days before winning the primary for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat in the 2022 midterm elections. The former Pennsylvania lieutenant governor went on to defeat Republican Mehmet Oz in a key Senate victory for Democrats despite the concerns about his health.New York Magazine's Intelligencer published an article earlier this month featuring an interview with Fetterman's former chief of staff Adam Jentleson, who raised concerns about the senator's health and whether he was following his recovery plan after the stroke.Fetterman later responded to the article in remarks to CNN's Manu Raju.\"My reaction is that it's a one-source hit piece, and it involved maybe two or three anonymous, disgruntled staffers saying just absolutely false things,\" he said.When asked if he has been keeping up with his recovery plan, Fetterman responded, \"My doctors are like 'John is great.' I am on all of the plan that it's always been. It's incredibly invasive, and why are people talking about peoples' personal medical things?\"What People Are SayingDemocratic Senator Ruben Gallego shared his confidence in Fetterman's ability to serve his constituents: \"I think the last thing he'll do is harming working-class families by voting for the reconciliation bill.\"Progressive commentator and journalist Mehdi Hasan wrote on X on Friday: \"This email, a year ago, from Fetterman's former chief of staff, and this entire piece from Ben Terris, makes clear that Fetterman should not be serving in the Senate. Every Senate Democrat should read this and be asked about it - especially Schumer.\"Republican Senator Tom Cotton defended Fetterman on X, formerly Twitter: \"The radical left is smearing him with dishonest, vicious attacks because he's pro-Israel and they only want reliable anti-Israel politicians.\"Republican Senator Dave McCormick: \"Stop these vicious, personal attacks against Senator Fetterman, his wife, and his health. He is authentic, decent, principled, and a fighter.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said Fetterman is an: \"All-star\" who is \"doing a good job.\"During a town hall in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Gallego stressed the need for Democrats to maintain a \"big tent\" approach, warning that: \"We got so pure that we started kicking people out of the tent — it ends up there aren't enough people in the tent to win elections.\"What Happens NextFetterman is up for reelection in 2028 in Pennsylvania, which flipped back to Trump in the 2024 presidential race after backing former President Joe Biden in 2020.","summary":"GOP senators defend Fetterman as Democrats debate his future amid health concerns and Republican outreach efforts.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/john-fetterman-course-wooed-gop-liberal-backlash-senator-2070744","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2642555/john-fetterman.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 01:09:42","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.104},{"id":320286108,"title":"Putin’s spokesman says Moscow will ‘continue’ invasion while blaming Ukraine for not being ‘ready’ for peace","text":"A Kremlin spokesman said in a new interview that Ukraine is to blame for a failure to make progress in peace talks and vowed that the Russian offensive would “continue” - despite Kyiv’s support for a U.S.-backed deal.\n\nWith their respective nations still yet to reach a formal ceasefire, Ukraine and Russia’s ambassadors appeared for dueling interviews Sunday on ABC News.\n\nDmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin, spoke to ABC’s Martha Raddatz in Moscow.\n\n“Ukraine is trying to escape from negotiations,” he claimed.\n\nRaddatz interjected: “Ukraine says they’re ready for a ceasefire right now, a 30 days ceasefire.”\n\n“But they’re not ready for immediate negotiations,” Peskov said. “President Putin is doing whatever is possible to solve the problem, to achieve a settlement through peaceful and diplomatic means. But having no peaceful and democratic means at hand, we have to continue military operation.”\n\nHe would go on to say that U.S. and European weapon shipments to Kyiv would need to be halted for those talks to take place.\n\n\"Otherwise, it will be advantage for Ukraine. Ukraine will continue their total mobilization, bringing new troops to front line. Ukraine will use this period to train new military personnel and to give a rest to their existing ones,\" said Peskov. \"So why should we grant such an advantage to Ukraine?\"\n\nUkraine is \"not ready for immediate negotiations,\" he insisted.\n\nSeparately on ABC News, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova sat down in-studio for an interview with Raddatz. She shot down Peskov’s assertion that Ukraine was refusing the possibility of talks beginning at once.\n\n“President Zelensky today already said that, yes, Ukraine is ready to negotiate,” Markarova said. Ukraine has set a temporary ceasefire as a condition for talks to take place. Russia, meanwhile, said that it would not accept the presence of European peacekeeping forces.\n\n“We have heard loud and clear from President Trump that ceasefires should be full and unconditional. And we have heard from other European leaders,” she continued. “Nobody wants peace more than Ukraine. The question of the day is whether Russia wants it.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent much of 2024 hammering his two opponents, Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris, for the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts, which he says started under their watch. The 47th president claimed often that Putin would not have dared to launch an invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had he been in office, and boasted as well that he could end the eastern European conflict in a matter of hours.\n\nThose hours have stretched into weeks as Trump has come to publicly grumble that Russia may be stringing his administration along in the hopes of securing a more advantageous position on the battlefield. The U.S. president has threatened damaging sanctions against Moscow if the conflict continues, but has yet to act on those threats.\n\nAfter an Oval Office blow-up between the two men earlier this year, Trump met Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican in late April. Soon after the meeting, he posted his suspicions of Russia’s aims on Truth Social.\n\n“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.”\n\nOn Sunday, Trump condemned the “bloodbath” in another Truth Social posting and urged Zelensky to accept an invitation for talks in Turkey with Putin scheduled for this coming Thursday. Zelensky, along with a coalition of NATO leaders, presented the U.S. with a pledge on Saturday stating that Ukraine would accept an immediate temporary ceasefire and to begin talks with Russia. Putin, in his response, accepted an invitation to negotiate while refusing to agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n\n“President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!”\n\n“I’m starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin, who’s too busy celebrating the Victory of World War ll, which could not have been won (not even close!) without the United States of America,” he continued. “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”\n\nZelensky accepted, responding in his own post to Twitter.\n\n“We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,” he said. “There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/putin-spokesman-says-moscow-continue-222244027.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e4a9b801638caee732bf8426b25345ed","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-12 01:01:20","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":320286538,"title":"After Pahalgam Attack, India Told Key Nations It Will Strike Terror Infra In Pakistan","text":"New Delhi: Following the Pahalgam attack, India conveyed to many world capitals, including the US, that there should be no doubts about its punitive strikes against terror camps operating from Pakistani soil, government sources said on Sunday.

Upholding it will pose challenges,” said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst based in Washington. \n\nIn a sign of just how fragile the truce remains, the two governments accused each other of serious violations late on Saturday. \n\nThe ceasefire, Kugelman noted, was “cobbled together hastily” when tensions were at their peak. \n\nTrump said on Sunday that, following the ceasefire, “I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations”. \n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for his part, has not commented publicly on the conflict since it began. \n\nIndia considers Kashmir an integral part of its territory and not open for negotiation, least of all through a third-party mediator. India and Pakistan both rule the scenic Himalayan region in part, claim it in full, and have fought two wars and numerous other conflicts over what India says is a Pakistan-backed insurgency there. Pakistan denies it backs insurgency. “By agreeing to abort under US persuasion ... just three days of military operations, India is drawing international attention to the Kashmir dispute, not to Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism that triggered the crisis,” said Brahma Chellaney, an Indian defence analyst. \n\nFor decades after the two countries separated in 1947, the West largely saw India and Pakistan through the same lens as the neighbours fought regularly over Kashmir. That changed in recent years, partly thanks to India’s economic rise while Pakistan languished with an economy less than one-10th India’s size. \n\nBut Trump’s proposal to work towards a solution to the Kashmir problem, along with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s declaration that India and Pakistan would start talks on their broader issues at a neutral site, has irked many Indians. \n\nPakistan has repeatedly thanked Trump for his offer on Kashmir, while India has not acknowledged any role played by a third party in the ceasefire, saying it was agreed by the two sides themselves. \n\nAnalysts and Indian opposition parties are already questioning whether New Delhi met its strategic objectives by launching missiles into Pakistan on Wednesday last week, which it said were in retaliation for an attack last month on tourists in Kashmir that killed 26 men. It blamed the attack on Pakistan - a charge that Islamabad denied. \n\nBy launching missiles deep into Pakistan, Modi showed a much higher appetite for risk than his predecessors. But the sudden ceasefire exposed him to rare criticism at home. \n\nSwapan Dasgupta, a former lawmaker from Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said the ceasefire had not gone down well in India partly because “Trump suddenly appeared out of nowhere and pronounced his verdict”. \n\nThe main opposition Congress party got in on the act, demanding an explanation from the government on the “ceasefire announcements made from Washington, D.C.” \n\n“Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation?” asked Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh. \n\nAnd while the fighting has stopped, there remain a number of flashpoints in the relationship that will test India’s resolve and may tempt it to adopt a hard-line stance. \n\nThe top issue for Pakistan, diplomats and government officials there said, would be the Indus Waters Treaty, which India suspended last month but which is a vital source of water for many of Pakistan’s farms and hydropower plants. \n\n“Pakistan would not have agreed (to a ceasefire) without US guarantees of a broader dialogue,” said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, a former foreign minister and currently chairman of the People’s Party of Pakistan, which supports the government. Moeed Yusuf, former Pakistan National Security Advisor, said a broad agreement would be needed to break the cycle of brinksmanship over Kashmir. \n\n“Because the underlying issues remain, and every six months, one year, two years, three years, something like this happens and then you are back at the brink of war in a nuclear environment,” he said.","summary":"NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD: India and Pakistan have stepped back from the brink of all-out war, with a nudge from the US, but New Delhi’s aspirations as a global diplomatic power now face a key test after President Donald Trump offered to mediate on the dispute over Kashmir, analysts said. \n\n\n\nIndia’s rapid rise as the world’s fifth-largest economy has boosted its confidence and clout on the world stage, where it has played an important role in addressing regional crises such as Sri Lanka’s economic collapse and the Myanmar earthquake. \n\n\n\nBut the conflict with Pakistan over Kashmir, which flared up in recent days with exchanges of missiles drones and air strikes that killed at least 66 people, touches a sensitive nerve in Indian politics. \n\n\n\nHow India threads the diplomatic needle - courting favour with Trump over issues like trade while asserting its own interests in the Kashmir conflict - will depend in large part on domestic politics and could determine the future prospects for conflict in Kashmir. \n\n\n\n“India .","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40362178/modi-faces-domestic-criticism-over-sudden-ceasefire","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/05/68213253d20f9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 00:51:22","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":320284946,"title":"Gold falls as 'positive' US-China talks erode safe-haven appeal - TradingView","text":"Gold prices slipped on Monday as U.S.-China trade talks ended on a positive note, easing investor anxiety and denting demand for the safe-haven asset.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS\n\n* Spot gold GOLD fell 1.1% to $3,286.86 an ounce as of 0014 GMT.

Trump is not planning to visit Israel.\n\nAlexander, an Israeli-American soldier who spent his formative years in the United States, was abducted during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led assault that marked the war’s beginning in Gaza.\n\nKhalil al-Hayyah, a Hamas leader in Gaza, said the group has been in contact with the U.S. administration over the past few days.\n\nIn a statement, he mentioned that Hamas is prepared to “immediately initiate intensive negotiations” to achieve a comprehensive agreement for a long-term ceasefire. This includes ending the war, exchanging Palestinian prisoners and hostages in Gaza, and transitioning the governance of Gaza to an independent technocratic body.\n\nAlexander’s parents did not immediately return requests for comment, and there was no immediate response from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nTrump has frequently mentioned Alexander, now 21, by name in the past few months.\n\n“Every time they say Edan’s name, it’s like they didn’t forget. They didn’t forget he’s American, and they’re working on it,” Edan’s mother, Yael Alexander, told The Associated Press in February.\n\nBombardment continues\n\nIsraeli strikes overnight and into Sunday killed 15 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, according to local health officials.\n\nTwo of the strikes hit tents in the southern city of Khan Younis, each killing two children and their parents, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Another seven people were killed in strikes elsewhere, including a man and his child in a Gaza City neighborhood, according to hospitals and Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nThe Israeli military says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths in the 19-month-old war because the militants are embedded in densely populated areas. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the latest strikes.\n\nIsrael has sealed Gaza off from all imports, including food, medicine and emergency shelter, for over 10 weeks in what it says is a pressure tactic aimed at forcing Hamas to release hostages. Israel resumed its offensive in March, shattering a ceasefire that had facilitated the release of more than 30 hostages.\n\nThe U.N. and aid groups say food and other supplies are running low and hunger is widespread.\n\nChildren carrying empty bottles raced after a water tanker in a devastated area of northern Gaza on Sunday. Residents of the built-up Shati refugee camp said the water was brought by a charity from elsewhere in Gaza. Without it, they rely on wells that are salty and often polluted.\n\n“I am forced to drink salty water, I have no choice,” said Mahmoud Radwan. “This causes intestinal disease, and there’s no medicine to treat it.”\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of Palestinian civilian affairs, says enough aid entered during a two-month ceasefire this year and that two of the three main water lines from Israel are still functioning. Aid groups say the humanitarian crisis is worse than at any time in the 19-month war.\n\nTrump to visit the region\n\nTrump, whose administration has voiced full support for Israel’s actions, is set to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this week in a regional tour that will not include Israel.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Fifty-nine hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.\n\nIsrael’s offensive has killed over 52,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants or civilians. The offensive has destroyed vast areas of the territory and displaced some 90% of its population of around 2 million.\n\nIsrael recovers remains of soldier killed in Lebanon in 1982\n\nIn a separate development, Israel said it retrieved the remains of a soldier killed in a 1982 battle in southern Lebanon after he had been classified as missing for more than four decades.\n\nThe recovery of Sgt. 1st Class Tzvi Feldman’s remains brought more closure to a case that has plagued Israel for years. The Israeli military said his remains were recovered from deep inside Syria, without providing further details.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Feldman’s surviving siblings on Sunday and told them that the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad late last year led to an “opportunity” that allowed the military and the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, to gather additional intelligence and eventually locate and retrieve the body, according to video released by his office.\n\nFeldman went missing, along with five other Israeli soldiers, in a battle with Syrian forces in the Lebanese town of Sultan Yaaqoub. Several years later, two of the missing soldiers were returned alive to Israel in prisoner exchanges with Syria. The remains of another soldier were returned in 2019, after Russia said it had helped locate them in Syria, while the fate of the other two remained unknown.\n\nCases of soldiers missing for decades have a powerful emotional and political resonance in Israel, where military service is compulsory for most Jewish men.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas has announced plans to release&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hamas Announces Planned Release of Edan Alexander, Last Remaining American Hostage in Gaza, Amid Truce Talks first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/hamas-announces-planned-release-of-edan-alexander-last-remaining-american-hostage-in-gaza-amid-truce-talks/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hamas-says-Edan-Alexander-last-living-American-hostage-in-Gaza.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 00:46:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":320284864,"title":"Trump promises to order that the US pay only the price other nations do for some drugs","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says he’ll sign an executive order on Monday that, if implemented, could bring down the costs of some medications — reviving a failed effort from his first term on an issue he’s talked up since even before becoming president.\n\nThe order Trump is promising will direct the Department of Health and Human Services to tie what Medicare pays for medications administrated in a doctor’s office to the lowest price paid by other countries.\n\n“I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,” the president posted Sunday on his social media site, pledging to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.\n\n“Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,” Trump added.\n\nHis proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office — think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables.

This action is part of the administration’s continual effort to remove government officials thought to be in opposition to the president’s policies.\n\nHayden named Perlmutter to lead the Copyright Office in October 2020. \n\nPerlmutter’s office recently released a report examining whether artificial intelligence companies can use copyrighted materials to “train” their AI systems and then compete in the same market as the human-made works they were trained on.\n\nThe report, the third part of a lengthy AI study, follows a review that Perlmutter began in 2023 with opinions from thousands of people including AI developers, actors and country singers. \n\nIn January, the office clarified its approach as one based on the “centrality of human creativity” in authoring a work that warrants copyright protections. The office receives about half a million copyright applications per year covering millions of creative works.\n\n“Where that creativity is expressed through the use of AI systems, it continues to enjoy protection,” Perlmutter said in January. “Extending protection to material whose expressive elements are determined by a machine … would undermine rather than further the constitutional goals of copyright.”\n\nThe White House didn’t return a message seeking comment Sunday.\n\nDemocrats were quick to blast Perlmutter’s firing. \n\n“Donald Trump’s termination of Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, is a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis,” said Rep.

But it could potentially bring significant savings to the government, although the “TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS” Trump boasted about in his post may be an exaggeration.\n\nMedicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress.\n\nUnder the planned order, the federal government would tie what it pays pharmaceutical companies for those drugs to the price paid by a group of other, economically advanced countries — the so-called “most favored nation” approach.\n\nThe proposal will face fierce opposition from the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIt was a rule that Trump tried to adopt during his first term, but could never get through. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under the Biden administration.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry argued that Trump’s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the “upper hand” in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines.\n\nOnly drugs on Medicare Part B — the insurance for doctor’s office visits — are likely to be covered under the plan. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor’s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay.\n\nA report by the Trump administration during its first term found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021.\n\nMore common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order.\n\nTrump’s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a “very big announcement” last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn’t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced imposing on much of the world.\n\n“We’re going to have a very, very big announcement to make — like as big as it gets,” Trump said last week.\n\nHe came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of “getting away with murder” and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the “Pharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the ‘suckers’ of America, ALONE.”\n\nReferring to drug companies’ powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions “can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.”\n\n“We are going to do the right thing,” he wrote.","summary":"“I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.” \n\n\nThe post Trump promises to order that the US pay only the price other nations do for some drugs appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/05/11/trump-promises-to-order-that-the-us-pay-only-the-price-other-nations-do-for-some-drugs/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trump_79104-6821377c66a15-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 00:28:46","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.38},{"id":320280370,"title":"Asia IPO market braces for headwinds from Trump's trade tempest","text":"TOKYO -- Companies are reining in plans to list in Asia, experts say, as sweeping U.S. tariffs and the festering global trade war sap investor appetite for initial public offerings.\n\nUncertainty has ricocheted through financial markets since U.S. President Donald Trump announced broad plans for \"reciprocal\" trade levies in early April, pushing businesses to shy away from potential IPOs.","url":"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Trading-Asia/Asia-IPO-market-braces-for-headwinds-from-Trump-s-trade-tempest","image":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F9%2F6%2F3%2F2%2F49462369-1-eng-GB%2F20250512%2520TA%2520Trump%2520turmoils%2520bring%2520IPO%","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 00:24:31","author":"Jada Nagumo","authors":["Jada Nagumo"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":320283060,"title":"Hamas Announces Plans to Release U.S.-Israeli Hostage Edan Alexander","text":"Hamas issued a statement claiming it will release Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last known living American being held hostage by the terrorist group, according to several reports.\n\nIn a statement, senior Hamas negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya explained that Hamas was affirming “its readiness to immediately start intensive negotiations, and make serious efforts to reach a final agreement” to end the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, according to CNN.\n\n“The movement affirms its readiness to immediately start intensive negotiations, and make serious efforts to reach a final agreement to stop the war, exchange prisoners in an agreed manner, and manage the Gaza Strip by an independent professional body,” Al-Hayya said.\n\nPer the outlet, Hamas announced that Alexander would be released “as part of the steps toward a ceasefire that will see the crossing into Gaza opened”:\n\nFollowing the communications, Hamas announced it will release Alexander as part of the steps toward a ceasefire that will see the crossings into Gaza opened and humanitarian aid brought into Gaza following an Israeli blockade that has last more than two months.\n\nThe statement issued by Hamas on Sunday evening, comes as President Donald Trump is set to visit the Middle East in the upcoming days, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAlexander, who was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, went on to join the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) after graduating high school, according to Haaretz News.\n\nYael Alexander, Edan’s mom, explained that at the time of Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, Edan had been stationed on the Gaza border. On October 7, Yael was awakened around 6:30 a.m. and she contacted Edan. After the two spoke on the phone, that was the “last” she heard from her son:\n\nOn Friday, the eve of the Simhat Torah holiday, they spoke on a video chat. “He was cute and handsome, playing with his hair the whole time. He said that people had brought them a holiday meal at the base, and that he was going to sleep because he had a guard shift early in the morning,” Yael says.\n“I joked and said, ‘We’ll come with an armored vehicle tomorrow; for Shabbat we’ll bring you cholent” — a slow-simmering stew that Orthodox Jews eat on Shabbat so that they don’t need to cook. “He laughed and said, ‘They won’t let you in, it’s dangerous.’ I went to bed, and at 6:30 in the morning, my father woke me up to go out to the stairwell, because there was a siren.”\nShe immediately sent a message to Edan and asked if everything was okay. He replied that rockets were flying but he was in a safe place and she shouldn’t worry. When the second siren went off, they went out to the stairwell again, and this time Edan didn’t answer her messages. But he called a few minutes later.\n\n – News’s Simon Kent reported in March that Hamas claimed it would release Alexander, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office “cast doubt” on Hamas’s offer and accused the terrorist organization of “trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHamas issued a statement claiming it will release Edan Alexander, who is&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hamas Announces Plans to Release U.S.-Israeli Hostage Edan Alexander first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/hamas-announces-plans-to-release-u-s-israeli-hostage-edan-alexander/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-Hamas-Claims-It-Will-Release-US-Israeli.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 00:24:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":320286104,"title":"Albanians head to the polls in election set to test EU ambitions","text":"White South African 'refugees' to arrive in US as soon as next week\n\nSTORY: Donald Trump's administration is aiming to bring the first group of white South Africans to the United States via its refugee program as soon as next week, three people familiar with the matter have said.It's a divisive move - especially given that Trump has been blocking refugee admissions from the rest of the world.Two of the sources, who requested anonymity as they were sharing internal plans, said the aim is to fly the initial cohort of around 50 Afrikaners into Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.\"It was like an answered prayer.\"Life coach Katia Beeden is administrator of a website that seeks to help white South Africans take up Trump’s offer.\"We've been forgotten. It's very hard for us to travel. It's very hard for us to get visas. So, to suddenly hear that a country like the United States is offering us refugee status was a really big deal, and I was so excited. I felt so relieved. It just felt like a lifeline.\"In February, Trump issued an executive order that called for the U.S. to resettle Afrikaner refugees.It said Afrikaners, who are descendants of mostly Dutch early settlers, were \"victims of unjust racial discrimination\".The assertion that minority white South Africans face discrimination from the Black majority has spread in far-right circles for years and been echoed by Trump's white South African-born ally Elon Musk.\"I guess the key issue to highlight on it is none of this is actually true.\"Political analyst T.K. Pooe says the refugee scheme has created a false narrative that South Africa is a country \"going through some civil war\".\"And then secondly, within the internal borders of South Africa it really has created a lot of division, it is almost as though President Trump has gone out of his way to sow internal division.\"Violence against white farmers and a law allowing for the expropriation and redistribution of land are often cited as evidence of anti-white discrimination in South Africa.However, out of 26,000 murders in South Africa last year, just 44 were linked to farming communities, according to police statistics. Crime researchers say the overwhelming majority of murder victims are Black.In addition, three quarters of private land in South Africa is white-owned, and not a single expropriation has taken place.South Africa's government has criticized Trump's program saying that it fails to recognize South Africa's history of colonialism and apartheid.It added that it's ironic that refugee status is being offered to people from the most economically-privileged part of South African society.The average white household owns 20 times the wealth of the average Black household, according to international academic journal, the Review of Political Economy.Official data shows unemployment rates are far higher among Black citizens.\"As long as it's not here, you can go anywhere you want.\"Trump's order also came after he'd suspended all U.S. refugee admissions, citing security and cost concerns.

His hand on Trump’s lower arm could have been a power clamp, but he seemed to bottle it and his mimicry of Trump’s ‘Fist of power’ gesture to the cameras looked weak.’\n\nThe clearest moment of imbalance came when Carney admitted feeling nervous during the meeting. \n\n‘I’m on the edge of my seat,’ he said with a tight-lipped smile, an admission which Trump pounced on with a theatrical pat of reassurance on the Canadian’s knee. \n\n‘This admission of vulnerability brought a knee-pat response from Trump. Being able to offer a nervous man a pat of reassurance right at the start must have shown Trump some sort of advantage,’ the expert said.\n\nCarney responded with what the expert called a ‘non-verbal purr’, a reluctant chuckle and approving smile that only reinforced the American president’s upper hand. \n\nThroughout the awkward but ‘amicable’ meeting, Carney maintained an outwardly respectful and professional demeanour, but his micro-gestures betrayed moments of resistance. \n\nWhen Trump suggested the US does not do much business with Canada or floated the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state, Carney’s face gave him away, the expert said. \n\n‘Carney’s body language suggested a passive-aggressive method of hinting disagreement via some micro-gestures like an eye-roll of surprise, a blink, then a narrowing of the left eye in an evaluation ritual with a lip pucker and head tilt to suggest he had other opinions,’ she explained.\n\nEven when speaking, Carney reportedly checked Trump’s reactions, looking over repeatedly for approval. \n\nAs he spoke he face-checked Trump for nodding approval,’ said the expert. \n\nOne moment of sincerity came when Carney used a meshing gesture with his hands to symbolise strong bilateral ties during a statement about US-Canada cooperation. \n\nBut seated across from Carney, Trump continued to advocate for Canada becoming America’s 51st state. The Canadian President then reiterated his firm commitment to defending Canadian sovereignty. \n\n‘As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,’ Carney told Trump, in a gesture to the president’s background as a real-estate developer.\n\nHe then referenced his mandate from Canada’s recent federal elections, which reflected growing anti-Trump sentiment among Canadian voters.\n\n‘Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign these last several months, it’s not for sale – won’t be for sale – ever,’ Carney said of his country. \n\nDuring the interaction while discussing the potential of Canada becoming the 51st state, Carney could be seen shaking his knee as the US President spoke.\n\n‘Knee-jiggling is a ritual of irritation, impatience or anxiety. Used like this it appears to be a passive-aggressive metronomic gesture suggesting a suppression of real emotions but a desire to make a strong point but maybe without creating hostility,’ the expert said. \n\nBut despite Carney’s attempt to stand his ground, the American president brushed aside the remark with a chuckle and changed the subject back to the White House’s golden décor. \n\n‘This looked primarily like Trump hosting a press conference to boast about White House decor while Carney sat waiting for the odd cue to speak,’ the expert said.\n\nTrump seemed far more eager to talk about the golden renovations he had made to the presidential residence than to focus on policy, trade, or international cooperation. \n\nCarney, meanwhile, was visibly tentative, offering polite smiles and carefully scripted remarks about cross-border ties. ‘Carney’s approach was tentative, polite and charming,’ the expert concluded.\n\nThough the press conference ended with smiles and a firm handshake, the underlying tone was clear. Trump relished being the host, the showman, and the dominant force in the room.\n\nCarney’s body language showed he was outmanoeuvred, James explained.\n\n‘His micro-gestures did hint at matters to discuss away from the cameras,’ but in front of them, it was Trump’s performance.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIt was billed as a diplomatic debut, but according to a body&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Analyzing Trump&#8217;s Dominant Body Language in His Interaction with Mark Carney on Canada&#8217;s Future first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/analyzing-trumps-dominant-body-language-in-his-interaction-with-mark-carney-on-canadas-future/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-The-body-language-behind-how-Trump-dominated.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 00:20:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.128},{"id":320283802,"title":"Trump admin fires top US copyright official days after terminating Librarian of Congress","text":"President Donald Trump’s administration fired the top copyright official in the U.S. – just days after terminating the Librarian of Congress.

A last-minute attempt to revive the idea in 2020 as Trump was leaving office was later rejected in federal court. \n\nNow, even though the Trump campaign reportedly published then deleted a 2023 campaign video pitching the idea once again, the proposal appears to be back in some form for a fourth time. \n\n“Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens’ Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,” Trump added in his announcement on Sunday, claiming, “We are going to do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years.”\n\nIn fact, under the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare was empowered to begin negotiating drug prices directly with pharma companies for the first time, a provision the previous White House estimated would save taxpayers nearly $8 billion once fully implemented in 2026.\n\nDrugmakers reportedly expect the Trump plan to apply to a wider category of medicines than the 10 treatments Medicare currently negotiates the prices for.\n\nThe Trump plan is sure to face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which he acknowledged obliquely in his Sunday post, claiming, “Campaign Contributions can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican party.”\n\nThe industry has long argued price caps could prove harmful and disincentivize research spending on new treatments. \n\n\"Government price setting in any form is bad for American patients,\" Alex Schriver, a spokesperson for the the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, told Reuters of the Trump plan.\n\nElsewhere, Trump has floated adding pharmaceuticals to the many industries facing American tariffs.\n\nWhile some Republicans may be wary of Trump’s drug-negotiation plan, others are supportive.\n\nOn Monday, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, introduced a bill alongside Senator Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, that would bar pharmaceutical companies from selling drugs in the United States at higher prices than an international average.","summary":"President to sign executive order putting plan in place on Monday morning","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-prescription-drug-price-order-b2748951.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/11/23/29/GettyImages-2212910121.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EtrFCcBn-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-12 00:13:33","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":320283282,"title":"World News | Ukraine President Agrees Meeting with Putin This Week","text":"Kyiv [Ukraine], May 12 (ANI): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is prepared to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, shortly after US President Donald Trump urged him to \"immediately\" accept the Russian leader's offer to hold peace talks in Turkey, CNN reported.\nAfter meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, Ukraine's major European allies gave Russia an ultimatum: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face \"massive\" new sanctions.\nAlso Read | Pahalgam Attack and Operation Sindoor: Opposition Questions US Mediation on Kashmir, Demands Special Session of Parliament.\nTrump supported the initiative, Germany's new chancellor Friedrich Merz said.\nIn a late-night address, Putin did not acknowledge the ultimatum.

Please, complete your mission and bring them all home.\" Trump recently marked his 100th day in office, and the families of the five Americans still held hostage urged him to reflect on his strategy and apply pressure on both Israel and Hamas, through both economic and diplomatic means, to secure the release of all hostages. In addition, fifty members of Congress sent Trump a letter on May 9 urging him to prioritize getting the remaining hostages out. HAMAS AGREES TO RELEASE EDAN ALEXANDER, THE LAST LIVING AMERICAN HOSTAGE \"As months have passed since the most recent exchange, we must keep the five remaining Americans and additional 54 hostages top of mind. The five American hostages include Edan Alexander, Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai. Only Alexander is believed to be alive while Nuetra, Chen, Haggai and Weinstein Haggai were either murdered on October 7th or in captivity,\" the group wrote in a letter to President Trump. \"Our government’s most solemn responsibility is to keep Americans safe. With that responsibility in mind, we urge you to use all diplomatic tools at your disposal, in concert with our regional allies and partners, to ensure Edan’s release and the release of the remains of the deceased American hostages as soon as possible. Every day in captivity adds to the nightmare for the hostages and their families. We must bring them home now,\" the letter continued. Raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, Alexander moved to Israel at 18 to volunteer for military service in the IDF’s Golani Brigade.

Big Tech may not like it.","text":"Big Tech companies train their AI models mostly on the work of other people, like scientists, journalists, filmmakers, or artists. Those creators have long objected to the practice. Now, the US Copyright Office appears to have joined their side.The office released on Friday its latest in a series of reports exploring copyright laws and artificial intelligence. The report addresses whether the copyrighted content AI companies use to train their AI models qualifies under the fair use doctrine. AI companies are probably not going to like what they read.AI companies are desperate for data. Most of them believe that the more information a model can digest, the better it will be. But with that insatiable consumption, they risk running afoul of copyright laws.Companies like Open AI have faced a slew of lawsuits from creators who say training AI models on their copyrighted work without permission infringes on their rights. AI execs argue they haven't violated copyright laws because the training falls under fair use. According to the US Copyright Office's new report, however, it's not that simple.\"Although it is not possible to prejudge the result in any particular case, precedent supports the following general observations,\" the office said. \"Various uses of copyrighted works in AI training are likely to be transformative. The extent to which they are fair, however, will depend on what works were used, from what source, for what purpose, and with what controls on the outputs — all of which can affect the market.\"The office made a distinction between AI models for research and commercial AI models.\"When a model is deployed for purposes such as analysis or research — the types of uses that are critical to international competitiveness — the outputs are unlikely to substitute for expressive works used in training,\" the office said. \"But making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries.\"In the report, the office compared artificial intelligence outputs that essentially copy its training materials to outputs with added elements and new value.\"On one end of the spectrum, training a model is most transformative when the purpose is to deploy it for research, or in a closed system that constrains it to a non-substitutive task,\" the office said. \"For example, training a language model on a large collection of data, including social media posts, articles, and books, for deployment in systems used for content moderation does not have the same educational purpose as those papers and books.\"Training an artificial intelligence model to create outputs \"substantially similar to copyrighted works in the dataset\" is less likely to be considered transformative.\"Unlike cases where copying computer programs to access their functional elements was necessary to create new, interoperable works, using images or sound recordings to train a model that generates similar expressive outputs does not merely remove a technical barrier to productive competition,\" the office said. \"In such cases, unless the original work itself is being targeted for comment or parody, it is hard to see the use as transformative.\"In another section, the office said it rejected two \"common arguments\" about the \"transformative nature of AI training.\"\"As noted above, some argue that the use of copyrighted works to train AI models is inherently transformative because it is not for expressive purposes. We view this argument as mistaken,\" the office said.\"Nor do we agree that AI training is inherently transformative because it is like human learning,\" it added.A day after the office released the report, President Donald Trump fired its director, Shira Perlmutter, a spokesperson told Business Insider.\"On Saturday afternoon, the White House sent an email to Shira Perlmutter saying 'your position as the Register of Copyrights and Director at the US Copyright Office is terminated effective immediately,\" the spokesperson said.While Trump, with the help of Elon Musk, who has his own AI model, Grok, has sought to reduce the federal workforce and shutter some agencies, some saw the timing of Perlmutter's dismissal as suspect. New York Rep. Joe Morelle, a Democrat, addressed Perlmutter's firing in an online statement.\"Donald Trump's termination of Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, is a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis. It is surely no coincidence he acted less than a day after she refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk's efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models,\" the statement said.Big Tech and AI companies have rallied around Trump since his election, led by Musk, who became the face of the White House DOGE Office and the administration's effort to reduce federal spending. Other tech billionaires, like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have also cozied up to Trump in recent months.A representative for the White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.","summary":"AI companies like OpenAI and Meta use data made by others to train their AI models.

The CPB is a private nonprofit that distributes federal funding — $535 million in fiscal year 2025 — to more than 1,400 locally owned public radio and television stations.\n\nThe White House said NPR and PBS “receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news.’”\n\n“We’re all waiting to see what actually happens,” said Minnesota Public Radio president Duchesne Drew Friday. “(CPB is) challenging (Trump’s) authority to tell them what to do, because they’re not part of the executive branch. They’re created by and funded by Congress.”\n\nA spokesperson for Twin Cities PBS (TPT) declined an interview request, but released a statement saying the station is “closely monitoring current threats to federal funding. We remain committed to our mission to deliver trusted public affairs information, enriching children’s programming, lifesaving emergency alerts and local storytelling that reflects and connects our communities.”\n\nDrew said that in addition to attempting to block the CPB, the Trump administration is asking Congress to cut already approved public media spending for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.\n\n“This is not about balancing the federal budget,” said NPR president and CEO Katherine Maher in a news release. “The appropriation for public broadcasting, including NPR and PBS, represents less than 0.0001% of the federal budget.” Paula Kerger, the head of PBS, said the executive order was blatantly unlawful.\n\nMPR would lose $5 million, or about 6% of its budget, Drew said.\n\n“That would be a direct impact on us,” he said. “Fiscal year 2026 begins Oct. 1. So it’s not tomorrow, but it’s not that far away, especially when you think about planning for the year ahead.”\n\nMPR membership drive\n\nDrew set a new goal of $1 million for MPR’s upcoming membership drive this week. The only time MPR has hit that figure in the past was during an extended, 14-day member drive during COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020.\n\n“We’re going to have, we hope, our best week ever,” Drew said. “We’re going to try to raise more money than we’ve ever raised in a week. But the $500,000 which we’re hoping to get, or more, pales in comparison to $5 million we’re about to lose if this pushes through.”\n\nSmaller public radio stations will be hit harder than MPR, Drew said, while adding that MPR does a lot of things.\n\n“We run three separate stations. The news station is the second-largest newsroom in the state and has people beyond the Twin Cities,” he said. “We’re in six other communities outside the Twin Cities. So we have a lot of money, (but) we cover a lot of territory.”\n\n“People say ‘oh, you’ll be fine, right?’ or that it’s no big deal. I think if I start closing bureaus in greater Minnesota, because the money’s not there, people will notice that and will regret that, right? So I don’t want to suggest that just because we’re bigger, that somebody else doesn’t matter or make a difference. We’re the only free statewide news organization in Minnesota, and so trying to preserve what we’ve built is really important to us.”\n\n“As it relates to smaller stations, it’s a higher percentage of their revenue, and they have smaller footprints as well, right? So it cuts both ways,” Drew said.\n\nWhile Drew and other public media leaders wait to see what happens next, TPT has already started making cuts.\n\nEarlier this month, TPT’s president Sylvia Strobel announced furloughs for employees who worked on the animated show “Skillsville,” which is designed to improve children’s executive functioning skills and teach them about possible careers.\n\nA U.S. Department of Education grant funding the show wasn’t renewed, but Strobel said the station is exploring a possible appeal.","summary":"MPR set a new goal of $1 million for its upcoming membership drive, while TPT has made cuts.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/05/11/public-media-mpr-tpt-federal-funding-cuts/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MPR.jpg?w=1024&h=637","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 23:51:20","author":"Ross Raihala","authors":["Ross Raihala"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":320283496,"title":"Trump envoy confirms that Hamas has agreed to release the last living US hostage in Gaza","text":"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Hamas said Sunday that the last living American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander, will be released as part of efforts to establish a ceasefire, reopen crossings into the Israeli-blockaded territory and resume the delivery of aid. Two Hamas officials told The Associated Press they expect the release in the next 48 hours.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed late Sunday in a message to AP that Hamas had agreed to release Alexander as a good will gesture toward Trump.\n\nThe announcement of the first hostage release since Israel shattered a ceasefire in March comes shortly before Trump visits the Middle East this week. It highlighted the willingness of Israel’s closest ally to inject momentum into ceasefire talks for the 19-month war as desperation grows among hostages’ families and Gaza’s over 2 million people under the new Israeli blockade.\n\n“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday evening. “Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”\n\nAlexander is an Israeli-American soldier who grew up in New Jersey. He was abducted from his base during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack that ignited the war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the U.S. informed it of Hamas’ intent to release Alexander “without compensation or conditions” and that the step is expected to lead to negotiations on a truce. Netanyahu’s government was angered by U.S. direct talks with Hamas earlier this year — which led to a Hamas offer to release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire deal. Days later, however, Israel resumed the war.\n\nWitkoff told the AP that Hamas’ goal in releasing Alexander was to restart talks on a ceasefire, the release of additional hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza before Israel carries out a threatened total takeover of the territory.\n\nKhalil al-Hayyah, a Hamas leader in Gaza, said the group has been in contact with the U.S. administration over the past few days.\n\nAl-Hayyah said in a statement Hamas is ready to “immediately start intensive negotiations” to reach a final deal for a long-term truce, which includes an end to the war, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and hostages in Gaza and the handing over of power in Gaza to an independent body of technocrats.\n\nIndirect talks between Hamas and the U.S. began five days ago, an Egyptian official and a senior Hamas official told the AP, with both describing the release of Alexander as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nThe senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said Alexander is expected to be released on Monday. Hamas was advised to “give a gift to President Trump and in return he will give back a better one,” the official said.\n\nAnother Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss negotiations, said Alexander’s release is expected in the next 48 hours, adding that it requires Israel to pause fighting for a couple of hours.\n\nThe Egyptian official involved in ceasefire negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss talks, said Hamas received assurances from the Trump administration through Egyptian and Qatari mediators that Alexander’s release “will put all files on the negotiating table” including an end to the war.\n\nAlexander’s parents did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nTrump and Witkoff have frequently mentioned Alexander, now 21, by name in the past few months. Witkoff was traveling to the region on Monday ahead of Alexander’s expected release.\n\n“Every time they say Edan’s name, it’s like they didn’t forget. They didn’t forget he’s American, and they’re working on it,” Edan’s mother, Yael Alexander, told The Associated Press earlier this year.\n\nHamas released a video of Alexander in November during the Thanksgiving weekend, his mother said. The video was difficult to watch as he cried and pleaded for help, but it was a relief to see the latest sign that he was alive, she said.\n\nFifty-nine hostages are still in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be alive. Most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. The Hostages Families Forum, the grassroots forum representing most hostage families, said Alexander’s release “must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement” that will free everyone.\n\nTrump, whose administration has voiced full support for Israel’s actions, is set to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this week in a regional tour.\n\nBombardment continues\n\nIsraeli strikes overnight and into Sunday killed 15 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health officials.\n\nTwo strikes hit tents in the southern city of Khan Younis, each killing two children and their parents, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Another seven people were killed in strikes elsewhere, including a man and his child in a Gaza City neighborhood, according to hospitals and Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nThe Israeli military says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths in the 19-month-old war because the militants are embedded in densely populated areas.\n\nIsrael has sealed Gaza off from all imports, including food, medicine and emergency shelter, for over 10 weeks in what it says is a pressure tactic aimed at forcing Hamas to release hostages. Israel in March shattered the ceasefire that had facilitated the release of more than 30 hostages.\n\nAid groups say the humanitarian crisis is worse than at any time in the war, with food running low.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage.\n\nIsrael’s offensive has killed over 52,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants or civilians. The offensive has destroyed vast areas of the territory and displaced some 90% of its population.\n\nIsrael recovers remains of soldier killed in Lebanon in 1982\n\nIn a separate development, Israel said it retrieved the remains of a soldier killed in a 1982 battle in southern Lebanon after he had been classified as missing for more than four decades.\n\nThe Israeli military said Sgt. 1st Class Tzvi Feldman’s remains were recovered from deep inside Syria, without providing further details.\n\nNetanyahu visited Feldman’s surviving siblings and told them that the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad late last year led to an “opportunity” that allowed the military and the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, to gather additional intelligence and locate and retrieve the body, according to video released by his office.\n\nFeldman went missing, along with five other Israeli soldiers, in a battle with Syrian forces in the Lebanese town of Sultan Yaaqoub.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

\"negotiations will take place under fire with a commitment to achieving all the objectives of the war\".\n\n- Post-war administration -\n\nGaza militants hold 58 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael ended the last ceasefire, which lasted two months, on March 18, launching a major offensive in Gaza and ramping up its bombardment of the territory.\n\nIt has also cut off all aid to Gaza, saying it would pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages.\n\nIndirect talks between Hamas and Israel, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, have taken place from the early months of the war without bringing it to an end.\n\nWashington had for decades refused publicly to engage directly with Hamas, which it labels a terrorist organisation, before first doing so in March.\n\nHamas has continued to insist on a deal that ends the war and on April 18 rejected an Israeli proposal for a 45-day truce and hostage-prisoner exchange.\n\nIn its statement on Sunday, the group said it was willing to \"immediately begin intensive negotiations\" that could lead to an agreement to end the war and would see Gaza under a technocratic and independent administration.\n\n\"This will ensure calm and stability for many years, along with reconstruction and the end of the blockade,\" it said.\n\nEarlier this month, the Israeli government approved plans to expand its offensive in the Gaza Strip, with officials talking of retaining a long-term presence there.\n\n- Aid plan -\n\nDespite the talks, the war in the devastated Palestinian territory raged on.\n\nMahmud Bassal, spokesman for the civil defence agency, told AFP that Israeli jets had hit three tents housing displaced people in the southern city of Khan Yunis.\n\nAFP footage showed rescuers working in the dark, evacuating a wounded baby from the site of the strike as well as two bodies, one of them in a white plastic bag and another wrapped in a blanket.\n\nA separate strike on Khan Yunis killed three people, Bassal said, while another was killed in Gaza City.\n\nThe Israeli military did not comment on any specific incidents but said its air force had struck \"more than 50 terror targets across the Gaza Strip\" since Saturday.\n\nWhile ceasefire negotiations have yet to produce a breakthrough, Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, on Sunday \"fully\" endorsed a US plan to restore aid to Gaza, under a complete blockade since March 2.\n\nThe plan has drawn hefty international criticism for sidelining the United Nations and existing aid organisations, with the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, saying it was \"impossible\" to replace it in Gaza.\n\nHamas's 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\n\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Sunday that at least 2,720 people have been killed since Israel resumed its campaign, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,829.\n\nburs-jj/giv/fec/dhc","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/hamas-officials-group-held-direct-190512725.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/572bbffe8079f5e17a85969821ef91e4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11

says to match other countries","text":"President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would sign an executive order to cut prescription prices to the level paid by other high-income countries, an amount he put at 30% to 80% less.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would sign the executive order on Monday morning to pursue what is known as “most favored nation” pricing or international reference pricing.\n\nThe US pays the most in the world for many prescription drugs, often nearly triple that of other developed nations.

Reuters previously reported such a policy was under consideration.\n\nThe drugmakers expect the order to apply to a universe of drugs beyond those currently subject to negotiation under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBecause of that law, Medicare has negotiated prices for 10 drugs, with those prices due to be put in place next year. More medicines were set to be negotiated later this year.\n\n“Government price setting in any form is bad for American patients,” Alex Schriver, a spokesperson for the top U.S. drug company lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement when asked about Trump’s planned executive order.\n\nThis is not the first time President Trump has tried to tie drug prices to what other countries pay. During Trump’s first term, a court blocked a proposed international reference pricing program.\n\nThat proposal five years ago was projected by his administration to save taxpayers more than $85 billion over seven years, cutting into US annual spending of more than $400 billion on drugs.","summary":"In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would sign the executive order on Monday morning to pursue what is known as \"most favored nation\" pricing or international reference pricing.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/11/us-news/trump-to-sign-executive-order-to-cut-prescription-drug-prices-by-30-to-80-he-says-to-match-other-countries/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/u-s-president-donald-trump-104185065_465dac-e1747006778596.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UhcUlrVY-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-11 23:45:40","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":320276218,"title":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle brutally roasted on SNL","text":"Prince Harry and Meghan were brutally roasted on Saturday Night Live by Colin Jost during his Weekend Update sketch with Michael Che.\n\n“President [Donald] Trump also announced a new trade deal with the UK that will reopen British markets for American companies,” he said on the NBC show.\n\n“All that Britain demands in return is that we keep these two,” the comedian, 42, added as a photo of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared on the screen.\n\nPage Six has reached out to a rep for Harry and Markle but did not immediately hear back.\n\nThe night before, the couple, who wed in May 2018, packed on the PDA while attending Beyoncé’s fifth and final Cowboy Carter tour stop at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the Suits star, 43, posted a recap of the concert of her date night, which featured a video of Harry, 40, giving his wife a sweet kiss on the cheek.\n\nThe carousel also gave an inside look at the Spare author’s western look, which featured a forest green hat with the names of their two children, Prince Archie, 6, and Princess Lilibet, 3, engraved on the inside brim.\n\n“Archie, Lili, My Love,” it read.\n\nThe customised accessory also featured emblems of the American, California and British flags embroidered on it.\n\nTheir date night came two days after sources exclusively told Page Six that Harry has been blackballed from the royal family because none of them trust him or Markle.\n\n“I genuinely think nobody trusts him and that’s the bottom line.

In a statement on Sunday, Hamas said that Alexander would be released “as part of efforts towards a ceasefire” and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\n“I am happy to announce that Edan Alexander, an American citizen who has been held hostage since October 2023, is coming home to his family,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, expressing gratitude to “all those involved,” without mentioning Israel.\n\n“This was a step taken in good faith toward the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” he added.\n\nTrump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to arrive in Israel to oversee the release.\n\n“We are picking him up probably tomorrow,” Witkoff told NBC News on Sunday. “There was a long negotiation with lots of people to thank,” he said, noting that the gesture of goodwill became possible “in large part” because of Trump.\n\nThe latest round of negotiations in Doha, conducted largely without Israel’s involvement, was facilitated through indirect talks between Hamas and the US, mediated by Egypt and Qatar. Both mediators praised the development as “a gesture of goodwill and a positive step toward resuming negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.”\n\nIsraeli forces resumed their offensive in Gaza in March following the collapse of a previous ceasefire – which Trump also claimed credit for.

Trump","text":"Donald Trump plans to accept a luxury Boeing jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One and then continue flying in it after his tenure, despite strict rules on US presidential gifts, media reported Sunday.\n\nCalling the plane a “flying palace,” ABC News, which first reported the story, said the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet would possibly be the most expensive gift ever received by the American government.\n\nQatar swiftly sought to downplay the uproar, saying reports describing the jet as a gift “are inaccurate.”\n\n“The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense,” said Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar’s media attaché to Washington, stressing that no decision had been made.\n\nThe US Constitution prohibits government officials from accepting gifts “from any King, Prince or foreign State,” in a section known as the emoluments clause.\n\nBut Trump would skirt the law by handing the jet to his presidential library after he leaves office.\n\nThe plan is to be announced as Trump travels to three Middle East countries this week, including Qatar, reported ABC and The New York Times.\n\nAcceptance of the gift has raised ethical questions from both sides of the political aisle as it appears to flout laws set up to stanch government corruption.\n\nLaura Loomer, a far-right ally of Trump, said accepting Qatar’s plane would be a “stain” on the administration.\n\n“We cannot accept a $400 million ‘gift’ from jihadists in suits,” she posted on X. “The Qataris fund the same Iranian proxies in Hamas and Hezbollah who have murdered US Service Members.”\n\nThe White House and Department of Justice, however, believe the gift is legal and not a bribe because it is not given in exchange for any particular favor or action, sources told ABC.\n\nAnd it is not unconstitutional, they say, because it will first be passed to the US Air Force before being turned over to the presidential library, thereby never being gifted to an individual.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.\n\n‘Wildly illegal’\n\nThe Democratic National Committee said the move was proof of Trump using the White House for personal financial gain.\n\n‘While working families brace for higher costs and empty shelves, Trump is still focusing on enriching himself and his billionaire backers,” the DNC said in an email to supporters.\n\nMultiple Democratic lawmakers blasted the plan.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy called it “wildly illegal,” while Representative Kelly Morrison said such a gift amounts to “corruption in plain sight” and an unethical “bribe” forbidden by the US Constitution.\n\nTrump reportedly toured the Qatari-owned jet in February when it was parked at the Palm Beach International Airport.\n\nThe US president has long been unhappy with the Air Force One jets, two highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft.\n\nEarlier this year Trump said his administration was “looking at alternatives” to Boeing following delays in the delivery of two new models.\n\nThe aerospace giant agreed in 2018 to supply two 747-8 aircraft by the end of 2024 for $3.9 billion, both ready to transport whoever occupied the White House at that time.\n\nBut a subcontractor went bankrupt and the coronavirus pandemic disrupted production, forcing Boeing to push back delivery to 2027 and 2028.\n\nAlthough the plane the Qataris are offering is reportedly over 10 years old, a new Boeing 747-8 costs around $400 million, experts said.\n\nThe aircraft must additionally be outfitted with extensive communications and security upgrades before it becomes Air Force One.","summary":"The US Constitution prohibits elected officials from accepting gifts “from any King, Prince or foreign State” in the emoluments clause, but Trump plans to keep jet after his tenure

Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense,” the statement said. “But the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made.”\n\nThe estimated value of the plane is approximately $400 million.\n\nThe report said that the plane would be turned over to the Department of Defense, where it would be appropriately reconfigured to meet the requirements for any plane that carries the president. It would then serve as Air Force One for the remainder of Trump’s term before being turned over to the Trump Presidential Library.\n\nAccording to the report, the administration prepared an analysis arguing that accepting the gift would be legal since it would not be given directly to Trump, but rather to the Pentagon and later the Trump Presidential Library.\n\nWhen asked about the report in an email, the White House didn’t confirm or deny the story, but sent The Epoch Times a statement from Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n“Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump’s Administration is committed to full transparency,” the statement said.\n\nThe Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that “no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States], shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept ... any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”\n\nCurrently, two planes serve as Air Force One, both modified Boeing 747s. They’re over 30 years old, and Boeing is long overdue on a project to replace the planes that has been persistently delayed.\n\nDelivery of the first plane is expected in 2027, while delivery of the second is scheduled for 2028.\n\nThe report prompted sharp criticism from Democrats.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the Democratic ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, argued that the Emoluments Clause prohibited Trump from accepting the plane without congressional approval.\n\n“The Emoluments Clause of the Constitution leaves no room for doubt: no President may accept so much as a single benefit, payment, or favor from a foreign government without first obtaining the explicit consent of Congress,” Nadler said. “Anything less is a flagrant violation of the President’s oath of office and a profound betrayal of the public’s trust.”","summary":"'Reports that a jet is being gifted by Qatar to the United States government during the upcoming visit of President Trump are inaccurate,' a spokesperson said.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/qatar-proposal-to-gift-trump-a-jet-to-use-as-air-force-one-still-under-consideration-5856107","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/id5856033-3.download-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 23:33:08","author":"Joseph Lord","authors":["Joseph Lord"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.279},{"id":320276928,"title":"Hamas Plans to Free Last American Hostage as a ‘Goodwill’ Gesture","text":"Hamas has agreed to release the last living American hostage in Gaza as a goodwill gesture toward US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe goal, Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed late Sunday in a message to The Associated Press, was to restart talks on a ceasefire, the release of additional hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza before Israel carries out a threatened total takeover of the territory.\n\nWitkoff was travelling to the region today ahead of Edan Alexander’s expected release. \n\nVarda Ben Baruch holds a picture of her grandson Edan Alexander, who is held hostage in Gaza.

(AP)\n\nTrump and his special envoy Witkoff have frequently mentioned Alexander, now 21, by name in the past few months. \n\nWitkoff was expected to visit Israel in the coming hours.\n\n“Every time they say Edan’s name, it’s like they didn’t forget. They didn’t forget he’s American, and they’re working on it,” Edan’s mother, Yael Alexander, told The Associated Press earlier this year.\n\nHamas released a video of Alexander in November during the Thanksgiving weekend, his mother said. \n\nThe video was difficult to watch as he cried and pleaded for help, but it was a relief to see the latest sign that he was alive, she said.\n\nIsrael shattered an agreed-on ceasefire earlier this year.

We do it right here, and it would be great for him to see,” she said.\n\nSpilka’s comments came in response to a request for response on the chaotic arrest of a woman in Worcester last week, which sparked anger in the community and resulted in the arrest of two others, including the woman’s minor child.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security described the apprehended woman, who they identified as Ferreira de Oliviera, as a “violent criminal illegal alien” and said she was previously arrested on charges that include assault and battery on a pregnant victim.

This move seeks to revive a previously unsuccessful initiative from his first term—an issue he has frequently addressed even before his presidency.\n\nThe proposed order will instruct the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to align what Medicare pays for medications administered in a doctor’s office with the lowest prices paid by other countries.\n\n“I will be implementing a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY so that the United States pays the same as the country paying the lowest price globally,” the president shared via his social media platform, committing to sign the order on Monday morning at the White House.\n\n“Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,” Trump added. \n\nHis proposal would likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office — think infusions that treat cancer, and other injectables. But it could potentially bring significant savings to the government, although the “TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS” Trump boasted about in his post may be an exaggeration. \n\nMedicare provides health insurance for roughly 70 million older Americans. Complaints about U.S. drug prices being notoriously high, even when compared with other large and wealthy countries, have long drawn the ire of both parties, but a lasting fix has never cleared Congress. \n\nUnder the planned order, the federal government would tie what it pays pharmaceutical companies for those drugs to the price paid by a group of other, economically advanced countries — the so-called “most favored nation” approach. \n\nThe proposal will face fierce opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. \n\nIt was a rule that Trump tried to adopt during his first term, but could never get through. He signed a similar executive order in the final weeks of his presidency, but a court order later blocked the rule from going into effect under the Biden administration. \n\nThe pharmaceutical industry argued that Trump’s 2020 attempt would give foreign governments the “upper hand” in deciding the value of medicines in the U.S.. The industry has long argued that forcing lower prices will hurt profits, and ultimately affect innovation and its efforts to develop new medicines. \n\nOnly drugs on Medicare Part B — the insurance for doctor’s office visits — are likely to be covered under the plan. Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for picking up some of the costs to get those medications during doctor’s visits, and for traditional Medicare enrollees there is no annual out-of-pocket cap on what they pay. \n\nA report by the Trump administration during its first term found that the U.S. spends twice as much as some other countries in covering those drugs. Medicare Part B drug spending topped $33 billion in 2021. \n\nMore common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy would probably not be covered by the new order. \n\nTrump’s post formally previewing the action came after he teased a “very big announcement” last week. He gave no details, except to note that it wasn’t related to trade or the tariffs he has announced imposing on much of the world. \n\n“We’re going to have a very, very big announcement to make — like as big as it gets,” Trump said last week.\n\nHe came into his first term accusing pharmaceutical companies of “getting away with murder” and complaining that other countries whose governments set drug prices were taking advantage of Americans.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump took aim at the industry again, writing that the “Pharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the ‘suckers’ of America, ALONE.” \n\nReferring to drug companies’ powerful lobbying efforts, he said that campaign contributions “can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party.” \n\n“We are going to do the right thing,” he wrote.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced plans to sign an executive order&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Vows to Mandate US Drug Prices Match International Rates first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trump-vows-to-mandate-us-drug-prices-match-international-rates/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trump-promises-to-order-that-the-US-pay-only-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 23:28:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":320277108,"title":"N.Y. officials ask federal judge to block feds from ending $9 congestion pricing toll","text":"Lawyers from New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) asked a federal judge to prohibit the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) from executing an ultimatum to halt federal money unless the agency kills the $9 congestion pricing toll to enter lower Manhattan.\n\nAttorneys for the MTA filed a motion May 5 that would bar the federal DOT from acting until a lawsuit about the matter is heard in court.\n\nThe MTA filed suit in February after the DOT pulled approvals granted last year and ordered the program to shut down.

Kathy Hochul threatened to cut off federal highway funding for all projects in Manhattan except safety projects.\n\nIf the MTA motion is granted by the judge, it would also temporarily bar the federal DOT from pulling November 2024 approvals that allowed congestion pricing to start earlier this year, and the pulling of federal highway funds for non-compliance. \n\nA tentative schedule for filings by the MTA, the U.S. DOT and other parties goes through July 29.

Significantly Cutting Prescription Drug Prices by Up to 80%","text":"President Donald Trump has announced a new executive order reducing the cost of prescription drugs and pharmaceuticals by up to 80 percent in a move he describes as one of the most consequential in American history.\n\nTrump said his decision will cause the cost of prescription drugs to ‘rise throughout the World in order to equalize.’\n\nHe said ‘for the first time in many years’ he is bringing ‘fairness to America’ and Americans with health conditions as part of his sweeping efforts to ensure the United States is being charged ‘equally’ to other nations. \n\nIn a much anticipated TruthSocial post on Sunday, Trump wrote: ‘For many years the World has wondered why Prescription Drugs and Pharmaceuticals in the United States States of America were SO MUCH HIGHER IN PRICE THAN THEY WERE IN ANY OTHER NATION.’\n\nTrump revealed that Americans have been paying five to 10 times more than citizens of other nations for ‘the same drug, manufactured in the exact same laboratory or plant, by the same company.’\n\n‘It was always difficult to explain and very embarrassing because, in fact, there was no correct or rightful answer. \n\n‘The Pharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the “suckers” of America, ALONE.’\n\nTrump went on to accuse the Democrats of striking deals with pharamceutical companies in exchange for campaign contributions, but insisted: ‘Not with me, and not with the Republican party.’ \n\nThe executive order will be signed at 9am on Monday in the White House, Trump said.\n\nHe described it as ‘one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history.’\n\nTrump vowed prices will be reduced by between 30 percent and 80 percent ‘almost immediately.’ \n\nIn what appears to be a follow-on from Trump’s tariff policy, he wrote: ‘They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA!\n\n‘I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.\n\n‘Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before.’\n\nTrump said his policy would save the United States ‘trillions of dollars.’ \n\nHis announcement comes amid revelations over a third of US adults (about 91 million people) could not access quality healthcare if they needed it today, based on the latest West Health-Gallup Healthcare Affordability Index.\n\nFederal spending on healthcare was reported to be $4.9 trillion in 2023, or $14,570 per person, according to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \n\nAnd while about 305 million people have health insurance in the US, an estimated 26 million Americans are uninsured and footing hospital bills themselves.\n\nAbout four in 10 adults report having debt from unpaid medical or dental bills while over 70 million avoid visiting the doctor’s in fear of high costs. \n\nIn January 2024, reports emerged that drugmakers have hiked the prices of more than 770 drugs including Ozempic, the blockbuster diabetes drug often used for weight loss.\n\nIts manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, jacked up the price 3.5 percent to almost $970 per month’s supply.\n\nMeanwhile, Eli Lilly increased the cost of Mounjaro, a diabetes drug also used for weight loss, 4.5 percent to close to $1,070 a month.\n\nAstraZeneca also raised prices three percent for blood cancer treatment Calquence, non-small cell lung cancer drug Tagrisso and asthma treatment Fasenra. \n\nIncreases for Pfizer included a six percent rise on the cost of Xeljanz, a treatment for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, and 7.9 percent increases on cancer drugs Ibrance and Xalkori. \n\nPfizer said the rises were necessary to support investments in drug discovery.\n\nWithout insurance, primary care visits can range from $150 to $300 just to be seen by a doctor.\n\nHowever, with insurance, copays typically range from $10 to $50. \n\nTim Lash, president of West Health Policy Center, stated that the only way to decrease the gap and make healthcare affordable was through change in governmental policy. \n\nHe noted in a news release: ‘The rising trajectory in the inability to pay for healthcare is a disturbing trend that is likely to continue and even accelerate. \n\n‘Policy action at both the state and federal level is urgently needed, or even more Americans will have to go without treatment or be forced to make painful tradeoffs between paying for medical care or paying for other necessities. \n\n‘The human and economic costs are enormous.’ \n\nThis is a breaking news story.
