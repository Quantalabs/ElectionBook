The agency said Thursday it was restoring Radio Free Europe’s funding after a judge in Washington, D.C. ordered it to do so.\n\n“This is a decisive victory for press freedom and the First Amendment, and a sharp rebuke” to the Trump administration’s “utter disregard for the principles that define our democracy,” said the plaintiffs’ lawyer Andrew G. Celli Jr.\n\nAt a hearing Friday in Manhattan, Oetken faulted the Trump administration for “taking a sledgehammer to an agency that has been statutorily authorized and funded by Congress.”\n\nThe judge criticized the agency’s leadership, including special adviser Kari Lake, for pulling the plug “seemingly overnight” on the U.S. government’s global, soft-power megaphone with “no consideration of the effects.”\n\nOetken ruled after a coalition of Voice of America journalists, labor unions and the nonprofit journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders sued the Trump administration last week to block the cuts. Ultimately, they seek to have VOA return to the air.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued the shutdown violated a court’s finding during Trump’s first term that VOA journalists have a free-speech firewall protecting them from White House interference. Their absence from the airwaves has left a vacuum that’s being filled by “propagandists whose messages will monopolize global airwaves,” the plaintiffs said.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have accused Voice of America of a “leftist bias” and failing to project “pro-American” values to its worldwide audience, even though it is mandated by congress to serve as a non-partisan news organization.\n\nVoice of America went off the air soon after Trump issued an executive order on March 14 that pared funding to the Agency for Global Media and six other unrelated federal entities — part of his campaign to shrink government and align its with his political agenda.\n\nThe White House called the service “The Voice of Radical America” and said Trump’s order would “ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.” It cited coverage it said was “too favorable” to former President Joe Biden, as well as stories about white privilege, racial profiling and transgender migrants seeking asylum.\n\nCongress has appropriated nearly $860 million for the Agency for Global Media for the current fiscal year.\n\nThree federal lawsuits in Washington, D.C. are challenging other aspects of the cuts, including one brought by Voice of America’s director and three journalists. Oetken said he’ll rule at a later date on the government’s request to move his case there.\n\nVoice of America has operated since World War II, beaming news into authoritarian countries that don’t have a free press. It began as a counterpoint to Nazi propaganda and played a prominent role in the U.S. government’s Cold War efforts to curb the spread of communism.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Voice of America employees were told to finish their live broadcasts on March 15, then vacate the building. Soon after, the lawsuit said, they lost access to agency computer systems, including email. Voice of America’s news website hasn’t been updated since.\n\nLake, a former TV news anchor and political candidate, said she has been determining how many people are required to operate some of these outlets at the minimum staffing levels allowed by law.\n\nSome people have been brought back to work and at least one service — Radio Marti in Cuba — has returned to the air, Lake told One America News Network in an interview posted Thursday on X.\n\n“We’re going to get lawsuits,” Lake said. “This is just par for the course. We’ve been victims — President Trump has, I myself have — of ‘lawfare’. It’s the same cast of characters that is trying to put landmines in the ways of every step President Trump and this administration is trying to do to get this government back in line to where we can actually afford it.”\n\nLake, echoing the White House’s complaints, said: “We want to make sure that these agencies are in line with what our American values are. We’re telling America’s story. We’re not telling our adversaries’ stories.”\n\n“By God,\" she said, “we’re not going to be putting out anti-American garbage.”\n\nAssociated Press media writer David Bauder contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

These countries include: Sudan. Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, DR Congo and Venezuela.\n\nSudan, Venezuela, and Iran are all reportedly on the \"red\" list, meaning they could face outright travel bans. \n\nThe remaining nations are also featured on the proposed restrictions list in some capacity, leaving their World Cup participation in jeopardy.\n\nHow can this issue be resolved?\n\nWith the Mundial less than a year away, discussions are already underway to find a resolution. \n\nAs reported by beIN Sports, FIFA has begun talks with the U.S. government to explore potential exemptions for affected teams. \n\nGiven that FIFA mandates host nations to ensure that all qualified teams can participate, pressure is mounting on U.S. officials to provide assurances that players from restricted countries will be able to enter the country.\n\nIf the travel ban is enforced, it could set a dangerous precedent, undermining the integrity of the World Cup and excluding teams based on political decisions rather than sporting merit. \n\nAs the situation develops, FIFA, national football federations, and human rights groups are expected to weigh in on the debate, with hopes of finding a solution that upholds the principles of fair play and inclusivity in global football.\n\nSource: YEN.com.gh","summary":"A further six countries could be blocked from playing at the 2026 World Cup in the US after being included in Donald Trump’s proposed travel ban list.","url":"https://yen.com.gh/sports/football/280442-6-countries-2026-world-cup-named-donald-trumps-travel-ban/","image":"https://cdn.yen.com.gh/images/1200x675/e779d65fe4ee8f9d.jpeg?v=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 00:55:53","author":"Isaac Darko,Samuel Obour","authors":["Isaac Darko","Samuel Obour"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.118},{"id":305344222,"title":"Katie Thurston announces devastating update on cancer battle aged just 34","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Mar 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChilling details emerge about day wealthy doctor 'tried to kill' his 'perfect' wife in Hawaiian paradise\n\nTrump reveals the two-word reason he really wants Greenland as he issues ominous new threat\n\nSick father admits raping his newborn baby to death while his wife left the house to buy more nappies\n\nTorment of Jade Goody's mum: As Jeff Brazier takes legal action to stop her seeing grandson Freddy, KATIE HIND reveals secret reason for feud\n\nThere's something eerily Orwellian about Donald Trump's America, where truth is dismissed as a lie, and lies are disseminated as truth: ANDREW NEIL\n\nSydney Sweeney and Glen Powell reignite romance rumors after actress calls off wedding\n\nBronzed Kerry Katona is back in her £200k Lambo following crash - after saying how 'proud' she is for bouncing back after being bankrupt and almost dying - with a little help from OnlyFans\n\nMillions face paying back some of their state pension to HMRC in a stealth tax raid.

'However, given that I am triple positive and the spots on my liver are fairly small and detected early, I feel very optimistic on my outcome.'\nShe also expressed feeling 'very confident' with her doctors and medical team.\nIn her caption, she wrote, '43 days since diagnosis and still no treatment? There is a lot of testing and prep that goes into cancer treatment. One important test is checking to see if the cancer has metastasized (spread). Unfortunately for me, mine has and I am now #stage4breastcancer . I’ll finally start my treatment next week.' \n\n Bachelorette star's surprise wedding amid breast cancer battle \nKatie also answered some questions from fans on her Stories. When asked 'how scared are you?' she answered: 'Scared: 0, Sad: 7, Pain: 5, Tired: 10, Ready: 100.' \nOne fan asked Katie whether she needs to have a mastectomy.\n'That'll be a choice down the road,' she wrote, adding, 'Given my circumstances I'll probably opt for a double mastectomy with breast reconstruction which is covered by insurance. Some options are implants or DIEP Flap (which uses my own fat).'\nKatie also shared two photos of herself in a hospital bed. One featured a lengthy caption.\n'Today I would have finally started treatment. But instead I have an appointment to discuss the suspicious spot found on my liver during my PET scan. And after that meeting, while still digesting the information, I'm heading to CNN for another interview. Why? Because this needs to be talked about more.'\n'Whatever is happening amongst younger women is scary. It's not normal. And current medical standards haven't shifted when it comes to mammogram schedules, leaving women to find out later about their diagnosis,' she went on.\n'Last summer when I first felt that lump, I would have been more proactive had I known there was a rise in young breast patients happening. Shout about it to your sister, your friend, your co-worker, your significant other.'\n\n'After days of waiting, unfortunately, I did find out today that my breast cancer has spread to the liver,' she shared with fans in an Instagram video on Friday\n\nShe shared that the cancer has metastasized, putting her from stage 3 into stage 4\n\n'It is fairly small, however it does put me at stage four,' she added. The reality star, who also shared two photos from a hospital bed, revealed she will begin her new treatment plan, which includes chemotherapy, next Friday\n\nDespite the scary health diagnosis, Katie shared that she is 'optimistic' as the cancer was caught early on\n\nEarlier in the day she shared another hospital photo with a lengthy caption, writing, 'Whatever is happening amongst younger women is scary. It's not normal'\n\nAnother fan asked, 'What is the treatment plan for your liver?'\nKatie replied: 'The plan is essentially the same as my breast cancer. The cancer that is within the liver is from the breast cancer spreading vs a new type of cancer. So in basic terms, my breast cancer is the root and will be the focus. Six rounds of chemotherapy to start.'\nSomeone else asked her about the first thing she'll do after she rings 'the bell' - a symbolic and celebratory tradition that marks the completion of a phase of treatment, most commonly chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n'Jeff and I are re-doing our trip to Maui and to the fullest. We were in Maui when I got the call and it really stole the trip from us,' she replied.\nAnother person asked, 'Who will go to appointments with you when hubby is back on tour?'\nKatie wrote: 'My treatment is spaced out as six treatments to start, three weeks apart. A treatment is essentially a dedicated day to travel/infusions/recovery. He will probably miss the first three but the good news is, if I'm up for it, I can still travel to where he is as early as the next day.'\nAs for how this has impacted her views on mortality and life, Katie wrote: 'I know long term, a lot will change for me. In the immediate mindset, I've been both pleased and disappointed by who I have and haven't heard from.'\nShe added, 'Ultimately, not everyone is meant to be in your life forever. Some people are simply a season. Thank them for their time and move onward.' \n\nKatie also answered some questions from fans on her Stories. When asked 'how scared are you?' she answered: 'Scared: 0, Sad: 7, Pain: 5, Tired: 10, Ready: 100'\n\nKatie shared that she'll 'probably opt for a double mastectomy with breast reconstruction' down the road\n\nSpeaking about the next treatment steps, she wrote: 'The cancer that is within the liver is from the breast cancer spreading vs a new type of cancer. So in basic terms, my breast cancer is the root and will be the focus. Six rounds of chemotherapy to start'\n\nAfter completing treatment, Katie and Jeff plan to return to Maui \n\nShe revealed that Jeff will probably miss her first three treatments due to work\n\nAs for how this has impacted her views on mortality and life, Katie wrote: 'I know long term, a lot will change for me.

No?”\n\nMr Albanese defended his government’s action on the housing crisis when questioned later, but spent most of the press conference talking up Medicare and attacking Mr Dutton’s health credentials.\n\nThe PM has leaned heavily on his government’s investment in Medicare and health services during the early hours of the election campaign, including talking up the opening of 87 Urgent Care Clinics and expanded access to bulk billing.\n\nIf re-elected, Mr Albanese has pledged to open a further 50 clinics across the country and deliver an additional 18 million free GP visits each year. He has also pledged to continue to expand the PBS and fast-track training for GPs and doctors. \n\n‘Out to win’: Albo’s battle cry in Dutton country\n\nMr Albanese lashed the Coalition’s shadow cabinet, saying they’re “not ready for government”.\n\nAsked if he was “going on the offensive” by choosing to campaign first in Mr Dutton’s seat, Mr Albanese said “I’m out to win”, as he spruiked the opening of 87 new urgent care clinics and an expansion of bulk billing.\n\n“I’m out to win here,” he said.\n\n“I want a majority Labor government.\n\n“I want the last seven elections that produced seven different prime ministers… Isn’t just what we’ll do going forward.”\n\nThe PM said the current Labor government was “the most stable of my lifetime”, and hit out at Mr Dutton’s cabinet, even forgetting the name of opposition health spokeswoman Anne Ruston. \n\n“Their team, you look at them – they are not ready for government,” Mr Albanese said.\n\n“My team is a competent, considered government that gets things done, that is making a positive difference to people’s lives.\n\n“We are turning the corner. Let’s not go back.”\n\nThe PM pushed back against comparisons between Mr Dutton and Donald Trump, but admitted it was “quite clear policies he put forward are things that have been borrowed”.\n\nMr Albanese was at the medical centre to spruik Labor’s policy on Medicare and investments in health, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers calling the May 3 poll a “referendum” on Medicare.\n\nAli France, Labor’s candidate for the electorate of Dickson, pushed back against suggestions it was “third time and out” as she takes another attempt at unseating Mr Dutton.\n\n“I think there’s a real risk in Peter Dutton becoming our prime minister, but also staying as the local member,” she said.\n\n“He’s been here for 24 years. I think it’s time for a change here in this electorate, and I feel really happy about being able to do this for the third time.” \n\nDutton eyes Greens fight back \n\nPeter Dutton’s first campaign visit on the campaign trail will be in the Greens-held electorate of Brisbane. \n\nThe Opposition Leader will hold his day one campaign doorstop at the iconic XXXX brewery, which also borders the seat of Griffith – held by Greens housing firebrand Max Chandler-Mather on a healthy margin of 10.5 per cent. \n\nThe Liberals lost the seat of Brisbane to Green’s Stephen Bates in 2022.\n\nMr Bates holds the electorate on a slim 3.7 per cent margin.\n\nThe Coalition wants to win back the seat of Brisbane with the electorate’s former MP Trevor Evans, who lost to Mr Bates at the 2022 election.\n\n‘Trump-lite’: Dutton rebuffs ‘playbook’ claim\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has rejected claims Australia would be getting a “Donald Trump lite” if he claims victory this federal election, despite embracing some of the controversial president’s populist policies, including cutting the public service and cracking down on immigration.\n\nThe Liberal leader claimed he would bring down energy prices and touted the party’s nuclear energy plans – which he said were being embraced in the US and the UK – in an interview with Today show host Clint Stanaway, as the first full day of campaigning got underway on Saturday.\n\nMr Dutton is in Brisbane, a key battleground seat won by Greens MP Stephen Bates off the Liberal National Party at the 2022 election at a margin of 7.5 per cent. \n\nAsked about his embrace of US-style policy pledges “straight out of the Trump playbook”, Mr Dutton denied Australia would get a “Donald Trump lite” in a new Liberal government, and instead recalled popular Coalition governments of the past.\n\n“I think we’re getting a version of what Liberal governments have been like before, if you look at the Howard government,” Mr Dutton said.\n\n“In the case of the Albanese government, there’s always a mess to clean up. \n\n“We need to spend money wisely. Every family is feeling the pinch at the moment, and there’s 29,000 small businesses who have collapsed over the past two and a half years (and) a record number in our country of the past 12 months.\n\n“What that means is families have lost their homes, they’ve lost their savings, and we have to make sure we can put in place an economy that works for and not against Australians.”\n\nMr Dutton said Australia could not afford another three years under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and that a Liberal government would help to build more homes and “deliver a safer community”.\n\nOn immigration, Mr Dutton claimed new arrivals “needed a place to live” and were forcing Australians out of housing. \n\n“I’m just not going to tolerate that,” he said.\n\n“I want to make sure we’ve got Australians front of mind, and that’s exactly what our policies indicate.”\n\nBoth Labor and the Liberals have put blame for the housing crisis in some part on increased immigration since lockdowns lifted years ago, but the actual impact it has on the market has been disputed.\n\nAustralian Institute senior economist Matt Grundoff said it was tax breaks for investors that were driving up prices in a piece released on Friday, not immigration.\n\n“Despite what you may have been told, over the past 10 years, housing supply has actually grown faster than the population,” he said.\n\nOpposition vow cheaper power bills in 9 months \n\nEarlier, Peter Dutton argued belligerent gas companies who have opposed the Coalition’s plans to lower gas exports have been “gaming the system”. \n\nSpeaking to Sunrise from Brisbane on Saturday, he said injecting more gas into Australia’s grid, instead of exporting it offshore would bring down electricity prices. \n\n“If the gas companies are telling you that this is bad, that’s because, frankly, many of them are gaming the system,” he said.\n\n“I want to be on the side of consumers, and when you see big energy users like Blue Scope making steel for houses and right across the economy… say that it’s good because their gas price is going to come down, (and) therefore they can pass on savings to consumers.\n\n“That is deflationary in our economy. That’s exactly what we need now.”\n\nA BlueScope spokesperson said using locally-produced gas would be cheaper for businesses.\n\n“We do not believe that -imported gas can fulfil this need because it will be too costly once liquefaction, transport, storage and regasification costs are included,” a spokesman said.\n\nWith energy firming up to be a major election battleground, the Opposition Leader claimed increasing gas from domestic sources would bring down electricity bills by the end of this year.\n\n“By the end of this year, this calendar year, we can bring that gas into the system,” he said.\n\n“We’ve been working on this plan for months. We’ve been working with industry experts, and that’s how we can do it.”\n\nMr Dutton was also forced to defend the Coalition’s nuclear after he only mentioned the word twice in his budget reply speech. \n\nHowever he said nuclear would continue to be a policy priority, stating: “Energy is the economy”.\n\n“The Labor Party in the UK have just announced that they can’t reach net zero by 2050 without nuclear, and that’s true in our country as well,” he said.\n\n“So we need cleaner fuel, cleaner energy. We need to make sure that we’ve got a cheaper energy like we’re paying three times the cost for electricity of other countries at the moment, and that’s what’s smashing families.”\n\nBattle lines drawn over key Queensland seats \n\nLabor and the Greens have taken the fight to “Keep Dutton out” to his home turf of Queensland, with both parties expected to hold events during the first full day of campaigning in the Sunshine State.\n\nMore than 500 Greens supporters are expected to join leader Adam Bandt and Brisbane MPs Stephen Bates, Max Chandler-Mather, and Elizabeth Watson-Brown at Jagera Community Hall at 9.30am. \n\nThe party vowed “rain, hail, and shine” to campaign to “deliver the most progressive government Australia has ever seen”, and warned of a potential minority government between the Liberals and Bob Katter. \n\nThe Greens have vowed hold on to their seats in Brisbane’s inner suburbs, which were snagged during the 2022 election, despite both major parties eyeing potential gains in the first battleground state of the campaign. \n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese flew into Brisbane on day one of the campaign, only hours after announcing in Canberra on Friday morning that the next federal election would be held in just 36 days time on May 3.\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton was also in Brisbane on Friday for the first day of his five-week campaign tour, telling voters Australia was “going backwards” and accused the PM of being “out of touch” over planned tax cuts.\n\nMore to come","summary":"Campaigning for the May 3 election is underway, with the Prime Minister entering enemy territory and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton talking up his gas plan.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/federal-election/labor-greens-bring-keep-dutton-out-to-brisbane-as-liberals-eye-innercity-seats/news-story/bad10719e9819d51d23f63033bf0405f?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d305efe54edc5473fc64f5bc6e067376","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 00:45:58","author":"Jessica Wang,Nathan Schmidt","authors":["Jessica Wang","Nathan Schmidt"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":305343910,"title":"Skadden made a deal with Trump. Associates on the inside say they're worried it's the beginning of the end for the firm.","text":"Another Big Law domino has fallen at President Donald Trump's feet.Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono legal services \"to causes that the President and Skadden both support,\" Trump announced from the White House on Friday afternoon.The firm also affirmed its commitment to merit-based hiring and employee retention, Trump said. In a copy of the agreement that Trump shared on Truth Social, Skadden agreed that it would not \"engage in illegal DEI discrimination.\"In recent weeks, the president has targeted major law firms that have worked for and with his political opponents by revoking their security clearances and calling for a review of their government contracts. He also authorized Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to sanction law firms that file lawsuits they deem \"frivolous\" to this administration. In response, some Big Law firms have chosen to fight back in court, while others — like Skadden — have chosen to make deals with the president to avoid punitive executive actions.In a statement, Jeremy London, Skadden's Executive Partner, said the firm \"engaged proactively\" with the Trump administration to reach the agreement.\"The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Admin,\" London said. \"We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"Trump described the deal with Skadden as \"essentially a settlement.\"\"We appreciate Skadden coming to the table,\" Trump said.One current Skadden employee told Business Insider that they felt the deal betrayed the firm's values and represented an \"unforgivable affront\" to the firm's culture. They spoke with BI anonymously to speak freely about the situation, as did another who echoed their concerns but did not wish to be quoted. BI has verified their identities.\"In addition to arguably being the best law firm in the country, many associates, including myself, joined the firm because its culture aligned with our values marginally more than other top law firms. That culture, and its emphasis on equity and inclusion, goes back to the firm's origins,\" the employee said, referencing the fact that founding partners' Jewish and Catholic backgrounds barred them from holding top-level positions in the legal industry in 1948 when the firm was formed.The employee added: \"There is a general consensus among associates who are politically engaged, that a deal reached with the Trump administration will mark the beginning of the end for Skadden.\"\"Partners and associates are considering leaving, much of the firm is demoralized, and we will struggle to recruit the best talent for years to come,\" the Skadden employee said.Rachel Cohen, a now-former firm employee, publicly resigned from Skadden last week after she said the firm had not responded properly to Trump's threats against other firms, including Paul Weiss and Perkins Coie. She circulated an open letter among associates at other top firms who called for their employers to take stronger action in response to the administration's orders targeting Big Law.Skadden is the latest firm to reach an agreement with Trump amid his administration's challenges to the industry. Some lawyers and legal scholars previously told Business Insider that these targeted attacks on Big Law by the government are \"unprecedented\" and threaten not just the legal field but also the rule of law itself.Paul Weiss, which was named as one of the firms Trump was eyeing for executive countermeasures, ultimately brokered a deal with the administration. Trump rescinded his order against the firm in exchange for Paul Weiss' agreement to eliminate DEI considerations from its hiring practices and the firm's pledge of $40 million in pro bono legal services to initiatives endorsed by the Trump administration.Business Insider previously reported the language in Paul Weiss' copy of the agreement did not include references to DEI that were in Trump's announcement.Other firms targeted by Trump, such as Perkins Coie, the Elias Law Group, Jenner & Block, and WilmerHale have signaled that they will not back down and plan to fight executive orders in court. Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block have so far seen some success after the firm filed suit to challenge the order against it.Jenner & Block was granted a temporary restraining order on Friday, blocking the Trump administration from punishing the firm. The New York Times reported that US District Judge John Bates, who is overseeing the case, described the order against the firm as \"disturbing.\"US District Judge Beryl Howell on March 12 partially blocked Trump's order against Perkins Coie. Politico reported that during an emergency hearing, the judge said that the \"retaliatory animus\" of Trump's order against the firm was \"clear on its face\" and \"runs head-on into the wall of First Amendment protections.\"On March 21, the Justice Department filed a motion to disqualify Howell from overseeing the lawsuit, arguing the judge is \"insufficiently impartial\" to rule on the case.","summary":"Skadden is the latest Big Law domino to fall at Donald Trump's feet.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy NIOMI HARRIS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:26 GMT, 29 March 2025 |Updated:00:30 GMT, 29 March 2025 \n\nScarlett Thomas is reportedly set for a £2million payday as she's tipped to become a huge star.\nThe soap nepo-baby, 16, is the daughter of Coronation Street legend Tina O'Brien, 41, and former Corrie actor Ryan Thomas, 40. \nAnd while former couple Tina and Ryan have made a name for themselves on the small screen, it appears they may well be outshone by their rising star daughter as she forges a flourishing career.\nThe Sun reports that while Ryan and Tina have had tensions in the past, they've come together in strong support of their daughter, with a source noting the family have 'huge plans' for Scarlett (as well as her cousin Teddy) and 'spend hours' deliberating the best steps for their career. \nWith Scarlett making waves not only in her role on BBC's Waterloo Road but on social media too, industry experts told the publication that she could make 'at least £2million before she’s even 18.'\nAt the age of 14, the budding actress was quickly snapped up for her first major role on screen, winning the part of Izzie Charles in the BBC drama Waterloo Road. \n\nScarlett Thomas is reportedly set for a £2million payday as she's tipped to become a huge star \n\nThe soap nepo-baby, 16, is the daughter of Coronation Street legend Tina O'Brien , 41, and former Corrie actor Ryan Thomas , 40 (both pictured 2007)\nDuring her stint on the series, Scarlett starred alongside her uncle, former Emmerdale star Adam Thomas, 36. \nHe played her on-screen father, Donte, while his son Teddy, 9, who he shares with his wife Caroline Thomas, played his on-screen son. \nAnd it's not just on screens that she's popular, with the youngster's recent TikTok bagging nearly three million views, according to The Sun. \nShe has amassed over 165k followers on the site, with a further 138k fans over on Instagram - with both accounts launched when she turned 16 in October. \nAs well as her own, she regularly appears on her parents' social medias, with the Thomas family also having their own account.\nThis includes her famous uncles, actor Adam and Love Island star Scott, as well as Ryan's former TOWIE star fiancée Lucy Mecklenburgh. \nPR expert Lynn Carratt told the publication: 'It's clear they're a close-knit family who understand how to use social media effectively to build their careers. They capitalise on TikTok trends, and each member is talented in their own right.'\nShe added that from a PR perspective, the family's TikTok videos are an 'excellent platform' for displaying their talent to a 'huge audience'. \n\nWhile Tina and Ryan have made a name for themselves on the small screen, it appears they may well be outshone by their rising star daughter as she forges a flourishing career [pictured on Waterloo Road]\n\nWhile Ryan and Tina have had tensions in the past, they've come together in support of their daughter, with a source noting the family have 'huge plans' for Scarlett (and her cousin Teddy)\n\nWith Scarlett making waves not only in her role on Waterloo Road but on social media too, industry experts said that she could make 'at least £2million before she’s even 18'\n\n Ryan Thomas throws lavish sweet sixteenth for daughter - but mum Tina O'Brien is missing \nShe went on: 'Teddy is clearly talented, and it seems the children in the family will follow in their fathers’ footsteps. Scarlett often appears in videos with her dad and uncles, showcasing her singing and acting skills. With both parents in TV, their talent has clearly rubbed off on Scarlett. She comes across as a confident and likeable girl who is close to her family.\nLynn added: 'The Thomas family videos are strategically leveraging each other's personalities and showcasing their talents to millions daily. This approach is garnering them even more attention than traditional TV appearances and is creating numerous career opportunities for the entire family. I believe Scarlett and her younger cousin Teddy are poised for fabulous opportunities in the entertainment industry, and I can see Scarlett potentially joining a girl band as she gets older.'\nMailOnline have contacted Scarlett's representatives for comment. \nScarlett's onscreen career certainly seems to be going well, with the teen having already bagged her first award nomination.\nHer mother Tina took to Instagram at the time to share her pride: 'So proud of Scarlett, she’s worked so hard on Waterloo road and I’ve absolutely loved watching her portrayal of Izzy.' \n'Wonderful to see her talent recognised by @tvtimesmagazine as she’s been nominated for an award #proud mum.' \nMeanwhile, her father also took to Instagram to share his excitement as his teen daughter followed in his footsteps. \nHe said in a video: 'What a time to be alive. Tonight, BBC One, 8pm, Waterloo Road, my little brother Adam, my little nephew Teddy and eldest daughter Scarlett take over the TV screen together as a family.' \n\nAt the age of 14, the budding actress was quickly snapped up for her first major role on screen, winning the part of Izzie Charles in Waterloo Road alongside Uncle Adam and cousin Teddy\n\nAs well as her own, she regularly appears on her parents' social medias, with the Thomas family also having their own account\n\nScarlett seen posing with Corrie star mum Tina \n\nPR expert: 'I believe Scarlett and her younger cousin Teddy are poised for fabulous opportunities in the entertainment industry, and I can see Scarlett potentially joining a girl band as she gets older'\n'Talk about a proud moment for the Thomases! Wow. I can't wait for you guys to see it. We watched it together as a family.' \nThe former couple dated for six years from 2003 to 2009, and welcomed Scarlett in 2008.\nTina and Ryan were once Coronation Street's 'It' couple. They met on the set of the ITV soap in 2000 when Ryan joined the cast as Jason Grimshaw. Meanwhile, Tina landed the role of Sarah Platt one year prior. \nThe pair have had a strained relationship since Ryan claimed Tina damaged his Range Rover with a baseball bat in 2022 after a furious late-night row.\nIt was reported that Ryan had blamed his ex for damage caused to the wing mirror on his car, with a source at the time citing their 'fractious relationship.'\nTina is now married to personal trainer Adam Crofts and the pair tied the knot on New Year's Eve in 2018 - though Tina recently sparked fears that they'd split. \n They also share a son together, Beau Lee Stephen, who was born in 2014. \nRyan is also in a happy relationship with TV personality Lucy Mecklenburgh, 33. The pair have been together since 2017 when they met on Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls. \n\nTina and Ryan were once Coronation Street's 'It' couple. They met on the set of the ITV soap in 2000 when Ryan joined the cast as Jason Grimshaw [pictured in 2006]\nThe couple got engaged in June 2019 and share two children together, Roman, 4, and daughter Lilah, 3. \nRyan is known for playing the role of Jason Grimshaw on the Cobbles from 2000 until 2016. \nIn 2018, he played Rafael Humphreys in the Australian soap opera Neighbours and won the 22nd series of Celebrity Big Brother.\nMeanwhile, Tina is best known for her portrayal of Sarah Platt on the Cobbles. She made her debut on the show in 1999, playing the character until 2008, before returning to the soap again in 2015. \nShe also appeared in the BBC One drama series Waterloo Road from 2010 to 2011. So, it's no surprise that Scarlett has acting in her blood. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSoap nepo-baby Scarlett Thomas, 16, 'tipped for £2million payday as warring parents Tina O'Brien and Ryan Thomas unite to make their daughter a star'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Most of them were downed.\n\nThe strike comes just hours after a menacing Putin defied Donald Trump and declared he can “finish off” Ukraine despite an impending ceasefire.\n\nThe brutal tyrant has also unleashed a wave of fresh strikes on civilian targets and retaken a border village in Kursk.\n\nPutin made the threat while visiting a nuclear submarine base in Russia’s frozen north – just a week after Sir Keir Starmer had a similar visit.\n\nHe launched a new nuclear submarine named the Perm – the first of its kind to be equipped with hypersonic Zircon missiles as a standard feature.\n\nVlad brushed aside peace moves, declaring: “Not long ago I said we’d grind them [Ukraine] down — now it looks like we’ll finish them off.”\n\nPutin has also urged for the removal of Volodymyr Zelensky by military leaders and suggested an interim government overseen internationally to conduct elections.\n\nThe tyrant’s threats come as his forces bombed a liquid gas facility in the latest violation of pledges to halt such strikes.\n\nVlad’s forces also bombed a hospital in what Kyiv labelled as a “war crime”.\n\nRussia also claims to have retaken the border village of Gogolevka from Ukraine in its Kursk region.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky said that the country’s military has taken “certain steps” in Russia outside the Kursk region.\n\nHe said this was done to ease pressure on Ukrainian troops in the area.\n\nIt comes after reports emerged suggesting Ukrainian troops were inside the adjacent Belgorod region and were fighting the Russians.\n\nMeanwhile, after a long marathon of negotiations, the White House confirmed that both the warring nations have agreed to halt strikes in the Black Sea region and on energy infrastructure.\n\nWashington also agreed to lift some sanctions against Moscow in its latest step towards endorsing Russia’s positions.\n\nThe agreements were struck by US negotiators who met separately over three days in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with delegations from Ukraine and Russia.\n\nWhile the full details of the ceasefire deal are yet to be revealed by top diplomats of the nations, experts fear that the deal hugely benefits Russia in the war.\n\nThe dictator has now succeeded in stopping the fighting on one of Ukraine most successful fronts – as well as halting more crippling attacks on Russian oil plants in another side deal.\n\nPutin is now expected to stall further peace deals for months until he has grabbed more swathes of invaded land and pushed Ukrainian forces out of Russia’s Kursk region.\n\nFormer Nato chief and British Army Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon told The Sun: “This is a deal that’s been written by Russia because actually they get most out of it.”\n\nDuring the peace talks, the US committed to help seek the lifting of international sanctions on Russian agriculture and fertiliser exports, long a persistent Russian demand.\n\nThe deals were reached after parallel talks in Saudi Arabia that followed separate phone calls last week between Trump and the two presidents, Zelenskiy and Putin.","summary":"THIS is the terrifying moment Vladimir Putin&#8217;s shahed suicide drones blitzed

leading charge to tariff Australian beef","text":"A Republican cattle-rancher congressman has introduced a bill to place a 70 per cent tariff on Australian Wagyu beef — part of an intensifying American push to pressure Australia over meat trade. \n\nThe US beef industry is hoping to capitalise on Donald Trump's trade war to squeeze a better deal out of Australia, as the US president finalises a new round of tariffs set to take effect next week.\n\nMarlin Stutzman, an Indiana congressman and Wagyu farmer, is helping to lead the charge with the newly introduced \"Protect American Beef\" bill.\n\nIt singles out Australia as a particularly unfair trade partner because of biosecurity barriers that block US imports, as well as an unfavourable currency exchange rate.\n\n\"Australia is producing a lot of Wagyu and shipping it here, and it's an un-level playing field with the currency difference and the fact that we can't have a reciprocal relationship,\" Mr Stutzman told the ABC.\n\nThe bill is unlikely to pass into law — fewer than 6 per cent of bills do — and, in any case, Mr Trump has been bypassing Congress and implementing trade policy via executive orders from the White House.\n\nBut the move is reflective of wider industry efforts to get Australian meat on Mr Trump's list of future tariffs, and to pursue all avenues to relax Australian restrictions on importing US beef. \n\nSome in the industry also want Mr Trump to consider new quotas on Australian beef imports.\n\nAmerican producers have been unable to export uncooked beef to Australia since 2003, because of fears over mad cow disease. The Americans argue the risks are now negligible, and Australia is using biosecurity as an excuse.\n\n\"We understood it [the ban] at the time,\" Mr Stutzman said.\n\n\"But 20 years later, it's like, you're still not letting us ship our beef back there.\n\n\"And so it just seems like the Australian government took advantage of the situation and never opened up the channels for beef to go back to Australia.\"\n\nAmerica's National Cattlemen's Beef Association is also pushing for the US to get tough on Australia, accusing it of using a \"myriad of sanitary concerns and endless bureaucratic red tape to delay the approval of US beef\".\n\n\"This is not how allies and trade partners should behave,\" the lobby group wrote in a submission to a congressional subcommittee on trade this week. \"If the Australians will not accept our beef products, then it is only fair that we reciprocate.\"\n\nIn 2024, Australia exported almost 400,000 tonnes of beef to the US, according to Meat and Livestock Australia, making it Australia's biggest beef export market.\n\nAmerican industry groups say Australia is now also selling more Wagyu beef in the US than American producers.\n\nCattle Australia has described Australia's biosecurity requirements as non-negotiable and \"completely unrelated\" to debates over US tariffs or market access.\n\nMr Trump has already introduced tariffs on all imported aluminium and steel – angering the Australian government – as well as foreign cars, and a range of products from China, Canada and Mexico.\n\nHis next round of tariffs, scheduled to come in on April 2, are set to target countries that Mr Trump feels have unfair trade imbalances with the US, but he has not announced specifics.\n\nAmerican business interest groups have been lobbying for tariffs or other measures to punish and pressure Australia on matters ranging from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to proposed tech regulations.\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell recently warned that US tariffs on Australian beef would penalise Americans by pushing up the prices of popular products like Big Macs. The bulk of Australian beef exported to the US is used in hamburgers.\n\nAmbassador Kevin Rudd has been leading efforts in Washington to persuade the White House not to further tariff Australian imports, arguing Australia's years of trade deficits with the US mean they're unjustified.\n\nBut the US's \"new Trumpian worldview\" meant it was being \"hardline and transactional in its approach\", Mr Rudd told 7.30 earlier this month.\n\nAustralia's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said it would \"continue to work with United States counterparts to progress our respective market access priorities\".\n\n\"Australia has a strong track record of managing trade concerns in line with our interests and consistent with our commitments in our free trade agreement with the United States,\" a spokesperson said.","summary":"As American producers lobby Donald Trump to put tariffs on Australian meat imports, a Republican cattle-rancher takes the fight to the US Congress.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-29/donald-trump-reciprocal-tariffs-wagyu-beef-marlin-stutzman/105111718","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/100f81ad34444691571f8efb1ca0409d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=909&cropW=1616&xPos=0&yPos=86&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 00:28:14","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":305343950,"title":"Trump’s FCC commissioner opens investigation into Walt Disney Co. and ABC for diversity policies","text":"By DAVID BAUDER\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s FCC commissioner said Friday he’s opening an investigation into the Walt Disney Co. and its ABC television network to see whether they are “promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination.”\n\nFCC Commissioner Brendan Carr announced the probe in a letter to Disney CEO Robert Iger on Friday. The company said it was reviewing the letter and looking forward to answering the commission’s questions.\n\nThe new administration has taken an aggressive posture toward the media on several fronts. Just this week, there were court hearings on the shutdown of Voice of America and the president’s dispute with The Associated Press over how the news agency refers to the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has ordered renamed the Gulf of America.\n\nCarr has pushed the Federal Communications Commission into an activist role since Trump appointed him as its leader. For example, the FCC currently has open investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News.\n\n“For decades, Disney focused on churning out box office and programming successes,” Carr wrote to Iger. “But then something changed. Disney has now become embroiled in rounds of controversy surrounding its DEI policies.”\n\nHe said that while he has seen reports that Disney has rolled back some of its practices, “significant concerns remain.”\n\nLast month, Axios reported that Disney had made some policy changes, including eliminating a website designed to highlight personalities and stories from underrepresented communities.\n\nDisney also softened messages that appeared before showings of movies like “Dumbo” and “Peter Pan,” Axios said. Instead of warnings that the films include “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of peoples or culture,” the messages changed to “this program is presented as originally created and may contain stereotypes or negative depictions.”\n\nCarr’s letter linked to an article by conservative activist Christopher Rufo describing Disney as “the wokest place on Earth.”\n\nSome examples Carr cited go back several years, such as a one-time policy at Disney-owned ABC that at least 50 percent of characters in TV pilots be from underrepresented groups. The letter cites a statement by a Disney executive in 2021 that it rejected some TV pilots because they didn’t satisfy inclusion standards.\n\nTrump has targeted all manner of DEI — standing for diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts across both public and private organizations.\n\n“At my direction, the FCC has already taken action to end its own promotion of DEI,” Carr wrote. “I have been pleased to see that some regulated companies are already taking steps toward rooting out discriminatory DEI policies.”","summary":"In a letter, to Disney's CEO, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said he aims to see whether the company is “promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination.”","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/03/28/trumps-fcc-commissioner-opens-investigation-into-walt-disney-co-and-abc-for-diversity-policies/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Media_FCC_Disney_50894-e1743208226616.jpg?w=1024&h=577","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 00:26:30","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":305341472,"title":"Nish Kumar from ‘Pod Save The UK’ Discusses Breaking into America, Trump, Elon Musk, Canadian Tariffs, and Global Comedy","text":"“We live in the stupidest possible version of human history,” said Nish Kumar to a roaring packed Largo at the Coronet in LA last week, perfectly summing up 2025 so far.\n\nCited as one of the 50 best comedians of the 21st century by the UK’s The Guardian and the subject of a recent New York Times profile that raised his American profile considerably, After Midnight alum Kumar’s relentless shiving and mocking of pompous and populist politicians was on full display on March 20 in those back-to-back shows at the iconic venue on La Cienega Blvd. From Donald Trump and MAGA authoritarianism, UK right winger Nigel Farage (“if gout was a guy”) and race riots, and how horrible Kash Patel and Rishi Sunak are, Kumar raged against the moronic and self-declared messiahs. There was also material on his mother’s obsession with Princess Diana, woke scolding, the return of Nazis to public life, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the co-host of Crooked Media’s Pod Save the UK (with journalist Coco Khan) saved special vinegar for Elon Musk.\n\nTo Kumar, DOGE chief Musk is, among other lows, a “man so congenitally unpleasant he is fighting a daily battle to be named history’s worst white South African.”\n\nDays later, the former host of the BBC satirical news show The Mash Report days equally captured the cartoonish and calamitous Signal scandal enveloping Trump’s National Security team “Also, you know, I guess we all just need to keep an eye on our own phones, because you might wake up one morning and realize you’ve been added to a text chain that’s talking about plans to invade Canada,” CAA-repped Kumar said.\n\nTelling his live audiences that some acquaintances have asked him to lay off the politics and do more traditional stand-up about what is in his fridge, Kumar proved as far from kissing the ring or bending the knee as possible in our increasingly authoritarian era. To that, the comedian inspired by the 1990s barrier shattering Goodness Gracious Me and chatted with me as his North American tour enters its final week, about Trump’s war on Canada, low expectations, that Signal fiasco, breaking America,and his parents fears about crossing the 49th parallel.\n\nDEADLINE: Having seen your second show at Largo last week, let me ask you in the interest of non-political comedy: What is in your fridge?\n\nNISH KUMAR: (LAUGHS) Well, actually, currently my fridge, the fridge that I’m most closest to, is in a hotel room. So, I guess currently what’s in my fridge is, I imagine, some incredibly expensive soft drinks\n\nDEADLINE: Now we have that out of the way, you have been touring a divided North America with a very political stand-up show since late February starting in Toronto. You’re doing two shows in Chicago on Friday and ending this part of the tour in Madison, Wisconsin on March 30. So, what’s the vibe you’re picking up in a continent where everything in Canada and America is sharply political right now?\n\nKUMAR: I landed in Toronto on February the 20th, I believe, and it was the week that the hockey games had happened and the Canadians were booing the American national anthem. it was angrier than I thought it was possible for Canadians to be, like Canadians were justifiably furious. So yeah, there was, we kind of landed into the middle of that kind of, like real anger and frustration. And then we were in Toronto, and then Montreal, and then I went into Boston. You know, I’m speaking to a very small, very specific demographic of Americans, but there is a lot of anger and a lot of hurt I think that a lot of American people are feeling right now, and certainly that is true over the boarder as well.\n\nDEADLINE: With all that anger, and it is very real, we can all see that, were you worried that your, let’s just say, MAGA critical material could have seen you held up at the boarder coming into the States, and, if so, how do you counter that?\n\nKUMAR: I mean, like, the show is the show, you know.\n\nI’m not going to change the material. It is what it is. Yeah, that’s what I do. And also, I believe that I’m still doing that in a country whose First Amendment to its Constitution enshrines freedom of speech. So, I believe that I’m still operating under those terms.\n\nDEADLINE: That feels like increasingly thin ice to many, especially for someone who doesn’t have white skin …\n\nKUMAR: You know, if we’re just being completely and utterly candid here, I have just had a very a conversation with a very, very tense and stressed mother on the phone about the fact that I am re-entering America on Thursday. I’m doing so with a valid O-1 visa, and I’m doing so to go and do pre-book shows with a flight that leaves the following week that takes me to Melbourne to do a run of pre book shows at the Melbourne Comedy Festival. But what’s also true is my parents are incredibly stressed/ They are reading stories about people being grabbed at the border, and they are wondering whether that will happen to me. And that is just that is just a reality of where we are at the moment in the conversation is that people who have all of their paperwork in order are genuinely frightened at the moment.\n\nDEADLINE: What are the consequences in your opinion for America in that conversation?\n\nKUMAR: Well, if you start really saber rattling, and you make it difficult for people to come into your country, there are economic consequences. Those consequences will be felt by Americans if tourists start being put off coming. There are parts of America that tourism is a huge industry that helps keep the country and keep people employed and keep the country’s economy buoyant.\n\nThere are also consequences to imposing tariffs on a neighbor with whom you share a land border. Yet, Elon Musk and Donald Trump will not face the consequences of the tariffs. Elon Musk and Donald Trump will not face the consequences of tourists being put off coming to this country because they’re hearing stories that a Canadian actress was detained and without any kind of judicial oversight, put in an immigration detention facility. And the reason I stress Canadian in that instance is that is a white Canadian person. Black and Brown people have long since feared the immigration policies. That is something that has been a part of the fear. But if they’re now doing this to white people, that is something that is something that is going to scare absolutely everybody.\n\nDEADLINE: In the realm of fear, the scandal of the week in the ever-scandalizing Trump administration is National Security Advisor Mike Waltz earlier this month breaking almost every security protocol in the book by adding the editor of the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg to a group Signal app chat with Vice-President Vance, the DEI hating Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other top administration officials over plans to bomb Yemen and the Houthi. Then they all denied it, say there was nothing classified on the chat, and, once Goldberg released parts of the military specifics that Hegseth put on the not secure chat, they tried to discredit him by insisting they were “attack plans” not “war plans” and hence no big whoop ….\n\nKUMAR: The thing that shocks me about it is, I wouldn’t trust them to organize a group chat.\n\n You know, it’s quite an astonishing thing to understand that they couldn’t work out who was in a Signal group. That feels like it should be something that is very deeply worrying to people.\n\nIt also does slightly fly in the face of this idea that there’s a lot of rhetoric about we need to get rid of DEI because we need the best of the brightest. Currently, some of the best of the brightest appear to be people that can’t use their phones. So that is something that I think is worth examining and worth considering. Also, you know, I guess we all just need to keep an eye on our own phones, because you might wake up one morning and realize you’ve been added to a text chain that’s talking about plans to invade Canada.\n\nDEADLINE: Invasion not being the operative term, between your very short lived Quibi show and your very busy Pod Save the UK duties for Crooked Media, you haven’t toured a lot in the States — so what were your expectations for this tour?\n\nKUMAR: (LAUGHS) I thought, listen, let’s just try. Let’s just see what the market is. Let’s see if people will come out. And let’s do comedy clubs, and let’s do these small rooms and see how it goes.\n\nDEADLINE: And?\n\nKUMAR: And so, my American agents put it all together. And I came at this with truly no expectations outside of the cities that I performed in before, which were Montreal in Canada and Toronto and New York and LA in the States. I was fully prepared to like, take a bath. I was fully like I’m writing off this money. Let’s see how it goes. And then the tickets went on sale, and like, I got a text a day later or something. My partner got a text from her family, a large chunk of whom are Canadians who live in Toronto, saying, Can you add more dates? And that was when we actually looked at the ticket sales and realized that things were sort of filling up.\n\nDEADLINE: A good feeling …\n\nKUMAR: Yeah! So, we had to add late shows in places like Largo in LA, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, and then, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, New York. Suddenly, it was very much like there was a sort of scramble to go. We have not adequately appreciated the demand for ticket, which is the right way round. That’s what you want in your career, and really it’s what I want in my life. I try and approach things with such healthily low expectations that I’m always permanently surprised by any glimmer of success\n\nDEADLINE: That’s a line…\n\nKUMAR: No really. Keeping on theme, my ambitions for my life and career was so low that my main priority was I would like to be a comedian, and not have to be an office temp at the same time.\n\nDEADLINE: Ambition achieved, globally.\n\nKUMAR: Then my other ambition beyond that was I wanted to do a British political show, which I did do for a few years. So that was really exciting. Beyond that, my other ambition, mainly, is just to sort of tour as a comedian.\n\nDEADLINE: Well, as Taylor Tomlinson made clear walking away from CBS’ After Midnight, touring and stand-up are the real deal …\n\nKUMAR: Yeah, part of touring as a comedian is it opens up the whole world to you. You can see whole different parts of the world, and especially in the advent of high-speed internet, it has created a market, global market for English language stand up across the world. \n\nWhen I was a kid, the comedian equivalents of someone as big as I am in Britain, which is like, great, very nice, but I’m not like an arena act in Britain. But the idea that someone at my size, who is like, you know, doing 900 to 1000 seat theaters in the UK would be able to come over and tour in America, and that’d be a financially worthwhile thing to do was inconceivable. Like, the only British comedians that actually went to America were, like, the biggest, biggest comedians, you know. So you know, Eddie Izzard, Billy Connolly, then, lately, Ricky Gervais. They were the only people who could come and actually do shows in America. Whereas now, because of the internet, it’s created this whole other substrata of comedy fans who really want to see the more obscure.\n\nDEADLINE: So, a few more dates in America, and what’s next?\n\nKUMAR: I actually don’t really know, because I’ve been touring so intensely\n\nFor this tour, I can tell you immediately what’s next, which is, I go straight to Australia and New Zealand. Then I go back to London and I film this show. Then we try and work out what we do with it once we filmed it. After that, I do a bunch of shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August, and then, at the moment, I genuinely don’t know what is happening next.\n\nDEADLINE: Seems like quite a plan.\n\nKUMAR: Thanks. You know, I’m not really like one of history’s great long-term planners, due to what my girlfriend, mental health professionals and several audience members have described as a textbook case of ADHD. So, like, that’s not necessarily my forte. So, at the minute, my plan is to film this show. Then I need to edit that show with my friends who make it, and then work out what I do with that show. And then after that, we I’ll be doing more Pods Save the UK. I’ve got September of this year bookmarked to do podcasts in and then I’m really really going to sit on my sofa. Like, really sit on it, really get that ass indentation.","summary":"“We live in the stupidest possible version of human history,” said Nish&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/nish-kumar-from-pod-save-the-uk-discusses-breaking-into-america-trump-elon-musk-canadian-tariffs-and-global-comedy/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 00:23:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.161},{"id":305344228,"title":"Sean Kingston and his mom found guilty of over $1M fraud as rapper 'cries' in court","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Mar 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChilling details emerge about day wealthy doctor 'tried to kill' his 'perfect' wife in Hawaiian paradise\n\nTrump reveals the two-word reason he really wants Greenland as he issues ominous new threat\n\nSick father admits raping his newborn baby to death while his wife left the house to buy more nappies\n\nTorment of Jade Goody's mum: As Jeff Brazier takes legal action to stop her seeing grandson Freddy, KATIE HIND reveals secret reason for feud\n\nThere's something eerily Orwellian about Donald Trump's America, where truth is dismissed as a lie, and lies are disseminated as truth: ANDREW NEIL\n\nSydney Sweeney and Glen Powell reignite romance rumors after actress calls off wedding\n\nBronzed Kerry Katona is back in her £200k Lambo following crash - after saying how 'proud' she is for bouncing back after being bankrupt and almost dying - with a little help from OnlyFans\n\nMillions face paying back some of their state pension to HMRC in a stealth tax raid.

Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, was taken by masked immigration officials as she walked along a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville on Tuesday. Also Read | Myanmar Earthquake: At Least 144 People Killed, 730 Injured in Powerful Quake, Government Says Urgent International Help Needed. Ozturk was quickly moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in remote Basile, Louisiana, before her attorneys could secure a judge's order blocking the transfer. On Friday, US District Court Judge Denise Casper gave the government until Tuesday evening to respond to an updated complaint filed by Ozturk's attorneys. Also Read | Earthquakes in South Asia: Powerful Quake Rocks Myanmar and Thailand, Kills More Than 150 People. “To allow the Court's resolution of its jurisdiction to decide the petition, Ozturk shall not be removed from the United States until further order of this court,” the judge wrote. Ozturk is among several people with ties to American universities who attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians during the war in Gaza and who have recently had visas revoked or been stopped from entering the US. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson has confirmed Ozturk's detention and the termination of her visa, saying investigations found Oztruk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. The department did not provide evidence of that support. Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in an attack that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and during which about 250 hostages were seized. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 50,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave. Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily last year that criticized the university's response to student demands that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. Friends have said Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. President Donald Trump 's administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the secretary of state to revoke visas of non-citizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests.

Darin LaHood, Illinois’ highest ranking Republican in Washington, interviewed a number of qualified candidates and passed along at least three names to the White House.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\nBoutros was not on that list, even though he was interviewed as part of the process. Jeff Cramer, Mark Schneider and Brendan O’Leary were, sources said.\n\nSeasoned former federal prosecutor turned white collar defense attorney Boutros is returning to the office he once served for nearly eight years.\n\nA first-generation American, Boutros’ resume reflects he’s been a partner at a number of firms, and teaches at the University of Chicago’s law school.\n\nLaHood spoke with the I-Team about the search last month.\n\n“This is, you know, one of the most important U.S. attorney’s offices in the country in terms of their work on public corruption, fighting crime, enforcing immigration laws,” LaHood said.\n\nAs the I-Team has previously reported, federal prosecutors in Chicago have not had a permanent boss in years, and the new appointment would come at a critical juncture for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, as immigration and deportation cases are likely to fill federal court dockets.\n\nJoliet native John Lausch, nominated by President Donald Trump during his first term in 2017, was the last confirmed lead prosecutor in the office.\n\nRELATED: Chicago US Attorneys Office at critical juncture with caseload pile-up, new Trump directives\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Morris “Sonny” Pasqual was put in the top spot on a temporary tenure nearly two years ago. President Joe Biden’s pick to fill the job, April Perry, was never confirmed. She was blocked by then-Sen. JD Vance.\n\nLegal experts say naming a new interim leader for Illinois’ Northern District allows the White House to temporarily bypass Senate confirmation.\n\n“This president will almost certainly want at some point, earlier than later in the administration, to have a confirmed United States attorney, that person speaks with more authority and carries more weight than an interim or an acting,” ABC7 Chicago legal analyst Gil Soffer said.\n\nData from the U.S. government show the number of criminal indictments filed by the Northern District of Illinois’ office has dropped relatively steadily in the last four years, from 924 in 2019 and bottoming out at 396 in 2024. That’s the lowest number of criminal indictments in at least 30 years.\n\nWhen asked about the appointment on Friday, Boutros told the I-Team “no comment.”\n\n“The position of U.S. attorney is exceptionally important. It’s the chief federal law enforcement officer in the entire state, and it’s very important to have a U.S. attorney, a presidentially appointed Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney. And acting can only do so much, so much. An acting U.S. attorney won’t want to and shouldn’t set large policy initiatives,” Soffer said.\n\nBoutros’ appointment is effective April 7.","summary":"CHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; The White House named Andrew Boutros the interim U.S.&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-administration-appoints-andrew-boutros-as-interim-us-attorney-for-northern-district-of-illinois-i-team/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 00:19:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":305345864,"title":"&#8216;Tariffs Will Work Out Well&#8217;: Donald Trump On India-US Trade Relations","text":"President Donald Trump has expressed confidence in the ongoing India-US trade negotiations, stating that tariffs will \"work out well\" between New Delhi and Washington, DC.\nSpeaking at the swearing-in ceremony of US attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, on Friday (local time), Trump emphasized his positive relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a \"very smart man\" and a \"great friend.\"\n\"Prime Minister Modi was here just recently, and we've always been very good friends,\" Trump remarked.\nAcknowledging India’s tariff policies, he noted, \"India is one of the highest tariffing nations in the world...

He issued the clarification about an hour later.\n\nHe had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election that will determine ideological control of the court in the battleground state.\n\n'I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,' Musk's now deleted post said. 'This is super important.'\n\nKaul asked the court to order that Musk stop promoting the Sunday giveaway and not make any future payments to Wisconsin voters. \n\nKaul referenced the changing plans for the Sunday event in arguing that any payment to voters was a violation of state law.\n\nEven though the original post was deleted, there has been no announcement that the payments will not be made, Kaul argued in the lawsuit.\n\nAndrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's PAC that planned to host the event, declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe Supreme Court race, with spending above $81 million, has shattered previous records for a US judicial election, and has become a referendum on Musk and the first months of Trump's administration.\n\nTrump endorsed Brad Schimel, a fellow Republican, and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night.\n\n'It's a very important race,' Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel´s campaign. 'I know you feel it´s local, but it´s not. It´s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.'\n\nSchimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday's election. \n\nCrawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. \n\nThe retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.\n\nKaul's lawsuit was initially randomly assigned to Crawford but reassigned to another judge in neighboring Columbia County within minutes.\n\nMusk´s PAC said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against 'activist' judges. \n\nIn a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and 'get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.'\n\n'If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,' Ainsworth said in the video.\n\nAinsworth donated $350 to Schimel's campaign this year, campaign finance records show. \n\nHe has also made dozens of Facebook posts since January supporting Schimel, including photos from campaign events, local organizations´ endorsements of Schimel and X posts from Trump urging Wisconsinites to vote for Schimel.\n\nMusk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.\n\nThat raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law, which makes it a felony to offer, give, lend, or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.\n\nMusk changing the terms of his offer may mitigate the circumstances, but it doesn´t necessarily resolve the legal issue, said Bryna Godar, staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.\n\n'The question is whether the offers are 'in order to induce' people to vote or go to the polls, and there can be arguments made on either side of that question,' she said in an email.\n\nAny legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nSchimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.\n\n'I, frankly, thought, \"Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,\"' Schimel said.\n\nWhen asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, 'I don't know what the criteria to get it was.'\n\nCrawford´s campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a 'last-minute desperate distraction.'\n\n'Wisconsinites don´t want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,' he said.\n\nMusk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. \n\nA judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.\n\nMusk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.\n\nThe race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.","summary":"Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul sued to block Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks to voters days before a pivotal state Supreme Court election.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14549091/Wisconsin-AG-sues-Elon-Musk-attempt-stop-1-million-giveaways-voters.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/23/96693483-0-image-a-19_1743205986300.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 00:14:06","author":"Associated,Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Associated","Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":305344224,"title":"Susanna Reid reveals she went clubbing in Ibiza to party with her three sons - and is planning to 'go alone' once they flee the nest","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Mar 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChilling details emerge about day wealthy doctor 'tried to kill' his 'perfect' wife in Hawaiian paradise\n\nTrump reveals the two-word reason he really wants Greenland as he issues ominous new threat\n\nSick father admits raping his newborn baby to death while his wife left the house to buy more nappies\n\nTorment of Jade Goody's mum: As Jeff Brazier takes legal action to stop her seeing grandson Freddy, KATIE HIND reveals secret reason for feud\n\nThere's something eerily Orwellian about Donald Trump's America, where truth is dismissed as a lie, and lies are disseminated as truth: ANDREW NEIL\n\nSydney Sweeney and Glen Powell reignite romance rumors after actress calls off wedding\n\nBronzed Kerry Katona is back in her £200k Lambo following crash - after saying how 'proud' she is for bouncing back after being bankrupt and almost dying - with a little help from OnlyFans\n\nMillions face paying back some of their state pension to HMRC in a stealth tax raid.

I stopped drinking in 2018 and I'm now predominantly teetotal. \n'I have a Buck's Fizz on Christmas Day, I had half a glass of champagne on my mum's birthday and I have a drink once every couple of months – including a couple in Ibiza – but I don't have pints at the pub like I did in my 20s.'\nShe added: 'Being virtually teetotal hasn't damaged my social life.

And they work from home two or three days a week. With us, there will be no more work from home.”Frankly folks, what we need in this country to pay for the cuts that people deserve and need, we need a British form of Doge, as Elon Musk has got in America. Let’s have a British Doge.”Doge, a programme aimed at cutting costs in the American federal government, has been praised by Mr Farage since its inception via an executive order after Mr Trump assumed office for his second term.\n\nThe Reform leader also criticised changes to the non-dom tax, which media reports suggested have led Lakshmi Mittal, an Indian steel magnate, to leave the UK.\n\nMr Farage said: “We cannot help those on lower incomes, we cannot help those that need to access public services, if we get rid of those that pay the most tax because they leave and go to Monaco, Dubai, America or wherever else it is. We need to be grown-up.”\n\nThe Reform UK local election campaign comes ahead of the local council elections on May 1 where Reform will contest nearly all 1,600 council seats up for re-election.\n\nThe party claimed the event was “the biggest-ever launch rally in modern British political history”, with 10,000 tickets reportedly sold.\n\nMr Tice said that Reform would create a “county-by-county equivalent of Doge”.\n\nHe told the rally: “We are going to win this May 1, we’re going to win big, we must win big.\n\n“We can then do a proper job, but if we’re lucky enough to actually run whole councils we can show that we can do a great job bringing in a fantastic team of experts.\n\n“Root and branch… a sort of county-by-county equivalent of a Doge maybe is what is required in this country.”\n\nA purpose-built set in the stadium featured overfilled rubbish bins in a reference to the bin strikes which are taking place in Birmingham after 400 council workers went on strike over pay and conditions in a row with the Labour-run council.\n\nInside the bins were “Easter eggs” such as a ripped-up TV licence with the name “Lee Anderson” and a mock Rachel Reeves CV.There were also posters depicting Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson as clowns, a blue Reform UK bus and a mock town including a betting shop “Labourbrokes” and a barber shop named “Keir’z Kutz” with the slogan “Cutting everything but tax”.Supporters were seen in the arena with “Make Britain Great Again” caps and light blue Reform UK rosettes bought from the merchandise stall in the arena.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/nigel-farage-pledges-ban-civil-000721778.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OSjYCdEOIhdAmApN80iW7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/25cbda03db731b773663c296101d3e92","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29

reinstated","text":"A federal judge is blocking the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, finding the Trump administration acted \"completely in violation of law\" when it attempted to quickly shutter the organization.\n\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction Friday afternoon that requires the Trump administration to reinstate any terminated CFPB employees, rescind the cancellation of any contracts, allow the workforce to access their computers and return to the office, resume statutorily required work and maintain any records held by the organization.\n\n\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Judge Jackson wrote.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by Congress to safeguard Americans against unfair business practices in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has been targeted for elimination by President Donald Trump as part of his efforts to slash the federal government.\n\nTrump has said the CFPB is \"very important to get rid of\" and that the organization was \"set up to destroy some very good people.\"\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Jackson said the Trump administration acted in \"complete disregard\" for Congress when it attempted to unilaterally dismantle the agency.\n\nTheir efforts to dismantle the organization continued even after Judge Jackson in February ordered the Trump administration to not fire the majority of the agency's employees, she wrote.\n\n\"Absent an injunction freezing the status quo – preserving the agency's data, its operational capacity, and its workforce – there is a substantial risk that the defendants will complete the destruction of the agency completely in violation of law well before the Court can rule on the merits, and it will be impossible to rebuild,\" she wrote.\n\nJudge Jackson also criticized the Trump administration for scrambling to change course after she began examining the effort to wind down operations.\n\nAccording to Jackson, the government's claim that the CFPB was still performing its legally required duties was \"nothing more than window dressing\" to hide what was happening to shutter the organization.\n\n\"The defendants are still engaged in an effort to implement a Presidential plan to shut the agency down entirely and to do it fast,\" Judge Jackson.\n\nIn court proceedings, Trump administration officials claimed the stop-work order that sent the vast majority of employees home was a \"common practice at the beginning of a new administration\" and Justice Department lawyers insisted the Trump administration is trying to improve the CFPB, not destroy it.\n\nJudge Jackson specifically called out the irreparable harm done to one of the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit, Pastor Eva Steege, who sought help from the CFPB to forgive her public service loans before she died. With the Trump administration dismantling the CFPB as she requested help, Steege never got an appointment with the CFPB, according to her lawyers.\n\n\"If I do not receive public service loan forgiveness and the large refund that I am owed before my death, my family could be forced to pursue a death discharge that will not provide them with the refund that they are counting on so that they can use the money for basic needs after I pass,\" Steege said in a sworn declaration.\n\nShe died on March 15, and her loans were never discharged.\n\n\"The irreparable harm that has already come to pass for Pastor Eva Steege is enough to grant preliminary relief,\" Judge Jackson wrote.","summary":"The judge's order requires the Trump administration to reinstate terminated CFPB employees among other steps.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/judge-blocks-dismantling-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-orders/story?id=120277275","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/164e0d23-1d62-452a-8969-2a77b88015cb/CFPB-gty-er-250328_1743195648141_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 00:05:19","author":"Peter Charalambous","authors":["Peter Charalambous"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":305344054,"title":"This week Trump rolled out more tariffs as consumer confidence plummets","text":"President Donald Trump painted a rosy picture of the economy on Tuesday, declaring, \"We're on the right track.\" However, the latest consumer confidence report shows that Americans disagree.According to Tuesday's report, consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since January 2021. The proportion of Americans anticipating a recession also remained at a 9-month high.Exacerbating the situation, the White House has announced a cascade of tariffs, including a 25% tariff on foreign-made cars and car parts. Trump said the move is \"about making America great again, making it strong and prosperous again,\" and that consumers will \"see prices go down.\"But experts disagree, with Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics telling CNN, \"By this time next year, the typical car price will be somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 more.\"RELATED STORY | Consumer confidence is sliding as Americans' view of their financial futures slumps to a 12-year lowThe White House is also barreling toward what they are calling \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, when reciprocal tariffs will kick in.

Most of them were downed. \n\nThe strike comes just hours after a menacing Putin defied Donald Trump and declared he can \"finish off\" Ukraine despite an impending ceasefire.\n\nThe brutal tyrant has also unleashed a wave of fresh strikes on civilian targets and retaken a border village in Kursk.\n\nPutin made the threat while visiting a nuclear submarine base in Russia's frozen north - just a week after Sir Keir Starmer had a similar visit.\n\nHe launched a new nuclear submarine named the Perm - the first of its kind to be equipped with hypersonic Zircon missiles as a standard feature.\n\nVlad brushed aside peace moves, declaring: “Not long ago I said we’d grind them [Ukraine] down — now it looks like we’ll finish them off.”\n\nPutin also called for Volodymyr Zelensky to be ousted by generals and replaced by an internationally-supervised provisional government to hold elections.\n\nThe tyrant's threats come as his forces bombed a liquid gas facility in the latest violation of pledges to halt such strikes.\n\nVlad's forces also bombed a hospital in what Kyiv labelled as a \"war crime\".\n\nRussia also claims to have retaken the border village of Gogolevka from Ukraine in its Kursk region.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky said that the country's military has taken \"certain steps\" in Russia outside the Kursk region.\n\nHe said this was done to ease pressure on Ukrainian troops in the area.\n\nIt comes after reports emerged suggesting Ukrainian troops were inside the adjacent Belgorod region and were fighting the Russians.\n\nMeanwhile, after a long marathon of negotiations, the White House confirmed that both the warring nations have agreed to halt strikes in the Black Sea region and on energy infrastructure.\n\nWashington also agreed to lift some sanctions against Moscow in its latest step towards endorsing Russia's positions.\n\nThe agreements were struck by US negotiators who met separately over three days in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with delegations from Ukraine and Russia.\n\nWhile the full details of the ceasefire deal are yet to be revealed by top diplomats of the nations, experts fear that the deal hugely benefits Russia in the war.\n\nThe dictator has now succeeded in stopping the fighting on one of Ukraine most successful fronts - as well as halting more crippling attacks on Russian oil plants in another side deal.\n\nPutin is now expected to stall further peace deals for months until he has grabbed more swathes of invaded land and pushed Ukrainian forces out of Russia’s Kursk region.\n\nFormer Nato chief and British Army Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon told The Sun: \"This is a deal that's been written by Russia because actually they get most out of it.\" \n\nDuring the peace talks, the US committed to help seek the lifting of international sanctions on Russian agriculture and fertiliser exports, long a persistent Russian demand.\n\nThe deals were reached after parallel talks in Saudi Arabia that followed separate phone calls last week between Trump and the two presidents, Zelenskiy and Putin.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/34133628/putin-suicide-drones-hotel-attack-dnipro/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bartolomeo-best-river-resort-sparking-983187010.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=609&h=927&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 23:58:02","author":"Sayan Bose","authors":["Sayan Bose"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":305337678,"title":"Vance delivers Trump’s ‘message’ to US troops in Greenland","text":"US Vice President J.D. Vance delivered a forceful address to American service members at Pituffik Space Base in northwest Greenland on Friday, emphasizing the Trump administration’s determination to expand its permanent foothold on the Arctic island.\n\nThe vice president’s visit came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined Moscow’s Arctic policy and warned that US annexation plans – dating back to the 1860s – should be taken seriously and not dismissed as “extravagant talk.”\n\n“I want to bring a message from President Trump,” Vance told the assembled airmen and guardians. “He’s grateful for your service, grateful for what you do up here... because the mission that you guys do is so important for the United States.”\n\nWhile insisting that there are no “immediate plans” to expand the US military presence with new bases, Vance announced that Washington would “absolutely” increase investment – including “investing in additional military icebreakers, investing in additional naval ships that will have a greater presence in Greenland.”\n\nThe vice president stressed that the US supports Greenlandic “self-determination,” but made clear that Washington envisions a future in which the island ultimately aligns with America.\n\n“I think that you’d be a lot better coming under the United States security umbrella than you have been under Denmark’s,” he said. Vance accused the Danish government of failing the people of Greenland, claiming the island is “extremely vulnerable right now.”\n\nWe do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary… Because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we will be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory.\n\nVance justified the administration’s increasingly assertive approach by pointing to rising Chinese and Russian activity in the region, describing Greenland as a geopolitical flashpoint in a new era of strategic competition.\n\n“We know that Russia and China and other nations are taking an extraordinary interest in Arctic passageways, in Arctic naval routes, and indeed in the minerals of the Arctic territories. We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic – because we know that if America doesn’t, other nations will fill the gap where we fall behind,” he said.\n\nHe also highlighted Greenland’s critical role in US missile early warning systems, describing the base’s function as a vital shield “if a missile was fired from an enemy country.”\n\nIn his Thursday speech, President Vladimir Putin countered the US narrative, stressing that “Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic,” and emphasizing the region’s “enormous potential” for joint economic development, resource extraction, infrastructure projects and transport.\n\n“But at the same time, of course, we are concerned about the fact that NATO countries are increasingly often designating the Far North as a springboard for possible conflicts,” Putin added, noting that Moscow is “closely monitoring developments in the region” and “modernizing military infrastructure facilities.”","summary":"Vice President J.D.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nElon Musk has announced that his AI company, xAI—which we're told is also working on a videogame—has acquired his social media company, X, in an all-stock transaction. The Musk-to-Musk deal values X at $45 billion before subtracting $12 billion in debt.\n\nBefore rebranding it as X, Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in 2022. Last year, Fidelity estimated that X's value had dipped substantially since then, appraising the social media site at 72% less than Musk's purchase price.\n\nEstimations of X's value have increased following the election and inauguration of Musk ally Donald Trump (who has gone so far as to promote Musk's cars on the White House lawn), and the return of some advertisers.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, however, X is still struggling to hit revenue targets following the advertiser exodus. Citing an internal email, the paper reports that X has brought in $91 million in ad revenue this year, \"well below its first-quarter target of $153 million.\"\n\nMusk has now assigned a value of $80 billion to xAI, whose main products are Grok, a large language model competitor to ChatGPT which is already integrated with X, and its image generation component, Aurora. xAI raised $6 billion in new funding in December.\nPart of xAI's advantage is that it can use X posts as training material. Unless users opt out, their data may be used \"to train and fine-tune Grok and other AI models developed by xAI,\" the X user settings say.\n\"xAI and X's futures are intertwined,\" Musk said in a post on X. \"Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nIn November 2024, Musk said that he was also launching a videogame studio within xAI, though we haven't heard much about what this department may be working on, except that \"photo-realistic graphics\" are a goal. And we can assume that it will cater to the reactionary 'anti-woke' crowd Musk courts.\nAs for his own gaming habits, Musk admitted to account boosting in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2 in January after being called out, an incident which Ubisoft recently referenced in a dig that seemed uncharacteristically bold for the Assassin's Creed Shadows developer.\n\n2025 games: This year's upcoming releases\nBest PC games: Our all-time favorites\nFree PC games: Freebie fest\nBest FPS games: Finest gunplay\nBest RPGs: Grand adventures\nBest co-op games: Better together\n\nTyler Wilde\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nEditor-in-Chief, US\n\nTyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

Janet Mills’ office and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey’s office for comment. The Maine School Administrative District 51, home to Greely High School, where a transgender athlete incited national controversy after winning a girls' pole vault competition in February, said Thursday it was not complying and will instead \"continue to follow state law and the Maine Human Rights Act.\" The Maine Principals' Association said in a statement it is also \"bound by the law, including the Maine Human Rights Act, which our participation policy reflects.\" CALIFORNIA LAWMAKER WARNS DEMOCRATS OF CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT PROTECTING GIRLS' SPORTS FROM TRANS ATHLETES The situation involving the trans athlete at Greely High School attracted national attention after Maine Republican state Rep. Laurel Libby identified the athlete by name with a photograph in a social media post. Libby was later censured by the Maine legislature, and she has since filed a lawsuit to have it overturned. Trump signed the \"No Men in Women’s Sports\" executive order in early February, which led to multiple athletics associations complying with it and a handful thumbing their nose at the order. The issue with the state of Maine came to a head at a meeting of the National Governors Association. Trump threatened to cut federal funding to the state for not banning biological males from girls’ and women’s sports. The next day, Mills' office responded with a statement threatening legal action against the Trump administration if it did withhold federal funding from the state. Then, Trump and Mills verbally sparred in a widely publicized argument at the White House during a bipartisan meeting of governors. \"Are you not going to comply with that?\" Trump asked Mills. Since then, multiple protests against Mills have been held outside the state Capitol, and the Maine University System has cooperated with the Trump administration to ensure no trans athletes compete in women's sports after a temporary funding pause. The OCR announced last week it found the Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals' Association and Greely High School in violation of Title IX for continuing to enable trans inclusion in girls' sports. OCR Acting Director Anthony Archeval previously provided a statement to Fox News Digital warning of potential consequences for continued defiance of the executive order. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"What HHS is asking of the Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals' Association (MPA) and Greely High School is simple — protect female athletes’ rights. Girls deserve girls-only sports without male competitors.

Yvette Davids, the academy’s superintendent, in response to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January, according to a court filing by the U.S. Justice Department in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe president’s order on Jan. 27 said that “every element of the Armed Forces should operate free from any preference based on race or sex.” It also directed the secretary of defense to conduct an internal review with respect to all “activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system,” including reviews at the service academies.\n\n“Under revised internal guidance issued by the Superintendent on Feb. 14, 2025, neither race, ethnicity, nor sex can be considered as a factor for admission at any point during the admissions process, including qualification and acceptance,” according to the court filing made public Friday.\n\nThe decision comes after a federal judge ruled in December that the academy could continue considering race in its admissions process. In that case, the judge found that military cohesion and other national security factors mean the school should not be subjected to the same standards as civilian universities.\n\nDuring a two-week bench trial in September, attorneys for the academy argued that prioritizing diversity in the military makes it stronger, more effective and more widely respected.\n\nThe case against the policy was brought by the group Students for Fair Admissions, which was appealing the judge’s decision.\n\nThe Justice Department asked in the filing on Friday to suspend the current briefing schedule in the case while the parties consider the change in the academy’s policy.\n\n“The parties require a reasonable amount of time to discuss the details of the Academy’s new policy and to consider the appropriate next steps for this litigation, including whether this litigation is now moot and, if so, whether the district court judgment should be vacated,” the Justice Department wrote.\n\nMaryland Rep. Sarah Elfreth, a Democrat who serves on the academy’s Board of Visitors, criticized the change, saying “this disastrous decision will have negative implications on our military’s recruitment and retention for decades to come.”\n\n“A Navy and Marine Corps that reflect the diversity of our country is our strongest Navy and Marine Corps,” Elfreth said. “Diversity and inclusion allow our academies to not just reflect how our country looks but are critical to mission readiness and strong national security.”\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions also brought the lawsuit challenging affirmative action that resulted in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023.\n\nThe high court’s conservative majority broadly prohibited the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions, ending a long-standing practice meant to boost opportunities for historically marginalized groups and sending shock waves through higher education. But it carved out a potential exemption for military academies, suggesting that national security interests could affect the legal analysis.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions later sued the Annapolis-based Naval Academy, challenging the exemption. But Judge Richard Bennett rejected their arguments, saying that the school had “established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps.”\n\nAttorneys for the group argued during trial that prioritizing minority candidates is unfair to qualified white applicants and that cohesion should arise from other sources such as training and command structure.\n\nThe academy argued in that case that its admissions process considers many factors, including grades, extracurricular activities, life experience and socioeconomic status, according to court testimony. Race often played no role in the process, but sometimes it came under consideration in a “limited fashion,” attorneys for the academy wrote in court papers.","summary":"The change was made in response to Trump's executive order aimed at eliminating DEI initiatives from the military, including service academies.","url":"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2025/03/28/us-naval-academy-ends-affirmative-action-in-admissions/","image":"https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/I5MFM2BWIFEWSVCVM43G2OKQI5.jpg?width=1200&auth=0b32b66cefe3b8f623064cd1a9a476c49bd130d2231f24f62cb45384b4dcf281","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 23:41:09","author":"Brian Witte","authors":["Brian Witte"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.044},{"id":305337862,"title":"UN rights chief demands end to 'horrific suffering' in Ukraine","text":"The UN rights chief called Friday for an end to the \"horrific suffering\" caused by attacks on civilians in Ukraine, while the United States attempts to broker a ceasefire, more than three years into Russia's invasion.\n\n\"Recent weeks have seen intense activity around a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, which would be very welcome,\" Volker Turk told the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\n\"Limited ceasefires that protect shipping lanes and infrastructure are a welcome step forward. What is most needed now is an end to the horrific suffering being inflicted daily in Ukraine.\"\n\nRussia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.

They argue that agencies like USAID and the CFPB were created as independent organisations under Congress and that the president has overstepped his constitutional bounds by overriding those congressional decisions.\n\nThe CFPB, in particular, has long been a target of conservative ire.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the bureau was founded in response to the financial crisis of 2007 that was spurred on by predatory lending practices.\n\nAs an independent agency, the CFPB served as a watchdog, collecting research, monitoring financial markets and fielding complaints from ordinary consumers facing illegal or deceptive actions from their banks or financial service providers.\n\nAs of December 2024, the bureau had claimed credit for returning $21bn to consumers through debt relief, reductions or monetary compensation stemming from its enforcement activities.\n\nBut many Republicans and financial industry leaders have chafed at its enforcement and regulatory activities, accusing the bureau of hampering businesses.\n\nOn January 31, shortly after the start of his second term as president, Trump moved to fire the bureau’s director, Rohit Chopra, and replace him with an ally.\n\nBy February 8, the bureau had been ordered to cease all investigations, including pending ones, and stop any enforcement activity fundamentally halting its functions. The next day, its headquarters was closed. The bureau also started to see the same widespread layoffs facing other federal agencies.\n\nJudge Berman Jackson opened her 112-page decision with quotes from some of the CFPB’s critics within the Trump administration.\n\n“The CFPB has been a woke and weaponised agency against disfavoured industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,” said Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget under Trump.\n\nAnother critic quoted in Berman Jackson’s order was Trump adviser and billionaire businessman Elon Musk, who called to “delete” the bureau.\n\n“CFPB RIP,” he wrote succinctly on February 7, as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led the dismantling of the organisation.\n\nMusk has been accused of having a conflict of interest with the CFPB, as he expands the financial services available on his social media platform X.\n\nJudge Berman Jackson emphasised she did not take her decision lightly in the opening lines of her ruling.\n\n“The motion for preliminary injunction to be decided boils down to one question: should the Court take action to preserve the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau now before the case concerning its fate has been resolved?” Berman Jackson wrote. “That is an extraordinary step.”\n\nStill, she indicated that the injunction was necessary: “The Court’s oversight is the only thing holding the defendants back.”\n\nAmong the plaintiffs were the National Treasury Employees Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a prominent civil rights organisation.\n\nBut there was also an individual named in the complaint: Reverend Eva Steege, an 83-year-old Lutheran pastor who sought the CFPB’s help for student loans she incurred while at seminary.\n\nWhile investigating Steege’s case, the CFBP found she not only qualified for loan forgiveness but also for $15,000 returned in overpayments.\n\nSteege is in hospice care at the time, according to the complaint.\n\n“It was her hope to resolve the debt and spare her family that burden after she died,” Judge Berman Jackson wrote in her ruling.\n\nBut the sudden shutdown of the CFPB’s services left Steege in a lurch, without a resolution to her case or a refund of her overpayment.\n\n“Steege’s fear of leaving her surviving family members saddled with her student loan debt came to pass on March 15, when she died,” the judge explained.\n\nBerman Jackson said the case raised questions about the separation of powers under the US Constitution and whether the president had encroached upon “legislative authority”.\n\n“The evidence reveals that: the defendants were in fact engaged in a concerted, expedited effort to shut the agency down entirely when the motion for injunctive relief was filed,” she wrote.\n\n“While the President is free to propose legislation to Congress to accomplish this aim, the defendants are not free to eliminate an agency created by statute on their own, and certainly not before the Court has had an opportunity to rule on the merits of the plaintiffs’ challenge.”\n\nShe also highlighted what she called a “disingenuous” arguments from the Trump administration’s lawyers.\n\n“The Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything,” the judge wrote.","summary":"The injunction is a setback for Trump, who has sought to streamline the federal government through cuts and layoffs.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/28/judge-blocks-trump-effort-to-shutter-consumer-financial-protection-bureau?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP25041856853761-1743201145.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 23:39:42","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.549},{"id":305344218,"title":"Megan McKenna rushes five-month old son to doctors after he 'cried all night' in pain - as she hits back at nasty trolls","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Mar 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChilling details emerge about day wealthy doctor 'tried to kill' his 'perfect' wife in Hawaiian paradise\n\nTrump reveals the two-word reason he really wants Greenland as he issues ominous new threat\n\nSick father admits raping his newborn baby to death while his wife left the house to buy more nappies\n\nTorment of Jade Goody's mum: As Jeff Brazier takes legal action to stop her seeing grandson Freddy, KATIE HIND reveals secret reason for feud\n\nThere's something eerily Orwellian about Donald Trump's America, where truth is dismissed as a lie, and lies are disseminated as truth: ANDREW NEIL\n\nSydney Sweeney and Glen Powell reignite romance rumors after actress calls off wedding\n\nBronzed Kerry Katona is back in her £200k Lambo following crash - after saying how 'proud' she is for bouncing back after being bankrupt and almost dying - with a little help from OnlyFans\n\nMillions face paying back some of their state pension to HMRC in a stealth tax raid.

Yvette Davids, the academy’s superintendent, in response to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January, according to a court filing by the U.S. Justice Department in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe president’s order on Jan. 27 said that “every element of the Armed Forces should operate free from any preference based on race or sex.” It also directed the secretary of defense to conduct an internal review with respect to all “activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system,” including reviews at the service academies.\n\n“Under revised internal guidance issued by the Superintendent on Feb. 14, 2025, neither race, ethnicity, nor sex can be considered as a factor for admission at any point during the admissions process, including qualification and acceptance,” according to the court filing made public Friday.\n\nThe decision comes after a federal judge ruled in December that the academy could continue considering race in its admissions process. In that case, the judge found that military cohesion and other national security factors mean the school should not be subjected to the same standards as civilian universities.\n\nDuring a two-week bench trial in September, attorneys for the academy argued that prioritizing diversity in the military makes it stronger, more effective and more widely respected.\n\nThe case against the policy was brought by the group Students for Fair Admissions, which was appealing the judge’s decision.\n\nThe Justice Department asked in the filing on Friday to suspend the current briefing schedule in the case while the parties consider the change in the academy’s policy.\n\n‘The parties require a reasonable amount of time to discuss the details of the Academy’s new policy and to consider the appropriate next steps for this litigation, including whether this litigation is now moot and, if so, whether the district court judgment should be vacated,” the Justice Department wrote.\n\nEdward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, praised the academy’s decision.\n\n“Students for Fair Admissions welcomes the announcement that the U.S. Naval Academy will end its unfair and illegal race-based admissions policies. Racial discrimination is wrong and racial classifications have no place at our nation’s military academies,” Blum said in a statement.\n\nMaryland Rep. Sarah Elfreth, a Democrat who serves on the academy’s Board of Visitors, criticized the change, saying “this disastrous decision will have negative implications on our military’s recruitment and retention for decades to come.”\n\n“A Navy and Marine Corps that reflect the diversity of our country is our strongest Navy and Marine Corps,” Elfreth said. “Diversity and inclusion allow our academies to not just reflect how our country looks but are critical to mission readiness and strong national security.”\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions also brought the lawsuit challenging affirmative action that resulted in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023.\n\nThe high court’s conservative majority broadly prohibited the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions, ending a long-standing practice meant to boost opportunities for historically marginalized groups and sending shock waves through higher education. But it carved out a potential exemption for military academies, suggesting that national security interests could affect the legal analysis.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions later sued the Annapolis-based Naval Academy, challenging the exemption.

Yvette Davids, the academy’s superintendent, in response to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January, according to a court filing by the U.S. Justice Department in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe president’s order on Jan. 27 said that “every element of the Armed Forces should operate free from any preference based on race or sex.” It also directed the secretary of defense to conduct an internal review with respect to all “activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system,” including reviews at the service academies.\n\n“Under revised internal guidance issued by the Superintendent on Feb. 14, 2025, neither race, ethnicity, nor sex can be considered as a factor for admission at any point during the admissions process, including qualification and acceptance,” according to the court filing made public Friday.\n\nThe decision comes after a federal judge ruled in December that the academy could continue considering race in its admissions process. In that case, the judge found that military cohesion and other national security factors mean the school should not be subjected to the same standards as civilian universities.\n\nDuring a two-week bench trial in September, attorneys for the academy argued that prioritizing diversity in the military makes it stronger, more effective and more widely respected.\n\nThe case against the policy was brought by the group Students for Fair Admissions, which was appealing the judge’s decision.\n\nThe Justice Department asked in the filing on Friday to suspend the current briefing schedule in the case while the parties consider the change in the academy’s policy.\n\n‘The parties require a reasonable amount of time to discuss the details of the Academy’s new policy and to consider the appropriate next steps for this litigation, including whether this litigation is now moot and, if so, whether the district court judgment should be vacated,” the Justice Department wrote.\n\nMaryland Rep. Sarah Elfreth, a Democrat who serves on the academy’s Board of Visitors, criticized the change, saying “this disastrous decision will have negative implications on our military’s recruitment and retention for decades to come.”\n\n“A Navy and Marine Corps that reflect the diversity of our country is our strongest Navy and Marine Corps,” Elfreth said. “Diversity and inclusion allow our academies to not just reflect how our country looks but are critical to mission readiness and strong national security.”\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions also brought the lawsuit challenging affirmative action that resulted in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023.\n\nThe high court’s conservative majority broadly prohibited the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions, ending a long-standing practice meant to boost opportunities for historically marginalized groups and sending shock waves through higher education. But it carved out a potential exemption for military academies, suggesting that national security interests could affect the legal analysis.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions later sued the Annapolis-based Naval Academy, challenging the exemption. But Judge Richard Bennett rejected their arguments, saying that the school had “established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps.”\n\nAttorneys for the group argued during trial that prioritizing minority candidates is unfair to qualified white applicants and that cohesion should arise from other sources such as training and command structure.\n\nThe academy argued in that case that its admissions process considers many factors, including grades, extracurricular activities, life experience and socioeconomic status, according to court testimony.

Mr Trump has vowed that he would target imported vehicles and vehicle parts with a 25 per cent tax.\n\nThe Republican has also warned that he will impose additional tariffs on Canada and the European Union if they work together to \"do economic harm\" against their \"best friend\" — the US.\n\nIt comes after Mr Trump imposed a blanket 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods, as well as 25 per cent duty on steel and aluminium imports.\n\nIn response, Canada has issued C$60bn ($42bn) of tariffs on US products.\n\nThe speech followed Mr Carney’s declaration of a snap election, two weeks after winning the Liberal Party’s leadership election and succeeding Justin Trudeau.\n\n“We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump’s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,” the Canadian PM said on Sunday 23 March, announcing his decision.\n\n“There is so much more to do to secure Canada. To invest in Canada, to build Canada, to unite Canada. That’s why I’m asking for a strong positive mandate from my fellow Canadians.”\n\nCanadians have reacted angrily to the US president’s talk of incorporating their country as a 51st state and rallied behind the party of government, which they previously held responsible for the inflated cost of living.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/watch-live-mark-carney-responds-172733539.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/df6acf6c04eb598d3f063133aa90e3a3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 23:33:54","author":"Holly Patrick","authors":["Holly Patrick"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":305337874,"title":"Carney Says Trump ‘Respected Canada’s Sovereignty,’ Agreed to Negotiations During Call","text":"Prime Minister Mark Carney said his phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump was “substantive” and the two agreed to further discussions on the two countries’ “broader economic and security partnership.”\n\n“The president respected Canada’s sovereignty today, both in his private and public comments,” Carney said on March 28 in Montreal.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in French, Carney said it was necessary for Canada to have a “new deal” with the United States, as there is “too much change, too many tariffs, too many threats, too much uncertainty right now in the relation.”\n\nWhen asked if he believed there was a strategy behind Trump being more respectful in his tone toward Canada following the phone call, Carney said there is “always a strategy” in a negotiation. He said Ottawa has been clear about its priorities and how it would approach negotiations with the United States, and that Canada will continue to develop alternative trading options with other countries. \n\n“Perhaps there was a different impression before about how strong Canada really is,” Carney also said of the phone call.\n\nFollowing the phone call between the two leaders earlier in the day, Trump took to Truth Social to say it was an “extremely productive” discussion, and that he and Carney will meet “immediately after Canada’s upcoming Election to work on elements of Politics, Business, and all other factors.”\n\nRelated StoriesTrump Says Call With Carney ‘Extremely Productive,’ Says They Will Meet After Election3/28/2025Carney Says Trump Reached Out for a Call, Retaliation on Latest Tariffs Will Come Later3/27/2025\n\nThe U.S. president also said that the discussion between the two leaders will “end up being great for both the United States of America and Canada.” \n\nTrump has said on many occasions that he wants Canada to be a part of the United States, referring to the country as the “51st state” of the United States, and calling former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “Governor Trudeau.”\n\nA readout from the Prime Minister’s Office said Carney and Trump had a “very constructive conversation about the relationship between our two countries.” The leaders agreed to begin “comprehensive negotiations” about a new economic and security relationship after the election, it added.\n\nUntil the election wraps up on April 28, conversations between Canada’s International Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick would “intensify to address immediate concerns,” according to the statement.\n\nCarney also informed Trump that Canada will implement retaliatory tariffs after the United States announces additional trade actions on April 2, the PMO said.\n\nOn March 26, Trump announced he would put 25 percent tariffs on all vehicles and some car parts imported into the United States. The automobile tariffs are set to kick in on April 3, a day after the United States will impose reciprocal tariffs on all its trading partners. Tariffs on auto parts will take effect on May 3.\n\nTrump also placed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico on March 4, but soon after, announced a one-month tariff pause on all products compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Trump also imposed 25 percent tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum, including from Canada, on March 12.\n\nCarney said Trump did not indicate he would be lifting the tariffs on automobiles, steel, or aluminum, and Carney’s response was that this was the “start of a process” for more intensive discussions between the two sides.Supply Management, Digital Services TaxDuring the press conference in Montreal, Carney was asked if he discussed supply management with Trump. Carney said he has been clear since he launched his campaign to be Liberal leader that “we will never have discussions with respect to supply management, it’s off the table.”\n\nTrump has criticized supply management and said Canada has treated American farmers “very unfairly” by imposing such high tariffs. On March 7, Trump threatened to place reciprocal tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy products.\n\nThe tax is a 3 percent levy aimed at digital giants such as Netflix, many of which are based in the United States, that receive revenue from Canadian subscribers and contributors.

And some of these things will seem esoteric to people. The birth rate is very low in almost every country, and unless that changes, civilization will disappear,\" Musk said in part two of his \"Special Report\" exclusive interview Friday. Musk pointed to declining birth rates in the U.S. and Korea, warning that \"nothing seems to be turning that around. Humanity is dying.\" ELON MUSK, DOGE TEAM OFFER UNPRECEDENTED PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF TRUMP'S COST-CUTTING DEPARTMENT After dishing out details about DOGE's cost-cutting mission, Baier took a more personal turn in his one-on-one with Musk Friday. In addition to his concern about declining birthrates, the Tesla founder also explained his worries for America's future. \"I worry generally about the strength of America. America is the central column that holds up all of Western civilization... If that column fails, it's all over. You can't run off to New Zealand or some other place. It's over. So either we strengthen that column and make sure America is strong, and we'll be strong for a long time, or that roof's coming down,\" he told Baier. Musk said he remained optimistic about \"the potential for a great future as long as America remains the land of freedom and opportunity.\" He went on to praise the efforts of President Donald Trump and the DOGE team in fighting to secure the \"fundamental principles\" of freedom. He previously appeared Thursday on the program with seven DOGE members, Steve Davis, Joe Gebbia, Aram Moghaddassi, Brad Smith, Anthony Armstrong, Tom Krause and Tyler Hassen. The group offered a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the department’s work from the Internal Revenue Source to the Interior Department to Social Security. DOGE DEPUTY, TREASURY SECRETARY DISH ON CRUSADE TO PULL THE IRS OUT OF ITS ‘REALLY BIG HOLE’ As of March 28, DOGE claims on its site it has saved Americans $130 billion, or $807.45 per taxpayer. President Donald Trump tasked the organization with optimizing the federal government, streamlining operations and slashing spending and gave the agency 18 months to do it. The department has canceled numerous diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at federal agencies, consulting contracts, leases for underused federal buildings and duplicate agencies and programs. During part two of his interview on \"Special Report,\" Musk was pressed about growing protests and scrutiny from critics over his fraud-exposing work. \"Everything I do is under extreme scrutiny. So there's not an action I can take that doesn't get scrutiny six ways to Sunday. Every action that the DOGE team does is public... It's the most amount of transparency there's been about any government thing ever,\" he said, noting his companies are \"suffering\" due to his role in the Trump administration. Musk and DOGE have been a lightning rod for criticism due to the department's commitment to slashing waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. Critics contend the organization has too much access to federal systems and should not be permitted to cancel federal contracts or make cuts to various agencies.
