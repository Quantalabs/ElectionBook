However, on election day, America turned out in force to elect Mr Trump, returning him to the White House for a second term.\n\nThe finding came from the Echelon Insights survey which showed no other politician held a candle to Ms Harris when it came to leading the Democrats into the next election.\n\nRegistered voters were asked if the presidential primary was held today, who they would support and Ms Harris was miles ahead.\n\nThe vice president held 41 per cent of the support from those surveyed, with the next nearest option being Gavin Newsom who secured 8 per cent.\n\nNotably, 16 per cent of respondents said they were unsure.\n\nMs Harris has not yet addressed if she plans to run again for the presidency, however, the strong result will surely be a reassuring boost to her confidence.\n\nIn her concession speech at her alma mater Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington., Ms Harris said: “While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign.”\n\n“Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn’t mean we won’t win.”\n\nHarris pledged to continue fighting for women’s rights and against gun violence, adding she would continue to “fight for the dignity that all people deserve.”\n\nAfter the election loss, criticism continued to mount on Mr Biden over his late decision to drop out of the presidential race. Citizens and political commentators said is delay did not allowing Ms Harris the time she needed to win over voters.\n\nThe now-outgoing vice president has been notably absent from public events since her election loss.\n\nMr Biden and Ms Harris were seen together for the first time since the shocking election on Tuesday, November 12 as they observed Veterans Day together by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n- With Reuters\n\nThe Echelon Insights survey had a poll of 1010 registered US voters and was conducted between November 14 to 18 2024.","summary":"Just weeks after Vice President Kamala Harris suffered a dismal loss to President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 US election, a shocking result has exposed what political future she could have.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/world-politics/kamala-harris-2028-echelon-insights-survey-shows-vice-president-democrat-front-runner-for-next-election-c-16825810","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-16825810/ff3c8585bf6c4680c03f54d28c3dffd2d0ff1dfe-16x9-x0y97w2919h1642.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 01:00:07","author":"Max Corstorphan","authors":["Max Corstorphan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":266136108,"title":"Taylor Swift fans turn on NFL star's wife after Kansas City Chiefs taunt","text":"Swifties are up in arms after Buffalo Bills linebacker Baylon Spector's wife Ryleigh took a cheeky swipe at Taylor Swift.\n\nFollowing the Bills' victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, which ended the latter's hopes for an undefeated NFL season with a 30-21 defeat, Ryleigh couldn't resist a dig at the pop sensation. Despite rumours that Swift might show up at Highmark Stadium to cheer on her partner, Chiefs star Travis Kelce, during a break from her Eras Tour in Toronto, she was notably absent from the packed venue.\n\nRyleigh's post-game social media post boasted about the Bills' stellar 9-2 record and included a thinly veiled barb aimed at the award-winning singer. \"9-2! Never a Swiftie,\" she posted, alongside a photo with Ryan Bass and Alexandra Knox, partners of Tyler Bass and Dalton Knox respectively.\n\n Aaron Rodgers' New York Jets in disarray as another top figure sacked NFL legend takes Jake Paul and Mike Tyson swipe in response to Bill Belichick \n\nThe comment didn't sit well with Swift's loyal fanbase, who quickly jumped to her defence. Fans lashed out at Ryleigh's apparent snub, with one saying: \"If it wasn't for Low Class... She would have NO CLASS. Do better\" - while another added: \"She obviously has a very low self-esteem to go out of her way to put down Taylor Swift. When I read all this ---- I think I'm back in high school.\"\n\nAnother fan weighed in, saying: \"Really? So unnecessary and immature. You would think women would support someone who has brought so many other women and children for that matter back to loving the sport. Shows their true character. They should be embarrassed.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Swift's loyal fans have targeted an NFL player's partner. In August, Swifties criticised Brittany Mahomes - wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick - after she seemed to show her support for President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Brittany liked a Trump Instagram post outlining his policies, Swift was noticeably absent from the same suite as the 29-year-old, sparking rumours their friendship had ended. Responding to the backlash, Brittany posted on Instagram: \"I mean honestly... To be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep-rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood. There's no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.\"\n\nThen in October, Kayla Nicole - Kelce's ex-girlfriend - opened up about dealing with online hate during an appearance on Chicago Sky star Angel Reese's podcast 'Unapologetically Angel'. \"I would be lying if I said that that level of hate and just, like, online chaos doesn't impact me,\" Nicole admitted.\n\n\"It does, even to this day.

The junk food industry is not lovin’ it.\n\nRealClearInvestigations has learned that representatives of companies that make snack foods, sugary beverages, and cooking oils are already meeting to discuss how to thwart the reform agenda of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former consumer rights attorney Trump has said he will nominate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Their response provides an early example of what experts predict will be a massive effort by D.C. lobbyists to position their clients in response to Trump’s pledge to change how Washington does business.\n\nAlthough much of the early criticism of Kennedy’s nomination has focused on his skepticism regarding some vaccines, the nominee is a longtime critic of the food industry, which he says is a leading contributor to America’s obesity epidemic. In recent months, he has called for a crackdown on food additives, limits on certain crop protection chemicals, stronger guidelines regarding what he says are conflicts of interest among regulators and business, and a review of any substance causing, what he argues, Americans to be “mass poisoned by big pharma and big food.”\n\nKennedy’s nomination sets up what may turn out to be the biggest reversal between the first Trump administration and the second. The last time around, Trump’s appointees, acting in deference to traditional business interests, moved to reverse regulations on neurotoxic insecticides and added delays to updates for school lunch nutritional standards.\n\nIn videos that have gone viral this year, Kennedy has singled out ultra-processed food as a priority for what Kennedy has called his “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda. In one video devoted to the potential dangers of Yellow 5 food dye, Kennedy stands before a table with Doritos chips and Cap’n Crunch cereal and claims the ingredients used in such products are one reason more than 40% of American adults are classified as obese by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The dye, also known as tartrazine, has been linked to behavioral problems in children and other health risks. The European Union requires child warning labels for products with tartrazine.\n\nKennedy has made similar arguments about the widespread use of seed oils – including those from corn, soybeans, sunflowers, and peanuts – especially in highly processed foods. Research suggests that high levels of seed oils, rich in polyunsaturated fat, can cause inflammation. America’s overreliance on seed oils in fast food and snack products, Kennedy claims, is a major overlooked factor in the health crisis.\n\nFood industry leaders began sounding the alarm even before the election. In October, Invariant, a powerful government relations firm that advises many food companies on how to shape policies in Washington, D.C., warned clients of Kennedy’s growing sway over Trump and the Republican Party.\n\n“Increasing number of voices on the right target the food industry,” an October memo stated, which went out to clients that include McDonald’s and America’s largest candy makers. The lobbyists warned that Kennedy’s MAHA movement “had gained increasing momentum among conservative figures who have taken a more vocal interest in the way food is produced and regulated.”\n\nThose initial alarm bells have become a siren among snack food makers and agribusiness representatives, according to records obtained by RCI. Last Friday, lobbyists for major processed food producers huddled over Zoom to discuss the rise of MAHA and how best to handle Kennedy’s recently announced nomination.\n\nDanielle Beck, a participant on the call who represents PepsiCo, makers of Doritos and Cap’n Crunch, and the Corn Refiners Association, a trade group for the largest producers of corn-based seed oils, noted that Congress could limit Kennedy’s abilities.\n\nThe “traditional agriculture and food stakeholders,” Beck noted, “might look to leverage, you know, the appropriations process” to curb what Kennedy is allowed to “initiate or implement.”\n\nCongressional appropriators often use the annual funding process to limit federal authorities. In 2010, under sway from industry sources, the House Appropriations Committee inserted a provision into federal funding that forced tomato paste on frozen pizzas to be counted as a vegetable under dietary regulations.\n\nThe lobbyists noted that Kennedy’s lengthy set of demands could also be exploited to stymie his overall agenda. “If RFK Jr. is focused on twenty different things, chances of success are likely limited,” observed Ken Barbic, another Invariant lobbyist representing processed foods firms and farming interests.\n\nInvariant, though founded by Heather Podesta, a prominent Democratic fundraiser, boasts bipartisan influence. Barbic, for instance, served during the first Trump administration in the Department of Agriculture and the firm employs a number of former GOP aides.\n\nThe Senate confirmation process, the lobbyists added, could be another process through which industry may shape the MAHA list of priorities. As Kennedy meets with individual senators, Beck noted, “serious conversations and commitments can be made to secure those votes that might end up resulting in some shifts in RFK’s overall agenda.”\n\nIn other words, in order to line up more than 50 votes in the Senate, the lobbyists suggest Kennedy may be convinced to trade away some of his MAHA demands.\n\nSimilar strategy sessions have percolated across Washington Beltway lobbying shops representing food, beverage, and drug industries. The American Farm Bureau, which represents pesticide companies and farming interests, recently said it was working to “combat misinformation that has been spread by several sources including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding critical crop protection tools and agricultural practices.”\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, which represents Kellogg, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, General Mills, and other processed foods firms, has also met with lawmakers, preparing for a fight over MAHA agenda items, according to a report from Politico.\n\nOther Kennedy proposals could spark a ferocious backlash from corporate America, particularly his suggestion that the U.S. fall in line with most of the industrialized world and ban direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising. Drug firms spend more than $1 billion per year on television spots. Shutting off the gusher of ad dollars would likely mobilize stark opposition from media conglomerates and the drug lobby.\n\nBut it is RFK’s ideas around wellness and nutrition that have percolated most with the new Trump coalition. The farm and processed food lobby must contend with a sea change within the Republican Party, which now relies on populist vigor increasingly receptive to the idea of reforming the way American food is produced and sold.\n\nIn September, Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, led a roundtable discussion with popular food industry critics. During the hearing, the stars of this nascent movement, including Dr. Casey Means and her brother Calley Means, food blogger Vani Hari, and author Max Lugavere, took turns at the microphone to pin the blame for America’s poor health mainly on the influence of processed food companies.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Kennedy ally, was scheduled to host a similar roundtable but had to cancel at the last minute due to Hurricane Helene flooding in North Carolina.\n\nSuch rhetoric suggests a political realignment on food and wellness issues. Bernie Sanders, perhaps the Senate’s most liberal lawmaker, has held a series of hearings on chronic disease, focusing on the influence of corporate actors, and departing Biden administration officials have called for an overhaul of the dietary guidelines. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to provide a new definition of the “healthy ” food label with stronger limits on saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars, a proposal that might find continuity under a Kennedy-controlled agency.\n\nKennedy himself is a former Democrat-turned-independent who was briefly floated as the Environmental Protection Agency chief for President Barack Obama in 2008. He has worked on several successful litigation efforts that have challenged the safety of widely used chemicals. Kennedy was part of the team that challenged glyphosate, sold as Roundup, over its links to cancer, a case that led to a $290 million verdict for the plaintiffs. \n\nWhile such regulatory interventions were once the province of the left, the MAHA movement capitalizes on a shift in media consumption by those in the Trump orbit.\n\nJoe Rogan, the most popular podcaster in the country, has emphasized the dangers posed by high fructose corn syrup, seed oils, and sugary, processed foods. He has hosted many of the most vocal activists aligned with the MAHA movement, including the Means siblings.\n\n“I love this idea of you teaming up with Robert Kennedy, and I love this ‘Make America Healthy Again’ idea,” said Rogan during his sit-down with Trump during the campaign, which garnered over 50 million views on YouTube.\n\n“There are chemicals and ingredients in our food that are illegal in other countries because they’ve been shown to be toxic,” Rogan added during the interview.\n\nTrump, in response, pledged to give Kennedy wide latitude over health policy, though he said he disagreed with his views on energy and the environment. In the past, Kennedy has opposed expanded oil and natural gas fracking and previously supported a moratorium on new nuclear energy – priorities of the new administration.\n\nYet Kennedy’s focus on health taps into a rich vein of new populist energy that defies easy ideological definition. The outreach to podcasters and wellness influencers has been credited with helping Trump secure the young male vote, which swung away from Democrats by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nIt is a dynamic agribusiness interests have noticed. The Invariant team credited the rise of RFK’s influence to the growing prominence of podcasts and independent media.\n\n“Trump appeared on more than 35 different podcasts,” noted Jenny Werwa, a strategic communications consultant with Invariant.\n\nWhen seeking influence with policymakers, the food and beverage industry typically focuses advertising dollars on insider Beltway media, such as Politico and Punchbowl News, added Werwa during the call with clients last Friday. Instead, she suggested, the industry should “think about how you might be able to partner with non-traditional media for content,” adding that Rogan and certain independent Substack publishers should be considered moving forward.\n\nConsumer brands generally seek to avoid public engagement in politics, typically working through third parties and industry groups.\n\nInvariant is one of many lobbying firms in the middle of the conflict. The firm not only represents highly processed snack producers, corn refiners, and fast food establishments like McDonald’s, but also Campbell Soup, McCain Foods, and the American Beverage Association, the lobby group for sugary sodas.\n\nThe lobbyists at the firm shared a memo outlining additional steps. Clients in the “food and agriculture space need to continue both defensive efforts – including legislative and regulatory efforts – while also considering offensive approaches that engage positively in the broader health focused debate.” The offensive approaches, however, are yet to be seen.\n\nIn the meantime, food industry giants might also hang some hope on the influence and taste of Kennedy’s boss. In a viral post-election photo, Trump is shown having dinner on his private plane with his son Don Jr., Kennedy, and Elon Musk. The menu: Big Macs and fries.\n\nSUPPORT TRUTHFUL JOURNALISM.

Pritzker, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.\n\nSixteen per cent said they were unsure.\n\nOn the Republican side, Vice President-elect JD Vance was the top pick for the 2028 nomination with 37 per cent, followed by Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley tied on 9 per cent, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on 8 per cent and Texas Senator Ted Cruz on 5 per cent.\n\nThe surprising poll comes despite Mr Trump’s crushing election victory on November 5, which saw the former President pull off the greatest political comeback in history.\n\nMr Trump swept every swing state to win the electoral college by 312-226, and also became the first Republican to win the popular vote since 2004.\n\nRepublicans took the Senate and retained control of the House of Representatives, handing them all three branches of government.\n\nA massive red shift across the country saw 90 per cent of counties move to the right, with Ms Harris severely underperforming Joe Biden’s 2020 election results.\n\nMr Trump received 2.5 million more votes compared with 2020, while Ms Harris received 7.1 million fewer votes than Mr Biden.\n\nThe Republican improved his vote share in nearly every demographic, especially among traditionally Democratic-leaning Latinos, Asians and black men.\n\nMs Harris’ resounding defeat has sparked a wave of recriminations and soul-searching both within the Democratic Party and the broader American left.\n\nIndependent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, said the party had abandoned its base during the “disastrous” campaign.\n\n“It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” Mr Sanders said in a statement.\n\n“First it was the working class, and now it is Latino and black voters as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they’re right.”\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut warned the party was “out of touch” and refusing to listen to genuine concerns fuelling the rise of MAGA.\n\n“The left has never fully grappled with the wreckage of 50 years of neoliberalism, which has left legions of Americans adrift as local places are hollowed out, rapacious profit seeking cannibalises the common good, and unchecked new technology separates and isolates us,” he wrote in an election post-mortem on X.\n\nMeanwhile many slammed the Harris campaign’s reckless spending on celebrity endorsements and events.\n\nLindy Li, a member of the Democratic National Committee finance committee, branded it an epic “$1 billion disaster”, referring to the record sum raised by the campaign only to cross the finish line tens of millions in debt.\n\n“It’s incredible, and I raised millions of that,” Ms Li told Fox News earlier this month. “I have friends I have to be accountable to and explain what happened because I told them it was a margin-of-error race.”\n\nMs Li argued that Mr Biden, by immediately endorsing his Vice President after dropping out, delivered a “big f**k you” to the party.\n\n“‘If you don’t want me, here’s somebody you may not like, deal with it,’” Ms Li said. “Kind of like sticking it to the man.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, widely believed to have played a key role in ousting Mr Biden from the race, defended Ms Harris’ performance and also pointed the finger at the President for effectively scuttling any chance of picking an alternative candidate.\n\n“The anticipation was that, if the President were to step aside, that there would be an open primary,” Ms Pelosi told The New York Times.\n\n“And as I say, Kamala may have, I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward. But we don’t know that. That didn’t happen. We live with what happened. And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different. But that’s not, we’re not here to agonise.”\n\nMs Pelosi would not be drawn on if Ms Harris should run again.\n\n“Well, that’s a whole other conversation, the decisions that people make,” she said.","summary":"She may have been destroyed by Donald Trump in the election, but now some Democrats are considering the unthinkable.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/shock-poll-predicts-kamala-comeback-in-2028/news-story/570a93a7daf9fdf95c202f144885016d?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/793778afdcb9687d701acbdea97a58ee","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:59:28","author":"Frank Chung","authors":["Frank Chung"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":266136506,"title":"Can Democrats fill judicial vacancies before January?","text":"Can Democrats fill judicial vacancies before January?\n President-elect Donald Trump is urging Republicans to slow down President Biden's judicial nominations before January.

They have a strategic communications campaign,” Goldberg told JNS.\n\n“We’re going to have sanctions on the Israelis, but we’re going to balance that out with some sanctions on Iran, and we’re going to have a couple of sanctions on Hamas and then we’re going to get back to pushing Israel on a ceasefire with Hezbollah,” he added. “There’s no real strategy here.”\n\nInstead of imposing sanctions “for impact and behavioral effect, they seem to always roll out sanctions for the sake of headlines and political and press effects, not policy effects,” he said.\n\nThe move to sanction six additional members of Hamas comes as the terror group’s leadership has reportedly relocated from Qatar to Turkey.\n\nMajed Al Ansari, the spokesman for the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirmed on Tuesday that the Hamas negotiating team was no longer in Doha but said that no decision had been made to permanently close its office in the city.\n\n“The office of Hamas in Doha was created for the sake of the mediation process,” Al Ansari stated. “Obviously, when there is no mediation process, the office itself doesn’t have any function other than being part of the mediation process.”\n\n“At the moment, I can confirm that they are not in Doha, but I won’t go into the details of what that means,” he added. “The decision to close it down—to close down the office permanently—is a decision that you will hear about from us directly, and it shouldn’t be part of media speculation.”\n\nQatar announced on Nov. 9 that it had suspended its role as a mediator between Israel and Hamas to achieve a ceasefire-for-hostages deal but denied media reports that it had ordered the Hamas office be closed.\n\nGoldberg told JNS that the Biden administration has not used the tools it has available to require Qatar and Turkey, both U.S. allies, to force the members of Hamas’s overseas political leadership to release hostages the group holds in Gaza.\n\n“I find it troubling that the Biden administration would give Qatar any room to allow these council members to leave Qatar without being detained, arrested or extradited,” he said. “These are the terror leaders of Hamas. They should be under pressure to surrender publicly.”\n\nWashington has designated Hamas a foreign terror organization since October 1997.\n\n“Why would they be allowed to just leave Doha freely and travel to Turkey?” Goldberg told JNS. “Why would Turkey be allowed to have Hamas terrorist leaders travel in and out of Turkey without any arrest, detention or extradition?”\n\n‘Increase its pressure on government’\n\nWith President-elect Donald Trump set to take office on Jan. 20, revising the Biden administration’s sanctions policies, including its executive order on “high levels of extremist settler violence” in Judea and Samaria, is likely to be a priority for the new administration.\n\nAnti-Israel politicians in Washington are encouraging the Biden administration to impose further sanctions on Israel.\n\n“One of the day-one priorities for an incoming administration should be to rescind the executive order, and then Congress needs to follow up and pass legislation to prohibit future presidents from ever trying to resuscitate a BDS campaign against Israel,” Goldberg said, referring to global efforts to boycott Israel.\n\nHe noted that “there will definitely be potential for a new administration to increase its pressure on governments that have influence over Hamas, that are harboring Hamas leaders.”","summary":"“The administration doesn’t really have a sanctions policy.

Dershowitz accused Bragg of trying to “freeze” the case for his political gain.\n\n“You can’t unfreeze a case any more than you can unfreeze… a live human, human being. What’s the purpose of freezing the case? It’s so obvious to any lawyer. Now, people who are not lawyers may not understand why Bragg wants the case to be frozen for four years,” Dershowitz said. “While the case is frozen, until there is a sentence, under New York law, Trump can’t appeal. We all know that once Trump appeals, the conviction will be reversed. Ideally, it will be reversed.”\n\n“There is no crime. You can’t even recite what there is because they tried to turn a misdemeanor into a felony, and it wasn’t even a misdemeanor. It was banned by the statute of limitations,” Dershowitz added. “There’s just no crime, but by putting off the sentencing for four years, actually four years and two months or so, several things can happen. Number one, Trump can’t appeal. So a conviction, jury verdict of guilt for a crime that didn’t exist, hangs over his head for four years, while he’s president. Exactly what Bragg wants, and I suspect it maybe it’ll be what Merchan wants as well.”\n\nA Manhattan jury of seven men and five women convicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsification of business records May 30 in the case, which centered around a $130,000 payout to porn star Stormy Daniels as part of a confidentiality agreement. Dershowitz said Trump’s attorneys could prevent the delay.\n\n“Here’s what I recommend the Trump lawyers do, and I will certainly be in touch with the Trump lawyers and tell them to do it and I’ll even help outline how to write the brief if they want my assistance on that: Bring a writ of mandamus,” Dershowitz said. “A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary application to the appellate courts to do something that the district court should have done, but refused to do so.”\n\nMerchan was scheduled to sentence Trump on Nov. 26, but he paused all deadlines Nov. 12.\n\n“So you bring a mandamus to the appellate division, saying: Look, we have a constitutional right to appeal. Judge Merchan, if he does this, is violating our constitutional right to appeal. This is a deliberate ploy, deliberate effort to try to prevent us from appealing because they know we’re gonna win this appeal,” Dershowitz said. “So we don’t care whether you delay the sentence or not. That’s not particularly the point. The point is: Let us appeal. Let us appeal now, with or without a sentence. Let us appeal, and I suspect the court would do one of two things: It would either let them appeal, which would be extraordinary. I’ve never heard of a case like that, but I’ve never heard of a case like this. It would either let them appeal, or it would demand, send it back to the district court judge and, say, sentence him within 30 days.”\n\n“One way or the other, sentence within 30 days, one or the other, the courts will not allow a four-year freeze designed to circumvent the right to an appeal,” Dershowitz added.\n\nThis story originally was published by the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

His presidential transition chair and the man he picked to be the secretary of commerce said he wouldn’t touch it. “They made themselves nuclear,” he said.\n\nBut the authors of Project 2025 — a 900-page playbook from a right-wing think tank for the next Republican president’s agenda — are all over Trump’s incoming administration.\n\nTrump is reportedly expected to appoint Russell Vought as the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, a key role that oversees spending across the administration. Vought also is among the architects of the Heritage Foundation’s plan and wrote the chapter on transforming the executive branch.\n\nHe was among the authors of the blueprint’s playbook for the first 180 days of the administration, and his Center for Renewing American is on Project 2025’s advisory board.\n\nTrump repeatedly tried to distance himself from the Heritage Foundation’s sweeping proposals on the campaign trail, claiming that he both knows “nothing” about it and has “no idea who is behind it” while also saying he disagrees with some of its “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” proposals.\n\n“Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them,” he added.\n\nHoward Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for secretary of commerce, told CNBC in September that there is “absolutely zero” connection between Trump’s campaign and Project 2025.\n\n“I won’t take a list from them,” said Lutnick, referencing the Heritage Foundation’s policy proposals and vetted hires for Trump’s administration. “I won’t take a topic from them. I won’t touch them. They made themselves nuclear.”\n\nTrump has since nominated several of the authors to key roles in his administration.\n\nBrendan Carr, Trump’s nominee to chair the Federal Communications Commission, authored Project 2025’s chapter on the agency, which regulates television, radio, internet and communications.\n\nTrump’s “border czar” Tom Homan — a former acting director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement who will lead Trump’s plan for mass deportations — also is listed among the contributors to Project 2025, and was a visiting fellow with the Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center, where he drafted a series of articles about immigration policy for the group.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence, was nominated as the next CIA director. He is included in Project 2025’s chapter on US intelligence.\n\nStephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s anti-immigration agenda in his first term in office, will return to the Trump White House as a deputy chief of staff for policy, overseeing Trump’s agenda.\n\nHis organization America First Legal was initially listed among the contributors to Project 2025, but the group’s name was removed from its website after Trump and his allies began to criticize the proposal.\n\nProject 2025 — the name for the contents of the mammoth Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise — was a key focus of Democratic campaigns leading up to Election Day, with Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz routinely amplifying its agenda in an effort to underscore the stakes of Trump’s return to office.\n\nA series of segments throughout the Democratic National Convention even highlighted excerpts from the plan using oversized, printed-out hardcover versions.\n\nThe plan calls for mass firings across the federal workforce, abolishing the Department of Education, slashing funds for federal law enforcement agencies, and using agencies that regulate the airwaves and campaign financing to silence dissent. It also proposes mass deportations and banning widely used abortion drugs in an effort to outlaw abortion nationally, among many other proposals.\n\n“Some on the right, severe right, came up with this Project ‘25,” Trump said during a rally in September. “I don’t even know, some of them I know who they are, but they’re very, very conservative. They’re sort of the opposite of the radical left.”\n\nTrump campaign director Chris LaCivita said during the summer that Project 2025 had become a “pain in the ass.”\n\nBut shortly after Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, the Heritage Foundation signaled it was done hiding in the shadows and prepared to re-enter Trump’s orbit, while right-wing media personalities openly touted Project 2025’s contents.\n\n“Now that the election is over I think we can finally say that yeah actually Project 2025 is the agenda. Lol,” far-right influencer Matt Walsh wrote after the election. Podcaster Benny Johnson said “it is my honor to inform you all that Project 2025 was real the whole time.”\n\n“We’re so back,” one Heritage official said.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Trump campaign press secretary and incoming White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued to deny that Trump has anything to do with Project 2025.\n\n“After months of lies to the American people, Donald Trump is taking off the mask: He’s plotting a Project 2025 Cabinet to enact his dangerous vision starting on day one,” Democratic National Committee spokesperson Alex Floyd said in a statement on Wednesday.","summary":"Trump said he didn’t know who’s behind the blueprint for his return.

Our public safety record speaks for itself. We are the safest major city in America, here in Boston. And it’s because of the work that’s put in every day to build trust between our residents and law enforcement, and it’s because of our focus on making sure we are there when residents need us.”\n\nHoman blasted Wu during an interview on Newsmax Monday over comments she made the day before on WCVB’s “On The Record.” During the appearance, Wu reiterated previous statements she’d made that Boston’s resources and personnel, including police, are not expected to cooperate with federal agents attempting to detain migrants on civil warrants in the city.\n\n“She’s not very smart, I’ll give her that,” Homan said. “What I just said is President Trump is going to prioritize public safety threats.”\n\n“Either she helps us or gets the hell out of the way because we’re going to do it,” he went on to say. “And look, there’s a clear line here. … They can not cooperate, but there are certain laws in place that they can’t cross and I hope she doesn’t cross it.”\n\nTrump campaigned on carrying out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Homan, a former Border Patrol agent who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2017 and 2018, has said he plans to “run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”At other times, he has said that the administration will not conduct roundups of immigrants and instead will move forward in a “humane manner.”\n\nIn the last week, Wu has repeatedly pointed towards an existing law in Boston, passed in 2014, that prohibits Boston police officers from coordinating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in a number of scenarios. \n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Wu again pointed to the law, noting that its passage had the support of the police department and public safety officials who recognized that residents need to feel safe reaching out to 9-1-1 when they need help or to share information about crimes that take place.\n\n“We have clear provisions where in the spaces where there are criminal actions that have taken place or on particular types of cooperation, like human trafficking, drug trafficking, child exploitation, cyber crimes, those are spaces that are very clearly laid out where the city does work alongside every level of government to protect our residents,” Wu said, according to CommonWealth Beacon.\n\n“Our policies at the local level are the interest of public safety and our record backs it up,” she said.\n\nThe mayor and Harvard graduate accused the incoming Republican administration of “talking out of both sides of their mouth” by making mass deportations a campaign promise and then saying it will only prioritize cases related to criminal activity. \n\nWu said her administration is reaching out to the “broader community” to ensure people know about the spaces where “the city of Boston does not interact with and does not communicate around immigration status.” \n\n“So you know you are safe in accessing public safety at the local level, in bringing your kid to school, in coming to our community centers,” Wu said. “The federal government does what the federal government does. And no city has the authority to override that. Elections have consequences. But we are also elected here in Boston to do what we do, and to focus on our work at the local level.”","summary":"“Our policies at the local level are in the interest of public safety and our record backs it up.”\n\n\nThe post ‘This isn’t about me’: Wu hits back at Trump border czar Tom Homan over deportation rhetoric appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/11/20/this-isnt-about-me-wu-hits-back-at-trump-border-czar-tom-homan-over-deportation-rhetoric/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GD5CZSVQFF73O4LNBD2K2BVJFA-671d7a570df10-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:39:22","author":"Dialynn Dwyer","authors":["Dialynn Dwyer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":266133272,"title":"NY’s $7.7B in handouts for film industry come under scrutiny","text":"New York’s $7.7 billion in handouts for the film industry came under scrutiny Wednesday — as state lawmakers seized on a new analysis showing taxpayers aren’t getting the best bang for their bucks.\n\nThe independent analysis of the Film Production Tax Credit, conducted by a Philadelphia-based consulting firm, found the nearly $700 million yearly in forgone revenue returns only about 31 cents on the dollar. \n\n“We now have more than enough evidence to demonstrate that a lot of this programming, a lot of the spending, is not being spent wisely and we have to do something about it,” state Sen. Jim Skoufis said after a hearing on economic incentives.\n\nAlbany signed off last year on massive new incentives to encourage film and TV productions to shoot in New York — adding up to $7.7 billion over 11 years — with dubious proof as to how much economic return the handouts would actually bring to the state.\n\nAshley Ranslow, NY State Director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, testified the mid-sized businesses she represents don’t really feel a substantial impact from the program.\n\n“For three quarters of a billion dollars I question how that is really helping small businesses generally,” Ranslow told lawmakers.\n\nSkoufis took the head of New York’s economic development arm to task during the hearing, asking her at one point if any analysis of an incentive program conducted by her agency had ever shown a negative return on investment.\n\n“Not during the time that I’ve been in this seat, but I can look back and see if that’s been the case,” Hope Knight, CEO of Empire State Development, responded. \n\nShe tried to cast doubt on the damning independent study of the film production tax credit — which was ordered by Gov. Kathy Hochul and the legislature — by saying it didn’t factor in enough of the trickle-down economic benefits small businesses, like caterers and hotels, see when a film production comes to town.\n\n“I think you have to look more inclusively at that metric because … so much of the film industry is connected to the small business community where these productions exist and so there is significant induced activity as a result of these productions engaging the local economy,” Knight told lawmakers.\n\nKnight pointed to other state studies that have estimated the production tax credit nets $1.70 for local and state governments for every $1 spent.\n\nBrian O’Leary, tax counsel for the Motion Picture Association, an industry group pushing for the incentives, also pointed to the other reports to try and prove the program’s worth.\n\n“They have done a credible job of, through the beginning of the history of this program, of showing not just showing the growth in production, but the growth in jobs and union jobs as well as the investments in infrastructure,” O’Leary said.\n\nBut Skoufis pointed out that the litany of reports and surveys presented by the MPA had been paid for by the film industry group itself.\n\n“They conveniently left out that those analyses were commissioned by them, paid for by them. So, of course, they’re going to come back and underscore exactly what they want to underscore,” the Hudson Valley rep later told reporters.\n\nState Sen. Liz Krueger, chair of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, shed considerable doubt on the incentives at the conclusion of the hearing and noted that the state needs to tighten its belt since it can’t easily lean on Washington for financial help with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\n“We know we’re walking into an era where we expect far less cooperation or funding from our federal government. We have to get smarter in New York state about what programs we operate, whether they are worth their salt, whether they are a bad use of the public’s money,” Krueger said.\n\n“Are we going to frankly continue to just have bad policies that we’ve known are bad policies forever and yet not choose to do anything about them?” she added. “I hope that we will choose to do something about them.”\n\nThe non-profit group Reinvent Albany calculates that New York spends $75,000 on every film and TV job supported by the program.\n\n“Credit the State Senate for using facts to punch through the Hollywood lobbying fog to show the $7.7 billion Film/TV tax credit and other corporate subsidies are a waste of New York tax dollars,” Executive Director John Kaehny, who also testified, told The Post after the hearing.\n\n“Does anyone but [Empire State Development] and the film industry think spending $75,000 in taxpayer money to pay for one full-time film job for one year is OK?” he added. “This is what legal corruption looks like in New York.”","summary":"Empire State Development CEO Hope Knight defended state incentives like the Film Production Tax Credit even after a damning independent analysis

Findling was replaced by Steven Sadow in 2023.Newsweek has contacted Findling and attorney Alek Ubieta by email for comment.Lil Durk is accused of being the mastermind behind the 2022 plan to kill fellow rapper Quando Rondo, allegedly in retaliation to the 2020 shooting death of rapper King Von. He allegedly hired five men associated with his Only the Family (OTF) label to carry out Rondo's shooting, which did not kill Rondo but instead his cousin, Saviay'a Robinson.A California grand jury indicted Kavon London Grant, Deandre Dontrell Wilson, Keith Jones, David Brian Lindsey, and Asa Houston.Lil Durk was later arrested at the Miami International Airport as prosecutors claimed he was trying to leave the country.All six defendants are expected to be arraigned in the United States District Court in Los Angeles in the coming weeks.Lil Durk is facing charges of conspiracy, use of interstate facilities to commit murder-for-hire resulting in death, and using, carrying, and discharging firearms and a machine gun and possession of such firearms.Last week, an LA federal grand jury approved additional charges against Lil Durk of using, carrying, and discharging firearms, including a machine gun, in furtherance of a crime of violence resulting in death.Co-Conspirators' Alleged RolesProsecutors allege that the five defendants used two vehicles and worked in tandem to track, stalk, and attempt to murder Rondo at a gas station in Los Angeles.They claim Lil Durk has a monetary bond on Rondo's life. They say that the hitmen allegedly used credit cards linked to OTF and Lil Durk to book one-way flights from Chicago to San Diego on August 18, 2022, as well as a hotel room at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Universal City, California.Text messages between Lil Durk and one of the alleged hitmen read, \"Don't book no flights under no names involved wit [sic] me,\" according to the complaint.Lil Durk also flew to California with Grant on a private plane on August 18.Later that day, Grant allegedly bought black ski masks for the hitmen to wear during the murder.Surveillance video allegedly captured Rondo and Robinson riding around town on the day of Robinson's murder in a black Escalade and being followed by a white Infiniti and white BMW allegedly carrying the hitmen.Jones, Lindsey, and an unidentified third man allegedly opened fire on the Escalade at a gas station, ran back to the Infiniti, and drove away.About 50 minutes after the shooting, surveillance video from an In-N-Out Burger in Los Angeles captured the co-conspirators at the restaurant.A few hours later, Jones, Lindsey, Wilson, Houston, and an unidentified co-conspirator boarded a flight from San Diego to Chicago booked with the same credit card linked to OTF and Lil Durk.The men were arrested in Chicago on October 24. Upon the arrests, the FBI received a tip that Lil Durk had booked two international flights: a one-way flight from Miami to Dubai connecting through Doha, Qatar, scheduled to depart the evening of October 24, and another one-way flight from Fort Lauderdale to Switzerland, connecting through New Jersey, also scheduled to leave that night.Lil Durk did not board either flight and the FBI learned he was on a private plane departing from Miami to Italy that night. He was arrested at the Miami airport.Do you have a story Newsweek should be covering? Do you have any questions about this story?

A journalist’s ethical job was originally to objectively present facts, not manipulatively manufacture consent for certain political ideologies. Yet, since the 1960s, journalism has changed dramatically as the left-wing ideal is to coerce and force the public to agree with the Marxist narrative.\n\nLeading Marxist intellectuals like Herbert Marcuse, the architect of the 1960s student revolution, spoke vividly about the importance of departing from the classical freedom of free speech, quenching it through “repressive tolerance.” In “A critique of pure tolerance,” he explains how to shut down the respect for plurality and the views of conservatives and others who were critical of his radical ideology. The aim was to kill the immensely prosperous traditional Western culture and quench its economic success. The admirer of Karl Marx, Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) further explained the Marxist tactic of ruthlessly curbing free speech: “We must be ready to employ trickery, deceit, law-breaking, withholding and concealing truth. … We can and must write in a language which sows among the masses hate, revulsion and scorn towards those who disagree with us.”\n\nMSNBC anchor Joy Reid’s recent on-air speech is a textbook example of this type of Marxist-Leninist trickery, deceit and slandering of political opponents. It is a remarkable testament to the deterioration of American journalism that she was even allowed on air. Reid began by admitting – hours before the Nov. 5 election results came in – that MSNBC biasedly had done all it could to ensure Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election. She explained that “one side stands for freedom while the other meets the textbook definition of fascism, a far-right dictatorial regime, a Hitler’s Germany or Franco’s Spain or Mussolini’s Italy, but also white-ruled South Africa before Mandela and the black majority took control, or Vladimir Putin’s Russia, or Victor Orbán’s Hungary or Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela today that suppresses the rights of women and minorities, uses the military to execute the whims of a strongman dictator, and controls and suppresses the press, education, the arts, rewrites history to suit a favored and dominant racial class, and foments extravagant corruption in order to enrich the dictator and his friends. We have warned you about Donald Trump’s profound unfitness for office.”\n\nSo, the man Americans overwhelmingly voted for is a dictator, not democratically elected?! Does she have any idea of how utterly ignorant she is perceived abroad? Is she even able to place Hungary on the map? Or is she just reading a given text from a teleprompter? Is she aware of the horrifying deterioration and corruption of South Africa since the ANC took power, how corporate globalists are notoriously exploiting the resources of that nation?\n\nHow can an editor allow such incompetence and lack of knowledge on display, totally out of sync with reality? Are there no checks-and-balances for employment at MSNBC? Most of those she called dictators are elected by the people, Reid displaying arrogant contempt for the citizens of other nations.\n\nThe cringe continued as she claimed to know what President-elect Trump intended to do if he returned to power: “Threatening to lock up and even execute his political opponents … capital punishment and releasing the police unrestrained, using the military to suppress protests, banning abortion nationwide, persecuting LGBTQ Americans, spiking prices and crashing the economy with across-the-board tariffs that amounts to a giant Trump tax on everything you buy that is imported from overseas.”\n\nIf not pure stupidity, the Joy Reid speech could be in the Nancy Pelosi Marxist spirit. Pelosi is infamous for openly explaining the Democrat playbook on how the Democratic Party smears its opponents with falsehoods and lies, then reports the smear and lies to the press, then uses the same smear reported in the press to re-validate the lies as these are “confirmed by the press.” It is apparently called The Wrap Up Smear, of which Pelosi describes a tactic.\n\nMaybe Reid was simply reading a Wrap Up Smear.

Despite losing a chunk of its territory to Russians, Ukraine still valiantly fights on, having, in turn, actually occupied a part of Russian territory in the Kursk region. It was the first time since the Second War that anyone had occupied Russian territory. Though the latter is merely a symbolic act which has not forced Putin to divert troops from the theatre of war in Donetsk region, it marked a psychological high for the beleaguered Ukrainians. After a thousand days of war, Russia controls 20% of Ukrainian territory. The seemingly endless war, with neither combatant able to force its will, may now be entering a decisive phase. Donald Trump’s election as the next US President has overnight triggered fast-paced developments. The outgoing US President Joe Biden’s belated approval for Ukraine to use the medium range missiles to attack targets in Russia has come as a shot in the arm for Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky. Within hours of the green signal, Ukraine fired a couple of missiles over a hundred kilometres inside Russia, destroying an arms depot. Russia warned that this was an unacceptable escalation and would invite strong retaliation. Within hours of the missile strikes inside, the American diplomatic staff was made to leave Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, as a Russian aerial assault was imminent. Meanwhile, Russia revised its much ballyhooed nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. As per the revised stance not only Ukraine which fired the missiles but their supplier, that is, the US, too is liable to face Russian retribution. Russians have been obliquely warning of using nuclear arms in the Ukraine war, now the timing of the revised nuclear stance too seems an empty warning. Putin may be a warmonger, obsessed with reclaiming the Soviet era glory for Russia but even the headstrong autocrat cannot be so foolish as to invite self-destruction by actually using nuclear arms to tame Ukraine. The truth is that Putin invaded Russia believing that in a few short weeks he would grab another Crimea-sized chunk of Ukraine and earn plaudits at home and validate his indefinite reign over Russia. He did not reckon that unlike the cake-walk in 2014 grabbing Crimea, he would meet a determined challenge from Ukraine and its western allies who readily supplied it arms and strategic assistance. Putin may have also misread Zelensky, a former TV comic, who displayed hitherto unsuspected leadership skills and an ability to enlist western leaders in aid of his cause. Defending Ukraine became a strategic cause for NATO powers since its capitulation would bring the Russian bear at their doorstep. Putin’s gamble glued European nations together, and obliged long-time unaligned Sweden and Finland into the NATO fold. Putin couldn’t have done worse to make NATO more cohesive, more powerful. However, with the inward — looking Trump winning the second term, Zelensky has shown flexibility, talking of a negotiated end to the war. Trump’s supporters, however, have criticised the Biden clearance for Ukraine to attack Russia inside its territory as a bid to foil his potential efforts to end the war. The so-called neo-cons entrenched in the Washington strategic community are being blamed for the latest escalation. One can reject such criticism since all that a potential Trump peace plan for Ukraine entails is its meek surrender of 20-percent territory now under Russian control.","summary":"","url":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/analysis/editorial-trump-seeks-peace-nobel-for-forcing-ukraine-surrender","image":"https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2020-06/26b24c38-de6a-4855-9042-011fc77f8e15/trump_afp.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:30:00","author":"Fpj Editorial","authors":["Fpj Editorial"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":266132196,"title":"Forget Melania, Musk’s all set to be Trump’s ‘first buddy’","text":"In an interview with Paris Match, Melania Trump dripped more disdain on the woman who succeeded and preceded her.

Vance when she tried to minimize the threat of gangs in Colorado taking over apartment buildings by force. “The incidents were limited to a handful of apartment complexes,” she said. It’s too bad for you if you lived in one of those buildings. \n\n“Do you hear yourself?” Vance asked.\n\nThat’s echoing now on biological males invading women’s sports. On his HBO soapbox “Last Week Tonight,” British comedian/activist John Oliver expressed disgust that Kamala Harris couldn’t rebut Donald Trump on this.\n\n“There are vanishingly few trans girls competing in high schools anywhere,” Oliver claimed. “Even if there were more, trans kids, like all kids, vary in athletic ability and there is no evidence they pose any threat to safety or fairness.”\n\nOut came the “no evidence” argument, which is simply overstated. You can easily find evidence, like 17-year-old volleyball player Payton McNabb getting injured in the head and neck and suffering partial paralysis after getting spiked in the face by a man in 2022. But Oliver dismissed her and her side. “It’s very weird for you to be so focused on the subject,” he said as he focused on the subject.\n\nMSNBC anchor Jen Psaki echoed Oliver, going after Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., telling the New York Times he didn’t want his girls to be run over on the field by a male. The backlash among Democrats was intense.\n\n“Reflection is good, but if that were actually an issue at thousands of schools across the country it would be worthy of a debate,” she said. “There are just incredibly few examples of transgender girls playing in youth sports, and when we do see these examples, there is no evidence that these kids are a threat to safety or fairness.”\n\nPsaki mocked the red states that passed bans on boys in girls’ sports since they could only find one in Utah and one in South Dakota. She may have a point, since it’s in blue states where this is all the rage, and the blue states wouldn’t dare offend the LGBTQ forces. The social contagion of transgenderism is at odds with the notion that the number is “vanishingly few.”\n\nOliver and Psaki are mad that this was a losing issue for Democrats. A survey from the University of Chicago found that 65% of Americans said transgender athletes should never or rarely be allowed to compete in sports leagues that don’t match their biological sex. The election seems to have underlined it.\n\n“Trump and the Republicans have managed to amplify their bad-faith attacks to the point where people do have concerns, as misguided and misinformed though those concerns may be,” Psaki claimed. On the Left, any challenge to transgender orthodoxy is considered a “bad-faith attack.” You’re “misinformed” if you think this issue isn’t insignificant. Dissent equals misinformation.\n\nPsaki described it as a fight between “manufactured panic” on the Right versus “actual facts” on the Left. But this professional Democrat failed to consider the actual fact that biological males simply cannot “become” girls in athletics. They have a pronounced physical advantage.\n\nThe libertine Left creates a “manufactured panic” that laws against transgender crossover into women’s sports is “targeting” people and harming their mental health to the point of suicide.\n\nConsider the actual fact that nearly 900 biological females were robbed of medals in sports competing against transgender athletes, according to a United Nations study titled “Violence against women and girls in sports.” Concerns about young women’s fairness and safety cannot be mocked away by comedians and cable TV hosts.","summary":"On the Left, any challenge to transgender orthodoxy is considered a 'bad-faith attack'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2024/11/tv-stars-mock-the-threat-of-fake-women-in-sports/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jen-psaki-green-dress.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:29:11","author":"Tim Graham","authors":["Tim Graham"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.433},{"id":266135204,"title":"Trump’s reelection: Whose ‘miracle’ was it?","text":"Based on what we were being told in the days leading up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election that the two candidates were in a virtual tie and it might take days after Nov. 5 to determine the winner, the unanticipated blowout by President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris enabled the election to be called in the former’s favor within hours after the polls closed. Never before in the history of presidential election polls have we seen so many pollsters be so wrong. For Republicans, who also won the House and Senate, it was as if a miracle had occurred. Were Tom Zimmer still alive today, he would probably be thinking to himself, “I told you it would happen.”\n\nWho was Zimmer?\n\nZimmer was a Catholic American who left the U.S. in the early 1970s to live in a town on the east coast of Italy. There he dedicated his life to his religion, co-authoring a prayer book that sold millions of copies and attending Mass several times a day. He lived as a hermit near the Basilica of the Holy House in Loreto, Italy, believed to enshrine the house where Mary – the mother of Jesus – is said to have lived. Zimmer issued several prophecies during his lifetime, becoming known as the Hermit of Loreto. In 2008, he returned to the U.S. to die, passing away in 2009 at age 83.\n\nZimmer made a fascinating prophecy in 1983. It was about a man he claimed would serve as president for two terms and would be used by God to bring America back to Him. Interestingly, while the man was identified by name 41 years ago and was well-known back then, he had never demonstrated any intention of entering into the political arena.\n\nHowever, a month after that man – Donald Trump – entered the Oval Office in 2017, a video was posted by American priest Giacomo Capoverdi on YouTube relating Zimmer’s prophecy. While Trump’s failure to win reelection in 2020 raised some doubts about him being a two-term president, Trump’s 2024 landslide reelection victory removed those doubts about Zimmer’s prophecy.\n\nSadly, Zimmer was right about America moving away from God. Many of the Christian values that motivated our Founding Fathers to risk their lives in establishing a nation in which all were free to practice their religions have been targeted as offensive in 21st century America. A 2020 article provided background on how this has happened:\n\n“For decades, secular humanists have been working to remove God from all aspects of life in America. Unfortunately, they have enjoyed a measure of success. With rare exceptions, prayer in schools, before high school football games, and at the beginning of public meetings is a thing of the past. Displaying Bible verses on the walls of your offices is now taboo. Recently a Christian with a pro-life license plate – a plate issued by the state of Florida – was told to remove it from her car or she could not park in the lot where she worked. There are many other examples of how secular humanists are pushing God out of our lives, but perhaps the most telling example is what we see happening in politics.\n\n“We see Supreme Court nominees and political candidates have their lives torn apart by unproven accusations, innuendo, rumors, and outright lies. Paid-thugs, posing as university students, incite riots to prevent Christians or conservatives from speaking. Members of Congress are stalked by protesters yelling profanity and making threats. Pro-life marchers are attacked by abortion advocates. Political candidates, including minorities, are labeled ‘racists,’ ‘bigots,’ and ‘misogynists’ for failing to toe the line of liberal orthodoxy. Campaign rallies devolve into fistfights between supporters of competing candidates. In short, politics in America has devolved into a gutter sport characterized by excessive partisanship, character assassination, personal animosity, venomous discourse, increasing polarization, name calling, smear campaigns, and even violence.”\n\nThe above article focused on how schools and colleges have transformed from Christian to godless institutions. By way of example, a school considered by many to be America’s flagship of higher education, Harvard University, was originally established to train ministers while that mission has long ago now been forgotten.\n\nDuring our Founding Fathers’ time, 99% of Americans identified as Christian, decreasing to 71% today, with a 12 point drop occurring between 2009-2019. In the two decades between 2000-2021, the percentage of adults regularly attending religious services dropped from 42% to 30%. By 2023, the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with any religion increased from 2% in 1948 to 22%. A Pew Research Center study determined that if things continue along these lines, Christians may not be a majority in the U.S. by 2070.\n\nOver the past four years of President Joe Biden’s term, little has been done to bring America closer to God. In fact, his FBI was weaponized to go after Catholics, spying on traditionalists from coast to coast. And a 2022 study cites the Democratic Party as a prime example of a group that has transitioned away from religion.\n\nIt is no wonder that Trump, during his campaign, promised to trigger a revival of Christian power if reelected. Catholics clearly saw a Trump presidency as ushering in an era of religious rebirth, overwhelmingly casting their votes for him as evidenced by the 56% to 41% margin he tallied. Boosting Trump’s Catholic support was Harris’ naive display of anti-Catholic bias, evidenced by her admonishment of students at one of her rallies who shouted “Christ is King” that they were at the “wrong rally.”\n\nIt is incredible that Zimmer prophesied not only a two-term presidency for Trump – who now will become the only president since Grover Cleveland to serve two non-consecutive terms – but also to win reelection by promising to bring America closer to God. While Republican supporters are pleased with a Trump “miracle,” somewhere “up there” Zimmer undoubtedly views it as God’s.","summary":"'Zimmer made a fascinating prophecy ... about a man he claimed would serve as president for 2 terms'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2024/11/trumps-reelection-whose-miracle-was-it/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/donald-trump-rally-atlanta-georgia-tech-20241028-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:27:47","author":"Lt.

Turkey offers to mediate. Plainly exhausted, both the Kremlin and Kyiv show clear signs of interest. Then, but a day later, the alleged U.S. president, Joe Biden, with 60 days left in office, sends word from his meanderings in the jungles of South America: In effect, “Yeah, I know I said I wouldn’t, but I think I will.”\n\nHe grants permission to Ukraine to send American-made (and probably operated) long-range missiles into Russia proper. This is the very thing Vladimir Putin had warned would be considered a declaration of war between Russia and us, if our missiles were used or with NATO if European missiles were used. In apparent coordination (or, perhaps, in the strangest coincidence in recorded history) England and France chimed in with their intention of sharing their long-range missiles with the Ukraine, as well, also capable of reaching deep into Russian territory.\n\nAnd while we wonder if this is some kind of mirage on the distant horizon, hopefully never to be reached, the Biden group decided, “If not us, who? And if not now, when?” The following day five U.S. made ATACMS missiles are launched from the Ukraine into Russia.\n\nPutin retaliates by sabotaging essential communication cables between several European countries. Or maybe they just happened to fail naturally, simultaneously. He announces a new, lowered standard for a justifiable atomic response to certain levels of conventional attack upon his fatherland, making it plain this is in reference to the heightened level of aggression. Both Russia and several north European countries begin to broadcast government advisories concerning needed preparations for a nuclear war.\n\nWe have witnessed one mind-boggling outrage after another from the Biden cabal for the last four years. Each time we have been shocked that they have actually succeeded in reaching new heights of inconceivable insanity. Our minds fail to embrace the entire catalog of nation killing policies and presidential orders. In the end we can only ask, “What have they done that was not to our detriment, and in most cases to the benefit of our adversaries?” We have all retreated into the mitigating claim of “incompetence” again and again. But the time for that is over.\n\nC.S. Lewis famously noted that Christ’s claim of divinity left no option for anyone to yammer about his being just some wonderfully wise man. It left but two choices. He was either who he said he was, that is God incarnate, or an utter lunatic, on the order of someone claiming to be a fried egg. \n\nSuch is the claim of “incompetence” regarding any of the murderous actions of Biden or whoever is pulling his strings. It can no longer be considered a viable description, as though yet another “failure.” Their only bitter failure has been to let Trump get elected. The rest, in their eyes, have been a long string of glorious, well executed successes. Joe’s brain may be fried, but the policies emanating from the White House are and have been evil personified. Their destructive effects have been the intentional work of those who despise America and who seek her conquest, one way or another.\n\nWhat we are witnessing can be more honestly seen as the doings of an elemental spirit of anti-Christ, willing to play very real games with the possibility of worldwide annihilation, rather than cede power to anyone intent on stopping America’s slide toward the abyss.","summary":"'Joe's brain may be fried, but the policies ... are and have been evil personified'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2024/11/a-spirit-of-anti-christ-continues-to-flow-from-white-house/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/skull-evil-matrix-600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:25:41","author":"Jim Darlington","authors":["Jim Darlington"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":266134582,"title":"US Senate votes down effort to withhold weapons to Israel amid Gaza war","text":"Washington, DC – The United States Senate has rejected a bill that aimed to block a US weapons sale to Israel amid the country’s war on Gaza, an outcome that rights advocates say does not take away from a growing push to condition aid to Washington’s top ally.\n\nA resolution to halt the sale of tank rounds failed to advance in a 79 to 18 vote on Wednesday with prominent progressives and mainstream Democratic senators backing the effort.\n\nTwo more resolutions to halt the sale of other weapons are still to be voted on, but the results are expected to be similar.\n\nThe proposal was part of a series of measures known as Joint Resolutions of Disapproval (JRDs) that Senator Bernie Sanders introduced in September to reject the sale of offensive weapons to Israel as part of a $20bn deal approved by the administration of President Joe Biden.\n\nIt was the first time ever that a weapon sale to Israel was subjected to such a vote.\n\nWhile support for the push may appear minimal, it represents a crack in the bipartisan consensus over unconditional US aid to Israel.\n\nBeth Miller, political director at the US-based advocacy group Jewish Voice for Peace, said the vote is an “inflexion point” in the decades-long effort to restrict Washington’s military assistance to Israel.\n\n“This is too little too late; this genocide has been going on for 13 months, but that does not change the fact that this is a critically important step,” Miller told Al Jazeera.\n\nMainstream support\n\nIn addition to Sanders, Senators Peter Welch, Jeff Merkley, Chris Van Hollen, Tim Kaine and Brian Schatz backed the resolution to block offensive munitions to Israel.\n\nWhile Sanders is a progressive independent who caucuses with Democrats, some of the lawmakers who backed the effort come from the mainstream wing of the party.\n\nKaine was the Democratic Party’s vice presidential nominee in the 2016 elections that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost to incoming Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a statement announcing his vote earlier on Wednesday, Kaine called for work towards “de-escalation and a sustainable peace” in the region.\n\n“Continued offensive weapons transfers will worsen the current crisis and add more fuel to the fire of regional instability,” the senator said.\n\n“Therefore, while I voted for the $14 billion defense aid package for Israel in April and continue to support the transfer of defensive weapons, I will vote to oppose the transfers of mortars, tank rounds, and Joint Direct Attack Munitions [JDAMs] to Israel.”\n\nOngoing US backing of Israel has been vital for funding the war on Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nA recent Brown University study found that the Biden administration spent $17.9bn on security assistance to Israel over the past year, despite warnings of United Nations experts that the US ally is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nThat assistance has persisted despite growing Israeli atrocities, including widespread destruction in Lebanon, sexual abuse of Palestinian prisoners and the suffocating siege in Gaza that has been starving the territory.\n\nWhite House intervention\n\nWhile Republicans were united in opposition to the measures, HuffPost reported that the Biden administration lobbied Democratic senators to vote against them.\n\nShelley Greenspan, the White House Liaison to the American Jewish community, appeared to confirm that report.\n\nGreenspan, a former employee of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), shared – with an approving emoji – a social media post saying that a lame duck Biden remains staunchly supportive of Israel, including by lobbying against Sanders’s resolutions.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.\n\n👇 https://t.co/FDdGmz1SxM\n— Shelley Greenspan (@ShelleyGspan) November 20, 2024\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) denounced the White House’s lobbying efforts.\n\n“We strongly condemn the White House’s dishonest campaign to pressure Senate Democrats into avoiding even a symbolic vote against the delivery of more American taxpayer-funded weapons to the out-of-control Netanyahu government,” the group said in a statement.\n\n“The Biden administration’s foreign policy in the Middle East has been a disastrous failure.”\n\nCAIR is one of dozens of advocacy and rights groups that backed the resolution.\n\nIn a speech on the Senate floor before the vote, Sanders cited that support ahead of the vote.\n\nHe said the resolutions are “simple, straightforward and not complicated”. He argued that the measures aim to apply US laws that prohibit military assistance to countries that block humanitarian aid and commit abuses.\n\n“A lot of folks come to the floor to talk about human rights and what’s going on around the world, but what I want to say to all those folks: Nobody is going to take anything you say with a grain of seriousness,” Sanders said.\n\n“You cannot condemn human rights [violations] around the world and then turn a blind eye to what the United States government is now funding in Israel. People will laugh in your face. They will say to you, ‘You’re concerned about China; you’re concerned about Russia; you’re concerned about Iran. Well, why are you funding the starvation of children in Gaza right now?”\n\n‘Moral obligation’\n\nSenator Jacky Rosen, a staunchly pro-Israel Democrat, spoke out against the resolutions, arguing that restrictions on aid to Israel would empower Iran and its allies in the region.\n\n“Israel has an absolute right to defend itself, and the aid provided by America is critical,” Rosen said.\n\nIf the resolution had passed, it would have needed to be approved in the House of Representatives as well before reaching the president’s desk, and Biden would have likely blocked them.\n\nA presidential veto can be overturned with a two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate.\n\nSeveral Democrats in the House of Representatives had voiced support for the JRDs.\n\nPramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and eight other lawmakers said in a joint statement: “President-elect Trump’s return to the White House will only embolden Netanyahu and his far-right ministers. A vote for the joint resolutions of disapproval is a vote to politically restrain the Netanyahu government from any forthcoming efforts to formally annex the West Bank and settle parts of Gaza.”\n\nMiller, of Jewish Voice for Peace, said lawmakers had ethical, legal and political obligations to vote in favour of the resolution.\n\n“There is a moral obligation for them to stop arming a genocide. There is a legal obligation for them to follow US law and stop sending weapons to a government that is using our equipment in violation of our own law. And there is a political obligation for them to do what their constituents are telling them to do,” she said.","summary":"The push led by Senator Bernie Sanders falls short, but advocates say it shows progress for Palestinian rights movement.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/21/us-senate-votes-down-effort-to-withhold-weapons-to-israel-amid-gaza-war?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-19T195625Z_513991876_RC2H8BAP92G9_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-USA-CONGRESS-1732135807.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:24:23","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":266134392,"title":"How President-Elect Trump Plans To Transform Washington (2)","text":"Similarly, heliocentrism, first proposed by Aristarchus of Samos (c. 310–230 BCE) and later revived by Copernicus (1473–1543 CE), met staunch opposition. The Catholic Church opposed Copernicus’ model, and advocates like Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei faced severe consequences—Bruno was executed, and Galileo was confined to house arrest for defending the idea of a Sun-centered universe.\n\nTrump’s political journey bears striking parallels to the struggles of these historical figures. Like them, he has faced significant resistance—allegations of election fraud in 2020, impeachment efforts, legal challenges, and even threats to his life during the 2024 campaign. Yet, his return to the presidency, set for January 20, 2025, underscores his resilience and broad support. The Republican Party’s simultane-ous control of the Senate and the House of Repre-sentatives—a first in a century—further highlights the movement he has built.\n\nTrump’s determination recalls figures like Ferdinand Magellan, whose historic circumnavi-gation proved the earth’s spherical shape. Just as Magellan’s expedition was driven by perseverance, Trump’s commitment to “draining the Washington swamp” and instituting bold reforms is poised to reshape the U.S. political landscape.\n\nThis anticipated transformation is comparable to other seismic shifts in human understanding, such as the visual confirmation of the earth’s shape via 20th-century satellite imagery or the revolutionary effects of artificial intelligence and social media. These innovations redefined how humanity inter-acts with the world, much like Trump’s policies are expected to redefine U.S. governance and global influence.\n\nIn preparation for his second term, Trump has begun assembling a team reflective of his unortho-dox approach. He has appointed long-time ally Susie Wiles as Chief of Staff, crediting her for his electoral success. Key nominations include Tom Homan as Border Czar, Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, and former Congressman Matt Gaetz as Attorney General.\n\nOther notable appointees include Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, as Director of National Intelligence; Chris Wright, an oil industry executive, as Energy Secretary; and Robert F. Ken-nedy Jr., a controversial figure due to his stance on vaccines, as Public Health Secretary. These choices signal Trump’s intention to challenge conventional governance and implement transformative changes during his upcoming term.\n\nFormer serviceman Doug Collins, known for defending Donald Trump during his first impeach-ment trial, has been appointed as Secretary of Vet-erans Affairs, while North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, with extensive business and governance experience, has been named Secretary of the Inte-rior. John Ratcliffe will serve as CIA Director, and Kristi Noem has been chosen as Secretary of Home-land Security.\n\nAmong Trump’s appointments, the most inno-vative is the creation of a new federal agency, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This agency will be led by tech billionaire Elon Musk and former Republican rival Vivek Ramaswamy. DOGE’s mission is to streamline government by re-ducing excessive regulations, cutting wasteful spend-ing, and restructuring federal agencies. Announcing the initiative, Trump stated: “I am pleased to an-nounce that the great Elon Musk, working in con-junction with American patriot Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the Department of Government Efficiency (‘DOGE’). Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to disman-tle government bureaucracy, slash excessive regu-lations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies—essential to the ‘Save America’ movement. This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people!”\n\nThese reforms are expected to challenge Wash-ington’s entrenched systems, ushering in an era of efficiency and innovation that could influence global governance trends for years to come.\n\nInterestingly, Trump’s DOGE initiative draws parallels to Nigeria’s 2012 Oronsaye Report, which outlined measures to reduce governance costs by consolidating Ministries, Departments, and Agen-cies (MDAs). Despite its potential, the report has been largely ignored for over a decade, contribut-ing to Nigeria’s current debt crisis, which the Debt Management Office estimates currently N134.3 tril-lion. President Bola Tinubu’s recent reforms, such as removing fuel subsidies and devaluing the naira, align with Trump’s bold approach and could serve as inspiration for addressing Nigeria’s governance challenges.\n\nTrump is also targeting “wokeism,” a term that originally referred to awareness of social injustices but has evolved into a critique of perceived political overreach and divisiveness. Trump’s opposition to wokeism resonates with figures like Elon Musk, who joined his campaign partly due to personal experi-ences—Musk’s son underwent a gender transition, a decision Musk attributed to ideological influences he opposes. Musk reportedly contributed $118 million to support Trump’s campaign and challenge cultural trends they see as harmful.\n\nTrump’s return to the presidency in 2025 will make him only the second U.S. president, after Gro-ver Cleveland, to serve two non-consecutive terms. In his victory speech, Trump described this achieve-ment as the “greatest political movement of all time” and vowed to restore the country’s values, saying: “There’s never been anything like this in this coun-try, and maybe now it’s going to reach a new level of importance because we’re going to help our country heal. We have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly.”\n\nTrump’s reforms aim to reset America’s moral compass, reflecting the values of its founding fa-thers and challenging what he perceives as a decline in societal ethics. His focus on combating wokeism and restoring traditional principles underpins his broader vision to Make America Great Again (MAGA).\n\nWhile implementing these changes will be com-plex, Trump’s presidency could redefine governance and democracy for the modern era. Much like Ath-ens pioneered democracy in the 5th century BCE, Trump’s efforts may reshape democratic systems globally. His forthcoming term, marked by ambitious reforms, will likely serve as a critical test for the re-silience and adaptability of American democracy.\n\n• Magnus Onyibe, an entrepreneur, public policy analyst, author, democracy advocate, development strategist, alumnus of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Massachusetts, USA, and a former commissioner in the Delta State government, sent this piece from Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nTo continue with this conversation and more, please visit www.magnum.ng.","summary":"Similarly, heliocentrism, first proposed by Aristarchus of Samos (c. 310–230 BCE) and later revived by Copernicus (1473–1543 CE), met staunch opposition.

Marco Rubio for secretary of state, Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser, Chris Wright for secretary of energy, Brendan Carr for FCC chairman) to the more audacious and controversial (former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health and human services secretary). What they all have in common is that they represent a precise reaction to the excesses and evils of the Obama-Biden bureaucracy that has, for over a decade and half, plagued American politics.\n\nTake, as the most obvious example, Gaetz. Gaetz is charismatic and brilliant; he has been both aggressive and effective on the House Judiciary Committee. He is also, as has been widely reported, thoroughly disliked in the House of Representatives. He has been generally perceived as a destructive force, an egotist focused more on media coverage than on the functioning of the House; his defenestration of Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy was unpopular among his colleagues, with many believing that he pursued McCarthy vindictively based on his opposition to McCarthy’s House Ethics investigation against him.\n\nAnd that’s precisely why Trump is picking him.\n\nTo Donald Trump, the Department of Justice has been an instrument of vindictiveness from his first days in office. From insiders in the DOJ working with the FBI to gin up the Mueller investigation to the Merrick Garland DOJ targeting him repeatedly under legally shoddy auspices, the DOJ has consistently represented resistance to his presidency. And so Trump has picked precisely the type of person he believes will clean out the agency from top to bottom.\n\nOr take RFK Jr.\n\nRFK Jr. represents a slap in the face to the traditional health establishment. He has a long record of controversial statements on everything ranging from 5G to vaccination. But he is a reaction to the overweening arrogance of a conspiratorial elite who crammed down COVID-19 misinformation on an industrial scale, told Americans that boys could become girls, attempted to wield the reins of government against their medical opponents and even tried to mandate vaccination on 80 million Americans. RFK Jr. is the natural reaction to a health policy elite who have made themselves radioactive.\n\nTrump himself has always been a form of snapback against the overreach of what came before. Barack Obama tried to remake American politics in his image: high-handed, intersectional and replete with authoritarian overtones. Trump came along and ripped the idol off his pedestal. Joe Biden tried to transform American politics by radically reinterpreting the bargain between American citizens and their government. Trump is returning to reject that never-requested transformation.\n\nEvery political action has its equal and opposite reaction. No doubt the same will hold true in the future if Republicans overreach in their own way. But for the moment, it’s vital to recognize that the Trumpian backlash has been well-earned.","summary":"'RFK Jr. is the natural reaction to a health policy elite who have made themselves radioactive'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2024/11/newtons-third-law-of-politics-applied-to-trump/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rfk-jr-robert-f-kennedy-campaign.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:22:01","author":"Ben Shapiro","authors":["Ben Shapiro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.113},{"id":266131310,"title":"Linda McMahon confirms separation from former WWE CEO Vince McMahon while Trump’s nominee deals with sexual misconduct allegations.","text":"Linda and Vince McMahon have officially gone their separate ways, a report revealed Wednesday. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tapped his transition co-chair and World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) co-founder Linda McMahon as his Education Secretary Tuesday night. \n\nAnd not even 24 hours later, her relationship status was unveiled amid her 58-year marriage with embattled former WWE chairman Vince. \n\nLinda’s attorney Laura Brevetti confirmed that the Education Secretary nominee and Vince had separated in a report by the Washington Post. \n\nAfter meeting as teenagers, Linda dated Vince McMahon while the pair were in high school – as she attended Havelock High School in North Carolina while he attended Fishburne Military School in Virginia.\n\nIn 1966, at the age of just 17 after graduating high school, Linda would marry Vince McMahon who was himself only 21 years old at the time.\n\nThey have two children together – Shane, their first child, who was born in 1970, and Stephanie, who was born in 1976.\n\nHowever, Wednesday’s report marks the first time either Linda or Vince have publicly acknowledged their split. \n\nThe Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported in 2022 that Vince and Linda were separated but not divorced. At that time, neither McMahon commented on the report. \n\nBut when the couple split or whether they are officially divorced remains unclear. \n\nWhile Linda, the former CEO of WWE from 1980 through 2009, may have parted ways with her husband, she still finds herself embroiled in a lawsuit alongside Vince. \n\nA lawsuit was filed in Maryland in October against the McMahons, the WWE, and WWE parent company TKO, alleging negligence that allowed the group known as the ‘ring boys’ to be ‘exploited and sexually abused’ by a company employee. \n\nThe former WWE employee named as Melvin Phillips Jr. was the company’s’ ringside announcer and ring crew chief under McMahon’s leadership.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the McMahons were aware they were being sexually abused by other WWE employees and did not do enough to protect them.\n\nThe ‘ring boys’ lawsuit, which was branded ‘baseless’ by Brevetti, cites the decision to come forward now coincides with the information they have learned from Vince McMahon’s lawsuit from Janel Grant, who claims he sexually assaulted her when she worked for the company.\n\nVince is additionally accused of trafficking Grant to other men and sharing nude photographs of the plaintiff. Grant is seeking unspecified damages from Vince.\n\nMeanwhile, Vince faces another ongoing federal investigation by the Southern District of New York into allegations that he used his position at the helm of WWE to commit and conceal sexual abuse and trafficking, according to the Washington Post. \n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission filings by WWE’s parent company, TKO Group Holdings, allegedly show he agreed to pay $14.6 million in connection to ‘allegations of misconduct.’ The Wall Street Journal reported that the money was promised to women who accused him of sexual misconduct between 2006 and 2022.\n\nLinda is not directly implicated with the latter two cases. \n\nIn addition to Linda, other Trump’s nominees have been caught up in alleged sex scandals. \n\nMatt Gaetz, Trump’s pick for attorney general, has been accused of having sex with minors. Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nLinda McMahon became president of the organization in 1993 before being promoted to the role of CEO in 1997.\n\nOne of her major interests in WWF and WWE was product merchandising, which saw her negotiate many of the company’s business deals and create the company’s first line of action figures, Wrestling Superstars, in 1984. \n\nIt was a first in the wrestling industry and helped expand the company’s popularity with children. \n\nShe was also the primary negotiator for the World Wrestling Federation’s 2000 TV deal with Viacom. \n\nMcMahon stepped down from her position as the CEO of WWE in 2009 to try her hand at politics. \n\nThis saw her serve on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year, during which time she spoke of her desire to explore the education sector and become a teacher.","summary":"Linda and Vince McMahon have officially gone their separate ways, a report&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/linda-mcmahon-confirms-separation-from-former-wwe-ceo-vince-mcmahon-while-trumps-nominee-deals-with-sexual-misconduct-allegations/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Linda-McMahon-confirms-split-from-ex-WWE-chief-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:21:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.044},{"id":266131682,"title":"Publisher Jimmy Lai testifies he didn’t ask Pence, Pompeo to take action against city","text":"Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai denied in his landmark national security trial yesterday he had asked then U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take action against the city and China during the territory’s anti-government protests in 2019.\n\nLai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper, was arrested in 2020 in the crackdown that followed the protests. He is accused of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.\n\nHe testified about his meetings with former U.S. officials and gave details about his alleged political connections with people in the U.S., Britain and Taiwan, including former leader Tsai Ing-wen and Hong Kong’s last British governor, Chris Patten.\n\nThe media tycoon, who also describes himself as a businessman and social activist, said he never tried to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong or China through the people he met overseas or ask them to take action against them.\n\nLai’s case is widely seen as a measure of media freedom and judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.\n\nLai testified in English that he asked Pence to voice his support for Hong Kong during a 2019 visit to the U.S. But he said he did not ask the U.S. government to take any action, saying, “It’s beyond me.”\n\nDuring the same trip Lai also met with Pompeo and had a similar discussion about the situation in Hong Kong, he said.\n\nWhen Lai’s lawyer, Steven Kwan, asked him whether he had requested the U.S. to do something at that meeting, Lai said “not to do something but to say something. To voice out its support for Hong Kong.”\n\nAuthorities have used a national security law to prosecute many of Hong Kong’s leading activists, including Lai and 45 democracy advocates who were sentenced to four to 10 years in prison on Tuesday. Other pro-democracy figures were forced into self-exile or silenced. Dozens of civil society groups have disbanded under the threat of the law.\n\nBeijing and Hong Kong governments insist that the law restored stability to the city following the 2019 protests.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing “under the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.”\n\nThey pointed to Lai’s meetings with Pence, Pompeo and U.S. senators in July 2019 to discuss a now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the anti-government protests. They allege that Lai sought support from the U.S. in sanctioning mainland Chinese and Hong Kong leaders who cracked down on the movement.\n\nDozens of people stood in the rain to secure a seat in the courtroom, including former Apple Daily reader William Wong, who said he wanted to remind Lai that Hong Kongers have not forgotten him.\n\n“I haven’t seen him for a few months. I know he will testify himself, so I want to encourage him,” said Wong, 64.\n\nUpon entering the court, Lai waved and smiled at his family members, who sat next to the city’s Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen.\n\nDuring the hearing, Lai said that he had introduced former U.S. officials Paul Wolfowitz and Jack Keane to Tsai, whom he called a friend.\n\nLai said Tsai wanted to know more about the thinking of then President Donald Trump’s administration, and knew he was “supportive of Trump.” She thought he was familiar with the U.S. because of his links with U.S. think tanks. But he never communicated with Trump, he said.\n\nHe said he wanted to help Taiwan to know how to better deal with the U.S., because the island was the only democracy of Chinese people.\n\nBut Lai rejected the idea of Hong Kong independence, saying it was a “crazy” idea and he never allowed his staff or the newspaper to mention it.\n\nHe said he broke into the media world “to participate in delivering freedom.”\n\n“The more you know, the more you are free,” he said, adding that the core values of Apple Daily were the core values of the people of Hong Kong, including the rule of law, freedom and the pursuit of democracy\n\nIn May 2020, a month before the security law took effect, Lai took up the role of executive chairman of Next Digital, the parent company of Apple Daily.\n\nThe trial will continue today.\n\nThe U.S. and U.K. governments and independent U.N. human rights experts have called for Lai’s release.\n\nAsked before his reelection this month whether he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to seek Lai’s release, Trump said: “100%, I will get him out.”\n\nHong Kong leader John Lee said that mutual respect is important for the development of trade relations and there should be no interference in local affairs.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also raised concerns over Lai’s detention to Xi in a meeting during the Group of 20 summit in Brazil.\n\nHong Kong’s security minister Chris Tang maintained the prosecution was based on facts.\n\nLai’s son, Sebastien Lai, said on Friday that his father’s treatment in prison is “inhumane.” “My father is now 77 and has spent nearly four years in a maximum-security prison in solitary confinement,” he said in the statement released by Britain-based law firm Doughty Street Chambers.\n\nOn Sunday, the Hong Kong government condemned some members of the law firm for what it called spreading misinformation. It said the separation of Lai from other inmates “has been made at his own request” and was approved by prison authorities.

The women in the Trump family are undeniably attractive, regardless of their political views. Typically, they’re never seen without makeup, but Tiffany Trump, the second daughter of Donald and his ex-wife Marla Maples, previously surprised many by showing off her makeup-free face. Despite her usual love for cosmetics, Tiffany’s bold decision to go natural in the past has shocked everyone.\n\nAs reported by Glam, Tiffany is frequently spotted in her well-maintained social media posts, which feature her special make-up look of bold lashes, dramatic winged eyeliner, and smokey eyes. However, in 2014, while she was a college student, she deviated from her typical look and shared a natural, unedited photo. In the photo, she’s confidently hitting a punching bag in boxing gloves, decked out in workout gear, with a fresh, makeup-free face. The image exudes a vibrant, fearless energy that stands out from her usual make-up appearance. She continued to offer glimpses into her more natural, student life in April 2015.\n\nTiffany, the youngest of the Trump children, posted an enthralling image of herself on Instagram, laughing cheerfully and posing in a cobra yoga pose between bookshelves, with no makeup on her face. She looked effortlessly glowing despite the late hour and stark institutional lighting, demonstrating that her beauty wasn't artificial. Whether with makeup or without, Tiffany’s natural charm and unique allure shine brightly. Later on, in November 2015, she also participated in Confessional, a video series by photographer Scott Nathan. The series explored themes of authenticity and inner beauty, alongside other women who shared their personal stories.\n\nSimilarly, the same is true for Tiffany's mother, Maples, as reported by Glam. She a well-known actress and TV personality who regularly embraces her inherent beauty on social media, particularly when sharing images of herself in nature. According to her website, Maples is renowned for promoting holistic well-being, which includes mental, spiritual, and physical health. Even when she decides to add a little glamour to her looks, she keeps it subtle, using blush, mascara, bronzy eyeshadow, and tinted lips for a soft, radiant look.\n\nMeanwhile, Tiffany’s style has always had subtle nods to her mother, especially from the few public appearances they made together during Tiffany’s childhood. At the 2004 premiere of Little Black Book in New York City, the duo wore straight-leg jeans paired with strappy sandals. They again dressed similarly for a pre-Golden Globe style retreat in 2006, wearing matching jackets and pants. Later on, during another outing in New York, they wore twin T-shirts, jackets, bootcut jeans, boots, and scarves. As reported by The List, these incidents demonstrate not only a shared love for subtle and fashionable clothing but also Tiffany's grounded background and her close bond with Maples, who raised her as a single mother in California.","summary":"Donald Trump&#39;s daughter, Tiffany Trump, is usually seen in her signature make-up look in her social media posts.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/people-are-just-finding-out-how-different-tiffany-trump-looks-without-any-makeup","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/725112/uploads/962e7730-a665-11ef-9165-29e54cf8d6e4_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:15:00","author":"INQUISITR,Simran Kumari","authors":["INQUISITR","Simran Kumari"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.711},{"id":266131684,"title":"Milei pivots to pragmatism in first talks with Xi after shaking up the G20","text":"Last year, then-presidential candidate Javier Milei declared Argentina would not “make deals with communists” in China or Brazil in a bid to channel the populist energies of Donald Trump and other global far-right icons into a winning political message.\n\nBut yesterday [Macau time], President Milei found himself at the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro shaking hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping and vowing to boost trade with the Asian powerhouse, a day after his economy minister signed a preliminary agreement to export Argentine natural gas to Brazil.\n\nMilei even acquiesced to a joint declaration endorsed by world leaders late Monday despite his earlier attempts to play spoiler to the G20 host, Brazil’s left-wing president Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva who was once called by Milei a “corrupt communist.”\n\nThe final moments of the summit revealed Milei’s more pragmatic streak, coming as a surprise after the irascible president sought to undercut various international initiatives — withdrawing Argentine negotiators from the U.N. climate summit, casting the only “no” votes on two U.N. resolutions, one supporting Indigenous rights and another advocating for an end to violence against women, and roiling negotiations at the G20 summit.\n\nArgentina has also dramatically reshaped its foreign policy in line with its hard-right allies in Italy — with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni headed to Buenos Aires yesterday to spend more time with Milei — and in Israel.\n\nAt the same time, Andrea Tenenti, a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission operating along Lebanon’s southern border, told reporters in Geneva that Argentina had decided to withdraw its peacekeepers from the force, known as UNIFIL.\n\nHe did not say why, but Israel has repeatedly requested that peacekeepers leave the area since the military’s Oct. 1 invasion of southern Lebanon.\n\nIn the past few days, Argentine resistance to the joint G20 communiqué focused on clauses related to the taxation of the super-rich and regulation of online speech, diplomats said. Argentine delegates also sought to block language about gender equality and references to the U.N. 2030 agenda on sustainable development, which Milei has decried as socialist.\n\nCritics in Rio saw the Argentine president as a saboteur. Supporters back home cheered Milei as a leader of the “new world disorder.” Fresh off a trip to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida where he ranted against socialism and rubbed shoulders with the president-elect and tech billionaire Elon Musk, Milei initially seemed immune to such concerns in Rio.\n\nMilei’s office issued a harsh statement citing his objections to the G20 declaration. But the president ultimately signed onto it under enormous international pressure.\n\n“Argentina is not a great power and it is in a very difficult situation economically,” said Roberto Goulart Menezes, a professor of international relations at the University of Brasilia. That pressure, he added, was “enough for Argentina to finally reduce its opposition.”\n\nDuring Milei’s first-ever meeting with Xi on Tuesday, the leaders discussed their “current trade and financial ties” and “desire to continue exploring new opportunities to expand and improve,” the Argentine presidency said in a statement, along with a photo of the presidents sharing a warm handshake. It said the leaders had invited each other to visit.\n\nWith Argentina highly reliant on China as a market for its soybeans and other crops, the cordial tone made clear that the crisis-stricken South American nation has no desire for relations with its second-largest trading partner and crucial source of financing to further deteriorate.\n\nA statement from China’s foreign ministry said Xi expressed his appreciation for Milei’s “willingness to continue deepening bilateral cooperation.”\n\nChina has maintained strategic assets in Argentina, including stakes in lithium mines and a space station in Patagonia.\n\nEarlier this week, as negotiations over the G20 draft grew increasingly tense, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Brazilian Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira signed a memorandum of understanding that offered a new and important source of income to cash-strapped Argentina.\n\nThe agreement to work toward shipping 30 million cubic meters of natural gas to Brazil from Argentina’s Vaca Muerta, a vast shale oil and gas field in Patagonia, over the next five years, “might have helped” Milei sign the joint G20 statement, Silveira told reporters.\n\nBut it did nothing to dispel the chill between the leaders of South America’s largest economies, who have opposite views on climate change, social issues and the role of governments.\n\nA set of official photographs that splashed across the front pages of local newspapers Tuesday showed Lula and other government leaders clasping hands amicably in sharp contrast to the Brazilian leader’s photo-op with Milei — both men standing stiffly apart despite protocol demanding they shake hands, looking like they’d rather be anywhere else in the world.\n\nSome fear that Trump’s election has further emboldened Milei and other far-right political figures to abandon U.N. commitments and ambitious multilateral agreements on issues like climate change.\n\n“Milei has already taken a pro-Trump stance, thinking … that the G20 could be emptied by President Trump,” said Goulart Menezes, the international relations expert.\n\n“Argentina is putting itself in a position of international isolation,” he said.\n\nIndeed, at the traditional G20 family photo — taken for a second time yesterday because U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau failed to show up to the first — Milei was the only leader missing from the lineup.\n\nThere would be no third attempt.

At that time, neither McMahon commented on the report. \n\nBut when the couple split or whether they are officially divorced remains unclear. \n\nWhile Linda, the former CEO of WWE from 1980 through 2009, may have parted ways with her husband, she still finds herself embroiled in a lawsuit alongside Vince. \n\nA lawsuit was filed in Maryland in October against the McMahons, the WWE, and WWE parent company TKO, alleging negligence that allowed the group known as the 'ring boys' to be 'exploited and sexually abused' by a company employee. \n\nThe former WWE employee named as Melvin Phillips Jr. was the company's' ringside announcer and ring crew chief under McMahon's leadership.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the McMahons were aware they were being sexually abused by other WWE employees and did not do enough to protect them.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tapped Linda as his Education Secretary Tuesday night\n\nThe 'ring boys' lawsuit, which was branded 'baseless' by Brevetti, cites the decision to come forward now coincides with the information they have learned from Vince McMahon's lawsuit from Janel Grant, who claims he sexually assaulted her when she worked for the company.\n\nVince is additionally accused of trafficking Grant to other men and sharing nude photographs of the plaintiff. Grant is seeking unspecified damages from Vince.\n\nMeanwhile, Vince faces another ongoing federal investigation by the Southern District of New York into allegations that he used his position at the helm of WWE to commit and conceal sexual abuse and trafficking, according to the Washington Post. \n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission filings by WWE's parent company, TKO Group Holdings, allegedly show he agreed to pay $14.6 million in connection to 'allegations of misconduct.'

A small comune on the island of Sardinia in Italy is listening.Ollolai, a town of 1,154 people, according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics, created a website geared toward helping Americans find homes in its town for just 1 euro (or about $1.05), taking advantage of the latest election cycle.\"Are you worned out by global politics,\" the new website reads. \"Looking to embrace a more balanced lifestyle while securing new opportunities? It's time to start building your European escape in the stunning paradise of Sardinia.\"Roughly one dollar for a home in a picturesque town in the middle of an Italian island — about 50 miles from the beach — might sound too good to be true. The homes offered aren't in the best condition and would require about $25,000 in renovations which must be completed within three years, according to previous reporting from Business Insider.But if you're willing to put some effort into your home, Ollolai will welcome you.\"We just really want, and will focus on, Americans above all,\" Mayor Francesco Columbu told CNN. \"We can't of course ban people from other countries to apply, but Americans will have a fast-track procedure. We are betting on them to help us revive the village, they are our winning card.\"\"Of course, we can't specifically mention the name of one US president who just got elected, but we all know that he's the one from whom many Americans want to get away from now and leave the country,\" Columbo told CNN.The transition team for President elect-Donald Trump did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.This isn't a new program — and Ollolai isn't even the first town to try the approach.\"Case a 1 euro,\" which means \"houses at 1 euro,\" is a program across Italy that launched in the 2010s to revitalize the dwindling populations in more rural towns. Ollolai started offering 1-euro homes in 2018, but other towns, like Sicilian commune Gangi, started giving away vacant houses in 2015.Americans moving to Europe, and Italy specifically, has been a somewhat common trend. But if you don't want to commit fully to moving across the ocean, a redirect from the Ollolai website luring potential buyers offers an option for digital nomads.\"Work from Ollolai\" is a program that lets \"successful professionals\" live in the municipality for just 1 euro as long as they \"promote an exchange of information\" to rural communities through presentations, classes, or projects.That covers rent and, according to the website, guests can stay for a maximum of one month.","summary":"A small Italian town on the island of Sardinia is targeting Americans for its plan to sell vacant homes for cheap.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/italian-town-offers-euro-homes-us-election-2024-11","image":"https://i.insider.com/673e6acafa0140cdd5649969?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:06:32","author":"Jordan Pandy","authors":["Jordan Pandy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.175},{"id":266129282,"title":"What to Expect From DOGE","text":"President-elect Donald Trump is set to launch the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which he introduced during a pre-election interview on billionaire Elon Musk’s social media platform, X.\n\nMusk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will co-chair the effort, which aims to slash $2 trillion from the roughly $6.75 trillion federal budget, hack through a labyrinth of executive branch regulations, and reform or remove entire federal agencies.\n\n“It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.”\n\nHow they might accomplish that effort, however, is unclear, experts told The Epoch Times. Especially because the department—which Trump said will serve in an advisory capacity to the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)—may encounter roadblocks in its mandate to “drive large-scale structural reform.”\n\nAlthough it has the word “department” in its name, DOGE is not a federal agency like the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which audits the federal government for Congress.\n\n“Trump has made clear that DOGE is an advisory board operating outside the federal government,” Jordan Haring, the director of fiscal policy at the American Action Forum, told The Epoch Times. “Thus, unlike federal agencies, it does not need to be formally enacted through an act of Congress.”\n\nThe department, Haring said, would work to “identify inefficiencies and waste within the federal government” like the GAO, but the latter works at the request of congressional committees and is mandated by public laws and committee reports.\n\nBecause of its goal of providing congressional oversight, the GAO is more of an extension of the legislative branch, while DOGE will largely advise the executive.\n\nExactly what DOGE will be doing in its day-to-day operations is still unclear, Haring said, although Trump has suggested it will operate outside the federal government while remaining under his authority.\n\n“DOGE could end up being nothing more than a glorified advisory board or an outside entity with significant influence,” Haring added.\n\nSusan Dudley, senior scholar and founder of the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center, told The Epoch Times that there could be a direct collaboration between DOGE and the OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews and oversees executive branch regulations.\n\n“[DOGE] couldn’t eliminate rules or create procedural changes itself, but could make recommendations that the president could direct agencies to pursue. I think the remit should include recommendations to Congress,” Dudley said.\n\nTo slash spending, Musk plans to use artificial intelligence and crowd-sourcing to find waste, abuse, and fraud in the federal government’s expenditures. That could include outright eliminating certain federal agencies, Ramaswamy said in a recent interview with Fox News.\n\n“We expect mass reductions in force in areas of the federal government that are bloated,” he added.\n\nTrump promised this year that he would protect Social Security and Medicare, and he even suggested that there be no more taxes on benefits, which could cost the government even more.\n\nThe federal government spent another $1.6 trillion on health insurance programs in 2023, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and Affordable Care Act subsidies. This was 24 percent of the federal budget that year.\n\nAnother8 percent ($545 billion) of the 2023 federal budget was used for economic security programs, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, Supplemental Security Income for low-income Americans who are disabled or older than 65, and food stamps—all programs that could be last in line for Trump-approved spending cuts, based on his campaign promises this year.\n\nLastly, defense spending, which was 13 percent of the 2023 budget ($820 billion), is also unlikely to be cut, as Republicans historically favor increases to the military budget. Musk and Ramaswamy, however, wrote in their co-authored op-ed that they may target the Pentagon’s budget after it failed its seventh straight audit.\n\nThose effects could vary widely depending on exactly what Trump prioritizes in his economic agenda throughout the next four years, but any increases to the debt could potentially stymie some of DOGE’s accomplishments.\n\nDOGE also has to contend with Congress, which the Constitution grants the power of the nation’s purse. Congress would likely need to approve any changes to federal spending or the dissolution of certain agencies.\n\nWhile Musk had highlighted the sprawling array of government regulations when first formulating DOGE with Trump, Dudley said that efforts to pull back or repeal some of those rules will likely meet with resistance from the agencies themselves and their employees, “who naturally believe that their activities—whether requiring companies’ financial statements to report climate risk, constraining private contractual agreements, or eliminating gas stoves—are essential.”\n\nShe recommends the formation of a bipartisan commission including key senators and representatives who have championed regulatory reform to “achieve lasting results.” That commission could make recommendations to Congress for legislative changes while targeting specific regulations and programs that need reforms.\n\nDOGE could also solicit public comments from “those with real experience on what works and what doesn’t,” but resistance to change will remain among those in the programs and agencies that institute the targeted rules and regulations.\n\nThat would involve relying on “cognizant agencies to develop a new rulemaking and support it with a record that can stand up in court,” Dudley told The Epoch Times.\n\n“This takes a year or more even if agencies are enthusiastic, which they are unlikely to be,“ she said. ”Even if a new rulemaking makes its way through the process ... it will be subject to litigation by parties that preferred the prior interpretation.”\n\nOthers are concerned about granting Musk and Ramaswamy so much authority over rolling back government regulations.\n\nVikramaditya Khanna, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said Musk leading DOGE may not necessarily present a conflict of interest if he acts as an adviser rather than a government employee, and a president can potentially waive conflict of interest rules. Khanna specializes in corporate law and government contracts.\n\nRegardless, Moller said he fears that DOGE will lead to “more waste ... and rampant abuse of political power.”\n\nHe added that although Musk is a “brilliant entrepreneur and a tech visionary,” the CEO and billionaire could “use his newfound government powers to throw a lifeline to his teetering companies.”\n\nMoller said fraud in federal spending is an important issue, and much can be accomplished by going after those who bilk federal agencies.\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted DOGE via X and Tesla’s press office for comment from Musk.","summary":"The project plans to cut roughly $2 trillion from the federal budget, or 30 percent of annual government spending.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/what-to-expect-from-doge-5762369","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/20/id5763358-14_2-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:02:10","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":266128888,"title":"Kellyanne Conway eviscerates liberal graduate student who tried to outsmart her at Harvard Q&A","text":"Kellyanne Conway hit out at a liberal graduate student who questioned her record during President-Elect Donald Trump's first term at a Harvard University discussion.\n\nThe former advisor to the president appeared at the Ivy League institution on Tuesday to discuss the 2024 presidential election and what challenges Trump may face in his second term.\n\nBut when audience members got a chance to ask Conway some questions, second-year Master of Public Policy student Jane Petersen took the opportunity to try to slam her for once claiming there were 'alternative facts' about the size of the crowd at Trump's inauguration. \n\n'I wanted to ask you a question about your job as White House spokesperson,' Petersen began. 'In that role, you said things that were pretty audacious [and] caused people to question things that they have seen with their own eyes.\n\n'I was always wondering whether it was a survival response in what seemed like what was a very chaotic White House, or was it a strategy? So was it strategy or was it survival? You know, all the bantering with journalists the alternative facts. Was it strategy or was it survival?'\n\nAt first, Conway simply asked if Petersen knew what the term 'alternative facts' meant, to which she said, 'I'm aware.'\n\n'Can you please explain it for us?' Conway then challenged the girl. 'Tell the person who uttered it on her third Sunday show of the day, looking into a blank camera, and then immediately said what I meant.'\n\nThe girl then seemed to backtrack, saying: 'Well we could also do other examples.'\n\nBut Conway cut her off, urging Petersen to answer the question 'to be fair.'\n\n'You're not going to go back eight years and do that,' Conway said.\n\nAt that point, the master's student tried to rephrase her question, saying she was asking Conway about her experience in the White House.\n\nBut still, Conway doubled down.\n\n'No,' she said. 'You gave me two choices and they're inaccurate.'\n\nPetersen then attempted to explain Conway's use of the term 'alternative facts,' but when she mentioned she was 'assuming,' Conway once again hit out at her for that.\n\nBy then, the student said she thought it was 'interesting that you decided to come here and know that you're going to be accepting questions from students and yet -' prompting Kellyanne to respond.\n\n'OK so then I'll answer it, thank you for your question,' she said. \n\n'You gave me choices, and they're both inaccurate,' Conway replied, noting that it was 'rich' for Petersen to suggest her actions in the White House were a 'survivor's response... since you know nothing about me.'\n\n'So alternative facts, I gave you a good chance there, and it's a great chance for you because I don't need any more air time, I get plenty of it,' she continued.\n\n'First of all, my job was counselor to the president. I said \"no\" to press secretary. Forty-two minutes after President Trump was elected, he offered me that job. He said \"You'd be great at that job,\" I said \"I would be terrible at that, I'm not even sure what they do.\"\n\n'Some days I'm still not sure, and clearly I'm not sure after these four years,' Conway said, taking aim at the Biden administration's claims that the border is secure despite migrants flooding into the country.\n\n'President Biden is behind the scenes, he's a trapeze artist and a triathlete. You just can't see it,' she insisted.\n\n'So I hope you take these same concerns to the people who've lied to your face for four years in this administration, all the way to this crushing defeat of a sitting vice president who should have been, who could have been the first female president of color in our nation's history, but instead had to eat and own all the lies that had been told by this administration.'\n\nShe then went on to note that there's an entire chapter of her book, Here's The Deal, in which she explains her use of the phrase 'alternative facts.'\n\n'Alternative facts was very simple,' Conway said. 'It was, I meant to say \"alternative information, additional facts.\" It wasn't George Orwell. It wasn't a new set of facts.'\n\n'If you want to be judged by two words in your life, it will take me - it wouldn't take me much time to find those two words,' Conway insisted to Petersen.\n\n'But I don't do that. I don't look at people that way,' she said. 'I don't look at people that way.'\n\nShe then said she was 'really proud that I was able to tell people what was going on in the White House... I'm very happy to have told the country that I work for the president,' going on to list some of Trump's policies like tax cuts, trade deals and moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \n\n'So here's what I do, I look at the full measure of people, and if the idea is to try to cut them down from one bad thing they said or one bad day they had or one article they wrote, then I wish you a much happier life than all that.\n\n 'So I don't have an answer to a question that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, except to say that you can read my book about alternative facts, you can listen to the many interviews I gave about it.\n\n'It was never actually a different set of facts, and that's pretty obvious,' she said.\n\n'And I will say this, you go back to 2016, the media, who I guess just [makes] a whole living on getting the elections wrong - on that they're consistent - they couldn't get enough of Donald Trump and Kellyanne Conway during the election, every show, every minute.\n\n'So I'm well on the record saying which states he was going to win, how he was going to win in 2016, where he was going to win. And then, he won and people changed. They turned just like that when we needed the media's help to tell the country what's going on, to co-parent the White House in the mainstream media, to responsibly co-parent the country for four to eight years' Conway claimed, snapping her fingers.\n\n'Instead, they turn out to be a lot of deadbeat dads interested in not getting the story, but getting the president and tearing us down,' she claimed.","summary":"Kellyanne Conway hit out liberal graduate student Jane Petersen when she tried to question her record during President-Elect Donald Trump's first term at a Harvard University discussion.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14107555/Kellyanne-Conway-Harvard-student-Jane-Petersen.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/20/23/92306469-0-image-a-18_1732147156657.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2022/09/15/2414767924302166532/1024x576_MP4_2414767924302166532.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:01:45","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":266136130,"title":"Migrants Depart From Mexico Hoping To Reach US Before Trump Takes Office","text":"Hundreds of migrants left the Mexican city of Tapachula on foot Wednesday, aiming to arrive at the US border before President-elect Donald Trump -- who has vowed massive deportations -- takes office in January.The group of about 1,500 people set out from Tapachula in southern Mexico in the early morning hours for a walk of some 2,600 kilometers (over 1,600 miles).\"My mentality is to get there, I want my (asylum) appointment before he (Trump) takes power,\" Colombian Yamel Enriquez told AFP.\"If I don't get the appointment before, I will give myself over to whatever God wants.\"Venezuelan Zuleika Carreno joined the exodus with the same single-minded purpose.She said she decided not to postpone her departure \"for fear of getting stuck on this side\" of the border, which would mean her laborious travels so far would have been \"in vain.\"Trump, who won an election in which illegal migration was a top issue, has vowed to declare a national emergency on border security and use the US military to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented migrants.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Authorities estimate that some 11 million people are living in the United States illegally, and Trump has stoked concerns by claiming an \"invasion\" is underway by migrants he says will rape and murder Americans.On Wednesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government was preparing a document highlighting the contribution of workers from her country to the US economy.Migrants who amass in Mexico from a variety of troubled countries with a view to a better life in the United States frequently organize group movements known as \"caravans\" in a bid to pressure authorities into giving them temporary Mexican visas.Sticking together also reduces the risk of criminal attacks, but the migrants groups usually disperse along the way.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Hundreds of migrants left the Mexican city of Tapachula on foot Wednesday, aiming to arrive at the US border before President-elect Donald Trump -- who has vowed massive deportations -- takes office...","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/migrants-depart-from-mexico-hoping-to-reach-us-before-trump-takes-office-7067953","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2018-09/n2rnmlf8_us-immigration-generic_625x300_22_September_18.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-21 00:01:43","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":266129094,"title":"Donald Trump: Economic and Policy Expectations","text":"TCF vendors\n\nExponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: IP addresses, Device identifiers, Probabilistic identifiers, Browsing and interaction data, Non-precise location data, Users’ profiles, Privacy choicesmoreCookie duration resets each session.
