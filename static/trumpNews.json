After making its world premiere this fall at New York’s SoHo Playhouse, tickets are available online for the Off-Broadway musical satire’s final show on Sunday, Oct. 13, concluding its run ahead of the 2024 presidential election. “We are so grateful for the dozens of running mates, our remarkable cast and creative team, and everyone who put their heart and soul into creating this production which has provided a unique and theatrical window into a presidential year like no other,” said producers Jason Rose, Lynn Londen and Max Fose in a statement. “We are proud to have played our unconventional part in the political conversation. Thank you, and God bless Off-Broadway.” Ghost of John McCain finds the late senator in the afterlife, which turns out to be inside Donald Trump’s brain. Accompanied by a “Greek Chorus” of iconic figures, including former Secretary Hillary Clinton, Roy Cohn, Eva Perón, Teddy Roosevelt, Lindsey Graham, Tiffany Trump, Grizabella from CATS, Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Joe Biden, Sarah Palin, Eric Trump and Kamala Harris, they rebel against the former president’s relentless demands for affirmation. The musical stars Jason Tam as McCain, along with an ensemble that includes Lindsay Nicole Chambers, Ben Fankhauser, Zonya Love, Luke Kolbe Mannikus, Aaron Michael Ray and understudies Gisela Adisa, Joshua David Robinson and Anthony Zambito. Co-conceived by McCain’s first chief of staff, late Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods — who was a eulogist at McCain’s funeral in 2018 — Ghost of John McCain features a book by Scott Elmegreen and a score by Drew Fornarola, directed by Catie Davis with choreography by Sunny Min-Sook Hitt. The producers extended an invitation to the late senator’s daughter Meghan McCain, who previously called the project “trash” when it was announced, and “nothing more than a gross cash grab by mediocre desperate people… I hope it bombs.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Ghost of John McCain is ready to cross over.

Trump’s team cited a June ruling from the Supreme Court in Fischer v. United States that curtailed the scope of the obstruction of an official proceeding charge used in the indictment against him. “The Superseding Indictment stretches generally applicable statutes beyond their breaking point based on false claims that President Trump is somehow responsible for events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,” his team wrote in a motion to dismiss based on statutory grounds. “The Special Counsel’s Office seeks to assign blame for events President Trump did not control and took action to protect against.” The Supreme Court ruled in the Fischer v. United States case that prosecutors need to prove individuals attempted to tamper with or destroy documents if they use the obstructing an official proceeding charge. Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson had joined her conservative peers in that opinion. Its decision has threatened to upend scores of the Justice Department’s prosecutions in Capitol riot cases. “The Special Counsel’s Office cannot establish the required nexus between alleged obstruction and any ‘evidence’ used in the certification proceeding, or that anyone acted with corrupt intent,” Trump’s lawyers argued in their 14-page filing. Two of the four charges Trump is facing from Smith pertain to that — one count of obstructing an official proceeding and another count for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding. Immunity battle In tandem with its effort to nix the election subversion indictment based on the Fischer v. United States case, Trump’s team is also looking to undercut it based on the Supreme Court’s separate July decision on presidential immunity. The Supreme Court held that presidents enjoy “absolute” immunity when it comes to official conduct but remanded the question of whether that applies to the election subversion case back to the lower courts. Smith’s team had lodged a comprehensive 165-page motion last week arguing that the high court’s decision on immunity does not apply its indictment against Trump. Presiding US District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Thursday gave Trump’s lawyers until Nov. 7 — two days after the election — to file their response to that blistering motion from Smith’s team that had elicited the 45th president’s fury. That immunity motion from Smith unfurled mounts of evidence the government compiled against Trump, largely rehashing details that were previously known about his efforts to thwart the 2020 election. “Democrats are Weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they know I am WINNING,” Trump raged on Truth Social. “The DOJ has become nothing more than an extension of Joe’s, and now Kamala’s, Campaign. This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election. The Democrat Party is turning America into a Third World Country.” Trump’s team had fought hard in court to delay the public release of that court filing until after the election, but Chutkan ultimately green-lighted the disclosure of a redacted version of it Wednesday, prompting Trump’s fury. “This was a weaponization of the government … and released 30 days before the election,” Trump told Ali Bradley of NewsNation on Wednesday. “My poll numbers have gone up instead of down. It is pure election interference.” Trump’s indictment in the matter had first been unsealed back in August of last year, but his lawyers managed to delay proceedings via the immunity challenge. Smith rolled out an overhauled indictment back in August of this year to adjust for the Supreme Court’s ruling. If Trump manages to win the Nov. 5 election, he will have tools at his disposal to potentially quash the case, including by possibly ordering the Justice Department to nix it. Trump is also facing a 10-count Georgia election tampering indictment that is effectively on pause due to a challenge against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. A 40-count indictment over allegations that Trump illegally hoarded classified documents was thrown out over the summer, but Smith has been fighting to revive it. The 45th president has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to all charges pending against him.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump's legal team pushed to toss out the four-count 2020 election subversion indictment against him, just one day after prosecutors' scathing evidence dump against him was unsealed.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/03/us-news/trumps-team-pushes-to-scrap-his-jan-6-indictment-one-day-after-jack-smiths-evidence-dump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/90965262.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bOVmfUNw-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:43:54","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.379},{"id":258400436,"title":"Donald Trump boasts about 'massive' rally crowd but images show half-empty venue in humiliation","text":"Donald Trump has been boasting about the size of his rally crowd in Michigan, despite video evidence showing a partially empty venue. The ex-president was rallying his base in Saginaw on Thursday, as he fights for wins in key \"blue wall\" battleground states. Trump praised his supporters for turning up in numbers, asking them: \"Only MAGA. Who else can fill up big places like this at three o'clock in the afternoon? \". Yet, videos shared by attendees tell a different story, revealing a sparsely filled venue. \"For a campaign that often points out when opponents' venues don't look full, this visual is striking,\" noted Spectrum News reporter Taylor Popielarz, as he posted a video showcasing the actual crowd size. In last month's presidential debate, Vice President and election rival Kamala Harris seemed to get under Trump's skin when she hinted that people were ditching his rallies early because of his lengthy speeches. Just last week, Harris threw another dig at Trump during a Los Angeles fundraiser, quipping to donors that her \"crowds are pretty big\" while she's on the campaign trail. Trump, nonetheless, keeps bragging about his rally turnouts, insisting he pulls the biggest crowds. \"I've spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me,\" Trump claimed in August, according to the Express US. In August, the Republican presidential nominee wrongly alleged that a photograph depicting thousands of supporters awaiting Harris' campaign rally at Detroit's airport was artificially tampered with. Harris' campaign team vehemently denied these claims, asserting that the photo was not manipulated. The rally at Detroit airport saw an impressive turnout of 15,000 people.","summary":"Donald Trump has bragged about the size of his rally crowd in Saginaw, Michigan - but video evidence shows a partially empty venue as the ex-President faces another humiliation","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-boasts-massive-rally-33817842","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article33817841.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_republican-candidate-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:31:31","author":"Housnia Shams,Joseph Wilkes","authors":["Housnia Shams","Joseph Wilkes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.097},{"id":258400420,"title":"U.S. dockworkers to head back to work after tentative deal","text":"US dockworkers will return to work after a three-day strike at East and Gulf Coast ports after the union and port operators reached a tentative deal on pay and extended the current contract to January 15, both sides said Thursday. The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) had launched a work stoppage early Tuesday after negotiations with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents shipping companies and terminal operators, came to an impasse. The strike -- which involved 45,000 workers, according to the ILA -- paralyzed 36 ports from Maine to Texas, which handle an array of goods from food to electronics. But Thursday evening, the two sides announced in a joint statement that they had \"reached a tentative agreement on wages and have agreed to extend the Master Contract until January 15, 2025 to return to the bargaining table to negotiate all other outstanding issues. \"Effective immediately, all current job actions will cease and all work covered by the Master Contract will resume.\" The statement did not offer terms of the deal, but The Wall Street Journal, citing sources close to the matter, said USMX had proposed a 62 percent salary increase over six years, which allowed the deal to be reached. The strike was the first walkout by the union since 1977 after negotiations stalled over union demands for significant wage increases and protection against automation-related job loss. U.S. President Joe Biden -- who had been under pressure to intervene in negotiations to keep ports open, but had demurred citing respect for collective bargaining rights -- celebrated the suspension of the strike late Thursday. \"I want to thank the union workers, the carriers, and the port operators for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Collective bargaining works, and it is critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.\" Outside the White House, Biden added: \"They've got the next 90 days, they are going to settle everything.\" Republican former president Donald Trump, who is seeking to take back the Oval Office, had blamed Biden for the crisis, saying Tuesday in Milwaukee: \"He should have worked out a deal.\" Analysts had cautioned that a lengthy strike could pose a major headwind to the U.S. economy, leading to shortages of some items and lifting costs at a time when inflation has been moderating. Oxford Economics had estimated that the strike would dent U.S. gross domestic product by $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion per week, with the overall impact depending on how long the strike lasts. But Capital Economics said fears about the economic impact of the strike were \"overdone,\" in part because recent shocks to the supply chain have made businesses more aware of the need to bake in precautionary measures. The strike arrived at a politically precarious time, just one month before the U.S. presidential election on November 5, but the tentative agreement relieves the political pressure. © 2024 AFP","summary":"US dockworkers will return to work after a three-day strike at East and Gulf Coast ports after the union and port operators reached a tentative deal on pay…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/business/us-dockworkers-to-head-back-to-work-after-tentative-deal","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/2d/29/e3107bd996d7e23e655622cf09e8960f387c/2d29e3107bd996d7e23e655622cf09e8960f387c/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:29:12","author":"Japan Today Editor,Julie Chabanas","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Julie Chabanas"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":258399462,"title":"Kamala Harris joins Liz Cheney at birthplace of GOP — says 2024 election is also about Ukraine","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the birthplace of the Republican Party Thursday to say that the 2024 election is not only about the US — but also about the war in Ukraine — as she hyped a double endorsement from the Cheney family. “Democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home. They are also at stake around the world,” Harris, 59, said in Ripon, Wis., after an introduction from Cheney, the fiery anti-Donald Trump former congresswoman from Wyoming. Harris told the crowd of her meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, in which she said she told him, “I stand with Ukraine and I always will.” “I want to Ukraine to prevail,” the vice president went on, noting that Trump, 78, did not say he wanted Ukraine to “win” in their presidential debate last month and suggesting he’d hand a strategic victory to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Harris said that Trump wants Ukraine to give up sovereign territory, which she said is a “bedrock principle upon which we stand and fight for.” The campaign stop in Ripon with the younger Cheney, 58 — whose father Dick Cheney served as vice president to George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009 — focused on Trump’s place in the Republican Party. Both Cheneys have come out in support of Harris. The former congresswoman took several digs at Trump, saying, “I was a Republican before Donald Trump began spray-tanning” — as she recited her well-worn denunciation of the former president’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when he urged a mob to march on the Capitol to challenge his loss in the Electoral College. “He summoned a mob to Washington, DC, with his lies, and he sent the armed mob the United States Capitol in an effort to stop the counting of electoral votes as the violent mob attacked our Capitol,” said Cheney, who served as vice chair of the House investigation into the riot. Cheney, who was born in the swing state, spoke at length about being a Ronald Reagan-style Republican and cited passages from the newly unsealed court filing from Wednesday in which special counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting Trump for his actions challenging his loss, alleged that Trump said “so what” in reaction to then-Vice President Mike Pence being evacuated during the riot. Harris gave Cheney, with whom Trump frequently clashed on foreign policy, a glowing review, saying they are aligned for their love of country, despite being from different parties. “We may not see eye to eye on every issue,” she said, “and we’re going to get back to a healthy two-party system … but we both love our country and democratic ideals.” Retiring President Biden also heaped praise on Cheney, who has been coy about her own presidential ambitions within a post-Trump Republican Party. “She made one of the most consequential speeches I’ve ever heard,” Biden raved to reporters. “She has character. I know her dad,” he added. “We argue like hell, but I always admired his courage and honesty. What she did not took only political courage, but physical courage… I was really incredibly proud of her.” Biden added, “She and her father have character, character, dammit.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the birthplace of the Republican Party Thursday to say that the 2024 election is not only about the US — but also about the war in Ukraine — as she hyped a double endorsement from the Cheney family. &#8220;Democracy and freedom are not only at stake here at home....","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/03/us-news/kamala-harris-goes-to-the-birthplace-of-the-gop-to-say-2024-election-is-also-about-ukraine/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/democratic-presidential-nominee-vice-president-90971212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KoIHffAa-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:25:36","author":"Diana Glebova,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Glebova","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.186},{"id":258399460,"title":"Kamala Harris, Donald Trump tied in North Carolina — but voters believe he’s the stronger leader","text":"With two weeks before early voting begins in North Carolina, the presidential race is too close to call. That’s according to a new High Point University survey, which finds Donald Trump and Kamala Harris knotted at 48% a piece among 589 likely voters. This is just the latest poll of the southern swing state to suggest a close race. The RealClearPolitics polling average shows just a 0.6 point Trump lead, factoring in a batch of tied polls and not including a single survey with either candidate leading by more than 3 points. The dead heat is remarkable in a sense given that 67% of likely voters think the country is on the wrong track under the Joe Biden administration, with 55% disapproving of the president’s leadership, along with 50% who aren’t happy with Harris’ performance in her current post (against 45% approval). But despite the Democratic nominee being underwater as vice president, survey participants are marginally more favorable to her as a candidate for the top job, with 50% approving of the campaign version of Harris against 47% disapproval. Conversely, Trump is seen unfavorably as a candidate by 52% of respondents; 47% regard him favorably. So why the tie? Despite the gap in personal approval ratings between Trump and Harris, the issues that matter most to Tar Heels play to the former president’s strengths. Thirty-one percent see improving economic conditions as the most important consideration when they vote, while 16% identify illegal immigration as their primary preoccupation. Those are the only two concerns more than 10% of respondents say matter most. On both issues, Trump is the favored option over Biden’s understudy. By a margin of 50% to 45%, the ex-prez is seen as the champion of economic growth in this election. And when it comes to managing immigration, 55% of North Carolina voters say Trump is better suited for the job than “Border Czar” Harris, whose administration has presided over prolonged failures in border security. Only 37% of respondents believe Harris can do as president what she failed to do as veep. Voters also think Trump is a stronger leader than Harris, by a 47% to 40% spread. They’re also more convinced Trump will do what’s right rather than popular, 46% to 42%. And they believe, by a 50% to 39% margin, he’s better at taking action rather than just talking. The poll was in the field between Sept. 20 and 29, as Hurricane Helene and a front that preceded it ravaged the state but before people in the western part of the state were compelled to reckon with a glacial response to the unprecedented disaster.","summary":"With two weeks before early voting begins in North Carolina, the presidential race is too close to call.

Theo The Guardian, hồ sơ dài 165 trang do đội ngũ của công tố viên đặc biệt Jack Smith đệ trình và được công bố vào ngày 2.10. Đây có thể là nỗ lực cuối cùng của công tố viên nhằm trình bày chi tiết vụ án chống lại ông Trump trước thềm bầu cử ngày 5.11, do cựu tổng thống Mỹ sẽ không dự phiên tòa nào trước ngày bỏ phiếu. Các công tố viên đã đưa ra các chi tiết bao gồm cáo buộc rằng một nhân viên Nhà Trắng đã nghe ông Donald Trump nói với các thành viên gia đình rằng việc ông thắng hay thua cuộc bầu cử không quan trọng mà “vẫn phải chiến đấu hết mình”. Cựu Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump vận động tại thành phố Milwaukee, bang Wisconsin ngày 1.10. ẢNH: REUTERS Hồ sơ mới trích dẫn các phát ngôn chưa được biết đến trước đây, được các cố vấn thân cận của ông Trump cung cấp, cáo buộc ông “đã sử dụng sự gian dối để nhắm vào mọi giai đoạn của quá trình bầu cử”. Trong hồ sơ, có đề cập chi tiết khi cấp dưới của ông Trump, cựu Phó tổng thống Mike Pence, có thể nguy hiểm sau khi đám đông tràn vào Đồi Capitol ngày 6.1.2021, ông Trump đã nói với trợ lý rằng: “Thì sao?”. Ngoài ra, trong một bữa trưa riêng giữa ông Pence và ông Trump, cấp dưới đã thúc giục ông Trump chấp nhận kết quả bầu cử năm 2020 và chờ tái tranh cử năm 2024. “Tôi không biết, năm 2024 còn rất xa”, hồ sơ trích lời ông Trump. Ông Trump: Các đối thủ không còn tôn trọng Mỹ Cựu tổng thống Mỹ bị cho là đã phớt lờ ông Pence cùng những quan chức tiểu bang, bao gồm những người trong chính đảng Cộng hòa đã công khai nói ông Trump thua cuộc và các cáo buộc gian lận bầu cử là sai sự thật. “Khi bị cáo (Trump) thua cuộc bầu cử tổng thống năm 2020, ông ta đã dùng hành vi trái pháp luật để cố gắng giữ chức vụ”, nhóm của công tố viên Jack Smith nói. Nhóm đệ trình hồ sơ lập luận với các cáo buộc này, ông Trump không nên được hưởng quyền miễn trừ truy tố – điều đã được Tòa án tối cao Mỹ phê duyệt, trao quyền miễn trừ rộng rãi cho các cựu tổng thống. Ông Steven Cheung, người phát ngôn chiến dịch tranh cử của ông Trump, gọi hồ sơ từ phía công tố viên “đầy rẫy sự dối trá” và “vi hiến”. Ông cáo buộc công tố viên Jack Smith và đảng Dân chủ “vũ khí hóa hệ thống tư pháp”.

Although more known for her illustrious racing career, Patrick is now becoming increasingly known for her support of Donald Trump.Recently, Patrick took to Instagram to claim that Trump, at 78, has shown more effective leadership during the recent Hurricane Helene crises than current President Joe Biden.Her comments followed the devastation of Hurricane Helene, which wreaked havoc on the eastern United States, causing over 100 fatalities. Responding to Trump's reaction to the natural disaster, the former NASCAR driver posted to her Instagram Story, as reported by First Sportz:\"Acting more like the president than the president.\"Patrick's involvement in political discourse is not limited to social media. She has been a vocal participant in the Reclaim America Tour, a campaign initiative throwing support behind Trump. Speaking at one of the events in Las Vegas, Patrick explained, as Newsweek Sports previously reported:\"People didn't like that. People looked at me like I was some radical right-wing MAGA. MAGA has got this awful connotation to so many people and you know what? All it did was light a fire.\"I will not be judged to live in America, be a proud American, say 'I love America', and want to make America great again. I won't be judged for it. Instead of quieting down, I am gonna get louder!\"I was raised in a middle-class family. My parents love their garden; they still do. But my parents instilled really good values in me. Instilled values to dream really big, to be honest, and to work hard.\"In a separate interview, the former driver opened up on her political stance, commenting:\"Here is where I stand with SOME current issues and politics. I am not a liberal. I am somewhere between republican and independent,\" she said.\"I think our country should be run by someone that knows business and has integrity. I believe we should be able to speak freely.\"I love this country, and I have lived in other places. I believe when people of different opinions speak face to face, we realize we are more similar than different.\"I don't believe everything anyone says.

A month out from Election Day, business and charter school interests that have raised millions of dollars are now infusing cash and stepping up in school board races against the CTU — in three districts dishing out so much money that election officials have lifted the contribution limits. They appear emboldened by the strife at CPS, many of them having spent the past few weeks backing schools CEO Pedro Martinez in his ongoing fight against Johnson and the teachers’ union. One recently formed political action committee has the explicit intention of providing a counterbalance to the CTU. “They have 10 CTU candidates; they’re gonna do exactly what they are told to do, right?” said Hugo Jacobo, the heavyweight political consultant who formed Chicago Democrats for Education. “So we need people that are gonna sit there and actually make tough decisions about the budget and everything that’s going on in the city.” On Thursday, Chicago Democrats for Education issued a news release declaring their candidates oppose CPS taking out a short-term, high-interest loan, which has been a main point of contention between Martinez and Johnson. Meanwhile the union is pulling on its more limited funds — plus its notoriously strong field organizing and campaigning — to try to push its own candidates over the finish line. “We’ve been knocking on doors for the last six weeks and we’re gonna continue to knock on doors with an army of volunteers who want to make sure that the public is educated around this,” said Hilario Dominguez, a CTU political coordinator helping lead the affiliated Our Schools PAC formed in July. “Our opponents are going to try to confuse the public. They are going to hope that the public is going to go in there and vote for the first name they see.” Even if those groups opposing the CTU are pointing to the controversy between the mayor and Martinez, Dominguez said they ultimately are anti-labor groups that want to privatize public education. In response, Dominguez said CTU-backed candidates are staying focused on what they see as at stake in this election — fully funded schools, equity and the need for more sports programming and arts education. Union-supported candidates Jason Dónes in District 3, Lanetta Thomas in District 9 and Robert Jones in District 10 were informed by election officials that the contribution caps were removed in their races. That can happen if a candidate gives more than $100,000 to their own campaign fund or a super PAC or individual spends more than $100,000 on a race. There are 31 school board candidates running in 10 geographic voting districts. Their campaign committees have directly received a total of $1,075,121 in contributions and loans as of Thursday, a Chicago Sun-Times and WBEZ analysis shows. That’s aside from $348,389 in-kind contributions in the races and much more that’s still expected to come. The CTU’s two PACs and a few others led by related community groups have spent more than $253,000 in support of their candidates since June through in-kind contributions, such as mailers, field canvassing and consulting, state campaign records show. Two super PACS opposing the union had around $3.6 million to spend at the start of September and are now making their move. The Illinois Network of Charter Schools has reported shelling out $526,974 in the past two weeks on digital ads and mailers supporting seven candidates: District 10 hopeful Karin Norrington-Reaves, District 8’s Ángel Gutiérrez, District 7’s Eva Villalobos, District 1’s Michelle Pierre, District 9’s Miquel Lewis, District 3’s Carlos Rivas and District 6’s Andre Smith. INCS also reported spending $30,000 on digital ads opposing the CTU-endorsed Karen Zaccor in the 4th District. That spending is through INCS’ independent expenditure committee, a type of campaign group that can spend in support or opposition of candidates but not contribute directly to or coordinate with campaigns, and has no limits on the size contributions it can accept. The group was sitting on nearly $3 million in early September and has raised more since. Chicago philanthropist Helen Zell, the executive director of her family’s foundation and widow of former media executive Sam Zell, contributed $500,000 to the super PAC last month. Craig Duchossois, the longtime chairman of his family’s investment firm, gave another $100,000 a few days later. Almost all the same candidates backed by INCS were boosted by another super PAC, Urban Center Action, to the tune of $123,479 on texting and printing efforts in the same two-week span. The group didn’t spend on Smith but did support Ellen Rosenfeld in District 4. Headed up by ex-charter school executive Juan Rangel with ties to former mayoral challenger Paul Vallas, Urban Center Action raked in $671,000 this summer and has kept the fundraising going. Oil industry executive Jay Bergman — who contributed $500,000 to a super PAC supporting Donald Trump in 2016 — gave Urban Center Action $50,000 in September. While Rangel, like INCS, has continued to support charter schools, his focus lately has been more squarely on opposing the CTU and Johnson. Urban Center Action released a poll that Rangel said showed voters’ unfavorable view of both the union and mayor — evidence to him that the school board races are crucial. “There are no checks and balances,” Rangel said. Rangel admits that under former mayors, like Richard M. Daley, the mayor and school board seemed one-sided. But he said he thinks Daley had the city in mind, whereas he sees Johnson as only focused on how to support the teachers union. “That’s just a very irresponsible, short-sighted way of looking at how to run the school system,” he said. “Eventually, that kind of thinking will hurt kids.” Jacobo said Chicago Democrats for Education is not necessarily giving money to campaigns, though it is accepting donations. It has not registered any contributions with the Illinois State Board of Elections. Jacobo would instead like campaign donors to give to the candidates directly, which he said would maintain their independence.

But Thursday evening, the two sides announced in a joint statement that they had \"reached a tentative agreement on wages and have agreed to extend the Master Contract until January 15, 2025 to return to the bargaining table to negotiate all other outstanding issues.\"Effective immediately, all current job actions will cease and all work covered by the Master Contract will resume.\"The statement did not offer terms of the deal, but The Wall Street Journal, citing sources close to the matter, said USMX had proposed a 62 percent salary increase over six years, which allowed the deal to be reached.The strike was the first walkout by the union since 1977 after negotiations stalled over union demands for significant wage increases and protection against automation-related job loss.US President Joe Biden -- who had been under pressure to intervene in negotiations to keep ports open, but had demurred citing respect for collective bargaining rights -- celebrated the suspension of the strike late Thursday.\"I want to thank the union workers, the carriers, and the port operators for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding,\" Biden said in a statement.\"Collective bargaining works, and it is critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.\"Outside the White House, Biden added: \"They've got the next 90 days, they are going to settle everything.\"Republican former president Donald Trump, who is seeking to take back the Oval Office, had blamed Biden for the crisis, saying Tuesday in Milwaukee: \"He should have worked out a deal.\"Analysts had cautioned that a lengthy strike could pose a major headwind to the US economy, leading to shortages of some items and lifting costs at a time when inflation has been moderating.Oxford Economics had estimated that the strike would dent US gross domestic product by $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion per week, with the overall impact depending on how long the strike lasts.But Capital Economics said fears about the economic impact of the strike were \"overdone,\" in part because recent shocks to the supply chain have made businesses more aware of the need to bake in precautionary measures.The strike arrived at a politically precarious time, just one month before the US presidential election on November 5, but the tentative agreement relieves the political pressure.","summary":"US dockworkers will return to work after a three-day strike at East and Gulf Coast ports after the union and port operators reached a tentative deal on pay and extended the current contract to January 15, both sides said Thursday.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/us-dockworkers-head-back-work-after-tentative-deal-3745469","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4551722/agreement-between-international-longshoremens-assocation-ila-united-states-maritime-alliance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 00:03:12","author":"Julie Chabanas","authors":["Julie Chabanas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":258398522,"title":"Biden’s FBI silently updates crime data for 2022 showing a negative trend","text":"This week President Biden once again took a victory lap on crime, trumpeting preliminary FBI data on trends in 2024. “Communities across our country are safer now than when I took office,” he bragged in an official statement. Despite crime playing a significant role in this year’s election, there has been a notable absence of coverage on indications that the FBI could be manipulating its statistics. This is reminiscent of the situation where the Bureau of Labor Statistics inaccurately estimated the number of jobs created during the Biden-Harris administration. Last month, new FBI data showed that reported serious violent crime (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) fell by 3.5% in 2023. Simultaneously, albeit with much less fanfare, the FBI made revisions to its initial data for 2022, altering a previously reported decline to a concerning rise in violent crime numbers. Last year, the media trumpeted the FBI’s claim that reported violent crime had fallen in 2022 by 2.1%. But now the FBI admits that violent crime rose in 2022 instead, by 4.5% — off by 6.6 percentage points. These updated figures revealed a total increase of 80,029 violent crimes in 2022 compared to 2021, including 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes, 33,459 robberies, and 37,091 aggravated assaults. It’s a concerning change regarding a highly politicized topic. A Gallup poll found in March that “crime and violence” was Americans’ second biggest concern, after inflation. For a couple of years now, the mainstream media has been running headlines such as this from NBC News: “Most people think the U.S. crime rate is rising. They’re wrong.” USA Today’s take on the 2023 FBI crime data was typical: “Violent crime dropped for second straight year in 2023, including murder and rape.” Yet don’t expect the media to let people know that all the headlines over the last year were wrong — or that 2022’s increase was greater than the reported 2023 drop. Perhaps the FBI’s newest numbers won’t be revised upward next year, after the election has safely passed. But even if we take them at face value, it’s important to distinguish reported crime from total crime. We have known for decades that most crimes aren’t reported to the police. That’s why the US Department of Justice provides a measure of total crime, which includes both reported and unreported crime. And the results of the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics 2023 National Crime Victimization Survey, released in mid-September, tell a very different story. Since victims don’t report most crimes, the NCVS interviews 240,000 people each year about their personal experiences. Instead of the FBI’s 3.5% drop in serious violent crime, the NCVS found a 4.1% increase in violent crime victimization from 2022 to 2023. While the FBI claims that serious violent crime has fallen by 5.8% since Biden took office, the NCVS numbers show that total violent crime has risen by an incredible 55.4%. Rapes were up by 42%, robbery by 63%, and aggravated assault by 55% during his term. The increases shown by the NCVS during the Biden-Harris administration are by far the largest percentage increases over any other three-year period, more than doubling the previous record. If we compare 2023 rates with 2019’s pre-COVID violent crime rates, the FBI’s new data show virtually no improvement — just a 0.2% drop — while the NCVS shows a 19% increase in that time period.

In 2023, 21% of departments including large cities like New York and Los Angeles, sent no crime figures to the FBI.

Yet, with crime a central issue in this year’s election, he and the mainstream media have carefully ignored evidence that the FBI may be fudging its numbers — much like the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics massively overestimated the number of jobs created during the Biden-Harris administration. Last month, new FBI data showed that reported serious violent crime (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) fell by 3.5% in 2023. But at the same time — and much more quietly — the FBI revised its earlier data for 2022, turning a reported decrease into a worrisome increase in violent crime. Last year, the media trumpeted the FBI’s claim that reported violent crime had fallen in 2022 by 2.1%. But now the FBI admits that violent crime rose in 2022 instead, by 4.5% — off by 6.6 percentage points. These updated numbers resulted in a net increase in 2022 over 2021 of 80,029 violent crimes: 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes, 33,459 robberies and 37,091 aggravated assaults. It’s a concerning change regarding a highly politicized topic. A Gallup poll found in March that “crime and violence” was Americans’ second biggest concern, after inflation. For a couple of years now, the mainstream media has been running headlines such as this from NBC News: “Most people think the U.S. crime rate is rising. They’re wrong.” USA Today’s take on the 2023 FBI crime data was typical: “Violent crime dropped for second straight year in 2023, including murder and rape.” Yet don’t expect the media to let people know that all the headlines over the last year were wrong — or that 2022’s increase was greater than the reported 2023 drop. Perhaps the FBI’s newest numbers won’t be revised upward next year, after the election has safely passed. But even if we take them at face value, it’s important to distinguish reported crime from total crime. We have known for decades that most crimes aren’t reported to the police. That’s why the US Department of Justice provides a measure of total crime, which includes both reported and unreported crime. And the results of the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics 2023 National Crime Victimization Survey, released in mid-September, tell a very different story. Since victims don’t report most crimes, the NCVS interviews 240,000 people each year about their personal experiences. Instead of the FBI’s 3.5% drop in serious violent crime, the NCVS found a 4.1% increase in violent crime victimization from 2022 to 2023. While the FBI claims that serious violent crime has fallen by 5.8% since Biden took office, the NCVS numbers show that total violent crime has risen by an incredible 55.4%. Rapes were up by 42%, robbery by 63%, and aggravated assault by 55% during his term. The increases shown by the NCVS during the Biden-Harris administration are by far the largest percentage increases over any other three-year period, more than doubling the previous record. If we compare 2023 rates with 2019’s pre-COVID violent crime rates, the FBI’s new data show virtually no improvement — just a 0.2% drop — while the NCVS shows a 19% increase in that time period. Much has been made of the recent decline in murder rates. But while murder rates fell by 16.2% from 2020 to 2023, they still exceed pre-COVID levels by a significant 9.6%. The mainstream media’s treatment of these statistics has been shameful.

The commander-in-chief, 81, stood in silence during sweltering heat when a Ray City farmer concluded his remarks at a post-hurricane event with a prayer. Biden and senior Washington officials stood and listened in front of rows of massive upturned pecan trees behind him, their leaves brown just days after Hurricane Helene tore through. Ray City is around 18 miles north of Valdosta, one of the areas that suffered the biggest hit from Helene and where Donald Trump visited earlier this week. Most of the area is still without power and residents are picking up the pieces from the deadliest hurricane since Katrina that has killed 200 people so far. At least 33 have died in Georgia. ‘Lord this is your creation,’ Shiloh farm property manager Buck Paulk said, with Biden and lawmakers gathered behind him. ‘There ain’t a twig or leaf or branch or root that you don’t hold account of,’ he said in his Georgia drawl. ‘Lord, we need the help – it all comes from you.’ Farmers here are looking for another kind of help from Washington, D.C., and Biden said they would get it. The president took a question about an emergency supplemental bill, something he has said may be needed soon to provide relief. Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier that other legislation already refilled a FEMA fund. ‘Can’t wait, can’t wait. People need help now,’ Biden said. ‘At moments like this, it’s time to put politics aside,’ said Biden during his own remarks. He called to ‘break down this rabid partisanship that exists,’ then said funds in some of his infrastructure legislation went more to red states than to blue ones. ‘It’s not one state versus the other, it’s the United States. You know, there’s no Democrats or Republicans out here … only Americans are here. I’ve been committed to being president for all Americans’. Earlier this week, Trump accused Biden of going out out of his way to not help Republicans hit by the storm. At a rally on Thursday he said the response has been worse than that of Hurricane Katrina. ‘There’s nobody that’s handled a hurricane or storm worse than what they’re doing right now,’ Trump said. ‘Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants. Many of whom should not be in our country Biden name-dropped Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, thanking him and saying they spoke earlier Thursday. Kemp has already vouched for their contact, But Kemp was not there in person for the presidential tour of his state. The event featured Sen. Rafael Warnock, a Democrat who helped give Democrats their majority, as well as Rep. Austin Scott, a Republican who Biden also acknowledged. ‘FEMA has been down here. Coordination has been pretty good,’ Scott told DailyMail.com on the farm. He said the damage to the overall pecan crop was ‘somewhere around $500 million.’ On an earlier storm tour in Florida, Biden met with people who lost their homes. Some houses were completely gone, with only bare pilings standing in what had been a community of retirees and vacationers near Big Bend, where the storm made landfall. The president was accompanied by Sen. Rick Scott, who was there in jeans and his familiar Navy ballcap from earlier storm duty. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wasn’t there, despite an apparent effort by the White House to get in touch. Asked why DeSantis wasn’t there, Scott told DailyMail.com, ‘I don’t know.’ DailyMail.com has reached out to the governor’s office for comment. DeSantis has been with Biden during other disasters, including after the Surfside building collapse, which came when the two were eying a potential presidential battle. The governor, who endorsed Donald Trump after a bitter primary that ended in his defeat, may be mindful of a famous event with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie famously toured Hurricane Sandy damage weeks before the 2012 election. Observers said it bolstered Obama in his reelection. The trip to Georgia was the latest by a top politician to a damaged battleground state, with Vice President Kamala Harris also getting in on the action with a visit to North Carolina. Trump got the jump on both Biden and Harris with his Monday visit, where his unfounded claim that the administration was brushing off Kemp drew White House pushback. If ‘rabid partisanship’ was on Biden’s mind in Georgia, he issued an emphatic statement to reporters upon landing near D.C. minutes after former GOP Rep. and Trump nemesis Liz Cheney endorsed Harris onstage in Wisconsin. ‘She made one of the most consequential speeches I’ve ever heard. She has character. I know her dad … We argue like hell, but I always admired his courage and honesty,’ Biden told reporters after returning on Air Force One. ‘What she did not took only political courage, but physical courage… I was really incredibly proud of her.’ But he bristled when DailyMail.com asked him what he would do to bring more Republicans over to Harris. ‘I am not making that judgment. I’m talking about her… She and her father have character, character, dammit. There’s not enough of it.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden bowed his head during a tearful prayer at a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden responds to Trump&#8217;s criticism of his handling of Hurricane Helene and urges for an end to extreme political divisions. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/biden-responds-to-trumps-criticism-of-his-handling-of-hurricane-helene-and-urges-for-an-end-to-extreme-political-divisions/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/03/22/90433051-0-image-m-14_1727992288955.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:54:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.572},{"id":258399548,"title":"Ex-GOP Rep.

Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas, who also oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, announced Wednesday that “FEMA does not have the funds to make it” through the rest of hurricane season — because it’s already emptied its emergency kitty on illegal-migrant expenses. It’s now sending Helene victims $750 checks to finish off of a fund of just $10 million to help hurricane survivors buy groceries. President Biden’s answer: Have Congress give FEMA a fresh cash infusion. Meanwhile, FEMA’s devoted $641 million this year just to help state and local governments handle the influx. (Of course, Mayor Adams will point out that this federal help is far short of what localities need to cover their migrant costs. But Biden’s not asking for an appropriation to pay for that, because then he’d have to admit the cost of his open-border policies: Far better to just deplete FEMA’s funds, then tell Adams and other mayors to just suck it up, or else). To be fair, it’s not just Mayorkas who didn’t prep properly for this year’s hurricanes: Kamala Harris reportedly skipped the annual pre-storm-season briefing, indeed has opted out every year she’s been veep. Meanwhile, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has his own Helene gripe with the Biden-Harris team: He says he was “outraged” when FEMA initially designated just 11 counties as post-hurricane disaster areas, which allows victims to file for federal assistance, when he saw “such devastation in up to 90 counties.” He rang up the White House and got another 30 counties listed, with a chance for more to qualify. (Hmm: If Georgia weren’t a swing state, would the response have been as helpful?) Also drawing critical fire is Pete Buttigieg’s Transportation Department, which on Tuesday ordered the grounding of all private drones in the North Carolina flood zone — even though drones have been delivering insulin, baby formula and other crucial supplies to isolated flood victims. Apparently, people are supposed to wait for official help: Tell that screaming infant to be patient. But don’t expect any of this to rise to the PR disaster that Hurricane Katrina proved for the George W. Bush administration: Too much of the media is running interference for Harris ahead of Election Day. Even if another hurricane hits hard and Mayorkas has to explain there’s no money left to help, we’re sure Harris & Co. will find some way to insist it’s Donald Trump’s fault.","summary":"The next Americans to get slammed by the Harris-Biden border disaster: hurricane victims!","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/03/opinion/sorry-hurricane-victims-harris-biden-already-spent-your-relief-funds-on-migrants/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/HHU1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:51:04","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.66},{"id":258398462,"title":"Melania Trump says she supports right to abortion, in break from husband","text":"Melania Trump, the wife of former United States President Donald Trump, has said there is “no room for compromise” over a woman’s right to have an abortion — a position at stark odds with that of her husband. “Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,” the former first lady said in a video posted on social media on Thursday. “Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth, individual freedom. What does ‘my body, my choice’ really mean?” Her comments appear to mark a significant divergence from Donald Trump’s public stance. The former president has campaigned on his role in overturning Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court decision that previously established a constitutional right to abortion access. Campaign on abortion restrictions While the 78-year-old ex-president has frequently changed his stance on abortion over the years, he currently supports leaving the matter up to individual states to decide. “My view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both,” Trump said in April. “And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.” Trump has also taken credit for appointing three of the Supreme Court judges who overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022. That decision ended more than 50 years of federal abortion protections. “I did a great service in doing it,” Trump said during the September 10 presidential debate, addressing his role in the court’s decision. “It took courage to do it. And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it.” ‘A slap in the face’ Melania Trump has been more reserved about articulating her political views in public, rarely voicing opinions about hot-button issues, particularly during the current 2024 election season. But Thursday’s video appeared to be part of the promotion for her new self-titled memoir, Melania, due to be released next week. On Wednesday, The Guardian newspaper published some advance excerpts. In one part, Melania Trump writes: “A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.” The newspaper said she also defended some abortions performed in the later stages of pregnancy, mostly out of medical necessity or to save the life of the mother. Her comments are likely to spur further division within the Republican Party, where there have been rumblings of dissent against her husband’s ambiguous stance on abortion access. In March, for instance, Donald Trump made comments that suggested he would support a national ban. “Maybe we could bring the country together on that issue,” he told a morning radio show. But when he backtracked in April, rejecting any potential federal ban, there was a backlash from evangelicals and hardline conservatives, including his former vice president, Mike Pence. Pence called Trump’s stance a “slap in the face” to “millions of pro-life Americans” who voted for him in 2016 and 2020. In June, under Trump’s leadership, the Republican Party also approved a platform document that offered no explicit support for a national abortion ban — a break with recent tradition. That too prompted outcry among some members of the Republican base, who feared it signalled a weakened commitment to implementing abortion restrictions. Broad public support Political experts have long considered abortion to be a winning issue for Democrats, who largely support greater access to reproductive healthcare. When the Democratic Party did better than expected in the 2022 midterm elections, critics credited the results to public anger towards the Supreme Court’s decision to end federal abortion protections. Earlier this year, the Pew Research Center confirmed that, even two years later, a majority of Americans supported the availability of abortion in nearly all cases. Nearly six in 10 respondents indicated abortion should be legal. In this year’s presidential race, Trump has sought to win over female voters — and some experts say he may be downplaying abortion as an election issue as a result. During this week’s vice presidential debate, for instance, Trump’s running mate JD Vance sought to present a moderate position on the issue, focusing on a “pro-family” platform and articulating sympathy for those considering abortion. However, he has previously said he would support a national abortion ban. “I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally,” Vance said in January 2022 when running for the Senate. While the debate between Vance and Democrat Tim Walz was unfolding, Trump reiterated on his Truth Social social media platform that he would not support a national ban.","summary":"Former US President Donald Trump has most recently supported states determining their own limits to abortion access.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/3/melania-trump-says-she-supports-right-to-abortion-in-break-from-husband?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AP22320155007180.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:50:37","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":0.148},{"id":258398054,"title":"Filmmakers of ‘No Other Land’ Return to West Bank and Israel Amid Escalating Middle East Violence","text":"EXCLUSIVE: The Israeli and Palestinian directors of No Other Land, the award-winning documentary set in the West Bank, are abandoning a U.S. tour and heading home as violence explodes in the region. Basel Adra, Yuval Abraham, and Rachel Szor cut short what was to have been a month-long visit. (Fellow director Hamdan Billal stayed back in the West Bank and didn’t make the U.S. trip). Adra, a Palestinian from the West Bank community of Masafer Yatta, and Abraham, a Jewish Israeli from the city of Be’er Sheva in Southern Israel, participated in a Q&A at the New York Film Festival last Sunday. They were to have taken part in a second Q&A Tuesday night, hours after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at Israel in apparent retaliation for Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. That attack, coupled with Israel’s ground invasion of Southern Lebanon, prompted the filmmakers to give up plans to attend the Woodstock Film Festival, AFI Fest in Los Angeles, and SFFILM’s Doc Stories in San Francisco. In an exclusive interview with Deadline before they headed to the airport, the filmmakers explained how they arrived at their decision. “I spoke with my parents, Basel spoke with his, and we’re very much afraid and worried for their safety,” Abraham said. “Just in the past 24 or 48 hours, things escalated again very dramatically. Eight Israelis were killed in Jaffa. More than 70 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, and in Basel’s community in Masafer Yatta, [Jewish] settler attacks began escalating again; Iran’s missiles — which killed a Palestinian from Gaza in the West Bank. And we were worried that we will be stuck in the United States, that we won’t be able to even get back.” Abraham added, “At the end of the day, we are activists and our purpose in life is to be there and to work for change from there. So, it felt like the right thing to do, and I guess above all else is to be with the people we love.” As an Israeli, Abraham can fly into Ben Gurion International Airport, located between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. However, Palestinians require special permission to do so; for that reason, Adra is flying to Amman, Jordan and will attempt to reach his West Bank home from there. Adra described his priority once he reaches Masafer Yatta: “Being with family and [doing] the work that we do, being in the field with the families, with the people. For me, at least in my area, be with those who face settlers, soldiers’ violence as well.” No Other Land, winner of the top prize for documentary at the Berlin Film Festival, provides a ground-level view of what it’s like to live day to day in Masafer Yatta, a collection of 19 hamlets in a mountainous area south of Hebron. For two decades, Palestinians in Masafer Yatta have fought a decree from the Israeli government ordering them off their land to make way for an Israel Defense Forces live-fire training ground. The expulsion order, one of the largest since the 1967 war, was upheld by Israel’s supreme court in 2022. The film shows the IDF demolishing Palestinian homes, a school, and sealing up a well as part of the expulsion. The film also explores the perhaps unlikely friendship between Adra and Abraham, who have spent years in common cause to highlight the reality of life for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. But it also shows the different circumstances in which they live; as a Palestinian, Adra is subject to Israeli military law and faces restrictions on his movements; Abraham, as a Jewish Israeli, can move freely and lives under civilian law. In a statement signed by Adra, Abraham, and Szor announcing their decision to shorten their U.S. trip, the filmmakers described No Other Land as “both a document of a war crime happening now in the occupied West Bank, and a plea for a different future, one without occupation and oppression, one which is based on empathy, respect for international law, and true security and equality between Palestinians and Israelis. It has never been more urgent.” Yuval expanded on the film’s themes in conversation with Deadline. “It’s very much about the West Bank and the military occupation in the West Bank, but still, we believe as a [filmmaking] collective of Palestinians and Israelis, that the only way forward is a political solution… Especially with regards to the relations between Israelis and Palestinians, it is not something sustainable that you have millions of people who cannot vote, who are living under a foreign military rule. And this has been going on for decades, much before October 7th.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised retaliation for Iran’s missile strike. “Iran made a big mistake tonight — and it will pay for it,” he said following the launch of upwards of 200 missiles. Abraham ascribed cynical motives to Netanyahu’s decision to expand hostilities into Lebanon, as well as his continued prosecution of the war in Gaza, following the Hamas terror attack on Israel almost one year ago. “This, in my mind, is Netanyahu’s attempt basically to remain prime minister for a very long time,” Abraham said. “It has been clear that if the war [in Gaza] ends and there’s a ceasefire, there will be elections and he will not remain prime minister. He knows that the more time that passes from October 7th, the more the Israeli public will — and it’s already happening — forget or forgive him for the big security collapse on his part [of October 7th].” Abraham further alleged, “I also think he has an interest, honestly, to try to create a context in the United States where it’s more likely that Donald Trump will be elected [president] and the more the U.S. is dragged into the escalation, the more likely it is that people in swing states will not vote for Kamala Harris.” The filmmaker also faulted the Biden administration for failing to use its leverage to interrupt fighting in Gaza, where more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since last October, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hamas continues to hold dozens of hostages seized on October 7th and has not released the bodies of 39 more who are believed to have died in captivity. “I don’t think they [the Biden administration] took forceful action to actually enforce those ceasefires,” Abraham said, referring to fitful efforts to mediate between Israel and Hamas. He maintains the White House should push for an end to the killing of civilians and press for a political settlement to hostilities. “I think the United States foreign policy is not helping it happen.” Adra said international focus on the widening conflict has obscured frightening developments in the West Bank. He told Deadline Israeli settlers and troops are ramping up violent assaults on Palestinians. “In Area C, such as Masafer Yatta, many Palestinians were shot to death by Israeli settlers and during pogroms where they come to burn homes, properties, attacking people and killing Palestinians. In my specific village, on October 13th — it’s in a video in the movie — a settler and one soldier and another settler enter my community and shot my cousin in the stomach after that Friday prayer,” he said, adding, “[People in] six communities in my area fled from their homes because of settlers, soldiers’ attacks.” No Other Land will open at Film at Lincoln Center on November 1 for an exclusive one-week run. However, it does not have formal U.S. distribution, despite winning awards at film festivals around the world, from Berlin to CPH:DOX, Sheffield DocFest, Millennium Docs Against Gravity, Visions du Réel and more. “We have very strong distribution all over Europe and Southeast Asia, and I think it’ll be a very big pity that the U.S. audience, the millions of people living in the states who are, for us at least, one of the most important target audiences that we believe should watch the film, will not get a chance to do so if there will not be strong distribution,” Abraham said. “We are still hopeful that this will happen… We are in touch with several distributors. Nothing is now yet concrete, but there are conversations happening.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: The Israeli and Palestinian directors of No Other Land, the award-winning&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Filmmakers of &#8216;No Other Land&#8217; Return to West Bank and Israel Amid Escalating Middle East Violence first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/filmmakers-of-no-other-land-return-to-west-bank-and-israel-amid-escalating-middle-east-violence/","image":"https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2175531087.jpg?w=300","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:49:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.186},{"id":258398404,"title":"Tranh luận trước bầu cử Mỹ bất ngờ ‘đổi gió’","text":"Hai ứng viên phó tổng thống Mỹ có cuộc tranh luận về hàng loạt vấn đề căng thẳng trước thềm bầu cử, nhưng tránh những lời côn.g kíc.h cá nhân. Nhiều khán giả theo dõi cuộc tranh luận sáng 2.10 (giờ VN) đã bất ngờ trước thái độ ôn hòa và thân thiện giữa 2 ứng viên phó tổng thống Mỹ, gồm Thượng nghị sĩ bang Ohio JD Vance (đảng Cộng hòa) và Thống đốc bang Minnesota Tim Walz (đảng Dân chủ). Hai ứng viên tập trung tranh luận các vấn đề chính sách và tránh những màn côn.g kíc.h cá nhân như từng diễn ra trong cuộc tranh luận giữa cựu Tổng thống Donald Trump và Phó tổng thống Kamala Harris hồi tháng trước. Có gì trong màn tranh luận của phó tướng Harris-Trump Hòa nhã nhưng quyết liệt Ông Walz đến từ bang Minnesota còn ông Vance đến từ bang Ohio, đều thuộc vùng trung tâm nước Mỹ vốn tự hào về thái độ lành mạnh và thân thiện, theo Reuters. Mỗi người đều đem lại một sự đa dạng về địa lý cho ứng viên tổng thống của đảng mình, với ông Trump đến từ Bờ Đông còn bà Harris đến từ Bờ Tây. Ông Vance và ông Walz (phải) bắt tay nhau tại cuộc tranh luận. ẢNH: AFP Tuy nhiên, quan điểm của 2 ứng viên tổng thống đã phủ bóng lên cuộc tranh luận của 2 “phó tướng”, khi ông Walz chỉ trích rằng ông Trump là “mối đ.e dọ.a đối với nền dân chủ và không phù hợp để lãnh đạo Mỹ trên trường quốc tế”. Trong khi đó, ông Vance chỉ trích bà Harris về những vấn đề kinh tế và nhập cư lậu. Theo tờ Politico, 2 ứng viên phó tổng thống dành phần lớn thời gian trong cuộc tranh luận 90 phút được tổ chức bởi Đài CBS News để bảo vệ ứng viên tổng thống của đảng mình. Về vấn đề nhập cư, ông Vance bảo vệ những chính sách biên giới của ông Trump, trong khi ông Walz chỉ trích vị cựu tổng thống về việc chỉ xây chưa đến 2% bức tường biên giới với Mexico khi đương nhiệm. Về kinh tế, ông Vance ca ngợi thành tích ông Trump trong việc tăng lương và giảm lạm phát, đồng thời chỉ trích bà Harris về kinh tế. Về y tế, 2 ứng viên tranh cãi về đạo luật Chăm sóc sức khỏe hợp túi tiề.n và chi phí thuố.c kê toa. Về đối ngoại, họ thay phiên nhau đổ lỗi cho đảng của đối phương về việc làm xấu đi sự bất ổn toàn cầu. Ông Trump kêu gọi luận tội và truy tố bà Harris Tiếp tục tranh cãi Sau cuộc tranh luận, ông Trump khen ông Vance thể hiện tốt và “chúng ta sẽ làm nước Mỹ vĩ đại trở lại”. Tờ Independent dẫn thông cáo do chiến dịch tranh cử của đảng Cộng hòa đưa ra cho rằng ông Vance đã “phác thảo một cách ngắn gọn kế hoạch Trump – Vance nhằm khôi phục sự thịnh vượng, an toàn và an ninh cho người dân Mỹ sau 4 năm bị hủy hoại dưới tay bà Harris”. Về phía đảng Dân chủ, chiến dịch Harris – Walz ra thông cáo đề nghị ông Trump tranh luận lần 2 với bà Harris. “Sự lựa chọn mà người dân Mỹ phải đối diện vào tháng 11 đã được thể hiện đầy đủ vào đêm nay, giữa việc vạch ra một con đường mới để tiến về phía trước, hoặc quay lại. Phó tổng thống Harris tin rằng người dân Mỹ xứng đáng được chứng kiến bà và ông Trump lên sân khấu tranh luận thêm một lần nữa”, theo thông cáo. Ngoài ra, thông cáo cho rằng ông Walz đã thể hiện sự tương phản trong tranh luận, khi là “một người nói thẳng, tập trung vào việc chia sẻ các giải pháp thực tế, trước một chính trị gia đã dành cả đêm để bảo vệ sự chia rẽ và những thất bại của ông Trump”. Trong động thái phản ứng, ông Trump nói rằng bà Harris đưa ra đề nghị tranh luận một lần nữa “vì họ thua cuộc thật tồi tệ trong đêm nay”. “Nó giống như một võ sĩ thua cuộc, đứng dậy và nói rằng mình muốn đấu lại. Tôi đã đán.h bại (Tổng thống Joe) Biden, sau đó tôi đán.h bại bà ấy và tôi không định làm lại điều đó”, ông Trump viết trên mạng xã hội Truth Social. Bầu cử Mỹ: Các bang chiến địa vẫn chưa rõ ủng hộ bà Harris hay ông Trump Liên quan cuộc tranh luận Walz – Vance, Đài CNN dẫn khảo sát với sự tham gia của 574 cử tri cho thấy 48% đán.h giá ông Walz đề cập nhiều hơn đến những nhu cầu và vấn đề phải giải quyết. Theo một khảo sát khác của CBS News với sự tham gia của 1.630 cử tri, đa số đều cho rằng cuộc tranh luận diễn ra tích cực. Khoảng 42% cho rằng ông Vance thắng trong tranh luận, trong khi tỷ lệ này dành cho ông Walz là 41%. Khảo sát có biên độ sai sót 2,7 điểm phần trăm. Ông Trump lo bầu cử bị tác động Tờ The Hill ngày 2.10 dẫn lời nhóm luật sư của cựu Tổng thống Trump cáo buộc Công tố viên đặc biệt Jack Smith đang cố gắng tác động cuộc bầu cử tổng thống, khi tìm cách đưa ra những lờ.i kha.i và bằng chứng mới liên quan vụ án âm mưu lật ngược kết quả bầu cử năm 2020. Ông Trump đã bác bỏ mọi cáo buộc trong vụ án và cho rằng cần phải biên tập thêm nội dung trong văn bản của ông Smith. Trước đó vào tháng 8, ông Smith ra cáo trạng mới, truy tố ông Trump trong vụ án. Đến ngày 26.9, ông Smith chuyển đến tòa án một văn bản về những vấn đề pháp lý và bằng chứng mới. Dự kiến Thẩm phán Tanya Chutkan sẽ quyết định việc có công khai văn bản này hay không.

In a video posted to her X account on Thursday morning, the former first lady defended women's \"individual freedoms\" to do what they want with their bodies. \"Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,\" she said in the video. \"Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?\" The video appears to confirm excerpts of her self-titled memoir reported by The Guardian on Wednesday. The former fist lady's views conflict with the GOP's anti-abortion platform and with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. In her memoir, she argues that the decision to end a pregnancy should be left to a woman and her doctor, \"free from any intervention of pressure from the government\", according to the published excerpts. \"Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?\" she wrote, according to The Guardian. \"A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.\" Melania Trump writes that she has \"carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life\". Ms Trump has rarely publicly expressed her personal political views and has been largely absent from the campaign trail. Last week, she sat down with Fox for her first interview in more than two years. Abortion rights a key election issue Democrats have blamed the former president for the severe deterioration of reproductive rights as abortion bans were implemented in large swaths of the country following the overturning of the landmark case, which had granted a constitutional right to abortion. The national anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America denounced the former first lady's views on abortion, including her comments on abortion later in pregnancy, but said their \"priority is to defeat Kamala Harris\". \"Women with unplanned pregnancies are crying out for more resources, not more abortions,\" the organisation's president Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement to the AP. \"We must have compassion for them and for babies in the womb who suffer from brutal abortions.\" Vice-President Kamala Harris's campaign noted Trump's role in ending Roe v Wade in a statement reacting to Melania Trump's defence of abortion rights. \"Sadly for the women across America, Mrs Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. \"Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.\" Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject. Abortion rights advocates are sceptical, however, saying Trump cannot be trusted not to restrict reproductive rights. Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday about Melania Trump's book or video. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the memoir was another example of \"the Trumps playing voters like a fiddle\". \"As president, [Trump] made it his mission to get Roe v Wade overturned,\" she said in a statement. \"Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue. Read between the lines.\" Democratic strategist Brittany Crampsie told the Associated Press the memoir's release was a \"clear attempt to appeal to more moderate voters and to moderate JD Vance's very clearly extreme views on the issue\". But she is sceptical that the move would work in favour of Trump, saying his shifting views \"have already confused voters and sowed distrust\". Melania Trump also defends abortions later in pregnancy, asserting that \"most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child. Perhaps even the death of the mother,\" she writes. \"These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor.\" While her husband, who has often parroted misinformation about abortions later in pregnancy, falsely claiming that Democrats support abortion \"after birth\", though infanticide is outlawed in every state. Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who focuses on reproductive rights law and history, said it was unclear if the memoir's release so close to the election was an attempt to help Donald Trump. Donald Trump promoted his wife's book at a September rally in New York, calling on supporters to \"go out and get her book\". It is unclear if the former president has read the book. \"Go out and buy it,\" he told the crowd. \"It's great. And if she says bad things about me, I'll call you all up, and I'll say, 'Don't buy it.'\" Opinion polls consistently show that a large majority of Americans support abortion rights.

Briarcliff Entertainment’s CEO Tom Ortenberg told CNN on Wednesday that the company has acquired the domestic distribution rights to the film, which will be released in theaters in early 2025. Majors, who previously appeared in “Creed III” along with Disney’s Marvel film “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and Disney+ series “Loki,” plays an amateur bodybuilder in “Magazine,” which also stars Haley Bennett. “‘Magazine Dreams’ is a visceral experience that challenges the perceptions of ambition and identity,” Ortenberg said in a statement. “Jonathan Majors’ transcendent performance as Killian Maddox will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the most compelling and transformative roles in recent cinema history.” Briarcliff Entertainment is also the distributor behind the upcoming film “The Apprentice,” which chronicles former President Donald Trump’s real estate dealings in New York in the 1980s and stars Sebastian Stan as Trump, “Succession” star Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn, and Oscar-nominated “Borat 2” actress Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump. “Magazine Dreams” was originally acquired by Searchlight after receiving acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival last year. It was slated for release in December but was pulled from Disney’s release calendar just before Majors’ trial began. A New York jury in December found Majors guilty of assault and harassment of his former girlfriend during a domestic dispute. He was convicted of one count of reckless assault in the 3rd degree and a non-criminal charge of harassment as a violation. Majors, who’d previously pleaded not guilty to all charges, was acquitted on another assault charge and one count of aggravated harassment. He avoided jail time but was sentenced to a 52-week mandatory in-person domestic violence prevention program. Majors had been set to reprise his Marvel character in what was previously titled “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” as well as “Avengers: Secret Wars,” but Marvel announced in July that “Kang Dynasty” was being replaced by “Avengers: Doomsday,” featuring the return of Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU.

However, Lawler did attempt to clean up the intention behind them. “The ugly practice of blackface was the furthest thing from my mind,” Lawler, who identifies as white, told the Times. “Let me be clear, this is not that.” The newspaper reported that Lawler, 38, had to be around 20 years old when the photos were taken during a campus Halloween gathering at the private Manhattan University in 2006. Someone who appears to be Lawler is shown dressed similarly to Jackson, in a black shirt and red jacket, with visibly darkened skin. A person familiar with the costume told the Times that Lawler allegedly used bronzer from a female classmate to tint his skin. Lawler claimed that the costume was “a genuine homage to my musical hero since I was a little kid trying to moonwalk through my mom's kitchen.” And this isn’t the first time that Lawler’s love of the late King of Pop has become a talking point. But rest assured, Lawler campaign spokesperson Chris Russell confirmed that the freshman congressman is, in fact, a Jackson fan. “It’s true that Congressman Lawler—who is known to have performed the Moonwalk once or twice—is a fan of Michael Jackson’s music and even attended one of his last concerts at Madison Square Garden in 2001,” Lawler’s spokesperson Chris Russell told the Daily Beast last year. Lawler has also even been touted as an MJ “expert” by one Jackson biographer, who recalled how “disgusted” Lawler had been with the 2015 allegations against Jackson in the book, Michael Jackson: The Magic, the Madness, the Whole Story. However, Lawler’s political opponent, Jones, has called his behavior “disgusting and disqualifying” for “refusing to stand up to Donald Trump’s dangerous antisemitic behavior and remarks,” he wrote in a September Facebook post. “It shows he doesn’t actually care about combating antisemitism if he feels there’s no political benefit to him,” said Jones, who has so far not addressed Lawler’s alleged blackface.

Trump leads in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina.Silver noted in Thursday's Silver Bulletin that the election is in \"a steady phase,\" and that recent surveys have not found significant changes in the candidates' prospects for victory. Per the pollster's forecast, Harris has a 56.7 percent chance of winning the necessary 270 electoral votes in November, while Trump trails with 43.1 percent.Below is a breakdown of how each swing state has shifted over the past week, according to Silver's model.ArizonaTrump continues to hold a slight lead in the Grand Canyon State, and polling over the past week has also gone in his favor.Per Silver's tracking, Arizona shifted by 0.1 percentage points in Trump's direction since September 26. The former president has improved by 0.6 percentage points overall in the past month.FiveThirtyEight's tracker finds Trump ahead in Arizona by 1.2 percentage points on average across statewide polling as of Thursday. By Silver's tracking, Trump is up by 1.1 percentage points (48.6 percent to 47.5 percent).PennsylvaniaIn the Keystone State, which Silver finds has the highest chance of tipping the election out of any swing state, Harris holds onto a small lead of 1.3 percentage points (48.8 percent to 47.5 percent) on average. But over the past week, Silver's tracking finds that Pennsylvania polls have shifted by a slim margin, 0.2 percentage points, toward Trump.FiveThirtyEight's polling averages find Harris leading Pennsylvania by just 0.8 points as of Thursday. As Newsweek previously reported, that average is a slight dip for Harris, who on September 3 was leading in Pennsylvania by 1 percentage point.GeorgiaThe race in the Peach State has not budged over the past week, per Silver's tracking, with Trump still leading by 1 percentage point (48.8 percent to 47.8 percent) as of Thursday.The former president has seen positive shifts in Georgia over the past month, however, with Silver finding the state shifting by 2 points in Trump's favor since the start of September.Similarly, tracking from FiveThirtyEight shows that Georgia has flipped over the past month. While Harris led by 0.3 points on average September 3, as of Thursday, Trump is up by 1.2 points on average.MichiganThe Great Lakes State is among Harris' best-performing swing states, per Silver's forecast, with the vice president ahead by 2 percentage points on average as of Thursday's update. Over the last week, however, Trump has improved by 0.3 percentage points across polling.Per FiveThirtyEight's tracking, the state of play in Michigan has been relatively steady over the past month. While Harris is up by 1.6 percentage points as of Thursday, on September 3, she led the race by 1.8 points.NevadaSilver's tracking also finds Harris holding a steady lead in the Silver State, where the vice president is up by 1.8 points on average. The past week of polling has also shown a bump in Harris' direction by 0.8 points, and Silver finds that Harris has improved by 1 point overall in Nevada since the start of September.FiveThirtyEight's tracking finds that Harris is up by 1.1 percentage points on average as of Thursday in Nevada. In comparison, on September 3, she was up by 0.5 percentage points.North CarolinaThe tightest race among the seven swing states is the Tar Heel State, where Trump is ahead by just 0.4 percentage points on average, according to Thursday's Silver Bulletin.Harris has also seen some positive signs over the past week, with polls shifting by 0.1 percentage points in her favor since September 26, per Silver's tracking.North Carolina has the chance of becoming a tipping-point state in November. Trump won there in 2016 and 2020, although the gap in the race has been neck-and-neck since Harris launched her campaign.Per FiveThirtyEight's tracker, Trump is up by just 0.5 percentage points in North Carolina as of Thursday. The past month has seen virtually no changes, with Trump leading by 0.6 points in the state on September 3.WisconsinSilver's tracking finds that Harris also holds one of her best leads in the Badger State, where the vice president is up by 2 percentage points on average.Over the past week, however, polling has slightly shifted toward Trump, by 0.2 points, per the Silver Bulletin. Since the start of September, Trump has improved by 1.2 percentage points in Wisconsin.FiveThirtyEight's tracker finds that Harris was up by 2.8 percentage points on September 3 across statewide polling.

Not only did he fail to fully and meaningfully comply with our investigation—he actively worked to undermine and thwart it.” They call his actions “an outrageous affront and embarrassment to the inspector general community and have undermined the reputation of the entire DHS Office of Inspector General.” READ MORE: JD Vance Says ‘Yes’ Trump Won in 2020 Then Walks Away When Asked ‘Will You Concede?’ The Project On Government Oversight (POGO), a nonpartisan independent watchdog, on Wednesday released a report alleging Cuffari “waged a years-long campaign to derail and discredit investigations into allegations of his misconduct, which include claims he retaliated against whistleblowers.” The independent report from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) did not cite Cuffari’s actions in deleted texts scandal, but as NCRM reported in 2022, Cuffari appeared to have waited seven months to notify Congress of the missing text messages from the day before and day of the January 6, 2021 insurrection. That means that four months after the January 6 insurrection the Dept. of Homeland Security knew Secret Service agents’ text messages, from the day before and day of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, were missing and did not inform Congress or the National Archives, which is required by law to retain those records. RELATED: ‘Coverup of Treason’: Trump-Appointed IG, Under Investigation, Knew of Missing Secret Service and DHS Texts Far Earlier The deleted Secret Service texts were not the only missing data at DHS. “Text messages for President Donald Trump’s acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf and acting deputy secretary Ken Cuccinelli are missing for a key period leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol,” The Washington Post reported in July 2022. Cuffari also reportedly “declined to pursue investigations into Secret Service during Trump administration,” The Washington Post reported in 2021, and “blocked investigations proposed by career staff … to scrutinize the agency’s handling of the George Floyd protests in Lafayette Square and the spread of the coronavirus in its ranks.” “Hundreds of Secret Service officers were either infected with the coronavirus or had to quarantine after potential exposure … as Trump continued to travel and hold campaign events during the pandemic.” The White House says the report is “concerning, but Politico reports Republicans are circling the wagons around Cuffari. “Firing Cuffari could spark outrage from Capitol Hill Republicans, who have praised him for investigating DHS’s trouble vetting people evacuated from Afghanistan and its inability to monitor all unaccompanied migrant children released from federal custody after traveling to the United States,” Politico reports. “As CIGIE’s investigation into Cuffari has unfolded, congressional Republicans have rallied around him, suggesting he is being targeted as punishment for criticizing the administration. In an occasionally contentious July hearing, House Oversight Republicans pressed the head of CIGIE on how his office handles investigations into inspectors general and raised concerns about the Cuffari probe.” In 2023 Cuffari testified before Congress he had deleted text messages from his government-issued cell phone which he also stated he did not use for personal reasons. He alleged the texts he deleted were not considered government records. Watch the video below or at this link.

In an unprecedented joint appearance with the former House GOP conference chair in Ripon, Wisconsin — the where the Republican Party was first formed more than 150 years ago — Harris said upholding the US constitution should be a “basic requirement” for seeking and holding the highest office in the United States. And citing Trump’s efforts to block the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election four years ago, she warned that Trump “must never again, stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.” “The tragic truth that we are facing in this election for President of the United States is that there is actually an honest question about whether one of the candidates will uphold the oath to the Constitution of the United States,” she said. “I know the vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land. I know the vast majority of us, regardless of your political party, agree we must hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections to the peaceful transfer of power,” Harris said. “If you share that view, no matter your political party, there is a place for you with us and in this campaign, because those principles I know unite us across party lines, and in this election, I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans,” she added. Harris promised that as president, she would not “not look at our country through the narrow lens of ideology or petty partisanship or self interest,” nor would she view America as “an instrument for [her] own ambitions” or “some spoil to be won.” “The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised, the nation that inspired the world to believe in the possibilities of a representative government. And so in the face of those who would endanger our magnificent experiment, people of every party must stand together,” she said. Harris took the stage to the strains of Beyonce’s “Freedom” after a rousing introduction from Cheney, the daughter of a Republican vice president and a lifelong member of the GOP. Cheney, who recalled how she’d first voted for a Republican presidential candidate when she cast a ballot for Ronald Reagan in the 1984 election, told the crowd in Ripon that this year, she is “proudly casting [her] vote” for Harris because the Democratic vice president is “standing in the breach at a critical moment in our nation’s history” and “working to unite reasonable people from all across the political spectrum.” “Vice President Harris has dedicated her life to public service. I know, I know that she loves our country, and I know that she will be a president for all Americans, as a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause,” she said. The former Wyoming congresswoman, who served as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the January 6 attack of the Capitol that Trump fomented after he lost the 2020 election, said the American republic “faces a threat unlike any we have faced before” in the GOP’s presidential candidate, “a former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our Republic, by refusing to accept the lawful results —confirmed by dozens of courts — of the 2020 election.” “We cannot turn away from this truth in this election,” she said. “Putting patriotism ahead partisanship is not an aspiration — is our duty.” Cheney added that the “peaceful transfer of power” that Trump attempted to subvert is “at the very heart of our survival as a republic.” “Donald Trump was willing to sacrifice our capitol to allow law enforcement officers to be beaten and brutalized in his name and to violate the law and the Constitution in order to seize power for himself. I don’t care if you are a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent, that is depravity, and we must never become numb to it,” she said. “Any person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again.” Continuing, she said of the former president: “He is petty, he is vindictive, and he is cruel, and ... is not fit to lead this good and great nation. The joint appearance by Harris and Cheney is the latest expression of the Harris-Walz campaign’s effort to rally Republicans and republican-leaning voters who’ve become disillusioned with the direction of the Party of Lincoln in the age of Donald Trump. The campaign has been organizing a formal “Republicans for Harris” effort for months, and has thus far been successful at organizing high-profile endorsements for the vice president from members of the GOP. Not one of the living former Republican vice presidents has endorsed Trump’s re-election bid, and Cheney’s own father — former vice president Dick Cheney — has formally endorsed Harris, calling Trump the greatest threat the American republic has faced from any individual. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,” he said. Other former Republican elected officials who have endorsed Harris include former Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, who served with Liz Cheney on the House January 6 committee, and former Republican senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. But the ranks of former GOP diehards who’ve thrown support behind Harris goes beyond former elected officials. In September, more than 200 former staffers for Republican presidential candidates — including former presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush, Utah Senator Mitt Romney and the late Arizona Senator John McCain — issued an open letter calling on “moderate Republicans and conservative independents” to join them in backing the Democratic candidate against Trump, calling the ex-president’s potential return to the White House “simply untenable.” Numerous officials who served in the Trump administration have endorsed Harris or have declined to endorse Trump’s third bid for the presidency on the grounds that he is unfit to serve because of his disregard for the US constitution. At the only debate between Trump and Harris in September, two top Trump White House officials — ex-communications director Anthony Scaramucci and former vice presidential homeland security adviser Olivia Troye served as surrogates for the vice president.","summary":"Cheney is one of the hundreds of prominent Republicans who are backing Harris over Donald Trump this year","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-wisconsin-cheney-endorsement-b2623595.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/04/00/AP24277827554843.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:08:18","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.313},{"id":258396692,"title":"What we learned from Jack Smith's new filing in Trump 2020 case","text":"What we learned from Jack Smith's new filing in Trump 2020 case Special counsel Jack Smith's recently unsealed filing reveals new details about former President Donald Trump's alleged criminal scheme to stay in power after losing the 2020 election.

Matthew Olsen, head of the department's National Security Division, said in an interview with CBS News that the U.S. is facing a multi-pronged offensive from the three nations. Among the lines of attack is a barrage of propaganda from Russia to sow division in a highly polarized U.S. electorate, persistent cyber-intrusions into the campaigns of both former President Donald Trump and Vice president Kamala Harris, and a \"grave\" Iranian assassination plot targeting Trump. \"They see this as a period of vulnerability for us,\" Olsen told CBS Evening News Anchor and Managing Editor Norah O'Donnell. \"They are looking at ways at which they can change the outcome of our election, or to find issues that divide us in ways that support their national interests at the expense of ours.\"Olsen's comments are expected to be the Justice Department's last word on the subject of election interference, honoring a policy of refraining from public statements in the 30 days before an election to avoid influencing the outcome. In a wide-ranging interview, he characterized the threats as \"sophisticated,\" utilizing advanced technology \"to target our politics.\" In Russia, he says malicious actors are leveraging artificial intelligence to manufacture content, such as fake videos of the vice president meant to spread disinformation. Moreover, he said, Moscow has upped its game in another way –laundering Kremlin talking points through U.S.-based social media influencers who have large online followings.Olsen described a brazen effort by Russia to help Trump win the election. \"What we're seeing with Russia is clearly a preferred outcome,\" Olsen said. \"Russia has been seeking to boost the candidacy of the former president and to denigrate the candidacy of the vice president.\"Contrary to messaging from the Trump campaign, which has consistently disputed reports of Kremlin interference, Olsen said the Russian initiative was real in 2016, and is even more robust now.\"Russian interference in the [2016] election was not a hoax. It was actually happening then. It is actually happening now,\" Olsen said. \"There is no question about it.\" Olsen said the intelligence and law enforcement communities learned a lesson from 2016, when officials were highly protective of the intelligence indicating the Russians were aggressively meddling in the election. This cycle they made a conscious decision to be far more transparent with the public. \"We've learned at the Justice Department, but this especially true for the intelligence community, and that is to be as open and transparent as we possibly can about the nature of the threat,\" Olsen said. In September, the Justice Department seized 32 internet domains they say Russia used as part of their \"doppelganger\" online campaigns aimed at influencing elections worldwide, including the upcoming presidential election here in the U.S. Olsen pointed to the case as an example of ways the department is working to \"dismantle the infrastructure\" of Russia's propaganda operation. The seizure targeted Russian entities, including the Social Design Agency (SDA), which since 2022 has allegedly been responsible for coming up with the propaganda strategy that included impersonating legitimate news entities, like Fox News or the Washington Post.\"They created these fake websites. They look very real,\" Olsen said. \"It is hard for the average American to understand the sophistication of these efforts. But that's why we're trying to be as transparent as possible about the nature of the threat.\"Olsen pointed to a specific case brought by the Justice Department where they uncovered \"talking points\" of people \"at the highest level of the Kremlin, people within [Vladimir Putin's] inner circle\" who have stated their goal of Trump prevailing. Olsen said that in addition to its goal of bolstering Trump's campaign, Russia is closely focused on sowing division among American voters on hot-button issues. Chief among them is the war in Ukraine, where Moscow is intent on diminishing popular support among Americans for Ukrainian independence. But Olsen said that the Russians also see domestic issues as ripe targets for its disinformation campaign. He pointed to immigration, one of the most contentious policy fights in the 2024 election. The Russians, he said, are \"highlighting immigration as a wedge issue.\" Russia is not the only country looking to \"sow discord\" ahead of the election. Among the Justice Department's biggest worries, according to Olsen, is credible evidence that Iran wants to \"compromise\" Trump's campaign and is actively plotting to assassinate Trump, something that he says they are monitoring \"with intense focus.\"\"Among the countries in the world, there are few countries that pose the range and significance of threats that Iran does,\" Olsen said, noting that this effort is related to the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by an American airstrike in 2020. \"They are determined to retaliate for Soleimani's killing. And they have targeted U.S. officials who they believe are responsible for that decision.\"In the past few months there were two attempts on former President Trump's life, and in a separate case, a Pakistani national with ties to Iran was charged with allegedly plotting a murder-for-hire scheme targeting current and former U.S. officials –a list that sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News may have included Trump. Olsen declined to comment about whether the government's case against Ryan Wesley Routh, who has been charged with attempting to assassinate the former president at his Florida golf course in September, has any ties to a foreign government, citing the ongoing nature of the case. Routh has pled not guilty. Last month, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence briefed Trump on \"real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him.\"As for China, while the volume of activity is less than that coming out of Iran and Russia, their interest in the upcoming election seems more focused on congressional and state office campaigns, where they aim to find candidates who may fall \"more in line with the interests of China,\" rather than the presidential race.Olsen said he hasn't seen any foreign efforts to manipulate voting machines or other election infrastructure. But one of his biggest worries is what happens in the aftermath of the election, particularly given the likely delays in determining the vote results. \"I do think that our adversaries will continue to see this time period as an opportunity for them to shape the outcome of the election or to sow discord within the country,\" Olsen said, warning, \"that is really the biggest issue that I see right now.\"","summary":"In an interview with CBS News, the head of the Department of Justice's National Security Division said the U.S. is facing a multi-pronged offensive from Russia, Iran and China.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-official-warns-foreign-election-interference-russia-iran-china/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/03/569f5658-7026-4bf3-90b1-90dc62fe918a/thumbnail/1200x630/9750c87ee8cd2086254930096eb5a192/ap24079677785156.jpg?v=0736ad3ef1e9ddfe1218648fe91d6c9b","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:02:14","author":"Clare Hymes,Daniel Klaidman,Michael Kaplan","authors":["Clare Hymes","Daniel Klaidman","Michael Kaplan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":258396924,"title":"Garth Brooks accused of rape in lawsuit from hair-and-makeup artist","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Most Canadians support expansion of Old Age Security benefits: Nanos survey Amid new polling indicating most Canadians support boosting Old Age Security (OAS) benefits by 10 per cent for seniors aged 65 to 74, a former Liberal finance minister and former Bank of Canada governor are warning the government not to pursue the policy change.

Tina Peters was convicted by a jury in August and will serve her sentence first in the Mesa County Jail and then in the Colorado Department of Corrections. “I'm convinced you would do it all over again if you could,” 21st Judicial District Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters during sentencing. “You’re as defiant a defendant as this court has seen.” The judge denied Peters’ request for probation or community correction. \"Prison is the only place that duly meets the purposes of sentence in this matter,\" the judge said. Barrett also called Peters a “charlatan” who used her position “to peddle snake oil,” according to NBC News. During her sentencing hearing, Peters lamented she was “very taken aback by how awful I've been depicted,” said she was a “child of God,” and argued that she would not be able to get the right kind of magnetic mattress at the Department of Corrections if imprisoned there. Peters was found guilty of using her position to breach security and tamper with election equipment at the Mesa County Clerk and Recorder's office in May 2021. Prosecutors said she was hoping to collect evidence that Donald Trump had won the 2020 presidential election. The state opened an investigation into the potential tampering in August 2021, after images of files and copies of election equipment hard drives appeared on election conspiracy websites. Not long after, Secretary of State Jena Griswold ordered the county to replace 41 pieces of compromised election equipment. In May 2021, Peters reportedly stole freelance software engineer Gerald Wood’s identity in order to create a security access card. She then told her deputy clerk, Belinda Knisley, to turn off security cameras trained on the room that was breached. The day before the election equipment was due for a software upgrade, Peters, along with someone connected to MyPillow CEO and Trump loyalist Mike Lindell, went into the secure room and copied files from the equipment. Both Knisley and Wood cut plea deals with prosecutors in return for their testimony against Peters. Peters was a darling of election denier circles following the 2020 election. She ran for secretary of state while being investigated for her crimes—and accused her own party of rigging the election against her when she lost. A Mesa County commissioner said Peters’ actions cost taxpayers $1.4 million and necessitated several recounts, according to Colorado Public Radio. Peters was facing up to 20 years in prison and kicked up a really big fuss when she was first arrested in 2022. Good riddance to bad rubbish.","summary":"Mesa County, Colorado’s former clerk and recorder was sentenced to nine years in prison on Thursday for orchestrating a security breach in the wake of the 2020 election.

Currently, we have statewide rent control. A majority of the large cities, like San Jose, have stricter rent controls.

I can only imagine how much that $104 million could have helped AIDS victims. This $104 million is primarily from a federal pharmacy program designed to help nonprofits stretch their money further to provide more health care services.

As a big-city mayor who has led other mayors to tackle common problems, Sam understands the need to think on a higher level. His experience lobbying in Washington proves he has the vision and capability to represent us effectively in Congress.

Rob Rennie Los Gatos Voting for Trump is voting against vets Twice a year, on Memorial Day and Veterans Day, Americans profess gratitude to their veterans and the fallen. The rest of the year … Six times a Vietnam War draft dodger has run for president (Bill Clinton twice, George W. Bush twice, Donald Trump twice) and five times has been elected. Two of these “victories” were over Vietnam veterans (Al Gore and John Kerry). Trump is running again for president. Trump considers all veterans, not just the fallen, to be “losers” and “suckers.” He mocks Gold Star mothers, disrespects POWs, desecrates the hallowed ground at Arlington, and doesn’t want to be seen with the disabled. And Trump may win election this year. America once again will show how it really feels about veterans.

At the time of our founding the state of New York’s much larger population would have elected every president.

The guy’s politics were unclear — he was also yelling something about Israel — but it was an indication that Donald Trump’s latest lie has gone viral. In case you missed it, Trump has been trying to exploit the natural disaster for political gain, claiming he heard that the federal government — Biden — and North Carolina’s Democratic governor are “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.” This claim has no basis: Major rescue and recovery operations are underway, and several governors of the affected states — including Republicans — have praised federal efforts. Trump said that Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, was “having a hard time getting the president on the phone.” On the contrary, Kemp said that Biden told him “that if there’s other things we need, just to call him directly — which, I appreciate that.” But then, at this point, Trump’s campaign rests heavily on made-up stuff. And he clearly seems to believe that he needs new material, because the old material seems to be losing some of its effectiveness. Before I get into the disaster relief issue, let me note that Trump has been a true innovator in political dishonesty. Lots of politicians have misrepresented their personal histories or the content of their policy proposals — Trump does that, too. But he has also constructed a whole dystopian fantasy world, trying to persuade voters that America is a nation with a collapsing economy overrun by violent immigrants.","summary":"His usual trash-talking is losing its mojo.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/opinion/trump-biden-hurricane-helene.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/03/multimedia/03krugman1-kvhw/03krugman1-kvhw-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 23:00:08","author":"Paul Krugman","authors":["Paul Krugman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":258395626,"title":"Trump reviewed OC voter data before approving California disaster aid in 2018, former official says","text":"For California, the 2018 wildfire season marked the “deadliest and most destructive” one on record, fire officials say. But then-President Donald Trump reportedly nearly declined to approve federal aid because of the state’s political makeup. Trump changed his mind, however, after he was shown voter registration data from Orange County where Republicans then had an edge over Democrats, Politico reported. In a phone call Thursday, Mark Harvey, who served as a special assistant to the president for matters related to domestic crisis at the time, confirmed to the Southern California News Group the exchange reported by Politico. The former National Security Council employee is among the more than 100 former Republican national security officials who have backed Vice President Kamala Harris in this election. In all, nearly 2 million acres burned in California in 2018 and 100 people died, according to Cal Fire. While Northern California was impacted the most, Southern California was hit with the Holy fire in August of that year, burning more than 23,000 acres in Orange and Riverside counties and destroying homes and cabins. “We went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas … to show him these are people who voted for you,” Harvey told Politico. In October 2018, 541,665 people (34.72%) in Orange County were registered Republican voters, 523,624 (33.56%) were registered Democrats and 429,675 (27.54%) were no party preference. Statewide, however, nearly 8.6 million (43.45%) registered voters in 2018 were Democrats, 5.4 million (27.52%) no party preference and 4.7 million (24.04%) were Republicans. As of Sept. 6, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in Orange County, 37.03% to 33.99%, with 22.77% of voters registered as no party preference. Southern California, and Orange County particularly, is home to multiple tight congressional races this year that will determine which political party controls the House in 2025. A campaign spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Trump has been highly critical of California and its handling of wildfires in 2018. “I think California ought to get their act together and clean up their forests and manage their forests because it’s disgraceful,” Trump said during an August 2018 Cabinet meeting. “So I say to the governor or whoever is going to be the governor of California: You better get your act together,” Trump said. “Because California, we’re just not going to continue to pay the kind of money that we’re paying because of fires that should never be to the extent …” The Washington Post in 2018 reported that the then-president’s response to disasters was “colored in red and blue,” comparing his trips to the Gulf Coast and North Carolina after hurricanes to his criticism of California post wildfires. The report noted that Trump took to social media to criticize what he called California’s “gross mismanagement of the forests,” only acknowledging the victims 14 hours later. After initially angering California officials with his social media response to the fires, Trump ultimately approved an expedited disaster declaration request. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Irvine, called the report about Trump’s initial leanings on disaster relief for California “abhorrent.” “When Orange County needed help, Donald Trump left us to fend for ourselves,” Porter said on X, formerly Twitter. “Our leaders should look out for every person they represent, not just the people who voted for them.” In recent days, Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration, including Harris, for its handling of the destruction in the southeast caused by Hurricane Helene. He has said, without evidence, that the Biden administration and Democratic officials were not helping people in Republican areas. At a rally in Michigan on Thursday, he claimed that the administration had no money to deal with the disaster because it had spent too much on migrants. President Joe Biden and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, lambasted Trump on Thursday. “You can’t only help those in need if they voted for you,” Biden said on X. “It’s the most basic part of being president, and this guy knows nothing about it.” “A glimpse into the future if we elect (Trump),” said an X post from Newsom. Last month, Trump was critical of both the state and federal governments for their handling of the reactivation of an ancient landslide complex on the Palos Verdes Penninsula. Speaking to reporters from his golf course on the cliffs of Ranchos Palos Verdes, Trump said officials were “missing in action” and called California a “mess.”","summary":"The former official, who now supports Vice President Kamala Harris, says Trump changed his mind about aid when he saw the numbers.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/10/03/trump-reviewed-oc-voter-data-before-approving-california-disaster-aid-in-2018-former-official-says/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OCR-L-TRUMPOC-1004.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:59:43","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":258395562,"title":"Iran Braces for Israeli Attack That Could Change the Middle East Forever","text":"After carrying out an explosive act of vengeance against Israel, Iran is preparing for the country to strike back in another dangerous round of escalation that has the potential to push the Middle East into an all-out war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Iran would \"pay\" after the Islamic Republic fired up to 200 missiles against its longtime foe in response to the assassination of Hamas's chief in Tehran, the killing of the leader of Hezbollah and a senior Iranian military official in Beirut and other Israel-linked actions across the Middle East.The tensions are the latest to rattle the region, already in crisis over ongoing wars pitting Israel against Hamas in Gaza and against Hezbollah in Lebanon.As experts and former Israeli and United States officials recently told Newsweek, Israel's options include striking Iranian military infrastructure, oil facilities and nuclear sites, as well as potentially going after high-level individuals. However, as Iranian officials declared the latest bout over, they also issued warnings of even more intensive measures should Israel pursue further action.Tehran-based security analyst Alireza Taghavinia argued that the length to which Iran goes is likely to depend on the nature and extent of Israel's attack, but, in any case, could have vast consequences.\"I know that Iranian officials have decided to deal with Israel seriously in case of any attack on Iran,\" Taghavinia told Newsweek, \"because Iran will not tolerate any attack on its territory, even a symbolic attack.\"\"Any attack on Iran's territory will strengthen the position of those who want to change Iran's nuclear doctrine and build nuclear weapons,\" he said. \"And making nuclear weapons is technically possible for Iran and depends only on Ayatollah Khamenei's political decision.\"Nuclear OptionsAyatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's longtime supreme leader, has for decades officially banned the production of nuclear weapons. But Israel, which possesses its own semisecret nuclear arsenal, has long accused the country of also clandestinely pursuing weapons of mass destruction.Iran has openly accelerated its enrichment of uranium and adopted other nuclear-related measures since then-President Donald Trump's administration abandoned the multilateral Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal in 2019 and reimposed sanctions against Tehran. As negotiations toward a restoration of the agreement failed, President Joe Biden's administration has said all options were on the table to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Israeli officials have also previously called for preemptive joint strikes with the U.S. against Iran's nuclear program. But responding to a reporter's question on Wednesday, Biden said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in response to the Iranian missile strike the day before.Such an operation could prove seriously challenging without the aid of Washington, as Taghavinia pointed out.\"I believe that if Israel does this, it will not be successful because Iran's nuclear facilities are under the mountains, and Israel cannot damage these facilities,\" Taghavinia said. \"Another point is that Israel cannot attack Iran's nuclear facilities with long-range weapons, and its planes must enter Iran's territory about a thousand kilometers away.\"\"This operation has a high risk,\" he added, \"and there is a possibility of losing a large number of Israeli fighters and Israeli pilots will be captured by Iran.\"Such an operation would also be especially influential in promoting already growing calls \"to change Iran's nuclear doctrine, and Iran will be determined in this regard for its survival and security.\"Amir Hossein Vazirian, also a Tehran-based analyst, agreed that Iran's nuclear facilities would be \"difficult to hit\" due to their heavily fortified, underground and decentralized nature. This contrasts substantially, he pointed out, with the reactor sites destroyed by Israeli strikes in Iraq and Syria in 1981 and 2007, respectively.But Israel has had a history of success in striking Iran's nuclear program in other ways. The assassinations of nuclear scientists and various acts of sabotage, from cyberattacks to explosions, have been widely attributed to Israel's Mossad overseas intelligence agency, which has been deployed substantially since the outbreak of the war in Gaza one year ago.\"Israel may decide to sabotage Iran's nuclear sites, as in previous times,\" Vazirian told Newsweek, \"and it's important to note that in any such situation, Iran will accelerate nuclear activities.\"Israel's extensive espionage prowess raised another wildcard. If Israel sought to direct its covert operations toward assassinating senior political or military officials, Vazirian said, \"Iran's reaction is unpredictable.\"'The Battle of Infrastructure'Iran's nuclear sector is just one of several kinds of targets being considered by Israeli decision-makers.Another option would be to strike Iran's vast arsenal of missiles. Here, too, however, the operation would be complicated by Iran's strategy of hiding some of its most valuable assets in sprawling subterranean complexes sometimes referred to as \"missile cities.\"Yet a number of military bases, air defense systems, radar arrays and other sites remain relatively exposed. Should Israel seek to pursue strikes against military positions, Vazirian argued that Iran's follow-up response might be to answer in kind with another, potentially more intensive round of missile strikes against its archfoe.However, Iran's energy sector is even more potentially vulnerable, including refineries, power plants and other facilities critical to Iran's economic well-being. If Israel strikes here, Vazirian said, \"We enter a new phase of war, the battle of infrastructure.\"\"If Israel attacked Iran's infrastructure, especially Iran's economic infrastructure, Iran can damage gas platforms in the Mediterranean region,\" Vazirian said, \"and Iran can attack Israeli military industries like Rafael, Israeli power stations, Israeli warehouses of oil and gasoline in Haifa, and especially I can refer to Haifa and Ashdod oil refineries.\"The situation could especially escalate if the U.S. participates in the Israeli strike. In this case, Vazirian said Iran, backed by its network of non-state allies, \"may decide to attack American interests in the Middle East,\" including U.S. military installations in Iraq and Syria and even disrupt the global oil and gas flow through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, where the crucial Strait of Hormuz and Bab el-Mandab chokepoints lie, respectively.Already, factions of the Iran-aligned Axis of Resistance, including Yemen's Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthi movement, and the militia coalition known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq have intensified actions against Israel and threatened to strike U.S. positions as well if war escalates.In a statement shared with Newsweek, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations said Tehran's response to any new Israeli attacks \"will be solely directed at the aggressor.\"But \"should any country render assistance to the aggressor, it shall likewise be deemed an accomplice and a legitimate target,\" the Iranian Mission added. \"We advise countries to refrain from entangling themselves in the conflict between the Israeli regime and Iran.\"As for channels to Washington, the Iranian Mission also noted that \"acting as the U.S. Interests Section, the Swiss Embassy in Tehran serves as the sole official communication channel for Iran.\"Newsweek reached out to the Israel Defense Forces and the White House for comment.Taghavinia said that Israel alone \"can undoubtedly damage Iran's oil and refinery facilities\" if it chose to target such sites given their exposed nature. But, he also said, \"This action of Israel causes Iran to attack Israel's oil, gas and refinery facilities such as the Haifa refinery.\"Should the war expand, he said, \"Iran can easily destroy all the main oil and energy facilities of Israel and in addition attack the oil facilities of Azerbaijan, the UAE and Saudi Arabia and prevent the export of oil in the Persian Gulf.\"At the same time, he noted that \"of course, the attack will not include the countries of Kuwait and Qatar.\"\"Therefore,\" Taghavinia added, \"Netanyahu must understand that any attack on Iran's energy and oil facilities will cause substantial damage and destruction to the oil facilities of Israel and its allies.\"Taghavinia felt the most likely target for Israel would be military sites in Iran, to which the Islamic Republic would respond in a manner that \"destroys the industrial and commercial infrastructure of Israel.\"\"Iran's recent missile attack showed that Israel does not have the ability to deal with Iran's hypersonic and advanced missiles,\" he said.A 'Dangerous Moment'Israeli and U.S. officials have downplayed the impact of the latest Iranian salvo against Israel, which said military operations were uninterrupted. While the full extent of the damage has yet to be released, at least some air bases appeared to have been hit, and the destruction appeared to outweigh Iran's previous round of strikes conducted in April over the killing of senior Iranian military officials at a diplomatic site in Syria.Mostafa Najafi, an Iranian researcher who specializes in Middle East conflicts and Iranian foreign policy, recently told Newsweek that while \"the Islamic Republic of Iran has also prepared all its defense capabilities\" to tackle the impending Israeli threat, the recent Iranian strike proved that \"no country's air defense is perfect.\"He argued that \"Iran is ready to defend its security, and in recent months, it has put its defense capabilities into action, and Israel will not have an easy time getting past Iran's defenses.\"Having \"left the policy of patience and restraint,\" he said, Iran \"will give a tougher and more immediate response to any Israeli action against its interests.\"\"This is a historic and, at the same time, dangerous moment for the Middle East,\" Najafi said. \"It is a strategic imperative for the U.S. to restrain Israel with the pressure levers it has; Netanyahu wants to start a war in the Middle East at the expense of the United States and involve Washington in a devastating war in the region.\"\"Iran is neither Iraq nor Afghanistan,\" he added. \"Going to war with Iran will destroy the economy and security of the world.\"Taghavinia and Vazirian were skeptical that the U.S. would get directly involved in the strikes, particularly due to the sensitive political climate amid a tight presidential race.With the election looming in November, Michael DiMino, a former CIA analyst now serving as a fellow and public policy manager at Defense Priorities, said Israel was \"pushing to change the facts on the ground as much as they can\" during a virtual discussion hosted by his think tank.\"And I think similarly, the Iranians are going to try to hold back,\" he added, \"maybe in the hopes that the Harris administration is more willing to back to something that looks like the JCPOA or something similar.\"Responding to Newsweek's question regarding the limits of Iran's strategic calculus, DiMino said, \"Everybody's got a line,\" and that line \"could be a serious attack on their nuclear infrastructure.\"","summary":"\"Iran will not tolerate any attack on its territory, even a symbolic attack,\" a Tehran-based analyst told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/iran-braces-israel-attack-1963617","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2487202/iran-military-parade-missile.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:59:18","author":"Tom O'connor","authors":["Tom O'connor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":258396070,"title":"Harris eyes Republican voters in Wisconsin with Liz Cheney event","text":"Harris eyes Republican voters in Wisconsin with Liz Cheney event Former President Donald Trump rallied in Michigan a day after a judge unsealed a court filing that gives insight into the federal election interference case against him.

Over 45,000 port workers, who cover 36 ports along the East and Gulf coasts, began their strike on Tuesday. The ports covered by the strikers are responsible for significant parts of the United States supply chain, leading to fears of a supply chain nightmare before the holidays. If it had continued, the strike would have threatened to raise prices on bananas, toys, seafood, cars, chocolate, and alcohol, among other products. The strike was over disagreements in pay and automation. In a rare moment of unity, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump all came out in support of the workers. “This strike is about fairness,” Harris said Tuesday. “Foreign-owned shipping companies have made record profits and executive compensation has grown. The Longshoremen, who play a vital role transporting essential goods across America, deserve a fair share of these record profits.” “American workers should be able to negotiate for better wages, especially since the shipping companies are mostly foreign flag vessels, including the largest consortium ONE,” Trump said. The strike was met with criticism from many, however, due to the inevitable inflation that would result, as well as shortages. Some criticized the timing as coming after the devastating Hurricane Helene, worrying it could impede rescue efforts.","summary":"The International Longshoremen’s Association has announced the end of its port strike.

In the 28-second video, Trump said, “Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard. Without a doubt there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth.” “Individual freedom. What does my body my choice really mean?” she added. The video comes a day after The Guardian reported that the former first lady defends abortion rights in her new memoir, scheduled for release on Oct. 8. NBC News has not independently verified The Guardian’s report, which said that Trump wrote: “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.” “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life,” she continued, according to the report. Former President Donald Trump was asked about his wife’s comments on abortion during an interview with Fox News on Thursday. “We spoke about it, and I said, ‘You have to write what you believe. I’m not going to tell you what to do. You have to write what you believe,'” he said. “She’s very beloved. People love our former first lady, I can tell you that, but I said, ‘You have to stick with your heart.’ I’ve said that to everybody, ‘You have to go with your heart.'” When reached for comment about the former first lady’s views on abortion, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung pointed to Donald Trump’s remarks in the Fox News interview. The former president has repeatedly touted his role in ending nationwide protections for abortion, saying that he “was able to kill Roe v. Wade.” “My view is, now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” he said in April. Earlier this week, Trump said that he would not sign into law a measure banning abortion nationwide if such legislation were to reach his desk as president. Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement earlier Thursday that “sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump’s husband firmly disagrees with her.” Chitika pointed to Trump’s presidency leading to abortion restrictions and bans across many states. Harris has made reproductive care and abortion access a centerpiece of her campaign. The comments from Melania Trump, who has been largely absent on the 2024 campaign trail, sparked criticism from the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life, which said in a post that “much of what she’s saying is simply not correct.” The group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, reposted the statement, adding, “The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.” The former first lady’s new position also prompted backlash from reproductive rights groups, who pointed to the Republican presidential nominee’s record on abortion. “This is just the latest example of politicians — or the politically-adjacent — shifting their position in rhetoric but not in action,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement Thursday. “As president, he made it his mission to get Roe v. Wade overturned. Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue,” she continued. “Read between the lines.” Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, told NBC News that Melania Trump seemingly coming out in favor of abortion rights angered her because her statements could confuse voters who are not fully informed about the abortion rights fight. “If the Trump campaign was actually strategic, I would guess that this could actually help confuse under-informed voters and maybe give permission to soft Republican women who are conflicted because of abortion to hold their nose and vote for Trump,” she said. “Trump’s record is very clear. He overturned Roe. The contrast with VP Harris is clear. She’s been a champion of reproductive freedom her whole career.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump posted a video to X on Thursday,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Melania Trump shows backing for abortion rights just a month ahead of the election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/melania-trump-shows-backing-for-abortion-rights-just-a-month-ahead-of-the-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Melania-Trump-indicates-support-for-abortion-rights.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:54:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":258395508,"title":"Trump refuses to release medical records as concerns about him being the oldest possible president grow","text":"Since Donald Trump first emerged on the scene of American politics in 2015, he has refused to provide a glimpse into his medical records. If Trump, 78, succeeds in November, he will become the oldest person ever to serve as president, ousting the current record-holder, Joe Biden. When his potential second term ends, he will be 82 years old. Despite his advanced age, Trump has refused to provide any glimpse into his records. When asked about his health in 2015, he provided a four-paragraph letter from his doctor, who claimed he would be the “healthiest person ever elected to the presidency.” Age has already played a major role in the 2024 presidential election; concerns over Biden’s cognitive health culminated with his decision to step away from the race, clearing the path for Vice President Kamala Harris to step up to carry the Democratic banner in November. But Biden’s decision came after his party colleagues collectively expressed their concerns over his health; there are few — if any — calls from prominent Republican leaders asking if Trump has the ability to lead as he approaches 80, and it’s unclear if those calls would deter the former president anyway. What little is known of Trump’s health comes from the 2018 White House physician Ronny Jackson. That year, he provided a glimpse into Trump’s cardiac health, the New York Times reports. According to the doctor, Trump’s blood pressure and an ultrasound of his heart were normal, but he noted concerns that his cholesterol was too high and that he was only 0.1 points below the threshold for medical obesity. According to Jackson’s report, Trump’s cholesterol was 143, despite the fact that he was reportedly taking a drug used to lower high cholesterol levels. At 143, cardiologists openly worried that he might be at risk for a stroke or a heart attack. A year after that report, Trump’s weight increased from 239 to 243, making him medically obese based on his height. His cholesterol fell to 122, which was an improvement but still too high to be considered healthy. The following spring the White House claimed Trump’s LDL had fallen to below 100. Last year, Trump’s weight was listed as 215 when he was booked at the Fulton County jail in Atlanta, but that was a number given by his aides, not an official weight taken from a scale. The last official statement on Trump’s health came in a three-paragraph letter from his new personal doctor, Dr Bruce Aronwald. That letter was sent in November 2023, and praised the former president’s weight reduction, but did not actually state his weight or provide any further details about what medications he takes or if he had taken any tests. It simply said that his blood work was “well within normal range,” and that his health was both “excellent” and “exceptional.” Perhaps more troubling that his physical health is his cognitive health. Trump’s father suffered from Alzheimer’s, which can be passed down through genetics. Trump previously claimed he had “aced” cognitive tests and regularly attacked Biden based on his cognitive performance. While Biden was often criticized for his verbal slips, Trump has shown some of the same issues; he has frequently referred to both Hillary Clinton and Biden as the “Obama administration,” and makes frequent mistakes about people and places. At rallies, he frequently speaks in bizarre non-sequiturs to the point that he has come up with a term he uses to describe his ostensibly intentionally disjointed speaking style, calling it “the weave.” “If there’s one area that needs to be 100 per cent in a chief executive — especially chief executive of the United States — it’s cognitive function,” Anand Kumar, a geriatric psychiatry expert at the University of Chicago, told the Times. Trump received a CT scan after a failed assassination attempt in July left him with a wounded ear, but the results of that test were never made public. It’s not just Trump who has been cagey about his health; Harris has not released any of her basic health information, and Biden regularly brushed off concerns about his health while he was still running for president.","summary":"Trump is nearly 80-years-old, loves steak and Big Macs, was hospitalized with Covid-19, and has been shot, but has maintained his health is fine","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-medical-records-doctor-refuse-b2623586.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/03/19/SEI224101864.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/znuemOAP-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-03 22:50:05","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":258397862,"title":"Missouri judge blocks Biden student loan forgiveness that was cleared to proceed","text":"The Biden administration's sweeping student loan forgiveness plan was temporarily blocked again Thursday by a Missouri judge, just one day after a federal judge in Georgia said he would let a restraining order against the relief expire. St-Louis-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp, an appointee of Republican former President Donald Trump, issued the latest preliminary injunction against Biden's relief plan. As a result of the order, the U.S. Department of Education is again barred from forgiving people's student loans until Schelp has a chance to rule on the case. The latest order capped 24 hours during which federal student loan holders were subjected to judicial whiplash, as a lawsuit challenging Biden's aid package, brought by seven GOP-led states, bounced from Georgia to Missouri courts. The states bringing the suit — Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Dakota and Ohio — allege that the U.S. Department of Education's new debt cancellation effort is illegal. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Randal Hall in Georgia found that his state lacked standing to sue against the relief plan, and therefor his court could not be the venue for the case. Hall directed the case to be transferred to Missouri, because the states claim that Biden's plan would most harm student loan servicer Mohela, or the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority. When CNBC broke the news Thursday that the restraining order would lapse, consumer advocates and borrowers hoped that the Biden administration would try to move ahead quickly with its loan forgiveness plan for tens of millions of Americans. The Education Department has already prepared its loan servicers to start reducing and eliminating people's debts. However, Schelp cited this possibility as precisely the reason for delaying the administration while he considered the case. \"Allowing Defendants to eliminate the student loan debt at issue here would prevent this Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court from reviewing this matter on the backend, allowing Defendants' actions to evade review,\" Schelp wrote.

Bruce Springsteen took to social media on Thursday (Oct. 3) to officially announce that in the upcoming presidential election, he will be voting for the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz ticket. “We are shortly coming up on one of the most consequential elections in our nation’s history,” he explains in the video, in which the “Born in the U.S.A.” star is seen at the bar of what appears to be a diner. “Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, emotionally and spiritually divided as it does at this moment. It doesn’t have to be this way. The common values, the shared stories that make this a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again. That will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith and women and men with the national good guiding their hearts.” He continued that what makes America “great” are values that Harris believes in — “freedom, social justice, equal opportunity, the right to be in love with who you want,” he shared, before adding that Donald Trump “is the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Springsteen continued, “His disdain for the sanctity of our Constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity for the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from the office of president ever again. He doesn’t understand the meaning of this country, its history or what it means to be deeply American.” The star concluded by noting that his right to vote is “one of the most precious possessions I have,” and that he respects everyone’s “choices” as a fellow American citizen. Springsteen joins a long list of artists who have also come forward with their support for Harris, including Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Stevie Nicks, Cardi B, Jason Isbell, John Legend, Katy Perry and many more.
