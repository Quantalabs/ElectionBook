When asked by host Lulu Garcia-Navarro about how she felt about commenting on politics today, Lawrence responded: \"I don’t really know if I should. The first Trump administration was so wild and just, how can we let this stand? I felt like I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off. But as we’ve learned, election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for.\" \"So then what am I doing? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart,\" she continued. \"We are so divided.\" JENNIFER LAWRENCE WAS 'AT PEACE' WITH NEVER RETURNING TO HOLLYWOOD AFTER TAKING BREAKS As noted by Garcia-Navarro, Lawrence was an outspoken critic of Trump during his first term, even writing an op-ed after Election Day in 2016 asserting that Trump's victory meant \"the only people that feel safe [in America], that their rights are recognized and respected, are White men.\" Lawrence told the podcast host that she's in a \"complicated recalibration\" when it comes to expressing her political views, noting that she's an artist and doesn't want to alienate her audience. \"With this temperature and the way things can turn out, I don’t want to start turning people off to films and to art that could change consciousness or change the world because they don’t like my political opinions,\" the actress said. \"I want to protect my craft so that you can still get lost in what I’m doing. And if I can’t say something that’s going to speak to some kind of peace or lowering the temperature or some sort of solution, I don’t want to be a part of the problem.\" \"You watch these actors’ faces who have had incredible careers and made incredible contributions and then one half of the internet doesn’t want to see their face anymore. I get so upset for those people, and it feels so wrong,\" she added. JOHN RICH SAYS HOLLYWOOD’S PRAISE OF TRUMP PROVES ‘WOKE MONSTER’ IS FADING AS WOODY ALLEN APPLAUDS PRESIDENT While she doesn't plan to explicitly voice her political opinions anymore, Lawrence said she still shares her beliefs through the art she produces. \"I try to express my politics through my work,\" she told Garcia-Navarro. \"A lot of movies coming out from my production company are expressions of the political landscape and that’s how I feel like I can be helpful.\" As noted by Variety, Lawrence's recent projects include films such as \"Bread and Roses,\" which follows three Afghan women through the chaos of the 2021 Taliban offensive, and the abortion documentary \"Zurawski v. Texas.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Looking back on some of the political comments she's made in the past, Lawrence conceded that there were some opinions she regretted sharing.

Ro Khanna, D-Calif., is a \"progressive capitalist,\" but ahead of New York City's highly-anticipated Election Day, the Silicon Valley congressman rallied for self-identified democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. As a broad coalition of Mamdani supporters gathered in Queens' Major Mark Park on Saturday, a socialist and a capitalist – both of Indian descent – found common ground despite the Democratic Party's looming identity crisis. \"My vision is economic patriotism,\" Khanna told Fox News Digital after the rally, explaining that he wants to \"build a broad, FDR-Obama-like coalition\" to overhaul the U.S. economy. \"I think we need to be a broad tent.\" Khanna said he is \"probably one of the few\" Democrats who has campaigned for the Democratic nominee in all three major races of this election cycle, also joining gubernatorial candidates Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., on the campaign trail in their states this year. 'DEMOCRATS ARE NERVOUS' ABOUT POTENTIAL ZOHRAN MAMDANI VICTORY, NEW REPORT WARNS \"If you had asked me when I was growing up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that there would be an Indian-American of Hindu faith representing Silicon Valley introducing an African-born Indian of Muslim faith, who would be the next mayor of New York, I would have told you only in a Mira Nair film, but it's happening,\" Khanna told the crowd, referencing Mamdani's filmmaker mother. CLINTON CAMPAIGN ALUM URGES JEFFRIES, SCHUMER NOT TO 'TAKE THE BAIT,' GET 'BULLIED' INTO MAMDANI ENDORSEMENT Among those rallying in Queens were coalitions of New Yorkers from Afghan, Muslim, Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds, along with local elected officials, including former Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who lost his Democratic primary to a more moderate challenger last year. Speakers during Saturday's rally and canvass launch condemned Islamophobia, after Mamdani last week criticized his competitors in the mayoral race, including Independent candidate former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa and Mayor Erics Adams, who suspended his re-election campaign and endorsed Cuomo for what he claims was \"Islamophobic rhetoric.\" Mamdani asked the New Yorkers gathered to raise their hands if they were ever called a terrorist, if employers \"mangled\" their names or they had been made to feel \"less-than because of who you are.\" \"We are not just saying goodbye to a disgraced former governor on Tuesday, we are saying goodbye to the politics of that disgrace,\" Mamdani said. But just moments prior, a protester disrupted Mamdani's remarks, lambasting the leading mayoral candidate for his refusal to denounce the phrase \"globalize the intifada\" – which is widely considered a call to violence against Jews. Mamdani said he would discourage others from using the phrase but has been reluctant to denounce it. \"You are a communist!\" the protester shouted from the press pen as the crowd booed him while Mamdani continued speaking. \"This is not Cuba! This is not Venezuela!\" the protester, who was wearing a shirt with the Cuban flag, shouted. He was ultimately escorted out of the rally by police officers as he shouted, \"F--- you, Zohran!\" President Donald Trump has labeled Mamdani a \"100% Communist Lunatic\" and \"My little communist\" – a moniker Mamdani has rejected. Mamdani's ambitious campaign agenda includes fast and free buses, city-run grocery stores, and free childcare, which he plans to pay for by raising taxes on corporations and the top 1% of New Yorkers. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was heckled by Mamdani supporters to \"Tax the rich\" during last Sunday's rally, has ruled out a tax hike, despite endorsing Mamdani's mayoral campaign. After Saturday's rally and canvass launch, Khanna told Fox News Digital that Hochul \"should be taxing the billionaires.\" \"What's wrong with having a tax on that wealth so that we can pay for childcare?\" Khanna questioned, explaining that a 10% \"trillionaire tax\" – which he said Elon Musk is angling to be – could pay for universal childcare in the United States. \"I don't understand why she's not for a basic wealth tax,\" Khanna added. Mamdani's mayoral campaign has exposed a divide within the Democratic Party, as New York Democrats were reluctant to endorse his democratic socialist agenda. After months of withholding his support, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries finally endorsed Mamdani last week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has yet to endorse Mamdani with just days left in the race. As the Democratic Party grapples with losses up and down the ballot in 2024, a new report this week urged Democrats to moderate their positions. The report was released on the heels of the trio of self-identified democratic socialists – Mamdani, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. – joining forces to rally more than 10,000 New York City voters at Forest Hills Stadium last Sunday. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP When asked about the value of building a coalition with Mamdani, despite Khanna rejecting socialism and calling himself a \"progressive capitalist,\" he told Fox News Digital that the real challenge is the \"wealth divide.\" \"People can't afford rent,\" Khanna said. \"People can't afford childcare. SNAP is being cut. I represent more wealth than ever before, and I'm saying you can tax billionaires so people can have healthcare and education. We can have a vision of how we're going to create high-paying jobs, not just here in Queens, but in rural America, in factory towns across this nation.\" Fox News Digital's Olivia Palombo contributed to this report.","summary":"New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani&apos;s &quot;tax the rich&quot; platform draws President Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;communist&quot; label as protester disrupts Queens rally with Rep.

Attackers in June invaded a bishop’s village days after he testified before Congress, killing more than twenty people. Other assaults in Plateau and Benue states have left hundreds dead, with survivors describing militants shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" as they burned churches and homes. International watchdog group Open Doors reported nearly 70% of Christians killed for their faith last year were in Nigeria. Groups like Boko Haram, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Fulani militants are blamed for most attacks, often targeting Christian farmers. Rights groups estimate 4,000–8,000 Christian deaths annually. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital 50,000 Christians have been killed and 20,000 Christian schools and churches destroyed in the country since 2009, calling it \"a crisis of religious genocide.\" Mark Walker, Trump’s ambassador-designate for International Religious Freedom, urged stronger U.S. pressure on Nigeria’s government, calling the violence a humanitarian crisis. He also pledged to work with Secretary of State Marco Rubio to strengthen U.S. advocacy. I WAS KIDNAPPED BY BOKO HARAM, AND SURVIVED. NO THANKS TO THE WEST'S SILENCE The White House and global leaders have condemned the violence, warning it could spread across Africa. However, Nigerian officials have denied systematic persecution, calling U.S. reports \"misleading.\" Hours before Trump's threat Saturday, Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu posted a statement on X, noting Nigeria \"stands firmly\" as a democracy governed by constitutional guarantees of religious liberty. \"Since 2023, our administration has maintained an open and active engagement with Christian and Muslim leaders alike and continues to address security challenges which affect citizens across faiths and regions,\" Tinubu wrote in the statement. \"The characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians. Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it,\" he continued. \"Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.

This decision comes as a response to escalating incidents of violence that have unsettled the city in recent weeks.\n\nMayor Bowser announced on the platform X that the curfew targets all individuals under 18, enforcing a restriction from 11 pm to 6 am, lasting until November 5. This directive aims to curb the recent wave of juvenile misconduct posing threats to both participants and the public.\n\nHer statement emphasized the necessity of this measure following weeks marked by unruly behavior among youths. In a release from the mayor’s office, it was clarified that this curfew would be in effect citywide each evening until the following Wednesday.\n\nThis urgent step is a reaction to multiple chaotic gatherings involving young people, notably a significant disruption in the Navy Yard area on Friday night, which officials claim jeopardized public safety.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Chief has been given the authority to designate “special zones” considered high-risk for juvenile disturbances. In these areas, curfew enforcement could begin as early as 6 pm, providing further flexibility to maintain order.\n\nThe Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) has also been authorized to establish ‘special zones’ deemed high-risk for juvenile disorder, where curfew times could begin as early as 6pm.\n\nPolice are also empowered to declare temporary curfew zones if groups of eight or more minors are found gathering in a way that endangers themselves or the public.\n\nThe announcement marks one of the most sweeping youth-control measures implemented in the capital in recent years, highlighting mounting concern among city leaders over juvenile crime, flash mobs, and group violence that have surged.\n\nFive teenagers were arrested following Friday night’s violent clash with the National Guard in Washington DC.\n\nAn officer was injured during the melee after hundreds of youths descended on the city’s famed Navy Yard just after 7.30pm on Halloween, DC Police said. \n\nThe teens were peaceful at first but as the night progressed the, ‘group began engaging in fights and disrupting the flow of traffic, repeatedly ignoring instructions to remain on the sidewalks.’ \n\nDramatic video shot by a nearby resident showed teenagers pursued by police, including the National Guardsmen, running in the park. Screams can be heard in the chaos. \n\nPolice – alongside the National Guard, Capitol Police, Metro Transit Police, and a Federal Task Force – closed down the streets in the area and worked to disperse the group. \n\nBy 11pm, the group had dispersed, and five were arrested.\n\nKaeden Brown, 18, was arrested for allegedly being in possession of a knife. \n\nFour minors, between the ages of 14 and 16, were also arrested on various charges, including public consumption of marijuana, affray, and failing to obey. \n\nAdditional arrests were made by the Metro Transit Police, DC Police said, but it is unclear how many. Daily Mail has reached out for further details.\n\nOne officer was injured in the debacle after he was thrown to the ground. He was treated on the scene by EMS. \n\n‘The behavior displayed last night in the Navy Yard is unacceptable,’ Chief Pamela A. Smith said in a statement. \n\nDC Police are amping up their presence in the city throughout the holiday weekend.\n\nIt comes after President Donald Trump sent the National Guard to the nation’s capital in August.\n\nNational Guard troops are NOW preparing for winter in Washington, DC as leadership acknowledges they could remain through summer 2026.\n\nTrump’s Interim Commanding General of the DC National Guard told officers ‘to plan and prepare for a long-term persistent presence,’ according to emails included in a new court filing.\n\nGeneral Leland Blanchard said in a September 17, 2025 message to generals from other states that he instructed National Guard forces currently in the District to ‘work quickly toward ‘wintering’ our formation.’\n\nWhile the current extension of troop deployment is through November 30, 2025, Blanchard acknowledged in the email that troop presence in the District could span through when ‘America 250 occurs this summer’.\n\nNational Guard are prohibited from directly making arrests, but the Trump administration credits the reduction in crime and the surge in arrests on their presence.\n\nAs of early October, more than 2,000 arrests have been made since the operation began on August 11. Around 1,500 were made by Metro Police Department officials and the rest by federal agent partners with agencies like ICE, CBP, FBI, DEA, ATF and others.\n\nLast month, two teenagers who beat former DOGE staffer ‘Big Balls’ into a bloody pulp were left still roaming the streets after a judge sentenced them to less than one year of probation.\n\nEdward Coristine, 19, was attacked by a gang of youths during an attempted carjacking in Washington, DC at 3am on August 3.\n\nA boy and girl from Hyattsville, Maryland, both 15, pleaded guilty to simple assault. They cannot be named because of their age.\n\nThe boy was sentenced to 12 months’ probation, the girl received a nine-month term.\n\nThe teenagers have been ordered not to contact each other or spend any time in DC, unless for school, job or family obligations. \n\nThe judge said that the purpose of juvenile court was to rehabilitate, not punish offenders.\n\nCoristine, who rose to national prominence for his leadership of Elon Musk’s DOGE team and his bawdy high school nickname, was left bloody and concussed after the attempted carjacking while he was with his girlfriend.\n\nHe was jumped by around ten youths but the others who took part in the assault have not been identified and remain at large. \n\nDays after the attack, Donald Trump deployed the National Guard in the nation’s capital as a response to concerns over raging crime.\n\nHe has since frequently remarked that DC feels much safer, and that politicians have told him that they are now able to go out for dinner with their spouses without fear.\n\n‘It’s like a different place, it’s a different city,’ Trump said earlier this year, adding: ‘Everybody’s safe now.’ \n\nThe President formally federalized DC in a safety and ‘beautification’ effort.\n\nBeyond crime, Trump also hoped to rid the streets of the homeless and clean up the graffiti.\n\nOn August 11, he announced in a news conference from the White House he was invoking the DC Home Rule Act in order to place the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control.\n\nViolent crime declined sharply following the deployment of National Guard, homicides and assaults were down by around 25 percent compared to previous weeks.\n\nTrump has since launched similar crime crackdowns in another Democrat-run cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis and Portland.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAmid a surge of youth-related disturbances, Washington DC&#8217;s Democratic mayor has instituted&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: City Implements Youth Curfew to Curb Juvenile Crime Surge Amid Rising Safety Concerns first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/city-implements-youth-curfew-to-curb-juvenile-crime-surge-amid-rising-safety-concerns/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Crime-ridden-blue-city-slaps-curfew-on-under-18s-after-juvenile-chaos.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 00:38:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.085},{"id":374873996,"title":"Hundreds attend Evanston vigil after feds’ Halloween arrests: ‘This neighborhood was under attack’","text":"After a Halloween disrupted by arrests by federal immigration agents in Evanston, several hundred people packed a community center parking lot for a vigil Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe vigil follows the arrests of five people without legal status in the area on Friday, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Nearby schools were placed on soft lockdown during the operation.\n\n“Twenty-four hours ago, this neighborhood was under attack,” Mayor Daniel Biss said at the vigil. “And Evanston showed up.”\n\nBiss said the Evanston Police Department, because of a new policy, is now investigating the incident. Under the policy the city will investigate federal immigration enforcement activity and take legal action or refer violations of local and state laws to state agencies.\n\nBiss was among local elected officials, including U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, and religious and community leaders who spoke at the vigil.\n\nThe speakers urged the residents to care for immigrant members of the Evanston community and to stand up to federal agents. They also condemned the agents for “terrorizing a progressive sanctuary city,” to the loud boos and shouts of “cowards” from the crowd.\n\n“The only thing you are doing is that you are uplifting and creating community leaders … to stand up to the things that are wrong,” said Evanston City Clerk Stephanie Mendoza, the city’s first-ever Latina elected official. “They are doing the opposite of what they think they are.”\n\nFriday’s arrests were the latest development in an escalating campaign that has gripped the affluent northern suburb in recent weeks. Nearly two dozen people, including some landscapers and day laborers, have been arrested in the area since early October, according to reporting from The Daily Northwestern.\n\nElliott and Robyn Hurtig, both 61, came to Saturday’s vigil with a large Mexican flag on a metal pole. They said they were appalled by Friday’s arrests in their “very peaceful, livable community.”\n\n“To see that atrocity is really frightening and horrifying,” Robyn Hurtig said. “And when we see things like that happen in our neighborhood, we have to take action.”\n\nElliott Hurtig said the family has displayed a variety of flags of “countries [President Donald] Trump has gone after,” including Canada and Ukraine. But he felt that the Latino immigrant community is now in need of the most support.\n\nChristie Kersnar, 58, a recently retired Evanston public school teacher, said she encountered the federal agents’ caravan on Friday and filmed them at a gas station.\n\n“It’s terrible. They are not criminals here. Nobody wants that. We’re a community,” Kersnar said.\n\n“It’s unconstitutional, period,” added Debbie Price, 57, who lives in the area. “It’s creating an immense amount of stress and trauma.”\n\nVideos on social media and shared privately with WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times show federal agents’ presence and brief clashes with protesters in Evanston on Friday.\n\nA video taken from a vehicle near Seward Street and Custer Avenue around 10 a.m. Friday shows a man, who identifies himself as a U.S. Border Patrol agent, leaning into the driver’s side window of a vehicle and telling the woman filming the video, “What you’re doing is interfering.”\n\n“I’m not interfering,” the woman replies, to which the man responds, “I’m telling you, you are.”\n\nThe man then reaches for the woman’s phone and threatens to arrest her before walking away.\n\nHours later, another video shows residents with phones and cameras surrounding federal agents and a vehicle presumed to be transporting detainees. People blow whistles, shout and record as the car drives off.\n\nA video circulating on Reddit, which social media users said was filmed in Evanston on Friday, shows a federal agent kneeling on a handcuffed man’s back and pressing the man’s face into the asphalt.\n\nThe agent then hits the man, pushes his face along the asphalt and grabs his neck as the man screams that he can’t breathe. “I’ll get off you, stop moving,” the agent says before pulling the man up by his collar to his knees.\n\nKersnar and Price said they’ve seen the last video, and they questioned why federal agents are using “such excessive force.”\n\n“If they want to get the criminals, go get the criminals,” Price said. “They are not targeting anybody but a very specific demographic. It’s purely racist.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/01/hundreds-attend-evanston-vigil-after-feds-halloween-arrests-this-neighborhood-was-under-attack","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6564a1e/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2523x1892+0+0/resize/1486x1114!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc0%2F6d%2F71d0b7fa48bcadae6a1e725e3cf8%2Fimg-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 00:36:28","author":"Casey He","authors":["Casey He"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":374873358,"title":"Trump’s Bold Warning: Military Action Looms Over Nigeria Amid Christian Persecution Allegations","text":"On Saturday, President Donald Trump announced that he has instructed the Pentagon to start preparing for possible military intervention in Nigeria.

'And that's how my journey in the United States ended,' Juarez said in a phone interview from Puebla, Mexico.\n\nOfficials at the Department of Homeland Security later conceded that Juarez had been 'removed to Mexico early because he was put on the incorrect transport.' \n\nThe mistake left his wife and four American-born children behind in New York and exposed procedural lapses within an agency under renewed pressure from the Trump administration to speed up deportations.\n\nInternal ICE emails reviewed by The New York Times show officials scrambling to locate Juarez after realizing he had been placed on the wrong flight.\n\nJuarez's case is an example of how the overburdened immigration system, rushing to meet political demands, can tear families apart in minutes. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE's parent agency, initially denied that Juarez had been deported claiming he was simply detained because of a 2022 DUI conviction. Only later did the agency acknowledge its error.\n\nA DHS spokesperson explained how ICE is now arranging Juarez's return to the United States to resume formal deportation proceedings.\n\nJuarez's wife, María Priego, now works double shifts as a maid in Westchester County, New York, trying to support their four children alone. \n\n'We're sad and devastated for what my husband has gone through,' she said. 'We depended a lot on him and are waiting for any good news from our lawyer.' \n\nTheir eldest son, 20, serves in the US Marine Corps. Their younger children, ages 10, 12, and 16, were born in America. \n\n'My 10- and 12-year-old children ask me on the phone, 'When are you returning, Papi?' ' Juarez said. 'We can't be without you.'\n\nJuarez worked for more than a decade at Trump National Golf Club Westchester, serving food and tending grounds before being fired in 2019 when the Trump Organization purged undocumented employees amid scrutiny of its hiring practices.\n\nHe continued to build a quiet life in Yorktown, working two jobs, one at a hotel and another maintaining private estates in order to support his family. \n\nBut his 2022 arrest for driving while intoxicated, with two of his children in the car, brought him to ICE's attention. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and received three years' probation.\n\nThat offense, ICE argued, made him a 'public safety threat.' \n\nYet Juarez continued to comply with every scheduled check-in at ICE's Manhattan offices until September 15, when agents suddenly detained him. \n\nHis wife, waiting in their car outside 26 Federal Plaza, had no idea he had been taken away.\n\nJuarez's attorney, Aníbal Romero, learned of his client's deportation only when Juarez called him from Mexico five days later.\n\n'I'm in Mexico,' Juarez told him. \n\n'This is unprecedented in my 20 years of practice - an individual being removed without any hearing, leaving even the court and DHS confused,' Romero said.\n\nAt Juarez’s scheduled immigration hearing in New York, Romero told the judge that his client had already been expelled. Even ICE’s lawyer admitted he didn’t know where Juarez was.\n\nThe case has amplified criticism of ICE’s chaotic internal processes under the renewed Trump administration push to accelerate deportations. \n\nSimilar blunders have surfaced before: in one case earlier this year, officials mistakenly deported Kilmar Armando Abrego García to an El Salvadoran prison; in 2022, a man was sent to Guatemala without a final removal order.\n\nThe DHS civil-rights office previously urged ICE to create a process for rectifying wrongful deportations, but advocates say little has changed.\n\nFor now, Juarez remains more than 2,500 miles away in Mexico, banished by bureaucracy and seemingly stuck there after an error ICE has reluctantly admitted.","summary":"A former Trump golf club employee was mistakenly deported to Mexico after ICE agents placed him on the wrong plane and expelled him without a hearing.

President Trump Issues Ultimatum to Nigeria: Stop the Slaughter of Christians or Else\n\nWhen cultural shifts begin to influence politics in a conservative direction, it’s noteworthy—even more so when the source of that shift is unexpected. This situation is a prime example, especially given the dire reports emerging from Nigeria.\n\nIn a surprising twist, Nicki Minaj, a leading figure in the rap industry and a committed Christian, expressed her gratitude on her X account. Early Saturday, she applauded President Trump for his commitment to defending Christians facing genocide in Nigeria.\n\nNicki Minaj, one of the top-selling rap artists over the past decade and a devout Christ-follower, took to her X account early Saturday morning to thank President Trump for standing up and pledging to stop Christians from being persecuted and slaughtered in a genocide in Nigeria. \n\nThe president made the announcement on Friday via his Truth Social account, as my colleague streiff wrote:\n\nPresident Trump announced Friday that he is designating Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” because of the ongoing slaughter of Christians and the government’s unwillingness to take action to prevent it. Using Truth Social for the announcement, President Trump condemned the atrocities.\n\nTrump wrote: \n\n“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a “COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN” — But that is the least of it. When Christians, or any such group, is slaughtered like is happening in Nigeria (3,100 versus 4,476 Worldwide), something must be done! I am asking Congressman Riley Moore, together with Chairman Tom Cole and the House Appropriations Committee, to immediately look into this matter, and report back to me. The United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria, and numerous other Countries. We stand ready, willing, and able to save our Great Christian population around the World!”\n\nSEE: Trump Recognizes Ongoing Christian Genocide in Nigeria, Now What?\n\nHere’s what the singer wrote In a post quoting Pres.

Sometimes her choices and the way she acts is just insane Supporting Donald Trump is crazy,’ a fan tweeted.\n“Millions of families can’t feed their families today due to this government shutdown & Nicki Minaj using her platform to praise Donald Trump. What a weird a** b***h !” another fan wrote.\n\nAs Christians we should use this as an example of taking opportunities where we find them, and to be inspired to continue holding tight to our beliefs and not be shaken by criticism when it matters. \n\nAs streiff added in his piece on Trump’s Friday statement:\n\nThe line in President Trump’s message that caught my eye was “We stand ready, willing, and able to save our Great Christian population around the World!” I don’t know what “ready” and “willing” look like. \n\nNow, we have a much better idea what those words mean.

Some arrived as early as 4 a.m. to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches.Mary Martin, who volunteers at the pantry, also relies on it regularly for food to supplement her SNAP payments. She said she usually splits her roughly $200 a month in SNAP benefits between herself and her two adult sons, one of whom has six children and is especially dependent on the assistance.“If I didn't have the pantry to come to, I don't know how we would make it,” Martin said.“I'm not gonna see my grandkids suffer.”The Department of Agriculture planned to withhold payments to the food program starting Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to make them. However, it was unclear as to when the debit cards that beneficiaries use could be reloaded after the ruling, sparking fear and confusion among many recipients.In an apparent response to President Donald Trump, who said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the government to report back by Monday on how it would fund SNAP accounts.McConnell, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration must either make a full payment by that day or, if it decides to tap $3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday.The delay in SNAP payments, a major piece of the nation's social safety net that serves about 42 million people, has highlighted the financial vulnerabilities that many face. At the Bronx food pantry, the Rev. John Udo-Okon said “people from all walks of life” are seeking help now.“The pantry is no longer for the poor, for the elderly, for the needy. The pantry now is for the whole community, everybody,” Udo-Okon said. “You see, people will drive in their car and come and park and wait to see if they can get food.”In Austell, Georgia, people in hundreds of cars in drive-through lanes picked up nonperishable and perishable bags of food. Must Ministries said it handed out food to about 1,000 people, more than a typical bimonthly food delivery.Families in line said they worried about not getting SNAP benefits in time for Thanksgiving.At a drive-through food giveaway at the Calvary Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, SNAP recipient James Jackson, 74, said he is frustrated that people are being hurt by decisions made in Washington and lawmakers should try harder to understand challenges brought by poverty and food insecurity.“If you’ve never been poor, you don’t know what it is to be poor,” Jackson said. “I hope that it turns around. I hope that people get their SNAP benefits, and I hope we just come together where we can love each other and feed each other and help each other.”While there is typically a long line for Calvary Baptist Church's drive-through events, the Rev. Samuel L. Whitlow said, the walk-in food pantry has seen increased demand recently with roughly 60 additional people showing up this week.And in Norwich, Connecticut, the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry had 10 extra volunteers working Saturday to help a wave of expected newcomers, making sure they felt comfortable and understood the services available. Besides groceries and hot meals, the site was providing pet food, toiletries and blood pressure checks.“They’re embarrassed. They have shame. So you have to deal with that as well,” director Jill Corbin said. “But we do our best to just try to welcome people.”Also Read | Trump Orders Pentagon To Plan Possible Military Strike Against Nigeria Over Persecution Of Christians","summary":"Long lines form at food pantries as SNAP benefits lapse due to US government shutdown, leaving millions without food assistance.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/snap-benefits-cut-off-long-lines-form-at-food-pantries-across-us-amid-government-shutdown","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/snap-benefits-cut-off-long-lines-form-at-food-pantries-across-us-amid-government-shutdown-1762040285598-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 23:38:11","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.052},{"id":374867212,"title":"Washington DC slaps curfew on under-18s after wave of juvenile chaos","text":"The Democratic mayor of Washington DC declared a curfew across Washington, D.C. on Saturday night, effective immediately, in response to a wave of youth-related disturbances and violence that have roiled the city in recent weeks.\n\n'All juveniles under the age of 18 are subject to a curfew from 11pm until 6pm, which will extend through November 5,' Bowser announced in a post on X on Saturday evening.\n\n'This is in response to several weeks of disorderly juvenile behavior which endangered both themselves and others,' Bowser's tweet read. \n\nAccording to a statement from the mayor's office, the curfew applies citywide each night until next Wednesday night.\n\nThe emergency measure follows a string of chaotic youth gatherings, including a large, disorderly crowd in the Navy Yard neighborhood on Friday night, that officials say threatened public safety.\n\nThe Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) has also been authorized to establish 'special zones' deemed high-risk for juvenile disorder, where curfew times could begin as early as 6pm.\n\nPolice are also empowered to declare temporary curfew zones if groups of eight or more minors are found gathering in a way that endangers themselves or the public.\n\nThe announcement marks one of the most sweeping youth-control measures implemented in the capital in recent years, highlighting mounting concern among city leaders over juvenile crime, flash mobs, and group violence that have surged.\n\nFive teenagers were arrested following Friday night's violent clash with the National Guard in Washington DC.\n\nAn officer was injured during the melee after hundreds of youths descended on the city's famed Navy Yard just after 7.30pm on Halloween, DC Police said. \n\nThe teens were peaceful at first but as the night progressed the, 'group began engaging in fights and disrupting the flow of traffic, repeatedly ignoring instructions to remain on the sidewalks.' \n\nDramatic video shot by a nearby resident showed teenagers pursued by police, including the National Guardsmen, running in the park. Screams can be heard in the chaos. \n\nPolice - alongside the National Guard, Capitol Police, Metro Transit Police, and a Federal Task Force - closed down the streets in the area and worked to disperse the group. \n\nBy 11pm, the group had dispersed, and five were arrested.\n\nKaeden Brown, 18, was arrested for allegedly being in possession of a knife. \n\nFour minors, between the ages of 14 and 16, were also arrested on various charges, including public consumption of marijuana, affray, and failing to obey. \n\nAdditional arrests were made by the Metro Transit Police, DC Police said, but it is unclear how many. Daily Mail has reached out for further details.\n\nOne officer was injured in the debacle after he was thrown to the ground. He was treated on the scene by EMS. \n\n'The behavior displayed last night in the Navy Yard is unacceptable,' Chief Pamela A. Smith said in a statement. \n\nDC Police are amping up their presence in the city throughout the holiday weekend.\n\nIt comes after President Donald Trump sent the National Guard to the nation's capital in August.\n\nNational Guard troops are NOW preparing for winter in Washington, DC as leadership acknowledges they could remain through summer 2026.\n\nTrump's Interim Commanding General of the DC National Guard told officers 'to plan and prepare for a long-term persistent presence,' according to emails included in a new court filing.\n\nGeneral Leland Blanchard said in a September 17, 2025 message to generals from other states that he instructed National Guard forces currently in the District to 'work quickly toward 'wintering' our formation.'\n\nWhile the current extension of troop deployment is through November 30, 2025, Blanchard acknowledged in the email that troop presence in the District could span through when 'America 250 occurs this summer'.\n\nNational Guard are prohibited from directly making arrests, but the Trump administration credits the reduction in crime and the surge in arrests on their presence.\n\nAs of early October, more than 2,000 arrests have been made since the operation began on August 11. Around 1,500 were made by Metro Police Department officials and the rest by federal agent partners with agencies like ICE, CBP, FBI, DEA, ATF and others.","summary":"A major US city has just imposed a sweeping overnight curfew for all minors after weeks of chaotic teen violence.

He’s a British prince,’ stammered the 27-year-old mother-of-three. \n\nThe photo, in which Andrew’s arm circles her bare waist in front of a smirking Ghislaine Maxwell, has been reproduced countless times around the world since its revelation by this paper. \n\nIt provided evidence to the FBI of Virginia’s life as a ‘sex slave’ to Epstein and Maxwell, and prompted the criminal investigations that led to his suicide in prison and Maxwell’s 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nBut when King Charles finally took action last week it came too late for Virginia. Her suicide in April is blamed by some relatives on the break-up of her marriage. \n\nBut she told me she was haunted by horrific memories of the years she spent in Epstein and Maxwell’s depraved world, in which she claimed to have had three sexual encounters with Andrew\n\n‘I’ve gone from pain, to hurt, to anger,’ she said as we sipped coffee in her garden. \n\n‘Epstein was a monster. He and Andrew were shameless. They have no remorse, no guilt for anything they have done. Andrew knew how young I was.’\n\nHe has vehemently and repeatedly denied her claims and paid a reported £12 million to settle a lawsuit she filed with no admission of wrongdoing.\n\nHe has claimed that Virginia sucked me into a plot to discredit him and that the photo we published was created by some kind of digital trickery. \n\nHe told Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis: ‘I have absolutely no memory of that photograph. I’m afraid to say that I don’t believe that photograph was taken in the way that has been suggested.’\n\nIn my opinion, it is a ludicrous suggestion, for if it were a hoax, Buckingham Palace failed to contact me to say so. Nor did Virginia seek me out. I found her after spending weeks digging into a lawsuit she’d filed against Epstein under the pseudonym ‘Jane Doe 102’.\n\nI was intrigued because the documents said she had been ‘sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers including royalty’.\n\nThe filing revealed she had been head-hunted by Maxwell from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where she was a $9-an-hour changing room assistant. \n\nThe club employed scores of workers in similar positions, but I accumulated clues.\n\nOne source recalled that her maiden name was Virginia Roberts. I learned she continued to date her high-school sweetheart, Tony Figueroa, even while working for Maxwell. \n\nI located Tony in a small town in Georgia. Epstein had approved of him continuing his relationship with Virginia.\n\nTony said: ‘I would give her rides to his house. I would hang out there, sit by the pool, talk to the chef. Jeffrey treated me like a friend.’ Then the bombshell.\n\nWhen Virginia returned from London, she showed Tony the photo of herself with Andrew.\n\nHe said: ‘She told me Jeffrey was hanging out with Andrew and she had hung out with him. It was supposedly just massages.’\n\nHe said he was sickened because he had come to understand that, in Epstein’s warped circle, ‘massage’ was a euphemism for sex.\n\n‘I tried to get her to stop the trips with Jeffrey but she didn’t. I think she was scared,’ he added.\n\nTony and Virginia had long separated by the time I met him, but he gave me the next lead to Virginia’s whereabouts.\n\nHer father’s name was Sky Roberts. I left a message on his answerphone saying I was investigating Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAnd on February 4, 2011, the email that would change my life – and Andrew’s – landed in my inbox.\n\nVirginia wrote: ‘Hi Sharon, my father, Sky Roberts, informed me of your call and I thought I’d send you my contact details so we can get in touch.’ \n\nHer voice was shaking when she took my call and confirmed that Andrew was the royal in her lawsuit. \n\nShe had fled the trafficking ring and was happily married, but she decided to break her silence because, weeks before I contacted her, she had seen a photo of Epstein strolling with Andrew through New York’s Central Park.\n\nA police probe had revealed the financier paid children in Florida for sex. After a slap-on-the-wrist 2008 jail sentence, Epstein resumed his activities.\n\n‘I’m appalled Andrew is still hanging out with him,’ Virginia said. ‘To me, it’s saying, “We are above the law”.’\n\nAfter our meeting in Australia, I was contacted by a US prosecutor who said she had been tipped off that I had found Virginia. \n\n‘The FBI would like to fly to Sydney to interview her,’ she said. Virginia wept when I passed on the message. Would Epstein have her killed, she asked me, if she cooperated with the FBI?\n\nShe told me that she was terrified of retaliation from a well-known politician who she had been ordered to meet at a cabana on Epstein’s New Mexico ranch. \n\n‘He repeatedly choked me and got aroused when I begged for my life,’ she said. Yet she wanted to do the right thing. She agreed to meet two US federal agents.\n\nMail photographer Michael Thomas and I drove her and her husband to the US Consulate in Sydney.\n\nWe weren’t allowed to accompany her inside but she told us she gave them the photograph of herself with Andrew. \n\nThey made a scan of the front, and of a time stamp on the back that the FBI agents believed proved that it was legitimate. It showed it was developed on March 13, 2001 by a one-hour photo service close to her Florida home.\n\nWhen this newspaper sent the picture to Andrew, prior to publication, he did not deny its authenticity on the spot. \n\nAnd for me, an email obtained last month by The Mail on Sunday, in which he suggested at the time that he had employed his personal protection officer to dig up dirt on Virginia, is proof that he knew the picture was real.\n\nBut the story doesn’t end with him. There are other powerful men who must be held accountable for their role in the crimes of Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nAs events unfolded last week, I thought back to that brave young woman I met all those years ago.\n\nWhen Virginia handed me that photograph, neither she, nor I, could possibly have imagined the juggernaut it would become.\n\nI will always remember her courage. And I am proud to have played my part in telling her story – and of obtaining the photograph that changed the course of history.","summary":"When 17-year-old Virginia asked paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to take the snap of her and Prince Andrew it was to prove to her mother she had met a royal.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15249529/photo-history-Sharon-Churcher-investigation-Andrew.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/01/21/103516111-0-image-m-71_1762033153371.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/31/6522650393236650623/1024x576_MP4_6522650393236650623.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 23:36:28","author":"Editor,Sharon Churcher","authors":["Editor","Sharon Churcher"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.544},{"id":374871062,"title":"Coalition won't back environment reforms without changes","text":"The Coalition says it cannot support once-in-a-generation reforms to Australia's environment laws in their current form, as deep negotiations on the legislation begin.\n\nThe massive 1,500-page package was introduced to parliament on Thursday, after months of meetings between Environment Minister Murray Watt and stakeholders to rewrite reforms that failed to win support last term.\n\nFrom the beginning, Senator Watt has said that nobody would get everything they wanted — including himself, suggesting that the federal government would be open to amendments in order to see the laws passed.\n\nSpeaking on ABC Insiders, Senator Watt said he was \"very confident\" the bill could be passed with the support of either the Coalition or Greens.\n\n\"What we're seeking to do here … is achieve a balanced package of reforms,\" he said.\n\nSenator Watt said while the government was not prepared to fully dump the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the government had not made a \"final decision\" on its shape, including whether its CEO could be sacked by a minister — one of the Coalition's asks.\n\nThe minister said there was also \"room to move\" to end native forestry's exclusion from the Act, a key demand of the Greens.\n\nThis morning, Shadow Environment Minister Angie Bell told Sky News if the legislation remained as it was \"we can't agree to it\".\n\n\"We have some grave concerns about the EPBC reforms the government is putting forward,\" Ms Bell said.\n\n\"No stakeholders are happy, we're worried about jobs, we're worried about investment and we're certainly worried about productivity.\"\n\nAlongside the EPA's leadership, Ms Bell has expressed concerns about definitions requiring a \"net gain\" when remediating environmental damage from a project, changes to an \"unacceptable impact\" clause that could be used to block projects and the removal of emissions reporting requirements.\n\nMs Bell did not rule out the possibility of a deal being struck this year.\n\nBut with an inquiry on the proposed laws set to run until early next year, Ms Bell suggested she would not hurry negotiations.\n\n\"He's ramming it through the parliament, at the beginning of the term he was saying he was going to take 12 to 18 months … now suddenly there is a dash to the finish line,\" Ms Bell said. \n\n\"Why is he running it through?

If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!”The warning came after Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump, announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country “a country of particular concern” for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.In a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.“Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,” Tinubu said. “Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.”Trump on Friday said “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and “radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.”Trump's comment came weeks after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africa’s most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of “Christian mass murder.”Nigeria’s population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts, including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions.“The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,\" Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday. \"Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.\"Nigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 over what the State Department called “systematic violations of religious freedom.” The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit.","summary":"Trump threatens military action against Nigeria, vows to cut aid over alleged persecution of Christians, orders Pentagon to plan potential strike.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trump-orders-pentagon-to-plan-possible-military-strike-against-nigeria-over-persecution-of-christians","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/india-s-been-very-good-trump-repeats-claims-of-new-delhi-scaling-back-on-russian-oil-purchases-1761813736065-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 23:31:13","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":374871980,"title":"Presiden Colombia kritik OAS berdiam diri terhadap Tindakan AS di Caribbean","text":"BUENOS AIRES: Presiden Colombia Gustavo Petro pada Sabtu mengkritik Pertubuhan Negara-Negara Amerika (OAS) kerana berdiam diri terhadap tindakan Amerika Syarikat (AS) di Laut Caribbean, lapor Sputnik/RIA Novosti.\n\n\"Jika pentadbiran Presiden AS Donald Trump melanggar undang-undang antarabangsa dengan menyerang orang awam menggunakan kekerasan yang besar dan tidak seimbang di Caribbean.\n\n\"Dengan kata lain, melakukan pembunuhan di luar proses undang-undang seperti yang didakwa Pertubuhan Bangsa-Bangsa Bersatu (PBB), mengapa OAS tidak mengadakan sesi untuk meneliti isu pelanggaran hak asasi manusia secara sistematik di Caribbean?\n\n\"Mengapa Suruhanjaya Hak Asasi Manusia OAS di Washington tidak mengambil langkah berjaga-jaga?

We live in a country where we can freely worship God,’ wrote Minaj, who arrived in America illegally at the age of five from her native Trinidad and has yet to obtain US citizenship.\n\n‘No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion. We don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other,’ she added.\n\n‘Numerous countries all around the world are being affected by this horror & it’s dangerous to pretend we don’t notice,’ added the rapper.\n\n‘Thank you to The President & his team for taking this seriously. God bless every persecuted Christian. Let’s remember to lift them up in prayer.’\n\nLiberal fans reacted with apoplexy, including one who tweeted: ‘Millions of families can’t feed their families today due to this government shutdown & Nicki Minaj using her platform to praise Donald Trump.

Rick Scott (R-FL) has re-introduced the Sunshine Protection Act to the Senate. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nHere’s a shocker, a bill aimed to address a longstanding issue has once again stalled in Congress. This time it’s the Sunshine Protection Act, which would give states the power to make Daylight Savings Time permanent year round.\n\nIf this Act were to somehow get through Congress and see the light of day, at some point, you might no longer have to do the annual Fall back thing. That’s the switching your clocks back an hour thing that you do every Autumn and will be doing again this Sunday, November 2, at 2 am.\n\nSenator Rick Scott and Representative Vern Buchanan, both Republicans from Florida, which is known as the Sunshine State, have been championing this bill. It’s actually already made it past the committee stage and this past Tuesday reached the Senate floor to be be discussed. This bill would permit states that have already passed permanent daylight saving time legislation to proceed with locking their clocks. On the Senate floor, Scott along with other Senators tried to advance the bill by unanimous consent in order to fast-track it, arguing that “this bill is about states’ rights. It allows the people of each state to choose what best fits their needs and the needs of their families.” The bill has had bipartisan support and addresses something that many including Donald Trump and Elon Musk have complained about so seemed to have a decent chance getting through Congress.\n\nBut then grid meet lock. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) refused to offer his consent to the whole unanimous consent thing. Why? He’s been a proponent of making standard time the permanent standard rather than Daylight Savings Time. So, rather springing forward with anything new, Congress may be yet again falling back on something that’s good for nobody.\n\nPrevious Attempts To Make Daylight Saving Time Permanent Have Failed\n\nIf you feel that you may have dreamt this scenario before, it’s been more than just a dream. The sun has set on the Sunshine Protection Act in similar fashion previous years. I have already detailed for Forbes about how current Secretary of State Marco Rubio had introduced the original version of the Sunshine Protection Act in 2022 when he was a Republican Senator for Florida. But that bill That bill aimed to do away with the switch from standard time to Daylight Savings Tim that happens each March and the the switchback that occurs every November. But the sun eventually set on that attempt to get the Sunshine Protection Act through Congress, leaving all of us with the unhappy medium that we have today.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSwitching Between Daylight Savings Time And Standard Time Can Have Negative Health Effects\n\nA study published on September 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed some of the bad health effects of this back-and-forth in Congress about going back-and-forth on the clocks each year. For that study, Lara Weed, a graduate student in bioengineering and Jamie Zeitzer, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, modeled the light exposure changes faced by people in different counties in the U.S. and the resulting potential circadian rhythm and health impacts, based on county-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the prevalence of arthritis, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, depression, diabetes, obesity and stroke. They estimated that establishing some type of permanent time—either standard time or daylight savings time—throughout the year could prevent 200,000 to 300,000 cases of strokes of each year and 1.7 to 2.6 million cases of obesity.\n\nThat’s because your Circadian rhythm—that innate clock in your body—helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle and a lot of your physiologic processes. This rhythm is why you experience jet lag when you travel across numerous time zones, resulting in your having to watch some kind of TV show that you’d never watch at freaking 3 am in the hotel room because you can’t sleep. Disrupting your Circadian rhythm twice a year can in turn throw off many of your physiologic processes for a while, possibly leading to various negative health outcomes.\n\nYour Circadian rhythm gets disrupted because the light exposure that you get, your activity and all the activity around you can all affect this cycle. Your natural circadian cycle is probably not 24 hours on the dot. On average, it is around 12 minutes longer but, of course, can vary significantly person-to-person. The timing and amount of light exposure that you get throughout the day can affect this cycle. For example, light exposure in the morning could potentially shortening it, and light exposure in the nighttime could potentially extend it.\n\nI’ve also written in Forbes before about studies that have shown how accidents and other bad health events such as heart attacks and strokes tend to increase right after the clock changes. This shouldn’t be too surprising when the “Spring Forward” part leads to your losing an hour of sleep. But the Fall Back part can be disruptive as well, even though you may welcome the extra hour of sleep.\n\nThere Are Arguments Both Sides Of The Daylight Savings Time Debate\n\nSo, with no one advocating to stick with what we currently have, why the bleep hasn’t there been a change? Well people have been arguing over which time to stick with all year round: Daylight Savings Time or Standard Time. The arguments for each direction really fall along the lines of when do you want to do more things. Standard Time year round will shift the sunlight hours and thus a lot of activities earlier in the day whereas DST throughout the year will do the opposite and make later in the day brighter. Therefore, if you are more of a “Morning Lark,” you may favor the former. And if you are more of a “Night Owl,” you may say, “Owl go with the DST option.”\n\nSome including the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the National Sleep Foundation and the American Medical Association have claimed that exposure to light in the early morning is better for your overall health and thus have argued for making standard time the year round standard. But you’ve got to wonder how much personal bias may be entering into any of these arguments. After all, there are plenty of morning larks in the medical profession as evidenced by the prevalence of 7 am meetings.\n\nPlus, many of the studies to date on this whole DST versus standard time argument haven’t taken into account the whole system of complexities involved and the diversity of the population. What’s better for you really depends on a lot of different things. Say you are more of Night Owl, otherwise known as a cooler person. Forcing your schedule to be earlier could make you more miserable, which can’t be good for your health. Also, some work and social circles tend to have activities later at night. If you are in a work or social situation where a given person may be very different based on his or her innate Morning Larkness versus Night Owlishness, surroundings, health situation, social situation, job situation and other things. What if, for example, being forced to wake up earlier cuts into a Night Owl’s work and social opportunties and makes him or her more miserable in general? Would that be better for the Night Owl’s overall health?\n\nMoreover, different parts of the world already experience significant differences in when the sun rises and sets based on how far from the equator they are. If you are going to tell people that having sunlight earlier is better for you, then should you also be telling people in northern Sweden, where the sun can rise as late as 9;30 am or not all, “You are bleep out of luck unless you move to some other part of the world?”\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The Sunshine Protection Act championed by Senator Rick and Rep.

This meeting will lead to everlasting peace and success. God bless both China and the USA!”The US President met the Chinese President Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in Busan, South Korea on October 30.After his highly anticipated meeting, Trump said that Washington has reached a landmark one-year trade pact with China, slashing US tariffs on Chinese imports from 57 per cent to 47 per cent.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump stated, “We have a deal,” referring to the trade pact which will be routinely extended.“Every year we’ll renegotiate the deal, but I think the deal will go on for a long time, long beyond the year. We’ll negotiate at the end of the year,” he added.Trump further noted that the 10 per cent tariff reduction on Chinese exports to the US was due to China agreeing to take “strong action” on the fentanyl issue.“It was 57, now it’s 47,” the US President said.“We reduced it by the fentanyl because I believe they are really taking strong action. We’ve already seen the action on fentanyl, and they’re taking very strong action. So reduced to 10 per cent,” he added.Later, while speaking to reporters, Trump announced that China has committed to immediately purchase “large and tremendous amounts” of soybeans and other US farm products as part of a deal between the two nations.During a gaggle aboard Air Force One following his departure to Washington, Trump hailed the decision as a “very nice gesture” from President Xi Jinping, noting that his Chinese counterpart had authorised the purchase a day earlier.“We’re in agreement on so many elements. Large amounts, tremendous amounts of the soybeans and other farm products are going to be purchased, starting immediately. If you notice, President Xi authorised yesterday for China to start buying very large quantities of soybeans and other things, which I appreciated. That was a very nice gesture,” Trump said.According to CNN, in May, China halted its purchases of US soybeans following Trump’s announcement of tariffs, leaving farmers nationwide with billions of dollars’ worth of unsold crops and prompting some to question the policies of a president many had supported.

'The median income taxpayer is cutting coupons for ground beef. They only dream of buying fresh lobster.' \n\nShe posted a photo showing a single Lobster Tail available for $9.99 through Whole Foods Market, which is partnered with Amazon. \n\nOther items that are available under SNAP include a nearly $51 can of Filippo Berio Pure Olive Oil on Amazon, Barrier Island Oysters for $1 a piece, $145 Caviar Russe Osetra, and $67.23 Wagyu Strip Steaks weighing less than a pound at Wegmans. \n\n'Allowing a government benefit program to cover high-end items like caviar, lobster, and filet mignon provides incentive for fraudulent applications and abuse, which both stigmatizes and jeopardizes the integrity of the entire program,' Nixon told the Daily Mail. \n\nNixon said she has no hatred towards 'poor people,' but rather that she believes the government program is 'wasteful' due to being 'loosely audited.' \n\n'As an economist, I look for the most efficient way to achieve the objectives of public sector programs.\n\n'The objective of SNAP is supplemental NUTRITION assistance,' she said. How can we best get nutritious, nourishing foods into the hands of vulnerable people who need them, while discouraging fraud and abuse in the system?\n\n'While lobster tails are a whole, nutritious food, at $40 per pound, it means the remainder of meals for the month will be meager nutritional vacuums, like ramen noodles, or even skipped.\n\nNixon believes that the best way forward is for the program to 'provide access to healthy, whole foods that have an economical ratio of macros per dollar cost.' \n\n'This enables families in need to feed their children nutritious meals throughout the entire month, satiating hunger and maintaining steady energy levels so they can focus in school, play sports, and ultimately feel their best every day,' she told the Daily Mail. \n\nWhile many agreed with Nixon's post, others pointed out that the SNAP recipients are within their rights to spend their benefit as they choose.\n\n'Fascinating that we are now justifying that poor people shouldn’t get to eat lobster,' Dr Danish Nagda, founder of Rezilient Health replied.\n\n'This is honestly a bit sad to see folks look down on people like this. Who cares how they spend their fixed SNAP budget?'\n\nAmazon and its partners started accepting SNAP in 2017. Those with EBT, the card used to purchase SNAP items, can also enjoy 50 percent off Amazon's grocery delivery subscription, which costs $9.99 a month at full price, and a Prime membership. \n\nThere are some stipulations to the program, recipients cannot purchase pet food, beer, wine, or liquor, food or drinks containing CBD, or food that are sold hot, such as a rotisserie chicken. \n\nLatest Department of Agriculture (USDA) data indicates 41,735,210 Americans received SNAP benefits in May 2025, accounting for roughly 22.4 million households. \n\nThe average benefit per beneficiaries was $188.45 per month, costing taxpayers $7.8billion in the month of May. \n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, the government spent $99.8billion on SNAP that went out to 41.7 million people, averaging $187.20 a month. \n\nMany of the states with the highest number of participants are in the South or in high-cost-of-living states like New York and California. \n\nThe states with the most SNAP recipients in the 2024 fiscal year were Oregon, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Washington DC. \n\nIn 2023, 38.8 percent of beneficiaries were children. The largest category was adults aged 18 to 59, accounting for 41.6 percent. Seniors accounted for 11.1 percent. \n\nSNAP has come to the forefront of Americans' minds as 42 million are set to lose their benefits on November 1 amid the ongoing US government shut down. \n\nOn Friday, two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously that President Donald Trump's administration must continue to pay for SNAP using emergency reserve funds, however disruption to the benefit is still anticipated for many.\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) could be similarly impacted as early as next week.\n\nWIC is a specialized food assistance program geared toward pregnant women, new mothers, and young children.\n\nThe Trump administration has already rerouted $300million in proceeds from tariff revenue to provide additional funding to keep the program afloat after previously allocated funds were scheduled to run out earlier in October.\n\nAmid the political dysfunction in Washington DC which many fear could lead to the longest government shutdown in history, some governors, particularly in red states, have decided to step up and provide food benefits.\n\nGovernors of Virginia, Vermont, and Louisiana have 'pledged to backfill food aid for recipients even while the shutdown stalls the federal program, though state-level details haven’t been announced,' per the Associated Press.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom and New York Governor Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, have made moves to stock up food banks across their states.\n\nHochul noted Monday that she planned to fast-track $30million in emergency food assistance, and Newsom is making $80million available, as well as sending the National Guard to help run food banks.\n\nThe Trump Administration has noted that states that choose to spend money on their food programs will not be reimbursed for their actions.\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Nixon, SNAP, and the USDA for comment.","summary":"The federal program mainly helps prevent children going hungry, but it has drawn criticism after it emerged beneficiaries can purchase gourmet food through the scheme.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15247087/luxury-foods-caviar-lobster-snap-benefits.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/31/20/103495781-0-image-a-10_1761942672233.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 23:06:51","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.083},{"id":374866068,"title":"Trump threatens Nigeria with military action over treatment of Christians: ‘Government better move fast!’","text":"President Donald Trump said he’s instructing the Defense Department to “prepare for possible action” in Nigeria, claiming the nation’s government “continues to allow the killing of Christians.”\n\nTrump made the announcement Saturday on Truth Social, one day after he declared that Nigeria is a “country of particular concern.” The State Department uses this designation for nations determined to have committed “particularly severe violations of religious freedom.”\n\n“If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” the president wrote on Saturday.\n\n“I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,” he continued. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!

The country faces insecurity on multiple fronts: Boko Haram and Islamic State–affiliated extremists, farmer–herder clashes, communal violence, ethnic tensions, and secessionist agitations.\n\nWhile Christians are among those targeted, some analysts claim that the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in the country’s Muslim-majority northern region, where most attacks occur.\n\nRead Also: US Senator Cruz backs bill against Sharia, blasphemy laws in Nigeria\n\nAlso, Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated that the government protects citizens of all religions.\n\n“The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,” spokesperson Kimiebi Ebienfa said. “Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.”\n\nThe U.S. first designated Nigeria a “country of particular concern” in 2020 over what the State Department called “systematic violations of religious freedom.” The designation— which did not exclusively cite attacks on Christians—was removed in 2023, a move widely viewed as part of efforts to improve diplomatic relations ahead of then–Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he has ordered the Pentagon to begin preparing for possible military action in\n\n\nread more Trump threatens to launch military attacks in Nigeria over Christian killings","url":"https://businessday.ng/news/article/trump-threatens-to-launch-military-attacks-in-nigeria-over-christian-killings/","image":"https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-2025-09-23T173721.216-1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 22:58:22","author":"Oluwatosin Ogunjuyigbe","authors":["Oluwatosin Ogunjuyigbe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":374863084,"title":"Trump threatens Nigeria with military action over treatment of Christians: ‘Government better move fast!’","text":"President Donald Trump said he’s instructing the Defense Department to “prepare for possible action” in Nigeria, claiming the nation’s government “continues to allow the killing of Christians.”\n\nTrump made the announcement on Truth Social on Saturday afternoon. \n\n“If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, “guns-a-blazing,” to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” the president wrote. \n\n“I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,” he continued. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!

Lauro explained during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday that Smith’s investigation was “simply a DOJ takedown of a political movement.”\n\nLauro’s comments come after Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) made newly released Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files — relating to Smith’s “Arctic Frost” probe public. Lauro added that the “shocking news in this Arctic Frost business” was that members of Congress were being targeted.\n\nBreitbart News’s Jasmyn Jordan reported that Smith’s “Arctic Frost” probe has previously received criticism regarding the “phone and financial records” of Republican officials and Republican-related organizations being obtained covertly.\n\n“This material should’ve been turned over to us, and it never was,” Lauro said, adding that it was “exculpatory information relating to the effort by the Biden administration” to prosecute Trump and Republican officials.\n\n“And, that really was the ultimate objective of Jack Smith. There was nothing righteous about his investigation or his prosecution. It was simply a DOJ takedown of a political movement, and it really should be shocking to all Americans that this was permitted to go on — with the support of the media, the Democratic Party, the Department of Justice, the Biden Administration, and it was really an outrageous example of lawfare where the goal was to interfere in the election, disrupt the MAGA movement, and ultimately deny President Trump another term.”\n\n“In fact, that was the stated goal of Joe Biden. If you remember, in November of ’22, after the midterms, Joe Biden got up and said, ‘I’m going to do everything I could to prevent President Trump from assuming power again,’ and he said constitutionally, which of course was wink, wink, nod, nod, we don’t care about the Constitution.”\n\n“And then President Trump announced, and immediately after that Jack Smith, the prosecutorial pitbull, who’s always used by the Democrats to take down Republicans, was activated and energized, and these fake indictments then came.”\n\n“But, what we didn’t know then is that Republican legislators, members of Congress were also being targeted, and that’s the shocking news in this Arctic Frost business.”\n\nLauro went on to explain that Smith knew that Trump’s legal team’s defense was “political vengeance.”\n\n“Jack Smith knew that our defense was political vengeance, that this was being done to President Trump and his supporters in retaliation for running for President. That was our core defense, everybody knew that. President Trump announced it publicly, and this information would substantiate all of that. The fact that they went after key Republican legislators would support our defense, and it should have been turned over.”\n\nLauro went on to point out that Smith “needs to be called before Congress and answer to the American people for everything he did to try to stop Donald Trump from being president.”","summary":"Lauro explained during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday that Smith's investigation was \"simply a DOJ takedown of a political movement.\"\n\n\nThe post Exclusive &#8212; Attorney John Lauro: Jack Smith&#8217;s &#8216;Arctic Frost&#8217; Probe Was &#8216;Takedown of a Political Movement&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/01/exclusive-attorney-john-lauro-jack-smiths-arctic-frost-probe-was-takedown-of-a-political-movement/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/jack-smith-8-1-24-ap-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 22:36:59","author":"Elizabeth Weibel","authors":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.73},{"id":374865840,"title":"‘Christian genocide’: Trump threatens to stop aid, assistance to Nigeria","text":"United States President, Donald Trump, has warned that his administration will suspend all aid and assistance to Nigeria if President Bola Tinubu’s government fails to address the growing attacks on Christians across the country.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social account on Saturday, Trump accused the Nigerian government of allowing what he described as “killing of Christians.”\n\nHe alleged that radical Islamist groups have been targeting Christian communities in different parts of Nigeria, insisting that Washington might be forced to intervene if the Nigerian authorities continue to look the other way.\n\nHe wrote, “If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, “guns-a-blazing,” to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\n\n“I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action.

Some arrived as early as 4am to choose from pallets of fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, juice, dry goods and prepared sandwiches.\nMary Martin, who volunteers at the pantry, also relies on it regularly for food to supplement her Snap payments. She said she usually splits her roughly US$200 a month in Snap benefits between herself and her two adult sons, one of whom has six children and is especially dependent on the assistance.\n“If I didn’t have the pantry to come to, I don’t know how we would make it,” Martin said. “I’m not gonna see my grandkids suffer.”\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture planned to withhold payments to the food programme starting on Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to make them.\nHowever, it was unclear as to when the debit cards that beneficiaries use could be reloaded after the ruling, sparking fear and confusion among many recipients.\nIn an apparent response to US President Donald Trump, who said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court, US District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the government to report back by Monday on how it would fund Snap accounts.\nMcConnell, who was nominated by US President Barack Obama, said the Trump administration must either make a full payment by that day or, if it decides to tap US$3 billion in a contingency fund, figure out how to do that by Wednesday.\nThe delay in Snap payments, a major piece of the nation’s social safety net that serves about 42 million people, has highlighted the financial vulnerabilities that many face. At the Bronx food pantry, the Reverend John Udo-Okon said “people from all walks of life” are seeking help now.\n“The pantry is no longer for the poor, for the elderly, for the needy. The pantry now is for the whole community, everybody,” Udo-Okon said.\n“You see people will drive in their car and come and park and wait to see if they can get food.”\n\nIn Austell, Georgia, people in hundreds of cars in drive-through lanes picked up non-perishable and perishable bags of food. Must Ministries said it handed out food to about 1,000 people, more than a typical bimonthly food delivery.\nFamilies in line said they worried about not getting Snap benefits in time for Thanksgiving.\nAt a drive-through food giveaway at the Calvary Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, Snap recipient James Jackson, 74, said he is frustrated that people are being hurt by decisions made in Washington and lawmakers should try harder to understand challenges brought by poverty and food insecurity.\n“If you’ve never been poor, you don’t know what it is to be poor,” Jackson said. “I hope that it turns around. I hope that people get their Snap benefits, and I hope we just come together where we can love each other and feed each other and help each other.”\nWhile there is typically a long line for Calvary Baptist Church’s drive-through events, the Rev. Samuel L. Whitlow said, the walk-in food pantry has seen increased demand recently with roughly 60 additional people showing up this week.\nAnd in Norwich, Connecticut, the St Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry had 10 extra volunteers working Saturday to help a wave of expected newcomers, making sure they felt comfortable and understood the services available. Besides groceries and hot meals, the site was providing pet food, toiletries and blood pressure checks.\n“They’re embarrassed. They have shame.

Scott Fitzgerald’s classic 1925 novel at his Palm Beach, Fla., estate, Mar-a-Lago. The president sat with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the Roaring '20s bash, which was complete with feathers and flapper dresses, photos show.\n\n The official theme of the lavish event was The Great Gatsby, the Roaring '20s and “a little party never killed nobody,” according to reports from White House correspondents Danny Kemp and Kellie Meyer of AFP News Agency and NewsNation, respectively. \n\n Footage of the event shared by Meyer on X shows Trump and Rubio, 54, smiling and chatting at a table with other guests. At a certain point in the evening, all members of the press were ordered to leave Mar-a-Lago, Meyer reported.\n\n Trump hosted guests at his Palm Beach property as millions of Americans braced to lose their federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, sometimes referred to as \"food stamps,” the following day amid the ongoing government shutdown.\n\n Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture warned that there would not be enough funding for the 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP benefits to receive their money on Saturday, Nov. 1. (The program provides one in eight people in the U.S. with money to buy food.)\n\n Trump spent Nov. 1 golfing at his Palm Beach golf club, Meyer reported on X.\n\n The timing of the Roaring ‘20s-themed party inspired criticism from politicians, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy.\n\n “Donald Trump hosted a Great Gatsby party while SNAP benefits were about to disappear for 42 million Americans,” Newsom wrote on X, reposting Kemp’s photo from inside the event. \"He does not give a damn about you.”\n\n The government shutdown began on Oct. 1 and is the second-longest on record. The largest point of contention is related to the Affordable Care Act, with Democrats seeking to quickly extend ACA tax credits to prevent healthcare premiums from dramatically rising for millions of Americans. Despite overwhelming public support, Republicans have refused to budge on the issue, saying they can negotiate after the government reopens.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Along with the loss of federal SNAP benefits for millions, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed or working without pay amid the government shutdown. Longtime Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employee LaShanda Palmer is one of them. She has not been paid since the shutdown began, she previously told PEOPLE.\n\n \"I have a car note, I have insurance, I have a grandchild that I have guardianship over, who's 6,\" as well as two of her five children who live with her, she told PEOPLE. Palmer, who works at the Philadelphia International Airport, also has a $1,375 rent payment due on Nov. 1, along with overdrawn checking and savings accounts and mounting overdraft fees.\n\n \"It is extremely hard,” said the lead transportation security officer, one of an estimated 1.4 million federal employees furloughed or working without pay while the federal government is locked in a shutdown.\n\n Elaborating on her situation amid the shutdown — the second she’s endured, including the last one during Trump’s first term — Palmer told PEOPLE, \"I don't want to get an eviction notice. I'm in a position right now, come Nov. 1, where my rent may not get paid because I don't have [rent money] to pay it.”\n\n “And it's not that I don't work for it because I am working for it,” she added. “I should have it.”","summary":"The president hosted the Roaring ‘20s bash at Mar-a-Lago on Oct. 31 amid the ongoing government shutdown","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-hosts-great-gatsby-themed-halloween-party-as-americans-brace-for-snap-benefits-to-expire-11841745","image":"https://people.com/thmb/ggt3_3x5AUzZUHJraMwDE6ZnMQo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/donald-trump-food-bank-110125-cbaca320fe7d4666b488fd5bd8e68183.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 22:19:35","author":"Bailey Richards","authors":["Bailey Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":374857786,"title":"University chancellor confirms darkest fears about who was really behind Pro Palestine campus unrest","text":"The chancellor of Syracuse University has revealed he believes Iran was behind the pro-Palestine protests that swept across US campuses. \n\n'When things happened - that I really believe were encouraged from Iran - it did not have the involvement of very many if any of our own students,' Chancellor Kent Syverud said on Tuesday. \n\nHe revealed his hypothesis on a panel with other chancellors from Washington and Vanderbilt Universities. \n\nIt has not been confirmed that there was outside influence on the chaotic protests which overwhelmed campuses across the country.\n\nSyracuse students were among those who staged a sit in on campus to protest the war in Gaza. \n\nThey set up an encampment on the quad, lasting 16 days, according to CNY Central.

Authorities allege that Giancola used the online alias “Cain Delon” on the social media platform Bluesky. In their statement, the DHS highlighted a staggering 8,000% increase in death threats against ICE personnel amidst President Donald Trump’s intensified measures against illegal immigration.\n\nGiancola is accused of posting messages such as, “Shoot the ICE Nazis down like the rabid dogs they are,” and “Just get a gun and shoot the ICE Nazis down,” among other violent remarks, according to DHS reports. These threats are part of a broader trend, with ICE agents also experiencing over a 1,000% surge in physical assaults.\n\nJoseph Giancola now faces charges for the alleged threats directed at ICE agents. (DHS)\n\n“This cowardly individual made repeated disgusting death threats against ICE law enforcement officers. He is now in federal custody and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “From bounties placed on their heads for their murders, threats to their families, stalking, and doxxing online, our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence and threats against them and their families. Threaten violence or death to our law enforcement? You’ll end up behind bars like this guy.”\n\nDHS said in the statement that it is “committed to safeguarding its personnel and ensuring that individuals who make threats of violence are held accountable and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nThe department blamed politicians’ and the media’s rhetoric for the increased threats against and assaults on its officers. DHS said it warned politicians and the media to “tone down their rhetoric” about ICE and other law enforcement officers.\n\n“Comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences,” DHS said in a statement. “Like everyone else, America’s ICE and CBP agents are hardworking men and women who have families and are real people. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”\n\nOn Thursday, DHS sounded the alarm over the increased threats to ICE agents and provided several examples of individuals threatening officers.\n\nEduardo Aguilar, a Mexican national living in the U.S. illegally in Dallas, Texas, was arrested earlier this month for allegedly soliciting the murder of ICE agents in a TikTok post.\n\nThe post, written in Spanish, allegedly offered $10,000 for the murder of an ICE agent and called for “10 dudes in Dallas with determination who aren’t afraid to [two skull emojis],” DHS said.\n\nIn another incident in Texas, an ICE officer’s spouse was threatened over the phone. The caller, who has not been identified, repeatedly cursed at the ICE officer’s spouse before saying, “Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Saturday the apprehension of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Florida Resident Arrested by Homeland Security for Alleged Online Death Threats Against ICE first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/florida-resident-arrested-by-homeland-security-for-alleged-online-death-threats-against-ice/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Florida-man-nabbed-by-Homeland-Security-for-allegedly-making-online.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 22:14:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":374857010,"title":"Coming up on ‘Fox News Sunday’: November 2nd, 2025","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nFox News Sunday November 01, 2025 00:29 \n\n Coming up on ‘Fox News Sunday’: November 2nd, 2025 \n This week on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ Shannon Bream talks with House Speaker Mike Johnson about the ongoing government shutdown and gets insight on President Donald Trump’s tariff policies from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRFOX NEWS SUNDAYLEADERSHIPELECTIONSECONOMYV-VIDEO","summary":"This week on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ Shannon Bream talks with House Speaker Mike Johnson about the ongoing government shutdown and gets insight on President Donald Trump’s tariff policies from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6384402640112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/603fbd19-db3c-411e-906a-5d7cb66345e1/6e584ad6-4a7f-45c3-9a53-025cb2c68597/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 22:13:54","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":374860972,"title":"\"Guns-a-blazing\": Trump warns Nigeria of aid cut, threatens military action","text":"Washington DC [US], November 2 (ANI): United States President Donald Trump warned that the United States could stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria if the country fails to act against the killings of Christians.In a Truth Social post, Donald Trump warned the US could go in “guns-a-blazing” if killings of Christians by Islamic terrorists continue.Trump said, “If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”Trump instructed the US’ Department of War to prepare, warning any US attack would be “fast, vicious, and sweet,” and told the Nigerian government to “move fast.”He added, “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our cherished Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!”The warning of possible military action came after Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump, announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country “a country of particular concern” for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians, The Washington Post reported. Nigerian authorities have denied that Christians are being systematically targeted. Information Minister Mohammed Idris told Fox News that claims of mass persecution were “very misleading,” rejecting reports that tens of thousands had been killed.Trump marked Nigeria a “country of particular concern” after claiming that Christianity is facing an “existential threat” in the country, highlighting the violence between the Muslim and Christian communities.Trump blamed “radical Islamists” for the persecution of the Christian minority in Nigeria and directed two federal lawmakers, Riley Moore and Tom Cole, to look into the issue.“I am asking Congressman Riley Moore, together with Chairman Tom Cole and the House Appropriations Committee, to immediately look into this matter and report back to me,” he instructed.“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a “COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN” But that is the least of it.

Trump declared that Meyers “may be the WORST to perform, live or otherwise.”\n\n“I watched his show the other night for the first time in years,” Trump wrote. “In it he talked endlessly about electric catapults on aircraft carriers which I complain about as not being as good as much less expensive steam catapults. On and on he went, a truly deranged lunatic.”\n\nHe continued: “Why does NBC waste its time and money on a guy like this??? - NO TALENT, NO RATINGS, 100% ANTI TRUMP, WHICH IS PROBABLY ILLEGAL!!!”\n\nThe Independent has contacted NBC for comment. When asked about the post, a White House official referred The Independent to Trump’s comments. \n\nOn Thursday night, Meyers took aim at Trump’s speech to members of the U.S. military earlier this week on board the U.S.S. George Washington aircraft carrier in Japan. There, Trump asked the audience to tell him which type of catapult is better for aircraft carriers: steam or electric. Several audience members shouted back, “Steam!”\n\n“They're spending billions of dollars to build stupid electric,” Trump said. “And the problem, when it breaks, you have to send up to MIT, get the most brilliant people in the world, fly them out, it’s ridiculous.”\n\n“The steam, they said they could fix it with a hammer and a blowtorch, and it works just as well, if not better,” Trump continued. “And I love the sight of that beautiful steam pouring off that deck — with the electric, you don't have that.”\n\nMeyers played part of Trump’s remarks for his audience before remarking: “Guy spends more time thinking about catapults than Wile E. Coyote.”\n\n“Next, they start complaining about how our troops don't tie themselves to rockets anymore,” Meyers added.\n\nMeyers, impersonating Trump, continued: “We used to strap our soldiers to the rockets, and they loved it, but then everything got woke and they said, ‘You can't tie a person to a rocket.’ But we miss those days, and we're bringing them back.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has taken aim at Meyers. In August, Trump went on a late-night rant about a “rumor” he heard that NBC had extended Meyer’s contract — even though the network signed a four-year extension with Meyers last year.\n\n“He has no Ratings, Talent, or Intelligence, and the Personality of an insecure child,” Trump wrote at the time. “So, why would Fake News NBC extend this dope’s contract.

In Rabat, the decision was met with celebrations, as Morocco considers Western Sahara an integral part of its kingdom. Thousands took to the streets waving national flags and cheering the outcome, while the Polisario Front rejected the resolution outright. The conflict over the vast, desert region along the Atlantic coast erupted in 1975, after Spanish colonial forces withdrew. Morocco claimed the territory and formally annexed it in 1979. For 16 years, it fought the Polisario Front, which sought independence for the Sahrawi people and declared the establishment of the “Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic” in 1976. Today, Morocco controls about three-quarters of Western Sahara, while the Polisario governs the remainder. Roughly 600,000 people live in the territory. According to the Security Council resolution, both sides were urged to resume negotiations based on Morocco’s 2007 autonomy proposal. Under that plan, Western Sahara would have its own local, legislative, executive, and judicial authorities elected by residents, while Rabat would retain control over defense, foreign affairs, and religion. Polisario rejects “legitimization of Moroccan occupation” U.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz said after the vote: “We call on all sides to use the coming weeks to sit down and engage in serious discussions. We believe regional peace is possible this year and will do everything we can to facilitate progress.” Russia, China, and Pakistan abstained from the vote, while Algeria, an ally of the Polisario, did not participate. Eleven Council members voted in favor. The resolution also renewed for another year the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO. Algeria’s UN ambassador, Amar Benjama, said: “The final decision about the territory’s future can belong only to the people living under colonial rule. The text ignores the Polisario Front’s proposals.” The Polisario’s UN representative, Sidi Mohamed Omar, wrote on X (formerly Twitter): “The Polisario Front reaffirms the Sahrawi people’s unwavering commitment to their non-negotiable right to self-determination and independence, and to defend their rights and sovereignty by all legitimate means.” Following the vote, the Polisario announced it would not take part in “any peace process or negotiations based on proposals intended to legitimize Morocco’s military occupation.” Rabat praises “historic” decision Morocco’s King Mohammed VI hailed the resolution as “a historic decision,” adding: “We thank President Trump for his efforts to reach a final solution to the Sahara issue. We seek a resolution with no winners or losers.” The king also called for dialogue with Algeria, addressing Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune: “We do not see developments regarding the Sahara as a victory, nor do we intend to exploit them to ignite conflict.” Another Trump-era peace deal in the making? U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in 2020 as part of the Abraham Accords, under which Morocco normalized ties with Israel. In July, Trump reaffirmed his support, calling Morocco’s autonomy plan “the only viable solution.” Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, previously said Washington was working toward a peace agreement between Algeria and Morocco. Israel officially recognized Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in 2023. Following Israel’s recognition, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism after maps displayed in official settings showed Morocco without Western Sahara. The backlash prompted Israel’s Foreign Ministry to replace them with maps that include the region as part of Morocco. Among those credited with helping calm tensions was Lea Ben-Shitrit, a key figure behind normalization efforts and Jewish community initiatives in Morocco. She was invited to witness the broadcast announcing the map correction—a symbolic gesture underscoring renewed warmth between the two nations.","summary":"The UN Security Council endorsed Morocco’s autonomy plan as the most viable path to resolve the 50-year Western Sahara dispute, prompting celebrations in Rabat.

Ted Cruz introduced a bill called “Nigeria Religious Freedom Accountability Act of 2025” that would protect Christians and other religious minorities being persecuted in Nigeria.\n\nThat legislation would impose targeted sanctions against Nigerian officials who facilitate violence against Christians and other minority groups and impose targeted sanctions against officials who enforce sharia or blasphemy laws.\n\nWith Post wires.","summary":"President Donald Trump threatened Nigeria in social media post Saturday night that he would go into the African nation “guns-a-blazing” with military force if they don’t stop Islamic...","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/01/us-news/trump-threatens-to-go-into-nigeria-guns-a-blazing-if-slaughter-of-christians-doesnt-stop/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/114615007.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xDgF9F0I-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 22:02:04","author":"Shane Galvin","authors":["Shane Galvin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.027},{"id":374858434,"title":"Obama shreds Trump over ballroom, bizarre Truth Social videos and family’s crypto fortune: ‘It’s like every day is Halloween’","text":"Former President Barack Obama tore into Donald Trump and said it feels like “every day is Halloween — except it’s all tricks and no treats” under his administration.\n\nObama shredded Trump during a speech Saturday in support of Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, where he said, “It’s worse than even I expected.”\n\n“It's not as if we didn't see some of this coming,” Obama told the crowd at the rally in Norfolk. “I will admit it's worse than even I expected. But I did warn y'all,” he added.\n\nThe former president began by reeling off how the Trump family has benefited from cryptocurrency dealings and accused the president of prioritizing his “billionaire pals and finance bros.”\n\n“Is the economy working better for you? Because it sure has gotten better for Trump and his family,” said Obama. \n\nMembers of the Trump family, through an umbrella company, own more than half of the cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial and it has allegedly netted them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters.\n\n“Since he's been in office, the whole crypto business and other ventures have made hundreds of millions of dollars,” Obama continued. “Including from foreign nationals and rich folks investing because they want to stay in the President's good graces.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nObama then criticized Trump for his $300 million ballroom and paving over the White House Rose Garden, which now resembles his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.\n\n“He has been focused on critical issues like paving over the Rose Garden so folks don't get mud on their shoes, and gold plating the Oval Office and building a $300 million ballroom,” Obama said.\n\nThe Democrat then took aim at the artificial intelligence videos Trump often posts on his Truth Social account, including one showing himself wearing a crown, flying a “KING TRUMP” fighter jet, and bombing a crowd of No Kings protesters with brown liquid.\n\n“And all the nonsense we see on the news every day, the over the top rhetoric, the fabricated conspiracies, the weird videos of a U.S. president with a crown on his head flying a fighter jet and dumping poop on protesting citizens,” said Obama.\n\nThe video, according to Obama, is part of the Trump administration’s attempt to “distract” voters.\n\n“They do it so you won't notice that while they're helping the wealthiest, most powerful people in the country consolidate more wealth and more power, your bills are still going up,” he said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, spent his Halloween in Palm Beach where his Mar-a-Lago residence was throwing a Great Gatsby-themed bash.\n\nHe was criticized for attending the lavish event hours before a vital food assistance program relied upon by millions of Americans was about to lapse.\n\nObama was speaking a few days on from a reported revelation that he wanted to let a “process” determine the Democratic nominee after former President Joe Biden dropped out of the running in 2024, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl wrote in his new book Retribution.\n\nHe was “not happy” with Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s speedy endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris – and chewed the former House speaker out in an angry phone call, according to the book.","summary":"Obama laid into Trump during a speech in support of Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/obama-speech-trump-halloween-b2856773.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/01/19/05/Former-President-Obama-Campaigns-With-New-Jersey-And-Virginia-Democratic-Gubernatorial-Candidates-Ah.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HPM3EOjv-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 22:00:43","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":374858212,"title":"Canadians take to social media to debate their prime minister's apology to Trump over anti-tariffs ad","text":"Ontario&apos;s premier didn&apos;t apologize for airing an anti-tariffs ad that angered President Donald Trump — but Canada&apos;s prime minister did.
