Trump allies have pushed for a special legislative session intended for the Republican-controlled Legislature to change Nebraska’s system to winner-take-all instead of awarding electoral votes by congressional district. “After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,” state Sen. Mike McDonnell wrote in a letter obtained by NBC News. GOP state Sen. Loren Lippincott, who sponsored the bill to move to winner-take-all, indicated Monday that McDonnell’s position means a special session to move the legislation isn’t expected this fall. In response to questions about McDonnell’s statement, Lippincott emailed a draft of his weekly op-ed in local newspapers, which reads: “Governor [Jim] Pillen did not want to call a special session unless he had assurances from 33 senators they would vote yes on the bill. That effort did not bear fruit. There will be no special session to address Winner Take All. I will be carrying this bill, again, next legislative session.” Lippincott clarified by email that he hasn’t heard directly from Pillen but that he expects him to weigh in later this week. “The time is clicking, and I don’t see a road forward for this, just based on what the governor said,” said state Sen. Merv Riepe, a Republican who discussed the effort with Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., last week. Riepe told NBC News he initially had concerns himself about changing the law so close to the election but said he wouldn’t stand in the way of fellow Republicans’ making the change. Riepe said Nebraska’s Electoral College system was initially changed in 1992 in hope of having more media exposure and money spent on presidential races in Omaha. “I’ve heard some senators say, ‘Well, let’s just wait and do it next year,’” he said. “And you’re kind of like, ‘Are you nuts?’ It will mean nothing, because then you’re talking about waiting until ’28. So it’s fundamentally get it done now or don’t worry about it so much.” McDonnell represents an Omaha-area state Senate district and is reportedly weighing a run for mayor of Omaha. A former Democrat, he switched parties in April, becoming a Republican, after state Democrats censured him. Trump slammed McDonnell on Truth Social. “It would have been better, and far less expensive, for everyone!” Trump wrote in part of his post. “Unfortunately, a Democrat turned Republican(?) State Senator named Mike McDonnell decided, for no reason whatsoever, to get in the way of a great Republican, common sense, victory. Just another ‘Grandstander!’” The developments appear to cap months of deliberations over whether Nebraska lawmakers could change how the state apportions its electoral votes in a way that would benefit Trump. Nebraska allocates its electoral votes by congressional district, and the swing district around Omaha has twice gone to Democrats in recent years, giving them one electoral vote from an otherwise ruby-red state. But if lawmakers changed to a winner-take-all model, Trump would be all but certain to win all of Nebraska’s electoral votes. And there’s a plausible scenario in which that could determine who becomes the next president. For example, if Vice President Kamala Harris were to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but lose every other swing state, she and Trump would be tied at 269 electoral votes under a winner-take-all setup in Nebraska with Trump winning the state. In that scenario, the race would be thrown to the U.S. House, where each state delegation would get one vote for president. Republicans hold a majority of delegations and are favored to retain it, even though the House majority could change hands after the November election. However, if Nebraska didn’t change its apportionment mode and if Harris were to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but lose every other swing state, she would win the presidential election with 270 electoral votes. Nebraska Democrats lauded McDonnell’s announcement. “Nebraska has a long and proud tradition of independence, and our electoral system reflects that by ensuring that the outcome of our elections truly represents the will of the people without interference,” Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said. “Senator McDonnell is standing strong against tremendous pressure from out-of-state interests to protect Nebraskans’ voice in our democracy. In this election and those to come, Nebraskans will continue to lead the way by electing leaders at every level who stand up for the people and respect our spirit of independence,” Kleeb added. Last week, Graham, a Trump ally, met with Pillen and about two dozen Republican legislators to discuss how the state allocates its electoral votes, according to a source with direct knowledge of the trip. Graham, acting on behalf of the Trump campaign, was working to encourage Pillen to call a special legislative session at which lawmakers could consider changing the state’s apportionment of electoral votes, the source said. Proponents of the winner-take-all model would need 33 votes in the state Senate to overcome a filibuster to move forward with the change. While the state’s unicameral Legislature is technically nonpartisan, Republicans do have a 33-seat majority thanks to McDonnell’s recent party flip. But that narrow margin means Republicans can’t move forward without him. Pillen has said he hasn’t yet “received the concrete and public indication that 33 senators would vote” for the winner-take-all system. State lawmakers told the Nebraska Examiner last week that they estimated that the change had the support of 30 or 31 state senators, meaning they remained two to three votes short. McDonnell had been one of them. Sen. Merv Riepe had been thought to be another. The Washington Post reported last week that Riepe now supports the change to a winner-take-all system. The newfound interest in Nebraska’s Electoral College votes comes months after Republicans tried, and failed, to make the change in the spring. Back then, a pressure campaign backed by Pillen, Trump and pro-Trump influencer Charlie Kirk fell short on procedural grounds, as it lacked support from enough senators to overcome a filibuster. Ever since the state changed how it allocated its Electoral College votes more than 30 years ago, lawmakers have repeatedly tried to change back to awarding all of Nebraska’s votes to the statewide winner. An effort to do so passed in 1995, but the governor vetoed it. Another effort fell just one vote short in 2016. Maine is the only other state that doesn’t have a winner-take-all system. But while Maine Democrats have discussed switching their system in response if Nebraska made a change, they appear to have run out of time to make a countermove for November.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA Nebraska Republican state lawmaker said Monday that he remains opposed to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Nebraska GOP leader against altering electoral vote system, thwarting Trump&#8217;s efforts first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/nebraska-gop-leader-against-altering-electoral-vote-system-thwarting-trumps-efforts/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-09/240923-Mike-McDonnell-Nebraska-se-105p-eb7c36.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 00:52:33","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":257164416,"title":"MANY FLOODS TO CROSS WITH DEMOCRACY","text":"OKELLO OCULI argues the need for communities to be directly involved on issues affecting them In recent times, millions of young people poured their rage against evil industrial activities by adults which, over many centuries, have cumulatively destroyed nature’s protection of planet earth against SUN – the ‘’Lion King’’’ of the planetary system. Sceptics and cynics among those who love money over human welfare, mocked them. Candidate Donald Trump snubbed their assertions as a ‘’hoax’’. Governments indebted to owners of industries that rely on burning coal for energy, sent the police to teach the loud-mouthed kids ‘’with heavy manners’’ and naked brutalities. As a man with investments in building houses with wood and insurance companies that harvest funds from anxious people that seek some protection from fires and hurricanes, American builder are likely to resist the example of Japanese builders to use building material that resisted volcanic tremors and convulsive earthquakes. Images of houses torn to pieces by tornadoes along routes of hurricanes in the United States of America was handled by including ‘’basement’’ spaces bellow living rooms for families to dive into and survive terrors above ground. Insurance companies pick damages to what survive of family properties. Profit is protected while families with low or no insurance at all, get blamed under the cruel law of ‘those who are poor, even the little they have is taken away from them’. Following President Reagan and Secretary Gorbachev sharing fear of Ayotollah Khomeni proclaiming himself as a new power across the Islamic world, it was safer to protect the Capitalist and Communist world against the possibility of a Muslim fanatic pressing a button that would hurl nuclear weapons against countries marked by Khomeni as ‘’Satanic’’. His instruction to all believers of Islam to murder Salman Rhusdie (for publishing a novel title ‘’THE SANATIC VERSES’’), panicked leaders globally. The result of withdrawal of ‘’Communism’’, as a fatal virus across Capitalist Europe wrecked the power of voters in democratic politics. The benefits of the Welfare State, previously used to bribe voters across Europe against the appeal of Communist Parties backed by the Soviet Union, would be withdrawn. Imposing anti-people economic policies on Greece became a prime example. The era had passed of the ‘’Marshall Plan’’ pouring American money into Europe to rebuild industries, homes, schools, hospitals and general economies shattered by German bombs during the 1938-1945 War across Europe and Britain. The flood of American wealth had flowed to drain away the flood of poverty resulting from that war. A major victim of degrading the power of the people’s voice in ‘’European Democracy’’ is the rage of youth against the terror of Climate Change. The youth were exploiting the flood of horizontal communication through the use of SMART PHONES and Internet. They beat adult gatekeepers of flows of information and opinion. On 15th September, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Austria, were hit by flood that killed 30 people. It covered a vast region drained by the Danube River. The tragedy coincided with a horrendous flood in Maiduguri town in Nigeria. Over 37 people died from it. Likewise, a flood in Myanmar was reported to have killed over 220 people and ruined thousands of acres of farmlands. A civil war and military rule has displaced thousands of people into detention camps. The military is using bloodshed to kill democratic politics. In Eastern Europe and Maiduguri blame is put on corrupt officials pocketing funds for repairing dams. In countries transiting from Communist rule to multi-party democracy, officials have exploited the relaxation of rigid control by Communist Party governance to rush into grabbing private property and a pandemic of corruption. Liberal Democracy regained its individualism and voice of greed. In Maiduguri, critical media noted that Borno State government had received 800 million Naira for managing environmental hazards. A committee of high-level officials had submitted a report which claimed that the dam which burst a wall a few days later was nothing to worry about. Possible diversion of funds by corrupt officials and a culture of lack of accountability was plausible.. Borno State has a long history of violent and destructive wars under the Saifawa and Kanem feudal rule. Officials in peripheries were selected from among local communities for an ‘’Indirect Rule System’’. It ensured that tribute and tax flowed from the dominated people to be enjoyed by central authorities. There was, however, no flow downwards of investment for development of subjected communities. The challenge of flood in Nigeria follows the colonial tradition of communities seeing government as an extractor of resources from them, without their participation in administering for their own development. Franz Fanon insisted that infrastructure must not fall on communities like ‘’mana’’ from skies. The DIRECT PARTICIPATION of communities in DESIGNING preventive and repair measures and activities cures people of docility; and helps in ‘’reconstructing’’ their personalities.

El destacado catedrático español Javier del Rey Morató conversó con la periodista Katherine Hernández en su programa Siendo Honestos sobre su percepción de la democracia, y aseguró que es una asignatura pendiente en América Latina y que en el resto del mundo, está en peligro. “La democracia está en peligro en todo el mundo. Si lo está en Estados Unidos, es que lo está en todo el mundo”, afirma que el populismo es contagioso y que ha infectado a la gran potencia del norte, refiriéndose a las acciones cometidas por el expresidente y aspirante al mismo cargo en Estados Unidos, Donald Trump. “Trump ha revelado que es un Maduro con el pelo rubio, lo hizo cuando perdió las elecciones, como lo hizo Maduro; además que incitó a la toma del Congreso, eso es dar un paso que es intolerable”. En cuanto a América Latina, el escritor de más de 20 libros manifestó que, “Latinoamérica ha fracasado, porque no sé a qué han llegado los países latinoamericanos. Me da la impresión de que tienen muchas asignaturas pendientes, una de ellas es el desarrollo, hay mucha gente que está en la miseria, que está descolgada del sistema”, dijo. De igual manera subrayó que otra de las tareas que América Latina tiene como una tarea pendiente es la democracia, al afirmar que, “si analizamos la historia, yo creo que casi de cualquier país latinoamericano, vemos que lo más novedoso de la cultura política es el prócer, es decir el caudillo”. Asimismo definió la democracia como “un sistema que no ilusiona como puede ilusionar la revolución, que promete el cielo en la tierra. La democracia hace lo que puede y no puede perseguir y maximizar la satisfacción que da un valor en detrimento de todos los demás. La democracia da a cada valor lo que puede darle, a la representatividad, a la libertad, a la igualdad, lo que puede. No satisface; no hay grupo que quede satisfecho, porque hace lo que puede”. En este sentido, puso como ejemplo al presidente de El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, explicando que, “la democracia puede optimizar, e intentar alcanzar algo más, pero no maximizar, porque si no ya no es democracia; sino es traición de la democracia. Creo que es lo que está pasando con Bukele, para muchas personas es atractivo, porque sin duda alguna eliminó la inseguridad en las calles y seguramente algunas otras cosas, pero ¿a qué precio? A mí me recuerda, más que a un demócrata, al expresidente cubano Fidel Castro, porque cuando persigues y maximizas la satisfacción que quieres darle al valor igualdad, te cargas la libertad, pero resulta que también te cargas la igualdad” aseguró el conferencista internacional. Cuestiona eficacia de ONU para resolver problemas de la humanidad Durante la entrevista la periodista Katherine Hernández le preguntó su perspectiva sobre el trabajo que realiza la Organización de las Naciones Unidas, debido a que recientemente se desarrolló la 79ª Asamblea General, a lo que el profesor del Rey Morato respondió: “en la ONU, hacen lo que pueden, pero lo que pasa es que la respuesta es falsa, porque falta la verdad, ya que pueden hacer más”. En ese ámbito cuestionó, “¿qué han hecho para salvar de la miseria a Cuba? ¿Qué han hecho para convertirlos en ciudadanos? Porque son súbditos. ¿Qué han hecho por salvar a Nicaragua del desastre en el que anda metida? Yo creo que nada. ¿Qué hacen con el señor Maduro y el absoluto desastre de la República de Venezuela? Hasta donde yo he podido ver, no han hecho nada. ¿Qué han hecho después de las últimas elecciones, parece ser que fraudulentas, perpetradas por el dictador Maduro? Hasta ahora nada”, aseveró. No obstante, en cuanto al cuestionamiento de que si la ONU puede hacer algo sobre la situación de Latinoamérica respondió: “Yo creo que sí, pero el freno, quizás son los propios latinoamericanos, quizás algunos países de la región, impiden que se tomen medidas drásticas, que no sé cuáles son, pero hay algún artículo que habilita a la ONU para tomar medidas”, dijo. Añadió que: “Lamentablemente no hacen todo lo que pueden y da la impresión de que no sirven para nada, pero sé que el mundo no estaría mejor sin ellas, por lo que menos mal que existen y que hay reuniones; con las algún día se podrá llegar a algo”.","summary":"El académico y escritor español cuestiona la eficacia de ONU para resolver problemas que aquejan a la humanidad y asegura que pueden hacer más.

I know a lot about John Deere. I love the company, but as you know, they’ve announced, uh, a few days ago that they’re going to move a lot of their manufacturing business to Mexico. I’m just notifying John Deere right now. If you do that, we’re putting a 200% tariff on everything that you want to sell into the United States. So that if I win, John Deere is going to be paying a 200% they haven’t started it yet. Maybe they haven’t even made the final decision yet. But I think they have, uh, John Deere is going to and anybody else that does this because it’s hurting our farmers, it’s hurting our manufacturing. And if you do that, they have a 200% tariff put on the product that you make in Mexico right across the border. They think they’re gonna make product cheaper in Mexico and then sell it in for the same price as they did before. Make a lot of money by getting rid of our labor and our jobs and, and really a great name because John Deere is a great name. I buy a lot of John Deere tremendous. I’m one of their big customers. I buy a lot of John Deere product as a private person. But if they’re going to do that, we’re going to put a 200% tariff on everything that they want to send back into the United States, which means one of two things, our country is gonna make a lot of money or they’re not gonna build, they’re not gonna open and, or they’re going to sell it to another country, they’re entitled to do that. If they want to build in the country and the United States, there’s no tariff. You can go ahead and you can build in any one of the 50 states, you can go ahead. But if they don’t want to do that, we’re going to put a 200% tariff on John Deere and you know what’s gonna happen. They’re going to announce very shortly if they think I’m gonna win or if I do win, they’re going to announce that they’re not going to build in Mexico. John Deere Is Already Manufacturing Products Outside The United States A fact check from KWQC about John Deere moving to Mexico stated: John Deere is an international company with factories, facilities and offices in more than 30 countries and 40,000 employees around the globe. Theyâre not moving jobs from the Quad Cities to another plant – but they are building a new facility in Mexico that will be ready in 2026. The plant will make mid-frame skid steer loaders and compact trackloaders. Those machines are made at Dubuque Works, and some jobs will be relocated to Mexico. However, the number of jobs has not been released. Trump Is Threatening American Companies John Deere is building a new plant. The company already has international plants and offices. Donald Trump wants to be the President Of The United States, but instead of protecting American companies, Trump is threatening them. Trump still doesn’t understand that John Deere won’t be paying the tariff. The tariff will be paid by the consumers that purchase John Deere products. The farmers may not have realized it, but Donald Trump wasn’t just threatening John Deere, he was also threatening their economic survival.

What Hayley Williams Had to. Say About Donald Trump As it was a radio festival, Paramore played a brief set for those in attendance. Their five-song performance included the track “Big Man, Little Dignity” with was the penultimate song in their setlist for the night. In the midst of the performance, Williams found her way to the front of the stage speaking directly into the camera to deliver her message. “Project 2025 is Donald Trump’s playbook for controlling and punishing women, poor people, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community,” the singer started. “It is time for all Americans to band together and to finally defeat the Trump agenda. And the only way to do that is by confronting him at the polls.” She continued, while pointing toward the camera, “Do you want to live in a dictatorship? Well shut up and vote!” What Elon Musk Said As video of Williams speech made the rounds on social media, X owner and Executive Chair Elon Musk got in on the conversation sharing a post from someone who had another camera angle of Williams’ speech. “She was reading from cue cards,” noted Musk. The cue cards he spoke of were clearly in view in the video shared, just to to the side of the camera that was filming Williams. The person who had initially shared the video was even more critical of the singer, adding in their commentary, “When you realize that these people are ALL paid actors for hire and the Romans treated actors as the lowest members of society on the same level as sanitation and prostitution, everything falls into place.” How Hayley Williams Addressed the Cue Card Controversy After the initial discussion on social media focused on Williams speech and the secondary discussion that followed then turned to criticism over her use of cue cards and what it could mean, the Paramore singer then addressed the controversy through her Instagram Stories (Williams bowed out of all other social media in 2021). In her response, she stated, “Whoever you are, I typed out my speech and had a crew member hold it near the camera for me in case I got nervous bc what I had to say was important and I didn’t want to trip up in the moment, didn’t end up looking at it though … that’s because I prepared.” She continued, “Finally, not only was i *not* paid to make the speech but we (paramore] didn’t get paid to play that radio fest either. Just out here kicking ass for free I guess :(. Thanks so much for your concern and for spelling my name right, bye!” Hayley Williams and Politics This would not be the first time that Williams has used the concert stage to voice her thoughts on the political landscape. In 2023, the Paramore singer jumped into the political discussion during a show in New Jersey when she expressed her disdain for then Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis. DeSantis’ political directives had made Florida particularly unsafe for people of color, LGBTQIA+ communities, those who speak with an accent and international travelers, according to a NAACP travel advisory. “I’ll be happy to tell you I’m very fucking comfortable talking politics,” Williams stated to the audience. “And if you vote for Ron DeSantis, you’re fucking dead to me.” READ MORE: Hayley Williams Rips State Politicians for Denying Fellow Grammy Winner The Paramore singer had previously taken part in the 2023 “Love Rising” benefit concert in her home state of Tennessee.

To understand why requires getting a bit deep in the Electoral College weeds. Almost all states use a winner-take-all system to apportion their presidential electors, but Nebraska and Maine award some electors by congressional district. In 2020, Joe Biden won one of Nebraska’s five electoral votes, and Donald Trump won one elector from rural Maine. This year Kamala Harris’s clearest path to victory is to take the so-called blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, plus one electoral vote in Nebraska. One reason that both states have resisted partisan pressure to switch to winner-take-all is the assumption that if one did so, the other would as well, balancing out any Electoral College effect. But this year, Republicans waited until it was too late for Maine to change its rules before starting a push to change them in Nebraska. If they succeeded and Harris held the blue wall but lost the other swing states, there would be a tie in the Electoral College. For the first time in 200 years, the election would go to the House, where each state delegation would get one vote and Trump would almost certainly be installed as president. So far, one man, State Senator Mike McDonnell, who defected from the Democratic Party this spring, is standing in the Republican Party’s way. We should all be grateful for his courage. But the pressure on him from his new party will be intense, and he can still change his mind in the coming weeks.","summary":"Can we fix the Constitution before it destroys us?","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/opinion/electoral-college-presidential-election.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/23goldberg1-bwmj/23goldberg1-bwmj-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 00:05:06","author":"Michelle Goldberg","authors":["Michelle Goldberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":257162318,"title":"Trump threatens John Deere with tariff hike if it outsources production to Mexico","text":"Trump threatens John Deere with tariff hike if it outsources production to Mexico Former President Donald Trump mentioned a new policy proposal that could cost an iconic American company big money, just as CBS polls show Vice President Kamala Harris making some gains on the economy in the neck-and-neck presidential race.

Now it's appalling to think of myself at that young age in that situation with men who should know better.' She chose to have an abortion and was supported by her mother, saying now as she looks back that she wants to go back in time and give her teenage self a 'big hug'. Later in life at 26, Sue married actor James Quinn and the couple had son Elliott, now 28. However they divorced and she is now happily married to second husband, lighting technician Brian Owen. It comes after earlier this year Sue revealed she felt 'shamed and judged' before losing three stone. She has been displaying a slimmer frame of late as a result of being 'seriously ill' last year as well as giving up alcohol. Appearing as a guest panellist on Loose Women, the soap star revealed she has been treated differently while at different weights. She told how she became promiscuous and had one night stands when she was growing up as she looked for love and validation 'in all the wrong places' After losing her virginity to an older boy she ran off with a sailor at just 16 before leaving him for his older brother and soon after getting pregnant at 17 with a 35-year-old man She told The Mirror : 'I looked for love and validation and acceptance in all the wrong places and my first sexual encounters were with somebody who was four or five years older than me' She explained: 'My weight has been up down all over the place and most of it was helped by red wine. 'At the minute I am a lot thinner but I've been ill this year and for some reason my metabolism seems to have changed and because I'm not drinking. But I have been the other way and I might go back the other way.' Sue continued: 'What I hate about it is the shame that is attached to being a bigger person. The judgments made, quite often from other women. 'I find it really hard to take We're not stupid, we know we're big, we know we have a problem, we know we have an addiction, don't treat us like we are idiots. Read More Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver, 60, says she's 'come out from hiding away' after her incredible three-stone weight loss: 'I decided this decade is for me' 'Other women are shocking at it. It's so in us. Examples are when I've lost weight I go into a room and someone goes 'oh my god, you look amazing, you've lost weight' all I will hear is 'you looked like an absolute dog when you were big'. 'It's how we talk about it that makes a big difference.' Sue recently opened up on her weight loss, explaining it was part of a lifestyle overhaul. She admitted she 'over-did red wine' during the pandemic and pilled on the pounds, which inspired her to give it up. Despite her Corrie character Eileen Grimshaw spending a lot of time in The Rovers, she admitted that pubs are her 'idea of hell.' Speaking Kaye Adams on her How to be 60 podcast, in quotes obtained by The Sun, Sue explained: 'In the pandemic we all over-did things. I spent a lot of it drinking lots of lovely red wine and I put on a lot of weight doing it. 'Then I did dry January and I thought. 'I wonder what life would be like if I stopped completely?'' The actress added her husband Brian, shares different views and 'love pub culture.' 'It was my idea of hell when I drank and especially now that I don't drink,' she said. Last year, Sue insisted she's 'not obsessed over diets' as she reflected on the unfair expectations placed on women while covering the March issue of Prima magazine. She is seen on the iconic soap in 2001 She declared she would never promote any weight-related products as women have 'enough difficulties as it is'. On not being embroiled in diet culture Sue told the publication: 'I lost some weight in the jungle, but I'm not obsessing over diets: life is hard enough! 'There's always going to be outside pressure and unfair expectations placed on women, but I refuse to get pulled into it. 'That's why I'll never promote anything weight-related, and it's why I'd always rather compliment somebody on their smile or their outfit, rather than their weight.' She continued: 'Let's just let women be women – we have enough difficulties and struggles as it is.'

Email tips@dailymail.com By Amelia Wynne For Mailonline Published:00:51 BST, 24 September 2024 |Updated:01:03 BST, 24 September 2024 e-mail View comments Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver has revealed she had an abortion age 17 after getting pregnant by a 35-year-old man. The Eileen Grimshaw actress, 61, recalled her 'tragic teens' in a new interview ahead of the publication of her memoir A Work in Progress. She told how she became promiscuous and had one night stands when she was growing up as she looked for love and validation 'in all the wrong places'. After losing her virginity to an older boy she ran off with a sailor at just 16 before leaving him for his older brother and soon after getting pregnant at 17 with a 35-year-old man. She told The Mirror: 'I looked for love and validation and acceptance in all the wrong places and my first sexual encounters were with somebody who was four or five years older than me. Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver has revealed she had an abortion age 17 after getting pregnant by a 35-year-old man The Eileen Grimshaw actress, 61, recalled her 'tragic teens' in a new interview ahead of the publication of her memoir A Work in Progress 'There were boyfriends, one-night stands. I convinced myself that 'Oh, if I do this, they will love me'. I was always searching for a way to belong.' Of her pregnancy she added: 'Again, that was somebody who was way older than me and took advantage. Now it's appalling to think of myself at that young age in that situation with men who should know better.' She chose to have an abortion and was supported by her mother, saying now as she looks back that she wants to go back in time and give her teenage self a 'big hug'. Later in life at 26, Sue married actor James Quinn and the couple had son Elliott, now 28. However they divorced and she is now happily married to second husband, lighting technician Brian Owen. It comes after earlier this year Sue revealed she felt 'shamed and judged' before losing three stone. She has been displaying a slimmer frame of late as a result of being 'seriously ill' last year as well as giving up alcohol. Appearing as a guest panellist on Loose Women, the soap star revealed she has been treated differently while at different weights. She told how she became promiscuous and had one night stands when she was growing up as she looked for love and validation 'in all the wrong places' After losing her virginity to an older boy she ran off with a sailor at just 16 before leaving him for his older brother and soon after getting pregnant at 17 with a 35-year-old man She told The Mirror : 'I looked for love and validation and acceptance in all the wrong places and my first sexual encounters were with somebody who was four or five years older than me' She explained: 'My weight has been up down all over the place and most of it was helped by red wine. 'At the minute I am a lot thinner but I've been ill this year and for some reason my metabolism seems to have changed and because I'm not drinking. But I have been the other way and I might go back the other way.' Sue continued: 'What I hate about it is the shame that is attached to being a bigger person. The judgments made, quite often from other women. 'I find it really hard to take We're not stupid, we know we're big, we know we have a problem, we know we have an addiction, don't treat us like we are idiots. Read More Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver, 60, says she's 'come out from hiding away' after her incredible three-stone weight loss: 'I decided this decade is for me' 'Other women are shocking at it. It's so in us. Examples are when I've lost weight I go into a room and someone goes 'oh my god, you look amazing, you've lost weight' all I will hear is 'you looked like an absolute dog when you were big'. 'It's how we talk about it that makes a big difference.' Sue recently opened up on her weight loss, explaining it was part of a lifestyle overhaul. She admitted she 'over-did red wine' during the pandemic and pilled on the pounds, which inspired her to give it up. Despite her Corrie character Eileen Grimshaw spending a lot of time in The Rovers, she admitted that pubs are her 'idea of hell.' Speaking Kaye Adams on her How to be 60 podcast, in quotes obtained by The Sun, Sue explained: 'In the pandemic we all over-did things. I spent a lot of it drinking lots of lovely red wine and I put on a lot of weight doing it. 'Then I did dry January and I thought. 'I wonder what life would be like if I stopped completely?'' The actress added her husband Brian, shares different views and 'love pub culture.' 'It was my idea of hell when I drank and especially now that I don't drink,' she said. Last year, Sue insisted she's 'not obsessed over diets' as she reflected on the unfair expectations placed on women while covering the March issue of Prima magazine. She is seen on the iconic soap in 2001 She declared she would never promote any weight-related products as women have 'enough difficulties as it is'. On not being embroiled in diet culture Sue told the publication: 'I lost some weight in the jungle, but I'm not obsessing over diets: life is hard enough! 'There's always going to be outside pressure and unfair expectations placed on women, but I refuse to get pulled into it. 'That's why I'll never promote anything weight-related, and it's why I'd always rather compliment somebody on their smile or their outfit, rather than their weight.' She continued: 'Let's just let women be women – we have enough difficulties and struggles as it is.'

The safety bump comes after two assassination attempts on Barron’s Republican presidential nominee dad in the last three months. Barron, who is 18 years old, recently started attending classes at New York University’s Stern School of Business after much speculation about his choice of college. He’s since been spotted on the campus with a team of security, commuting to the school’s campus from Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. New photos snapped Monday revealed Secret Service agents flanking the 6-foot-9 student with ballistic plates and bulky backpacks. The plain-clothed officers were seen escorting Barron between NYU buildings – one with a clear bulletproof vest under his pink polo shirt. Barron meanwhile, wore a white long-sleeved polo shirt, navy pants, and blue and white striped Adidas sneakers. The ramped-up security measures come after several incidents in recent months. Shortly before a rally held by Trump in Long Island, New York on September 18, there was a security scare due to a reported potential explosive device within the area. However, law enforcement eventually confirmed that these reports were false. On September 15, just a few days prior, 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh was accused of aiming a gun at Trump while the former president was at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Routh, who is facing multiple charges, had a court appearance on Monday where he was denied bail. This marked the second assassination attempt on Trump in the last three months and as the election cycle heats up. Nearly two months to the day before that attempt, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was killed after he opened fire on a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was struck in the ear during the rally shooting, which left one man dead and two others critically injured. The former president now has increased Secret Service protections after a bipartisan bill was passed in the House of Representatives on September 20 – which could be a reason for Barron’s heightened security detail. ‘VERY KNOWN’ As The U.S. Sun previously reported, Barron’s classmates are relatively unfazed by the former president’s son’s presence. One fellow freshman, Rohan, 18, said the Secret Service “give him a little bit of a space and breathing room.” “Obviously he’s very known. Not even just from his status. Also just physically, you can tell [who he is] he’s clearly really tall,” another freshman, Aaruush, added. Aaruush added that Barron has integrated to campus life well and hasn’t been using his status as the Republican presidential candidate’s son to his advantage. “He doesn’t like to use that privilege and use that, I guess, prestige to influence other people,” he said. “You know he’s he’s trying to be as normal as possible.” Students also said they weren’t surprised by Barron’s decision to attend Stern. “I’m not too surprised because he grew up here. And so I think he wanted to stay in Manhattan,” Aaruush said. One student, Sloan, 20, told The U.S. Sun she hadn’t been aware of the Secret Service’s on-campus presence. “I hadn’t heard until I found out he was here. I wasn’t following the announcement made prior about a New York school,” Sloan said. “It wasn’t something I really followed or cared too closely about.” ‘HE’S DOING GREAT’ Barron’s decision to attend NYU was revealed by his father only weeks ago. In an interview with Daily Mail, Trump confirmed Barron’s studies were set to begin at Stern. “He’s a very smart guy, and he’ll be going to Stern, the business school, which is a great school at NYU,” Trump said. Barron is breaking from family tradition by attending NYU instead of his father’s alma matter, the University of Pennsylvania. His older siblings – Ivanka Trump, Tiffany Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. – all graduated from UPenn, following in their father’s footsteps. Still, Trump appeared pleased by Barron’s decision to attend the prestigious NYU. “He’s a very high aptitude child, but he’s no longer a child,” the former president told Daily Mail. “He’s just passed into something beyond child-dom. “He’s doing great.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBARRON Trump&#8217;s security team has been pictured using a slew of safety&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Security for Barron Trump increased by wearing bulletproof vests and large backpacks to accompany him to NYU. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/security-for-barron-trump-increased-by-wearing-bulletproof-vests-and-large-backpacks-to-accompany-him-to-nyu/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Barron-Trumps-security-ramps-up-safety-measures-by-wearing-bulletproof.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 00:02:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":257162152,"title":"Joe Biden tells Hillary Clinton ‘I love you’ after being ‘trapped’ by wife Jill into giving NYC speech","text":"President Biden professed his admiration for Bill and Hillary Clinton Monday evening after being “trapped” by his wife into giving a speech in New York City — telling the former first lady that “I love you” for defending him in public. Biden, 81, was not scheduled to give remarks at the Clinton Global Initiative’s summit, but he appeared there to support Jill Biden before being called to the stage himself to accept a Global Citizen award. “This is what you call being trapped,” Biden said, before proceeding to thank the former first couple. “Hillary, I want to thank you —and I maybe shouldn’t do this publicly — but thank you personally for the way you have helped me, the way you’ve spoken up for me with such passion. I can’t tell you — you can ask Jill. Anyway, I love you.” Hillary mouthed back “thank you” as her husband put his arm around her and gave her shoulder a squeeze. Jill Biden clapped lightly as she looked on. Biden hailed Bill Clinton for his “decency” and “incredible intellect.” The Clintons supported Biden after his calamitous June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump, with Hillary tweeting “I’ll be voting Biden,” the day after. The former first couple stood behind Biden as other leading party leaders pressured him to step aside amid questions about his mental acuity — with that ultimately successful rebellion featuring former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the side of the mutineers. Just a day before Biden caved to mounting pressure and relinquished the Democratic nomination, CNN reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton were urging donors to resume contributions to Biden. Biden, who visited New York City for this week’s United Nations General Assembly meetings, was introduced on stage Monday by Bill Clinton — who referred to his wife and Jill Biden as “the two doctors.” Hillary Clinton has a law school degree — known as a juris doctor (JD) — and Jill Biden earned a doctor of education degree in 2007 at age 55. Jill Biden has taken an increasingly prominent role as her husband prepares to retire and had four public engagements on her schedule in New York on Monday afternoon, including a speech to the Clintons’ summit and remarks to an event on gay and transgender rights and another hosted by USAID and UNICEF.","summary":"President Biden professed his admiration for Bill and Hillary Clinton Monday evening after being &#8220;trapped&#8221; by his wife into giving a speech in New York City — telling the former first lady that &#8220;I love you&#8221; for defending him in public.

(AP) — Donald Trump sat in a large barn in rural Pennsylvania on Monday, asking questions of farmers and offering jokes, but, in a rarity for his campaign events, mostly listening. The bombastic former president was unusually restrained at an event about China’s influence on the U.S. economy, a roundtable during which farmers and manufacturers expressed concerns about losing their way of life. Behind Trump were large green tractors and a sign declaring “Protect our food from China.” The event in Smithton, Pennsylvania, gave Trump a chance to drive his economic message against Vice President Kamala Harris, arguing that imposing tariffs and boosting energy production will lower costs. He highlighted Harris’ reversal of a previous vow to ban fracking, a method of producing natural gas key to Pennsylvania’s economy. And he noted the tractors behind him were manufactured by John Deere, which announced in June it was moving skid steer and track loader manufacturing to Mexico and working to acquire land there for a new factory. Trump threatened the firm with a 200% tariff should he win back the presidency and it opted to export manufacturing to Mexico. “If they want to build in the United States, there’s no tariff,” he added. Trump opened the event with some of his usual themes. He declared that in 2020, “We had an election that didn’t exactly work out too good. And it was a disgrace.” But he then did something unusual: He let others do most of the talking. When one farmer said recent decades had seen scores of family farms shut down, Trump asked what that meant for overall production. The response was that, thanks to larger farms now operating, total production is actually up but “we are losing the small family farms.” “I know that, yes,” Trump responded somberly. Later, he said, “I am not too worried about the people around this table” supporting him on Election Day, while jokingly adding, “But you never know.” In response to another participant’s concerns about energy production, Trump said he didn’t know that farmers were so energy-dependent. Another farmer talked about Chinese-subsidized businesses, prompting Trump to respond, “That’s why we need tariffs.” After the same farmer finished her comments by praising him profusely, he intoned, “Amen. I agree.” Trump has embraced tariffs as he tries to appeal to working-class voters who oppose free-trade deals and the outsourcing of factories and jobs, and the event wasn’t all about showing a more personable side. Later the former president took questions from reporters and got more customarily combative when asked whether he was concerned that tariffs on manufacturers like John Deere would increase costs for farmers. He said of Harris, “She is not going to be good for Pennsylvania.” Later Monday, Trump is holding a rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania, where he is hoping conservative, white working-class voters help him pull ahead of Harris. Stopping at a neighborhood market prior to the rally, Trump again displayed a softer side, buying a bag of popcorn and quipping to staff that if elected, he may send for more from the Oval Office. He also gave a woman paying for groceries a $100 bill, declaring that the total “just went down a hundred bucks.” Harris herself is visiting Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Attending a New York fundraiser on Monday, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov.

In response to Trump’s farming event, Harris campaign spokesman Joseph Costello said that “despite all his lies and pandering, Donald Trump used the White House to give handouts to wealthy corporations and foreign companies.” Costello said in a statement that those came “at the expense of family farmers, drive farm bankruptcies to record levels, and sacrifice small American farmers as pawns in his failed trade war with China.” Trump’s event in Smithton was hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, led by Richard Grenell, Trump’s former acting director of national intelligence, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin. Grenell said, “China is getting into our farmlands, and we have to be able to see China very clearly.” At the end of 2022, China held nearly 250,000 acres of U.S. land, which is slightly less than 1% of foreign-held acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Rex Murphy, from a nearby rural community who raises cattle and grows corn and hay, said farmers support Trump in this area, and said he wanted fewer taxes and “more freedom.” “I want him to do everything for the economy,” said Murphy, 48. “If he just becomes president, and he does what he does, he will do more.” __ Weissert reported from Washington.

(AP) — Donald Trump sat in a large barn in rural Pennsylvania on Monday, asking questions of farmers and offering jokes, but, in a rarity for his campaign events, mostly listening. The bombastic former president was unusually restrained at an event about China’s influence on the U.S. economy, a roundtable during which farmers and manufacturers expressed concerns about losing their way of life. Behind Trump were large green tractors and a sign declaring “Protect our food from China.” The event in Smithton, Pennsylvania, gave Trump a chance to drive his economic message against Vice President Kamala Harris, arguing that imposing tariffs and boosting energy production will lower costs. He highlighted Harris’ reversal of a previous vow to ban fracking, a method of producing natural gas key to Pennsylvania’s economy. And he noted the tractors behind him were manufactured by John Deere, which announced in June it was moving skid steer and track loader manufacturing to Mexico and working to acquire land there for a new factory. Trump threatened the firm with a 200% tariff should he win back the presidency and it opted to export manufacturing to Mexico. “If they want to build in the United States, there’s no tariff,” he added. Trump opened the event with some of his usual themes. He declared that in 2020, “We had an election that didn’t exactly work out too good. And it was a disgrace.” But he then did something unusual: He let others do most of the talking. When one farmer said recent decades had seen scores of family farms shut down, Trump asked what that meant for overall production. The response was that, thanks to larger farms now operating, total production is actually up but “we are losing the small family farms.” “I know that, yes,” Trump responded somberly. Later, he said, “I am not too worried about the people around this table” supporting him on Election Day, while jokingly adding, “But you never know.” In response to another participant’s concerns about energy production, Trump said he didn’t know that farmers were so energy-dependent. Another farmer talked about Chinese-subsidized businesses, prompting Trump to respond, “That’s why we need tariffs.” After the same farmer finished her comments by praising him profusely, he intoned, “Amen. I agree.” Trump has embraced tariffs as he tries to appeal to working-class voters who oppose free-trade deals and the outsourcing of factories and jobs, and the event wasn’t all about showing a more personable side. Later the former president took questions from reporters and got more customarily combative when asked whether he was concerned that tariffs on manufacturers like John Deere would increase costs for farmers. He said of Harris, “She is not going to be good for Pennsylvania.” Later Monday, Trump is holding a rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania, where he is hoping conservative, white working-class voters help him pull ahead of Harris. Stopping at a neighborhood market prior to the rally, Trump again displayed a softer side, buying a bag of popcorn and quipping to staff that if elected, he may send for more from the Oval Office. He also gave a woman paying for groceries a $100 bill, declaring that the total “just went down a hundred bucks.” Harris herself is visiting Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Attending a New York fundraiser on Monday, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, told a group of about 30 donors focused on climate change that Trump’s energy catchphrase of “drill baby, drill” is “not a solution to things, and the public knows that it’s a cheap, easy thing.” Walz, speaking at a midtown Manhattan hotel to an audience that included former presidential candidate Tom Steyer and Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, called climate change an “existential threat” but also “an incredible opportunity to grow our economy.” He specifically cited farmers who use their land to generate wind energy in addition to growing crops.

I’m going to say, ‘you have to honor the deal you made,’” Trump said at a roundtable featuring farmers at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. “We made a deal. You’d buy $50 billion worth of American farm product,’ and I guarantee you he will buy it, 100% he will buy it,” Trump added. The former president struck a deal with China in his first term in tariff negotiations between the US and Beijing, which he said included an agreement for Xi to buy $50 billion worth of American agricultural goods. Now, Trump said, China is “not living up to it.” Trump also blasted the Harris-Biden administration for how they’ve handled relations with China during their term and said he would also tell Xi to crack down on fentanyl pouring out of China and across the US-Mexico border. “Second thing I’m going to do is I’m going to say, ‘you have to give the death penalty to your fentanyl dealers who are sending fentanyl,’” Trump went on. The roundtable with Pennsylvania farmers was intended to convince the key swing state voters that Trump will do more for farmers than Vice President Kamala Harris. Both 2024 candidates have hit The Keystone State hard to sway voters their way, as winning the state would be a huge win in the fight for the needed 270 electoral votes. Trump also stumped for Republican Senate candidate David McCormick, who is fighting an electoral battle against Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.). McCormick is “going to help me make the farmers rich again,” Trump said. Trump said he would fight against China buying up American farmland, touted his policy of getting rid of the estate tax and stressed he would protect fracking. He also announced he would impose a 200% tariff on the tractor company John Deere if they decided to move their manufacturing to Mexico, as planned. “I’m just notifying John Deere right now, if you do that, we’re putting a 200% tariff on everything that you want to sell into the United States,” Trump said, arguing that the company moving to Mexico would hurt farmers. Those at the roundtable in Pennsylvania told The Post they largely agreed with Trump focusing his efforts on China. Darrell Becker, the president of the Fayette County Farm Bureau, said the US can’t afford “to ignore China” because “they’re our biggest threat in the entire world and they want to replace us.” Eric Davanzo, representative of the 58th district in the Pa.

Just one of the defendants, Eliazar Cisneros, was ordered to pay $30,000 in damages to the plaintiffs and $10,000 to the bus driver, Timothy Holloway. The court’s decision comes after the so-called Trump Train drivers faced a lawsuit for following and boxing in a campaign bus for President Joe Biden on Oct. 30, 2020. The New Braunfels Trump Train was comprised of a group of trucks waving Trump and American flags that trailed the campaign bus down a Texas highway for roughly 90 minutes. After one defendant collided with a campaign volunteer’s car, all drivers were reduced to a 15 mph crawl. Texas Democrats canceled three scheduled campaign events that day due to “safety concerns,” while Democratic state Rep. Terry Canales asked the Texas Department of Public Safety to open an investigation into the “multi-county, criminal behavior on 1-35.” Passengers on the bus, including former Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis and former Biden campaign staffer David Gins, sued the drivers in 2021, alleging they feared for their lives. “Dangerously surrounding somebody on the highway, anyone, a Republican, Democrat, anyone on the highway and forcing them out of town isn’t OK, doesn’t have a place in Texas, doesn’t have a place in America and it has consequences,” prosecuting attorney Samuel Hall said during an opening statement at the trial. Although the Democrats claimed the drivers participated in an orchestrated conspiracy, the defendants argued they had no knowledge of each other before or during the incident. When the incident occurred in 2020, Trump criticized the FBI for opening an investigation into the incident as he defended “patriots” who did “nothing wrong.” In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong.

A lawyer for one of the defendants argued that while her actions may have “not been likable,” they failed to meet the threshold of violating the law. “It may not be likable. It may not be her proudest moment. But it’s not a violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act,” Erin Mersino, a lawyer for defendant Dolores Park said.","summary":"A Texas jury cleared nearly all six supporters of former President Donald Trump who were accused of threatening Biden campaign officials on a bus four years ago.  On Monday, a seven-person Austin jury found five Trump supporters innocent of violating the Ku Klux Klan Act, an 1871 federal law targeting political violence and intimidation tactics.

The words aren’t only his, though — they’re also the slogans and cliches of Trump’s Democratic opponents, virtually verbatim. Ryan Routh left a letter with a friend, months ago, to apologize in case his assassination attempt failed. What’s been released so far makes Routh’s political motives clear — he saw Trump as dangerously unfit for the presidency and a threat to peace. Routh was especially incensed Trump terminated Barack Obama’s deal with Iran: Trump, he wrote, “Ended relations with Iran like a child and now the Middle East has unraveled.” America’s president, according to the would-be killer, “must at bare minimum embody the moral fabric that is America and be kind, caring, and selfless and always stand for humanity.” If this all sounds familiar, it’s because Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Trump’s legion of Democratic and ex-Republican detractors have supplied the premises for stopping the former president by any means possible. After all, if democracy really is at stake in November, voters themselves must be suicidal even to consider voting for Trump. To save democracy in such an emergency might well seem to call for extreme measures of a sort that no politician would dare endorse — but that a true believer might be prepared to hazard. Harris, Biden, and other Democratic leaders are quick to lament political violence; they have a responsibility to do more, however, by acknowledging that whatever their differences with Trump, his election does not mean the end of constitutional government. President Trump was not a tyrant, he isn’t poised to become one if re-elected — and, most importantly, killing him is nothing like justifiable tyrannicide. If Democrats could bring themselves to say this, they would do wonders for the emotional health of some of their own supporters — and might just save lives, including but not only Trump’s. The chilling thing about Routh’s letter is that it’s not a mindless, stream-of-consciousness rant: it’s an assassin’s manifesto written in the bland language of ordinary anti-Trump discourse.

Kirsten Gillibrand both described Trump as a menace to America’s “moral fabric.” “One of the worst things about President Trump . . . is he’s torn apart the moral fabric of who we are,” Gillibrand said in one Democratic debate, while Biden accused Trump of shredding “America’s invisible moral fabric.” Routh’s “kind, caring, and selfless” description of a good president — one he presumably wouldn’t murder — sounds generic, yet closely tracks Kamala Harris’s endorsement of Biden four years ago as “kind and endlessly caring” and possessed of “selfless courage.” Those words are obviously not incitements to violence: they simply testify to how little original thinking was taking place in Routh’s head. In the empty space between his ears there was a great echo chamber, reverberating with whatever he heard from Democrats and the anti-Trump hype machine. Routh wasn’t just soaking up the syllables of anti-Trump rhetoric, he was internalizing a mindset that presents Trump as an enemy of humanity itself, not only immature but malevolent. Democrats have created an extraordinary climate of fear around Trump, and if they don’t weigh their words more carefully, more violence will follow from the likes of Ryan Routh.","summary":"The man who intended to murder Donald Trump has explained in his own words why he wanted to do it.

That she’s Indian,” the 58-year-old singer said. When the reporter replied that the vice president’s parents were Indian and Jamaican, Jackson responded that “her father’s white.” “That’s what I was told,” she said, adding, “I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white.” The pop star received backlash for her comments in her wide-ranging interview while she was promoting her concert tour in Europe. Navarro called Jackson “very irresponsible” on Monday and said the singer spoke “carelessly, to spread misinformation.” “What she did was spread misinformation,” Navarro said. “I think it’s irresponsible when you have a platform the way Janet Jackson does, to use that platform carelessly to spread misinformation based on a racist allegation by Donald Trump.

Ill) was asked in Boston what the Democrats’ plan was for dealing with Iran, designated even then by our State Department as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism and well on its way to acquiring nuclear weapons. “I don’t know,” Durbin replied. “With any luck Israel will do something about it, and we’ll all blame Israel.” When the Obama White House was fairly begging Iran for a deal to temporarily slow Iran’s race to obtain those weapons in 2015, critics of the proposed deal pointed out that what the administration was offering would come back to bite the world – painfully. Desperate to announce a deal that would kick the can down the road knowing that future leaders would have to deal with the consequences, President Obama offered Iran about $100 billion in unfrozen assets and the removal of sanctions on its oil industry. Cash and oil gushed for the mullahs. The critics observed that the cash was unlikely to be used to build greenhouses, but would instead flow to the terror groups which, funded, supplied and trained by Tehran, had already established themselves as accomplished mass murderers. Hamas and Hezbollah among them, these were savage, jihadist enterprises which were demonstrably skilled at slaughter. Hezbollah, which carries the comforting meaning “Party of God,” was by then already responsible for numerous massacres of Americans. In 1983, it carried out bombings at the American Embassy in Beirut that killed 300 people, mostly Americans. In 1984 it killed 18 American servicemen in Spain, injuring 83. That year it also killed 11 Americans near an Embassy annex in Lebanon. In 1996 it killed 19 American Air Force personnel in a bombing in Saudi Arabia, injuring 372. Hezbollah forcibly occupies Lebanon, effectively controlling it with a well-trained army furnished by Iran. In 2006 it fired thousands of rockets at Israeli civilian centers, each rocket a war crime. It has carried out assassinations globally. Those who had the temerity to point out that the terms of its Iran deal would mean billions of dollars for Iran’s proxies were dismissed and derided by the Obama White House. Their loyalty to America was questioned, and they were labeled “neo-cons” and “warmongers.” Now, thanks to that hubris, Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis are flush with the cash that we handed to Iran. Hamas has massacred over 1,200 Israelis, and is responsible for the deaths of thousands of Gazans who Hamas decided better served Hamas dead than alive. Hezbollah has an estimated 150,000 rockets aimed at Israel that are perched on Israel’s border. It has fired 8,500 of them at Israeli communities since Oct. 8, citing Israel’s “aggression” the previous day. About 80,000 Israelis have had to evacuate their homes as a result. The Houthis, another Iranian proxy, fire drones at American assets and personnel, and we satisfy ourselves by announcing when we have intercepted some of them. In the meantime, Iran is providing drones and other weapons paid for by the Obama administration to Vladimir Putin – who badly needs them to continue pulverizing Ukraine. The Democrats rightfully note that they, and not the Republicans, have stood strong on Russia, while Republicans, led by Donald Trump, have stood weak. But Democrats have no more plan to deal with Iran than they did in 2006, and their party is plagued by useful fools like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and others, who sympathize, let’s face it, with Iran’s proxies and not with their victims. There is a real risk that if Democrats retain the White House, their administration will be staffed with the same sorts of ideologues and ostriches who waved aside the cash handed over to Iran in 2015 as no problem. If there is another presidential debate, the moderators should ask the two candidates: given the threat that Iran poses both because of its imminent acquisition of nuclear weapons and its lavish support of terror, what is your plan for dealing with it? Neither party has answered the question thus far. Somebody needs to, and quickly.

Pro-Zionist organization Betar USA wants the mayor’s office to remove the images that customers need to step on in order to enter The King of Falafel and Shawarma located in Astoria, slamming it as “anti-Semitic and anti-American materials” on public property. Israeli and American leaders are even labeled war criminals as part of the inflammatory display that is considerably worn after being there for months. The images on the sidewalk — and on the restaurant’s interior floor — also feature Israel’s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir, former President Donald Trump, ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Gov. Kathy Hochul, Mayor Eric Adams and other leaders that the owner believes has been overly supportive of Israel. Betar spokesperson Meredith Weiss said the organization wants to see the posters on the public sidewalk scrapped by the city right away. “If the falafel restaurant owner in question genuinely cared for the welfare of the people of Gaza, their focus would be on condemning the oppressive leadership of Hamas,” Weiss said in a statement to The Post. “This was nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt to display hatred — of Jews and America. These actors of hate are fundamentally un-American and have no place in New York.” “Enough with empty words. It is time for responsible leaders to rise above divisive rhetoric and take a stand, rather than perpetuating an agenda rooted in hatred,” she added. Betar’s letter sent to City Hall on Friday argued the city “has become increasingly unrecognizable as authorities appear to turn a blind eye to violence and hatred, allowing an atmosphere of hostility towards the Jewish community to persist.” Queens rabbi David Aglaze called the imagery “inappropriate” and an “incitement to hate.” “It’s really the greatest demonstration of, of their lack of sensitivity and humanity, to step on people’s face is a form also of incitement to violence,” said the rabbi of Havurat Yisrael of Forest Hills. “It’s a form of dividing the community and making people hate one another — and that’s tragic.” But owner Fares “Freddy” Paideia, who sells authentic Palestinian street food, insisted the display is not antisemitic, and he isn’t just targeting Jewish leaders. He argued he’s an “equal opportunity” pro-Palestine protester, noting he also has pictures of Saudi Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman and Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas on the ground because he believes they’ve previously been friendly with Israel. “It’s not just about being Jewish. I have Middle Easterners,” Paideia told The Post on Sunday. “I have the Palestinian leader. I’m not being specific about a certain group.” He said he placed the posters on the sidewalk after he got increasingly upset over the conflict in Gaza that was sparked when Hamas terrorists slaughtered 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped 250 more back to the Palestinian enclave in a brutal sneak attack. “If I just had only Israeli leaders, I would understand why they’d be upset. But I’m not being specific,” he said, insisting he chose a form of protest that doesn’t harm anyone and that he supports a two-state solution. The inside of the restaurant, in addition to world leaders on the floor, also has a mural on the wall that depicts the bloody war in Gaza with bombs destroying buildings and killing civilians, including journalists and children. Paideia is used to stirring the political pot, noting a few years ago the Saudis were “trolling me like crazy.” Social distancing decals had photos of Bin Salman and United Arab Emirates President Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan caused the uproar, the Queens Chronicle reported at the time. “It’s not a big deal. I think I had about 40,000 one-star reviews in about 24 hours,” he claimed. His action has been cheered on by Jordanian-Palestinian writer and activist Sam Husseini who tweeted Sunday, “On the floor, you step on genociders” and a Halal Instagram account that wrote, “Stepping on Netanyahu’s face was therapeutic.” The Department of Transportation is looking into the matter, according to city officials. “Mayor Adams unequivocally stands against all forms of hate speech and discrimination,” a spokesperson said in a statement. Paideia said if city officials want to remove the images on the sidewalk, he won’t fight it. “It’s my first two feet. That’s about it. If they want to come and take it out, they can take it out. I have no problem,” he said. “I still have the inside and the bathroom.” Additional reporting by Aneeta Bhole","summary":"“This was nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt to display hatred — of Jews and America.

As the current state superintendent of public instruction, Tony Thurmond seeks your support in his bid to be governor of California. The findings noted in this article covered his tenure directing public education. Elevating obscurity to mask ongoing failures does not bode well for a gubernatorial candidate. Public education continued with a lack of accountability; Thurmond’s failure to promote significant movement toward accountability while leading public education should not be rewarded. With a ‘D’ grade in education, Thurmond’s calling lies elsewhere; that calling is not California’s next governor.

In response to the letter about how the “state isn’t helping PG&E customers” deal with the utility’s greed, the writer should know that it’s up to our governor to appoint California Public Utility Commission members who will act in the interests of California citizens and ratepayers. Instead, what we’ve gotten for many years are appointees with ties to the investor-owned utilities who give them whatever they ask for rather than properly regulate them as they are expected to do. This corruption has been going on for a long time and will likely continue as long as the utilities can pay big donations to campaigns and offer high-paying jobs as rewards to their government benefactors. Beth Weinberger Oakland GOP leaders are late with Trump denunciation Re: “111 former GOP officials are backing Harris, call Trump ‘unfit to serve’” (Page A3, Sept. 19). I find it very irritating that one month before the national election, 111 former GOP officials decided to go public and endorse Kamala Harris because they believe Donald Trump is unfit to serve. I am not saying they are wrong, but their timing is unacceptable. Where were they during the primaries when they could have impacted the selection of the GOP presidential candidate? If they had spoken up then, they may have engineered the selection of a worthwhile Republican candidate. The Democrats have stood up twice in the last two elections to sway the primaries. First when they were afraid that Bernie Sanders was sure to win the nomination and, in one Super Tuesday, selected Biden. This time around they ousted Joe Biden, who was seen as medically unfit and sure to lose to Trump. Now the Republican Party is a disaster and may never recover and we will move closer to socialism.

My goodness, America is a constitutional republic, not a “democracy,” for good reason. I present to you in microcosm an example of how a so-called democracy works; But if you extrapolate that nationally, America absolutely becomes a one-party country. This may meld with the desire of some to govern our great country from the left. However, the founders brilliantly anticipated that problem, allowing for the the individual voters to select their national legislators individually while giving the underrepresented citizens some say in national government. We need to continue this method of government. The alternative ain’t pretty.

The official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), speaking on condition of anonymity, made the comment in a briefing to reporters on the alleged use of artificial intelligence (AI) by Russia and other countries to influence the November 5 vote. AI content produced by Moscow is “consistent with Russia’s broader efforts to boost the former president’s [Trump] candidacy and denigrate the vice-president [Harris] and the Democratic Party, including through conspiratorial narratives,” he said. China has been using AI content in an attempt to influence how it is perceived worldwide, but not to sway the outcome of the US election, the official said. “China is using AI in broader influence operations seeking to shape global views of China and amplify divisive US political issues,” the official said. “We are not yet seeing China use AI for any specific operations targeting US election outcomes.” The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia previously has denied interfering in the US election. Like other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI learns from past data how to take actions. Using that training, it creates new content such as text, pictures and videos that appears to have been produced by humans. The ODNI official said Russia is generating more AI content to influence the November election than any other country, but did not provide a volume of that AI content. He said Russia was a much more sophisticated actor and had a better understanding of how US elections work and appropriate targets. Asked how Russia was disseminating AI content, the official pointed to a July 9 Justice Department announcement of the disruption of an alleged Moscow-backed operation that used AI-enhanced social media accounts to spread pro-Kremlin messages in the US and elsewhere. The official said “Russian influence actors” staged a widely reported video in which a woman claimed she was a victim of a hit-and-run car accident by Harris. The video, however, was staged rather than produced through AI, he said. Microsoft said last week its research showed that video was the work of a covert Russian disinformation operation. Iranian influence actors have used AI to help generate posts for social media and “write inauthentic news articles for websites that claim to be real news sites”, the official said. The content created by the Iranian actors is in English and Spanish. It has targeted American voters “across the political spectrum on polarising issues” such as Israel and the conflict in Gaza, and on the presidential candidates, the official said. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Only one of the six Trump supporters who were sued in the civil trial was held responsible by the jury. A Texas man whose car brushed up against another as the caravan of vehicles dubbed the “Trump Train” raced down Interstate 35 was ordered to pay the bus driver $10,000 and another $30,000 in punitive damages. Both sides declared victory at the end of a two-week trial in an Austin courthouse. The five Trump supporters cleared in the lawsuit – which was brought by three people aboard the campaign bus, including former Texas Democratic lawmaker Wendy Davis – described the verdict as vindicating and a relief. “We’re just ready to feel like normal people again,” said Joeylynn Mesaros, one of the defendants, who described being harassed for participating in the ‘Trump Train.’ “It’s been a thousand something days to have our day in court.” Attorneys for those aboard the bus said justice was served, even as they disagreed with the jury’s decision to clear five of the defendants. “When I came to this case, it was never about politics that day. I’m grateful, I’m proud of my team,” said Tim Holloway, who was behind the wheel of the campaign bus on Oct. 30, 2020. The Biden-Harris campaign bus was traveling from San Antonio to Austin for an event when a group of cars and pickup trucks waving Trump flags boxed in the bus on the highway. Davis testified she feared for her life. Video that Davis recorded from the bus shows one of the defendants, Eliazar Cisneros, hit a campaign volunteer’s car while the trucks occupied all lanes of traffic, forcing the bus and everyone around it to a 15 mph crawl. It was the last day of early voting in Texas and the bus was scheduled to stop at San Marcos for an event at Texas State University. The event was canceled after Davis and others on the bus – a campaign staffer and the driver – made repeated calls to 911 asking for a police escort through San Marcos and no help arrived. The trial centered on whether the actions of the “Trump Train” participants amounted to political intimidation. No criminal charges were filed against the six Trump supporters. An attorney for Cisneros, the only member of the convoy who the jury found liable, said they would appeal. “With regard to my client, it’s not over yet,” attorney Francisco Canseco said. Davis testified that she felt scared and anxious throughout the ordeal. “I feel like they were enjoying making us afraid,” she testified. “It’s traumatic for all of us to revisit that day.”","summary":"The jury found one person liable in a civil trial over a so-called 'Trump Train' that surrounded a Biden-Harris campaign bus in 2020.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/23/texas-jury-clears-most-trump-train-drivers-in-trial-over-biden-harris-bus-encounter/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Trump_Train_Trial_Things_to_Know_31086_ef2f55.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:26:11","author":"Nadia Lathan,NADIA LATHAN - Associated Press","authors":["Nadia Lathan","NADIA LATHAN - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":257160806,"title":"Watch live: Donald Trump holds rally in battleground Pennsylvania","text":"Watch live as Donald Trump holds a rally in battleground Pennsylvania on Monday (23 September).

Mark Robinson,” Wooden said, explaining to the congregation that he’d gotten a call from a local reporter on Friday and that the news media — me — was sitting among them that morning. “I called him Friday,” Wooden said, referring to Robinson, “and spoke to him myself.” Robinson’s history of comments that have been widely criticized as antisemitic and anti-gay made him a deeply polarizing figure in North Carolina long before his bid for governor was upended last week by a CNN report that he had called himself a “Black NAZI” and praised slavery while posting on a pornographic website between 2008 and 2012. Now, some of his allies are abandoning him. Most of his senior campaign staff members have resigned. The Republican Governors Association said that its pro-Robinson ads would expire tomorrow and that no new ones had been placed. And former President Donald Trump, who endorsed Robinson in the spring, calling him “Martin Luther King on steroids,” did not mention him once during his rally in the state over the weekend. Four days after the report was published, Robinson has insisted that he won’t drop out of the race. And a visit to Upper Room, a deeply conservative Black evangelical church with its own outspoken leader whom Robinson has spent years getting to know, was a window into a place where he still has support.","summary":"At a Black evangelical church in North Carolina, the candidate for governor still has support.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/us/politics/in-north-carolina-a-snapshot-of-mark-robinsons-enduring-support.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/23-pol-on-politics-newsletter-robinson-topart-ftlw/23-pol-on-politics-newsletter-robinson-topart-ftlw-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:19:52","author":"Jess Bidgood","authors":["Jess Bidgood"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":257160146,"title":"RFK Jr. seen for the first time post-cheating scandal with Olivia Nuzzi, considering possible legal action over explicit photos","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. isn’t shirking from the limelight amid his bombshell sexting scandal with New York Magazine’s Olivia Nuzzi. On Monday, Kennedy appeared at an event on Capitol Hill and posed for photos with prominent Republican lawmakers. Ahead of the Monday event, GOP Rep. Thomas Massie shared a picture with Kennedy, noting that they had dined together Sunday night. Fellow Republicans, Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Chip Roy, also shared snaps with Kennedy, while Sen. Ron Johnson had him appear on a panel discussion entitled: ‘American Health and Nutrition: A Second Opinion.’ The tour of Washington comes as Kennedy is reportedly considering suing Nuzzi over the pornographic content she sent to him. Jessica Read Kraus, who writes the popular House Inhabit Substack, wrote Saturday that Kennedy is exploring his legal options after Nuzzi allegedly ‘bombarded him with increasingly pornographic photos and videos.’ Kraus, who has generally covered Kennedy in a positive manner, wrote that Nuzzi would prod her for information about the now-former presidential candidate. ‘There was an undercurrent of fascination that went beyond journalistic intrigue, bordering on obsession,’ she wrote. Nuzzi’s ‘constant desire for updates, coupled with the tone of her inquiries, made it clear she wasn’t merely reporting: She was weaving some kind of fantasy.’ ‘I could sense her emotional investment growing. In that shift, the gossip centered less on politics and more on tracking and dissecting his every move,’ Kraus said. She reported that those in Kennedy’s orbit believe Nuzzi was trying to ‘set him up.’ Nuzzi, Kraus reported, made a ‘flirtatious remark during a phone conversation,’ which led the independent candidate to block the prominent journalist. In turn, Nuzzi reached out to Kennedy via email to have him unblock her number ‘but later that night, she sent him a provocative picture, prompting him to block her again,’ Kraus’ account said. Security expert Gavin de Becker is investigating the situation to see if Kennedy can file a civil suit against Nuzzi, Kraus reported. ‘This has nothing to do with romance,’ de Becker told Kraus. ‘He was being chased by porn.’ The Daily Beast reported Sunday that the sexting scandal came to light due to Kennedy boasting to friends that he had intimate photos of Nuzzi – and word made it back to New York’s editor-in-chief David Haskell. Nuzzi hasn’t responded to outreach from DailyMail.com. Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race in August, a day after the Democratic National Convention concluded, and endorsed Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. Kennedy, a prominent anti-vaxxer, said that he and Trump are aligned on the goal of making Americans healthy again. During his afternoon spent on Capitol Hill, Kennedy talked about overmedicating Americans and how disturbed he is that micro-plastics are being found in people’s brains. He also volunteered that he didn’t eat anything that came in a package, pushing that Americans needed to get away from processed food. Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, commended Kennedy’s work in this arena. ‘I don’t know anybody who’s been more vilified and ridiculed and marginalized or canceled or paid as heavy a personal price for advocating for children’s health, for making decisions you made over the last couple of years and literally in the last month or two,’ Johnson – a strong supporter of Trump – said of Kennedy.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRobert F.

Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina who is now the GOP’s gubernatorial nominee, suggested that the comments in which he apparently called himself a “black NAZI,” yearned for the restoration of slavery, and enjoyed reading Mein Kampf could have been artificially generated. “Look, I’m not going to get into the minutiae about how somebody manufactured these salacious tabloid lies,” Robinson told CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, who broke the original story. “But I can tell you this: There’s been over $1 million spent on me through AI by a billionaire’s son who’s bound and determined to destroy me. The things that people can do with the internet now is incredible,” Robinson insisted. “But what I can tell you is this: Again, these are not my words.” Robinson’s claims of fakery—AI or otherwise—are extremely unlikely. As The Washington Post’s Philip Bump notes, the CNN report linking Robinson to the porn site known as “Nude Africa” was “robust,” exposing “a digital trail that would be all but impossible to create artificially.” And not everyone in the GOP is buying Robinson’s excuse. Much of his senior staff has resigned, and the Trump campaign is reportedly distancing itself from Robinson, although Donald Trump’s endorsement of Robinson still stands. But the existence of AI aids Robinson in his shoddy defense: Not only can the technology make fake stories believable, but its existence helps those who want to make true stories seem unbelievable. In this election, invoking AI is yet another tool for some Americans to alter facts so that they align with their desired reality. Trump, for example, falsely accused Kamala Harris of using AI to generate an image showing a large crowd at a rally. (Meanwhile, he himself has spread illusions online: He recently reposted a doctored photo of Harris with the accused sex offender Sean “Diddy” Combs—whose face is actually superimposed on the body of Montel Williams; Trump also shared a fake endorsement from Taylor Swift last month.) To be sure, many fake images of politicians—including Donald Trump—proliferate online, some of which use AI, but because this technology sows doubt about reality, it can also provide a convenient dodge for politicians confronted by uncomfortable facts. Insinuating that AI played a role is just one of the tactics that Robinson and his defenders are using. Others have argued that the allegations are a targeted political attack without identifying exactly how such supposed lies were created. The GOP’s candidate for North Carolina attorney general, Dan Bishop, called the CNN report “a meticulously timed and coordinated character assassination.” The North Carolina Republican Party released a statement hours after the report was published, citing Robinson’s denial and accused “the Left” of “trying to demonize him via personal attacks.” Others are using vague language to avoid taking a stand. Consider, for example, this tangled double negative from J. D. Vance when he was asked about Robinson’s denial: “I don’t not believe him; I don’t believe him—I just think you have to let these things play out sometimes in the court of public opinion.” Lindsey Graham also toed a careful line, although with clearer language. “The charges are beyond unnerving. If they’re true, he’s unfit to serve for office,” Graham said. But he seemed to leave the door open to the possibility that the story was false. “If they’re not true,” Graham said, “he has the best lawsuit in the history of the country, for libel.” Then there are those who simply don’t care about the allegations. At a Trump rally in North Carolina over the weekend, The New York Times found that while few in attendance believed the story—many blamed the untrustworthiness of the media, according to the Times—some would support Robinson even if the reports of his racist, anti-Semitic, transphobic, and obscene posts were real. “Bryan Faulcon, 39, of Wilmington, said he didn’t believe the allegations,” the Times reported, “but even if they were true, Mr. Robinson still had his vote. The calculation was simple, Mr. Faulcon said: policy over character.” Indeed, if these allegations mattered to voters, they would not have nominated Robinson in the first place, would they? This is, after all, someone who called the Holocaust “a bunch of hogwash,” referred to transgenderism and homosexuality as “filth,” and suggested this summer that “some folks need killing.” North Carolina’s GOP voters had ample evidence of who he was, and they chose him anyway. While some of the MAGA faithful have grabbed onto convenient manipulations of the evidence in front of them, these voters’ approach seems to be acceptance.

On Sunday, Sept. 22, the Paramore bandleader, 35, shared an Instagram Story where a user accused her of \"reading a script\" and asked if she was \"paid or blackmailed\" for taking aim at Trump on Friday, Sept. 20 at the Las Vegas music event. \"whoever you are, i typed out my speech and had a crew member hold it near the camera for me in case i got nervous bc what i had to say was important and i didn’t want to trip up in the moment. didn’t end up looking at it though… that’s because i prepared,\" Williams said of . She added: \"finally, not only was i *not* paid to make the speech but we (paramore) didn’t get paid to play that radio fest either. just out here kicking ass for free i guess 🙁 thanks so much for your concern and for spelling my name right, bye!\" Williams didn't hold back her feelings about the Republican presidential candidate running against Kamala Harris during Paramore's performance on Friday. “Project 2025 is Donald Trump’s playbook for controlling and punishing women, poor people, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community,” she said. “It is time for all Americans to band together and to finally defeat the Trump agenda.

Gender-affirming health care for all, including our youth, is a necessity,” she wrote, per Teen Vogue. \"Once again our state has passed two regressive and unfathomably harmful bills. We stand in solidarity with our LGBTQIA+ family and local LGBTQIA+ orgs in this fight, not only for inclusion for our friends & family in the queer community, but for radical acceptance and empowerment for each of them.”","summary":"&#34;I typed out my speech and had a crew member hold it near the camera for me in case I got nervous,&#34; Williams wrote in an Instagram Story","url":"https://people.com/paramore-hayley-williams-responds-criticism-she-read-from-script-while-denouncing-donald-trump-concert-8716971","image":"https://people.com/thmb/kiQFSkYJojPWnvbSDWQQ_sTSQP8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(790x230:792x232)/hayley-williams-iheart-music-festival-tout-092324-fa4a1157cf9e4e36b0c6264ae85b3cf2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:15:00","author":"Ilana Kaplan","authors":["Ilana Kaplan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":257163146,"title":"Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris strip naked for eye-popping sauna scenes and receive bombshell health news on new BBC travel series Road Tripping","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Streaming Reality Daytime Film Soaps My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Tuesday, Sep 24th 2024 1AM 13°C 4AM 13°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris strip naked for eye-popping sauna scenes and receive bombshell health news on new BBC travel series Road Tripping Have YOU got a story?

The first episode, entitled Sweden, will follow the pair's journey to Sweden as they visit one of the 'healthiest outdoorsy' place on earth. They quickly plunge straight into mastering the art of the Nordic mindset of ‘friluftsliv’, which consists in getting back to nature & embracing the great outdoors.

Promising plenty of surprises already in the first episode, the duo will also get on a arduous hike on a remote island, followed by some ice cold swimming across a lake for final reflections and some Swedish ‘fire water' around a fire pit. The following episode, Greece, investigate how to 'age gracefully, or less dis-gracefully' as they touch down on the Greek rocky Island of Ikaria - named the island of longevity. One in three Ikarians live well into their 90s, ten years more than most people in the UK and Paddy and Chris are on a mission to find out how. During the episode, they meet a typical Ikarian family while in the Highland Plateau, who embodies the simple way of life and are set to work earning their self-sufficiency stripes, with Chris milking goats and Paddy set to work putting up fences. As they whisk off to the southern side of the island, they go fishing with Stavros, a 75-year-old fisherman - who has no plans to ever retire. Chris and Paddy even enjoyed riding some waves as surfing is a great activity in the island. For the penultimate day, Paddy challenges himself with rock climbing - but Chris was not one to join him due to his fear of heights.

Speaking about his experience on the show, Paddy said: 'We’ve really tried to tap into both the traditional and modern methods of ‘living well’ that is adopted by each of the countries we visit. From Swedish saunas, to milking goats, rock climbing, and even visiting a ‘Gentleman’s clinic’...you name it and we try it!' The TV favourite also added the Greek island of Ikaria was so far his favourite place as it allowed him to 'see people leave all the complications of modern day life and technology behind, and just getting out there and enjoying everything life has to offer. While praising his journey companion, Paddy said: 'I could mention many things about the enigma that is Chris Harris, but alongside all the laughs and banter, we genuinely learn a lot about ourselves and each other on this trip, which has been eye-opening. 'I have also learnt, however, that Chris has terrible taste in music and should never be given control of the car radio again!' On their final day, Chris and Paddy head to the hills on scooters and join one of the island's famous village parties - a Panigiri 'We’ve really tried to tap into both the traditional and modern methods of ‘living well’ that is adopted by each of the countries we visit.

'I’ve learnt a lot about my own health during the trip, some of which really shocked me, so I’ll definitely be taking forward the advice I’ve been given.

The TV presenter, 51, and the professional racing driver, 49, will be delighting fans with their eagerly-anticipated travel series - kicking off on Sunday 29 September on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. Paddy and Chris: Road Tripping will be shown in three parts, and see the duo tackle everything from surfing to trying out rollercoasters, working out in the woods and testing cosmetics as they find out how Europeans make the most of their later years. The first episode, entitled Sweden, will follow the pair's journey to Sweden as they visit one of the 'healthiest outdoorsy' place on earth. They quickly plunge straight into mastering the art of the Nordic mindset of ‘friluftsliv’, which consists in getting back to nature & embracing the great outdoors. Paddy McGuinnes (L) and Chris Harris (R) have stripped naked to shoot some eye-popping sauna scenes and also received a bombshell health news as they appeared on their new BBC's Road Tripping The TV presenter, 51, and the professional racing driver, 49, will be delighting fans with their eagerly-anticipated travel series - set to begin on Sunday 29 September on BBC and BBC iPlayer Swedes swear by ‘friluftsliv’ to restore body confidence, calm stress levels, and ultimately improve mental health. Promising plenty of surprises already in the first episode, the duo will also get on a arduous hike on a remote island, followed by some ice cold swimming across a lake for final reflections and some Swedish ‘fire water' around a fire pit. The following episode, Greece, investigate how to 'age gracefully, or less dis-gracefully' as they touch down on the Greek rocky Island of Ikaria - named the island of longevity. One in three Ikarians live well into their 90s, ten years more than most people in the UK and Paddy and Chris are on a mission to find out how. During the episode, they meet a typical Ikarian family while in the Highland Plateau, who embodies the simple way of life and are set to work earning their self-sufficiency stripes, with Chris milking goats and Paddy set to work putting up fences. As they whisk off to the southern side of the island, they go fishing with Stavros, a 75-year-old fisherman - who has no plans to ever retire. Chris and Paddy even enjoyed riding some waves as surfing is a great activity in the island. For the penultimate day, Paddy challenges himself with rock climbing - but Chris was not one to join him due to his fear of heights.

And for their third and final episode, Switzerland, the brave pair headed to explore its multi-million-pound wellness industry. They travelled to one of the country’s top wellness resorts for a full body MOT to assess how well they’re ageing. Speaking about his experience on the show, Paddy said: 'We’ve really tried to tap into both the traditional and modern methods of ‘living well’ that is adopted by each of the countries we visit. From Swedish saunas, to milking goats, rock climbing, and even visiting a ‘Gentleman’s clinic’...you name it and we try it!' The TV favourite also added the Greek island of Ikaria was so far his favourite place as it allowed him to 'see people leave all the complications of modern day life and technology behind, and just getting out there and enjoying everything life has to offer. While praising his journey companion, Paddy said: 'I could mention many things about the enigma that is Chris Harris, but alongside all the laughs and banter, we genuinely learn a lot about ourselves and each other on this trip, which has been eye-opening. 'I have also learnt, however, that Chris has terrible taste in music and should never be given control of the car radio again!' On their final day, Chris and Paddy head to the hills on scooters and join one of the island's famous village parties - a Panigiri 'We’ve really tried to tap into both the traditional and modern methods of ‘living well’ that is adopted by each of the countries we visit. From Swedish saunas, to milking goats, rock climbing, and even visiting a ‘Gentleman’s clinic’...you name it and we try it!,' said Paddy Chris added about the experience: 'I’ve learnt a lot about my own health during the trip, some of which really shocked me, so I’ll definitely be taking forward the advice I’ve been given' Meanwhile racing driver Chris described the experience as a 'deep-dive into the secrets of human longevity'. 'I’ve learnt a lot about my own health during the trip, some of which really shocked me, so I’ll definitely be taking forward the advice I’ve been given. 'I’ve also learnt that life is for living, so plan to do plenty of that as well!' Chris added.

It is utilizing text, images, audio, and video in the content the Russians have produced. “The IC is observing foreign actors, including Russia and Iran, use generative AI technology to boost their respective U.S. election efforts. … Our update today makes clear that this is now happening here. Foreign actors are using AI to more quickly and convincingly” produce that content, an ODNI official told reporters. The official said their use of AI is more like “an accelerant rather than a revolutionary tool,” adding that “information operations are the threat, and AI is an enabler, generative AI is how to improve and accelerate aspects of foreign influence operations. But thus far, the IC has not seen it revolutionize such operations.” The update also noted that Russia is still boosting former President Donald Trump and denigrating Vice President Kamala Harris. In one example of Russia’s influence attempts that was not AI generated, a Kremlin-aligned troll farm recently faked a video laundered through a website staged to look like a San Francisco media outlet that fabricated inaccurate claims about Harris’s involvement in a hit-and-run accident, Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center revealed last week. The website was created only days earlier. Comparatively, Iran has used AI to write fake news articles for fake news websites it set up that pose as legitimate news outlets. These outlets, and corresponding social media posts, have targeted Americans across the political spectrum on polarizing issues including on presidential candidates. Iran’s election interference operations unrelated to AI include hacking the Trump campaign and then offering that information to both U.S. media outlets and the then-Biden campaign. “This malicious cyber activity is the latest example of Iran’s multipronged approach, as noted in the joint August statement, to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process,” the FBI said in its announcement. “As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER China, for its part, is not boosting either candidate ahead of the election, though it is using AI to stoke division among Americans by promoting divisive U.S. issues like abortion and immigration.

Only one of the six Trump supporters who were sued in the civil trial was held responsible by the jury. A Texas man whose car brushed up against another as the caravan of vehicles dubbed the “Trump Train” raced down Interstate 35, was ordered to pay the bus driver $10,000 and another $30,000 in punitive damages. Both sides declared victory at the end of a two-week trial in an Austin courthouse. The five Trump supporters cleared in the lawsuit — which was brought by three people aboard the campaign bus, including former Texas Democratic lawmaker Wendy Davis — described the verdict as vindicating and a relief. “We’re just ready to feel like normal people again,” said Joeylynn Mesaros, one of the defendants, who described being harassed for participating in the ‘Trump Train.’ “It’s been a thousand something days to have our day in court.” Attorneys for those aboard the bus said justice was served, even as they disagreed with the jury’s decision to clear five of the defendants. “When I came to this case it was never about politics that day. I’m grateful, I’m proud of my team,” said Tim Holloway, who was behind the wheel of the campaign bus on Oct. 30, 2020. The Biden-Harris campaign bus was traveling from San Antonio to Austin for an event when a group of cars and pickup trucks waving Trump flags boxed in the bus on the highway. Davis testified she feared for her life. Video that Davis recorded from the bus shows one of the defendants, Eliazar Cisneros, hit a campaign volunteer’s car while the trucks occupied all lanes of traffic, forcing the bus and everyone around it to a 15 mph crawl. It was the last day of early voting in Texas and the bus was scheduled to stop at San Marcos for an event at Texas State University. The event was canceled after Davis and others on the bus — a campaign staffer and the driver — made repeated calls to 911 asking for a police escort through San Marcos and no help arrived. The trial centered on whether the actions of the “Trump Train” participants amounted to political intimidation. No criminal charges were filed against the six Trump supporters. An attorney for Cisneros, the only member of the convoy who the jury found liable, said they would appeal. “With regard to my client, it’s not over yet,” attorney Francisco Canseco said. Davis testified that she felt scared and anxious throughout the ordeal. “I feel like they were enjoying making us afraid,” she testified. “It’s traumatic for all of us to revisit that day.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A federal jury in Texas on Monday rejected&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Texas jury finds the majority of &#8216;Trump Train&#8217; drivers not guilty in civil trial involving 2020 Biden-Harris bus incident. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/texas-jury-finds-the-majority-of-trump-train-drivers-not-guilty-in-civil-trial-involving-2020-biden-harris-bus-incident/","image":"https://www.cbs42.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2024/09/66f1ed6c949c22.18620164.jpeg?w=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:11:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":257162554,"title":"Diddy's prediction about his wild parties from 25 years ago resurfaces after sex trafficking arrest","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Tuesday, Sep 24th 2024 1AM 13°C 4AM 13°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Leonardo DiCaprio breaks silence on hanging out with Diddy as picture emerges of him at rapper's notorious 'White Party' RMT boss Mick 'the grinch' Lynch vows to 'seize control' of the UK economy: Militant chief demands unions in 'every workplace' in hard-Left rant now his Labour 'friends' are in power Is Nanny Keir after your beer?

The rapper told Entertainment Tonight that he felt one day he would be arrested for his 'crazy parties.' His wild fetes - which are not to be confused with his lurid Freak Offs - were attended by stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker as well as Kim and Khloe Kardashian. 'You're gonna hear about my parties,' said the 54-year-old rap mogul as he referred to his star-studded bashes. 'They're gonna be shutting them down. They're gonna probably be arresting me, doing all types of crazy things just 'cause we wanna have a good time,' Combs added. There is an interview from 1999 that has come back to haunt Sean ' Diddy ' Combs. The rapper told Entertainment Tonight that he felt one day he would be arrested for his 'crazy parties.' Seen with Tommy Lee in 2007 at his Real White Party in the Hamptons Unforgivable Fragrance models pose at The Real White Party on September 2, 2007 at Combs' residence in East Hampton, New York Diddy said that he was judged by adding a 'different element' to his bashes. He argued, 'Whenever you bring up a different element into people's environment, things that broaden people's horizons, people get intimidated. It's a lot of people out there that feel intimidated by it.' Diddy has been charged with sex trafficking and related crimes and will likely spend about 10 years behind bars. The ex of JLo added that he had trouble getting support for his famous fetes. 'They won't even give me a permit for the parties no more,' said Diddy. 'They don't want me to throw the parties no more, but we ain't gonna stop. We gonna keep on having fun bringing people together from all walks of life.' Combs felt he was helping join races together. The first White Party was held on September 7, 1998. Paris Hilton described it as 'iconic'. Photos of the gatherings are like a time capsule of late Nineties, early Noughties celebrity. Howard Stern, Kelly Osbourne, Aretha Franklin, Martha Stewart, Jay-Z and Beyonce, 'it' couple Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson. Combs, 54, was arrested last week at a New York City hotel and charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. On Wednesday Combs has been denied bail for a second time. The ex of JLo added that he had trouble getting support for his famous fetes. 'They won't even give me a permit for the parties no more,' said Diddy Combs poses with Mariah Carey at the launch party for her album The Emancipation of Mimi; she attended one of his birthday parties Ashton Kutcher co-hosted a White Party with Combs to help raise awareness for Malaria No More held at a Private Residence on July 4, 2009 in Beverly Hills The singer, center, at his The Real White Party at Club Dune on September 2, 2007 in East Hampton, New York The star is set to remain in a Brooklyn jail until he stands trial in his sex trafficking case, after a second judge refused to accept a $50million bail package offered by his lawyers. US district judge Andrew L Carter Jr dismissed Combs' request to be released to home detention with GPS monitoring, with the judge pointing out that the hip-hop mogul could potentially tamper with witnesses. Combs pleaded not guilty to allegations of sex trafficking on September 19. The rapper appeared at a court in Manhattan after being charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Asked during a court hearing how he pleaded to the charges, Combs replied: 'Not guilty.' The rapper's lawyers subsequently requested that Combs be freed on bond, pending trial, after paying a sum of $50million. However, following a a lengthy debate between legal teams on whether Combs represents a flight risk, Magistrate Judge Robyn Tarnofsky announced that the rap star will remain in detention until his sex trafficking trial begins. He also reportedly parties with Justin Bieber; seen with Sean Kingston in 2010 Marc Agnifilo - Combs' lawyer - subsequently said that the music star is determined to 'establish his innocence'. Agnifilo told reporters outside the court: 'He's going to fight this. He's innocent. He came to New York to establish his innocence. 'We believe in him wholeheartedly. He didn't do these things. There's no coercion and no crime.' Combs is 'not afraid of the charges' he's currently facing, according to his lawyer. Agnifilo added: 'He's been looking forward to this day, and he's been looking forward to clearing his name.' It was also learned last week that the Quiet On Set documentary markers are working on a series about Combs. Diddy spent time with Prince William (L), US rapper Kanye West (2nd L) and Prince Harry in 2007 in London True crime network Investigation Discovery was behind this year's documentary in which a slew of former Nickelodeon child actors alleged instances of abuse and a toxic working environment at the hands of producer Dan Schneider. Now, they have announced a multipart docuseries for 2025 which will tell 'the rise and influence of Combs and the allegations of violent behavior and illegal activity that have trailed the music mogul'. In a press release, they added: 'As accounts of sexual assault, abusive behaviors, and other disturbing claims surface, the doc traces the story of this self-proclaimed Bad Boy, unraveling allegations of a pattern of depravity.'

The rapper told Entertainment Tonight that he felt one day he would be arrested for his 'crazy parties.' His wild fetes - which are not to be confused with his lurid Freak Offs - were attended by stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker as well as Kim and Khloe Kardashian. 'You're gonna hear about my parties,' said the 54-year-old rap mogul as he referred to his star-studded bashes. 'They're gonna be shutting them down. They're gonna probably be arresting me, doing all types of crazy things just 'cause we wanna have a good time,' Combs added. There is an interview from 1999 that has come back to haunt Sean ' Diddy ' Combs. The rapper told Entertainment Tonight that he felt one day he would be arrested for his 'crazy parties.' Seen with Tommy Lee in 2007 at his Real White Party in the Hamptons Unforgivable Fragrance models pose at The Real White Party on September 2, 2007 at Combs' residence in East Hampton, New York Diddy said that he was judged by adding a 'different element' to his bashes. He argued, 'Whenever you bring up a different element into people's environment, things that broaden people's horizons, people get intimidated. It's a lot of people out there that feel intimidated by it.' Diddy has been charged with sex trafficking and related crimes and will likely spend about 10 years behind bars. The ex of JLo added that he had trouble getting support for his famous fetes. 'They won't even give me a permit for the parties no more,' said Diddy. 'They don't want me to throw the parties no more, but we ain't gonna stop. We gonna keep on having fun bringing people together from all walks of life.' Combs felt he was helping join races together. The first White Party was held on September 7, 1998. Paris Hilton described it as 'iconic'. Photos of the gatherings are like a time capsule of late Nineties, early Noughties celebrity. Howard Stern, Kelly Osbourne, Aretha Franklin, Martha Stewart, Jay-Z and Beyonce, 'it' couple Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson. Combs, 54, was arrested last week at a New York City hotel and charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. On Wednesday Combs has been denied bail for a second time. The ex of JLo added that he had trouble getting support for his famous fetes. 'They won't even give me a permit for the parties no more,' said Diddy Combs poses with Mariah Carey at the launch party for her album The Emancipation of Mimi; she attended one of his birthday parties Ashton Kutcher co-hosted a White Party with Combs to help raise awareness for Malaria No More held at a Private Residence on July 4, 2009 in Beverly Hills The singer, center, at his The Real White Party at Club Dune on September 2, 2007 in East Hampton, New York The star is set to remain in a Brooklyn jail until he stands trial in his sex trafficking case, after a second judge refused to accept a $50million bail package offered by his lawyers. US district judge Andrew L Carter Jr dismissed Combs' request to be released to home detention with GPS monitoring, with the judge pointing out that the hip-hop mogul could potentially tamper with witnesses. Combs pleaded not guilty to allegations of sex trafficking on September 19. The rapper appeared at a court in Manhattan after being charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Asked during a court hearing how he pleaded to the charges, Combs replied: 'Not guilty.' The rapper's lawyers subsequently requested that Combs be freed on bond, pending trial, after paying a sum of $50million. However, following a a lengthy debate between legal teams on whether Combs represents a flight risk, Magistrate Judge Robyn Tarnofsky announced that the rap star will remain in detention until his sex trafficking trial begins. He also reportedly parties with Justin Bieber; seen with Sean Kingston in 2010 Marc Agnifilo - Combs' lawyer - subsequently said that the music star is determined to 'establish his innocence'. Agnifilo told reporters outside the court: 'He's going to fight this. He's innocent. He came to New York to establish his innocence. 'We believe in him wholeheartedly. He didn't do these things. There's no coercion and no crime.' Combs is 'not afraid of the charges' he's currently facing, according to his lawyer. Agnifilo added: 'He's been looking forward to this day, and he's been looking forward to clearing his name.' It was also learned last week that the Quiet On Set documentary markers are working on a series about Combs. Diddy spent time with Prince William (L), US rapper Kanye West (2nd L) and Prince Harry in 2007 in London True crime network Investigation Discovery was behind this year's documentary in which a slew of former Nickelodeon child actors alleged instances of abuse and a toxic working environment at the hands of producer Dan Schneider. Now, they have announced a multipart docuseries for 2025 which will tell 'the rise and influence of Combs and the allegations of violent behavior and illegal activity that have trailed the music mogul'. In a press release, they added: 'As accounts of sexual assault, abusive behaviors, and other disturbing claims surface, the doc traces the story of this self-proclaimed Bad Boy, unraveling allegations of a pattern of depravity.'

The Fifth Circuit earlier this year said the latest version of the law is largely constitutional but one key part, which gives a nonprofit the ability to investigate and levy fines, is not. The appeals court’s ruling was set to take effect on Sept. 25, and challengers of the law have said they wanted to have the ruling expanded nationwide. The law in question, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2020. The law enables the nonprofit Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority to create anti-doping and racetrack safety programs. After courts found the law was unconstitutional, Congress amended it in 2022 to give the Federal Trade Commission the power to repeal, add to, or otherwise modify rules promulgated by the nonprofit. The National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association and other groups sued. They said the regulatory scheme was still unconstitutional. Requests from the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority for the appeals court to reconsider the case and to stay the ruling until the Supreme Court weighed in, were rejected. That prompted the authority to ask Alito to intervene. In the brief order on Monday, Alito stayed the Fifth Circuit’s mandate and ordered the government to reply to the application by Sept. 30. Government lawyers said among the reasons to pause the decision is that two other federal appeals court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, have turned away challenges to the same law. The split between circuits makes it more likely the Supreme Court will take up the case, the lawyers said. “Because the court of appeals held important aspects of a federal statute facially unconstitutional and created a circuit conflict, there is a reasonable probability that this Court will grant certiorari,” they wrote. Applications for stays are submitted to individual justices, depending on the appeals court from which the cases come. Alito oversees the Fifth Circuit. The justice who receives an application can act on the filing or refer it to the full court for consideration. Granting an application is only done if the justice or justices decide the applicant has met four criteria, including establishing a reasonable probability that four justices will agree to review the case.","summary":"Justice Samuel Alito stayed a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Fifth Circuit that found part of the law unconstitutional.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-court-lets-anti-doping-horse-racing-law-remain-in-effect-5728739","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/27/id5676339-GettyImages-1431397924-sb-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:09:54","author":"Zachary Stieber","authors":["Zachary Stieber"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":257160366,"title":"U.S. to seek attempted assassination charge against man accused of staking out Trump at golf course","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The man accused in the assassination attempt of Donald Trump at a golf course in Florida left behind a note detailing his plans to kill the former president and kept in his car a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump was to appear, the Justice Department said Monday. Trump complained that the current holding charges against the man were too light, but prosecutors indicated much more serious attempted assassination charges were coming. The new allegations about the note were included in a detention memo filed ahead of a hearing Monday at which federal prosecutors argued that Ryan Wesley Routh should remain locked up as a flight risk and a threat to public safety. U.S. Magistrate Ryon McCabe agreed, saying the “weight of the evidence against the defendant is strong” and ordered him to stay behind bars. The latest details were meant to bolster the Justice Department’s contention that the 58-year-old suspect had engaged in a premeditated plan to kill Trump, a plot officials say was thwarted by a Secret Service agent who spotted a rifle poking out of shrubbery on the West Palm Beach golf course where Trump was playing and then opened fire in Routh’s direction. The note describing Routh’s plans was placed in a box that he dropped off months earlier at the home of an unidentified person who did not open it until after last Sunday’s arrest, prosecutors said. The box also contained ammunition, a metal pipe, building materials, tools, phones and various letters. The person who received the box and contacted law enforcement was not identified in the Justice Department’s detention memo and was described only as a “civilian witness.” One note Routh left, addressed “Dear World,” appears to have been premised on the idea that the assassination attempt would be unsuccessful. “This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job,” the note said, according to prosecutors. The letter offers “substantial evidence of his intent,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Dispoto said in court Monday. “That’s the message he wanted to send to the world in advance of this incident” he said. In a statement, Trump accused the Justice Department of “mishandling and downplaying” the apparent assassination attempt by bringing charges that were a “slap on the wrist.” Routh is currently charged with illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions, including two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002 in North Carolina, and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. But Dispoto said in court Monday that prosecutors would pursue additional charges before a grand jury accusing him of having tried to “assassinate a major political candidate” — charges that would warrant life in prison in the event of a conviction. It is common for prosecutors to file more easily provable charges as an immediate placeholder before adding more significant allegations as the case proceeds. Trump also claimed that the Justice Department has a conflict of interest in prosecuting this case since, under the supervision of a special counsel, it is simultaneously pursuing cases charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 election and with hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. He signaled support for a separate state-level criminal investigation announced last week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Kristy Militello, an assistant federal public defender representing Routh, asked during Monday’s hearing for Routh to be permitted to live with his sister in Greensboro, N.C., as the case moves forward. She argued that prosecutors had failed to show that he was a threat to the community and noted his track record of habitually showing up for court appearances throughout decades of legal troubles. Besides the note, prosecutors also cited cellphone records indicating that Routh traveled to West Palm Beach from Greensboro in mid-August, and that he was near Trump’s golf club and the former president’s Mar-a-Lago residence “on multiple days and times” between Aug. 18 and the day of the apparent attempted assassination. He was arrested Sept. 15 after a Secret Service agent who was scoping the Trump International Golf Club for potential security threats saw a partially obscured man’s face, and the barrel of a semiautomatic rifle, aimed directly at him. The agent fired at Routh, who sped away before being stopped by officials in a neighboring county, leaving behind a loaded rifle, digital camera, a backpack and a reusable shopping bag that was hanging from a chain link fence. The FBI has previously said Routh had camped outside the golf course for 12 hours before his arrest. The Secret Service has said Routh did not fire any shots and never had Trump in his line of sight. The Justice Department also said Monday that authorities who searched his car found six cellphones, including one that showed a Google search of how to travel from Palm Beach County to Mexico. They also found a list with dates in August, September and October and venues where Trump had appeared or was scheduled to, according to prosecutors. A notebook found in his car was filled with criticism of the Russian and Chinese governments and notes about how to join the war on behalf of Ukraine. In addition, the detention memo cites a book authored by Routh last year in which he lambasted Trump’s approach to foreign policy, including in Ukraine. In the book, he wrote that Iran was “free to assassinate Trump” for having left the nuclear deal.","summary":"The suspect wrote a note months earlier saying that he intended to kill the former president, the Justice Department said.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/23/u-s-to-seek-attempted-assassination-charge-against-man-accused-of-staking-out-trump-at-golf-course/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Secret_Service-Assassination_Attempt_43542_9b2687.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:09:19","author":"ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and STEPHANY MATAT - Associated Press,ERIC TUCKER,Eric Tucker, Alanna Durkin Richer And Stephany Matat","authors":["ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and STEPHANY MATAT - Associated Press","ERIC TUCKER","Eric Tucker, Alanna Durkin Richer And Stephany Matat"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.51},{"id":257160330,"title":"Exclusive: Zelenskyy says Ukraine's war with Russia is 'closer to the end'","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believes the war with Russia is \"close to an end\" than many believe and called on allies to strengthen Ukraine's army. \"The plan of victory is strengthening of Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said during a sit-down interview with \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Robin Roberts. \"That's why we're asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us.

Later this week, Zenlenskyy is expected to travel to Washington to meet with Biden as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.","summary":"Zelenskyy has repeatedly appealed to the United States and United Kingdom to drop their restrictions on the long-range missiles they have provided to Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia.","url":"https://abc13.com/politics/zelenskyy-says-ukraines-war-with-russia-is-closer-to-the-end/15345883/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15345891_zelenskyy-intv.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:07:41","author":"ABCNews,Meredith Deliso","authors":["ABCNews","Meredith Deliso"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.171},{"id":257159666,"title":"Nassau County PBA backs Democrat Tom Suozzi’s re-election for House seat — after supporting GOP in special election","text":"The Nassau County PBA is putting its weight behind Democrat Tom Suozzi in his House re-election bid — after backing his GOP opponent in a special election earlier this year. The local police union’s pivot to Suozzi, 61, is considered a boon for the moderate — who’s faced claims of being soft on crime — in his race against Republican rival Mike LiPetri, 34, for the competitive Long Island-Queens District 3 seat. “Tom [Suozzi] is a man of his word. He is willing to fight against his own party,” Nassau PBA president Tom Shevlin said in a press briefing. “Tom is a proven leader. He has proven to us that he will represent us and his district very well.” Local law enforcement unions have sided mostly with Republican candidates since Albany Democrats approved bail reform in 2019 — the controversial law that nixed cashless bail for many crimes. The Nassau PBA has already endorsed former President Donald Trump. “This is a big deal,” Suozzi said of the endorsement. “I will always support the cops. … We have to fund the police.” Suozzi slammed calls to “defund” the police as “the most wrong-headed, stupidest idea I ever heard.” In February, the Nassau police union backed GOP candidate Mazi Pilip over Suozzi in a special election following George Santos’ expulsion from Congress — a race Suozzi easily won. The former Nassau County executive served three terms in the House but didn’t seek re-election in 2022, instead losing handily in a Democratic primary for governor to Kathy Hochul. The LiPetri campaign brushed off the endorsement. “Let’s not be fooled, Tom Suozzi is no friend of law enforcement — he voted to eliminate qualified immunity, he kicked ICE out of Nassau County, and he’s best friends with pro-crime Democrats like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and Kathy Hochul,” said Mike Falk, LiPetri’s campaign manager. “Police Officers and law enforcement families know who really backs the blue and who only shows up when it’s election time.” Republicans believe LiPetri, a former member of the statehouse, has a shot at toppling the incumbent. The National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the House, last week added LiPetri to its “Young Guns” program — indicating the seat will be a priority.","summary":"The Nassau County PBA endorsed Democratic Rep.

The cutting-edge technology is making it easier for Russia as well as Iran to quickly and more convincingly tailor often-polarizing content aimed at swaying American voters, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters at a briefing. “The [intelligence community] considers AI a malign influence accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool,” the official said. “In other words, information operations are the threat, and AI is an enabler.” Intelligence officials have previously said they saw AI used in elections overseas. “Our update today makes clear that this is now happening here,” the ODNI official said. Russian influence operations have spread synthetic images, video, audio, and text online, officials said. That includes AI-generated content “of and about prominent U.S. figures” and material seeking to emphasize divisive issues such as immigration. Officials said that’s consistent with the Kremlin’s broader goal to boost former President Donald Trump and denigrate Vice President Kamala Harris. But Russia is also using lower-tech methods. The ODNI official said Russian influence actors staged a video in which a woman claimed to be a victim of a hit-and-run by Harris in 2011. There’s no evidence that ever happened. Last week, Microsoft also said Russia was behind the video, which was spread by a website claiming to be a nonexistent local San Francisco TV station. Russia is also behind manipulated videos of Harris’s speeches, the ODNI official said. They may have been altered using editing tools or with AI. They were disseminated on social media and using other methods. “One of the efforts we see Russian influence actors do is, when they create this media, try to encourage its spread,” the ODNI official said. The official said the videos of Harris had been altered in a range of ways, to “paint her in a bad light both personally but also in comparison to her opponent” and to focus on issues Russia believes are divisive. Iran has also tapped AI to generate social media posts and write fake stories for websites posing as legitimate news outlets, officials said. The intelligence community has said Iran is seeking to undercut Trump in the 2024 election. Iran has used AI to create such content in both English and Spanish, and is targeting Americans “across the political spectrum on polarizing issues” including the war in Gaza and the presidential candidates, officials said. China, the third main foreign threat to U.S. elections, is using AI in its broader influence operations that aim to shape global views of China and amplify divisive topics in the U.S. such as drug use, immigration, and abortion, officials said.","summary":"The cutting-edge technology makes it easier for Russia as well as Iran to quickly and more convincingly tailor polarizing content aimed at swaying American voters, intelligence officials said.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123927/russia-artificial-intelligence-election","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4660x3240+0+0/resize/4660x3240!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F17%2Fd87ab83a407db3f163e6ff424dfb%2Fgettyimages-2173180626.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:01:37","author":"Shannon Bond","authors":["Shannon Bond"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057}]}
