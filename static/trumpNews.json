The poll, conducted by Verian and commissioned by the Danish paper Berlingske, shows that only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of joining the US, with 9% undecided.\nSince his re-election, Trump has reiterated his desire to acquire the Arctic island, which is controlled by Denmark but enjoys a large degree of autonomy. Speaking onboard Air Force One, Trump confidently stated, \"I think we’re going to have it,\" and claimed that the island’s 57,000 residents \"want to be with us.\" However, the new poll suggests otherwise, with the vast majority of Greenlanders opposing the idea.\nThe poll results come as Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen emphasizes the need for European unity in the face of changing relations with the US. During a tour of Berlin, Paris, and Brussels, Frederiksen met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss the evolving dynamics with the US. \"I want to ensure that all of Europe stands together,\" Frederiksen said. \"Everyone in Europe can see that it will be a different collaboration with the USA now.\"\nScholz echoed Frederiksen's sentiments, stating that \"borders must not be moved by force.\" The Danish Prime Minister also highlighted the importance of Europe standing stronger in its own right, capable of defending and promoting European interests.\nTrump has not ruled out using military force to take control of Greenland, which remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Over the weekend, he doubled down on his ambitions, declaring, \"I think we’re going to have [Greenland].\" Reports suggest that Trump has even threatened Denmark with tariffs.\nFrederiksen, however, remains focused on maintaining dialogue with the US through various channels. At a joint press conference in Berlin, neither Scholz nor Frederiksen mentioned Trump or Greenland directly, but the issue was clearly on their minds. Scholz reiterated the principle of inviolability of borders, stating, \"The principle must apply to everyone. Borders must not be moved by force.\"\nIn response to the heightened tensions, Denmark has announced a 14.6 billion krone (£1.65 billion, $2 billion) agreement with Greenland and the Faroe Islands to improve surveillance and sovereignty assertion in the regions. The plans include three new Arctic ships capable of carrying helicopters and drones, two long-range drones for detailed imaging, and enhanced satellite capacity to monitor the Arctic and northern Atlantic.\nThe Danish government aims to demonstrate its capability to defend Greenland by boosting spending on defense. The agreement also includes initiatives to enable more young people in Greenland to gain skills for preparedness and asserting sovereignty.\nThe Inuit Circumpolar Council, representing Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Chukotka, and Greenland, emphasized the importance of the Arctic in the international agenda. However, the council warned against debating which state is a better or worse colonizer. \"We do not wish to debate which state is better or worse to live in or is a better or worse colonizer,\" the council stated. \"Rather, we want to debate how we improve Inuit lives, livelihoods, wellbeing, and self-determination across all our regions.\"\nAs tensions between the US and Denmark continue to rise, the overwhelming opposition from Greenlanders to joining the US highlights the complexities of geopolitical ambitions and the importance of respecting the autonomy and wishes of the island's residents. The situation underscores the need for diplomatic dialogue and cooperation to address the challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region.\nALSO READ: Shetland Hosts Europe's Biggest Fire Festival Once Again","summary":"A new poll reveals 85% of Greenlanders oppose joining the US, as Trump reiterates his interest in acquiring the Arctic island.

rogue MAGA performance on “SNL”: 'I'm out'","text":"Kenan Thompson and Ego Nwodim are reflecting on one of their weirdest Saturday Night Live memories: Ye's pro-Donald Trump rant in 2018.\n\n The former Kanye West's infamous off-the-cuff monologue occurred at the end of the season 44 premiere after he performed his song \"Ghost Town.\"\n\n The incident happened during Nwodim's first-ever SNL broadcast, she recalled in the new documentary Ladies & Gentlemen…50 Years of SNL Music. \"I moved to New York exactly eight days prior for this job,\" she said, noting that she was one of the cast members on stage behind West as he began rambling. \"I was like, 'I don't wanna be up here for this, and I don't agree with this, and standing up here looks like I'm standing in solidarity.'\"\n\n Nwodim remembered trying to distance herself from the \"Stronger\" rapper's statements, which included lamentations about liberals criticizing him for wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and an assertion that \"Blacks weren't always Democrats.\"\n\n \"I was like, 'Don't make any faces. Neutral face. Neutral face. Everyone's gotta know I'm just fulfilling my duties as a cast member,'\" Nwodim recalled. \"It's like your first day at school, and you're like, 'I don't wanna get in trouble. Y'all told me to come up here, I'm up here.'\"\n\n The comedian also said she came to a disturbing realization midway through Ye's remarks. \"I remember looking around the stage,\" she said. \"Something made me be like, 'Oh, are there other Black people up here in the cast?' And I look, and no, I was the only one! And I thought, 'They had a meeting!' And so then I'm like, 'These motherf---ers!'\"\n\n Thompson exited the stage as Ye began to address the SNL audience. \"When he grabbed the mic, and was just wandering around, you could see that he was gearing up to say something. I was like, 'I'm out!'\" Thompson explained. \"It would have been cool if he just had did the music thing, and, I don't know, just spoke through the hat, I guess, 'cause the hat was loud.\"\n\n The documentary also includes footage of Thompson seeing Ye's MAGA hat for the first time as they filmed a promo for the episode alongside host Adam Driver. \"Oh yeah, that is a MAGA hat, huh?\" Thompson says in the footage, surprised.\n\n Ye responds, \"You didn't notice that 'til now?\"\n\n Thompson then remarks, \"I'm just now noticing. I'm putting it all together. He's serious!\"\n\n Later, in an interview, SNL musical director and keyboardist Leon Pendarvis recalled continuing his performance as West spoke. \"When it was happening, we kind of went, 'Okay, this is Kanye,'\" he remembered. \"But it went on and on and on, and at one point it was just me playing and Kanye. I guess my musical instinct said, 'Keep playing. Just keep playing.'\"\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n SNL producer Steve Higgins reflected on the show's lack of censorship. \"This is a non-censoring show.

However, she said many are living in fear amid President Donald Trump’s promised mass deportation operations.\n\n“We are not criminals, despite how the federal administration seeks to portray us,” Aviles told reporters via a translator Tuesday, Jan. 28. “We pay taxes, we are essential workers, and above all, we are human beings who happen to be born in a different country.”\n\nAviles was among demonstrators who showed up to the Tuesday, Jan. 28 Grand Rapids City Commission meeting to demand that elected leaders declare Grand Rapids as a sanctuary city. \n\nBy the time the 7 p.m. meeting started, more than 100 people were packed into the city commission chambers, with another 70 waiting downstairs due to capacity limits.\n\nThe demonstration was organized by Movimiento Cosecha, a group made up largely of immigrants that advocates for driver’s licenses for all, and by GR Rapid Response to ICE, an ally group formed in 2017 to support and protect immigrants in Grand Rapids.\n\nGema Lowe, organizer of Movimiento Cosecha, said the group planned to present two main demands to city commissioners at Tuesday’s meeting:\n\nTo declare the city as a sanctuary for undocumented immigrantsTo commit to preventing the Grand Rapids Police Department from cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and any law enforcement agencies that seek to arrest, detain and deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nGrand Rapids Police Chief Eric Winstrom said last week that his officers will not be arresting or detaining people solely on the basis of an immigration violation. Winstrom said his department aims to be non-political and that officers have a good relationship with local Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities.\n\n“People in our city depend on and interact with immigrant neighbors every day: from the harvested food we eat, to the restaurants we patronize; from the construction of buildings we live and work in, to the manufactured products we use daily; from the clean hotel rooms and offices we visit, to the home health care we receive or provide for our loved ones,” Lowe said. “They are the children learning and playing in our schools, the drivers who stop and wave us through the busy traffic turn, and the neighbors who offer a smile on our daily walks and errands.”\n\nRELATED: Activists push for ‘sanctuary city’ status in Grand Rapids amid Trump’s deportation pledge\n\nThe same group has asked Grand Rapids Public Schools to pass a “Sanctuary Schools” resolution that would prohibit federal deportation officers from stepping foot on school property.\n\nLast week, GRPS issued guidance to its staff and faculty on what to do if paid a visit by ICE. Superintendent Leadriane Roby told staff to “remain vigilant” about who enters school buildings, and to prioritize the safety and security of students.\n\nRELATED: ‘Remain vigilant:’ Grand Rapids schools issue protocol for visits by ICE\n\nIn addition to speaking at Tuesday’s commission meeting, the group is also circulating an online petition that outlines the same demands seeking that Grand Rapids declare itself a sanctuary city. The group said it has already generated over generated 20,000 letters to the city seeking sanctuary status.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Police Department passed official policy in 2019 stating it would not arrest or detain people solely on the basis of an immigration violation.\n\n“GRPD will not coerce, threaten with deportation or engage in verbal abuse of any person based on the person’s or the person’s family members’ actual or perceived immigration status or citizenship,” the city policy states.\n\nCity Manager Mark Washington included the policy in Tuesday’s agenda in response to the recent demands for sanctuary status.\n\n“The Department will not inquire into a person’s immigration status when the person seeks police services, such as filing a police report or calling 911,” the police states. “Moreover, officers will not stop, question, investigate, arrest, search or detain an individual based solely on actual or suspected immigration status, actual or suspected violations of federal civil immigration law, prior deportation order or other civil immigration document.”\n\nRELATED: Grand Rapids police ‘not in the business of immigration enforcement,’ chief says\n\nTuesday’s Grand Rapids City Commission meeting started at 7 p.m. in the 9th floor commission chambers at city hall and is streamed online.\n\nThe Grand Rapids City Commission has already received more than 1,600 communications urging commissioners to vote to make Grand Rapids a sanctuary city, according to Tuesday’s agenda.\n\nMLive/The Grand Rapids Press will have further coverage of Tuesday’s meeting.\n\nWant more Grand Rapids-area news?

So what's really happening? Kraft Heinz provided us with an answer.\n\nAmerican bottles shipped north when demand spikes: Kraft Heinz\n\nIn an email to CBC News, a Kraft Heinz spokesperson said ketchup produced in the U.S. is shipped to Canada only when there are \"unanticipated increases in consumer demand\" that cannot be met by the Canadian facility in Mont Royal, Que. The company also produces some specialty ketchups that cannot be made in Canada, so those bottles also have U.S. labelling.\n\nIn 2024, Kraft Heinz says the American bottles accounted for approximately 10 per cent of Heinz ketchup in Canada.\n\nGenerally, the company produces and bottles its Canadian ketchup in Mont Royal, using tomatoes from Leamington, Ont. Those bottles are labelled \"Prepared in Canada,\" as per Canadian Food Inspection Agency guidelines.\n\nThe vinegar, salt and spices are also sourced locally, but the sugar is imported, the company says.\n\nCompany returned to Canadian tomatoes in 2022\n\nIn 2014, Kraft Heinz sold off its 100-year old tomato processing plant in Leamington, leaving local farmers and workers in the lurch and setting off a rivalry with French's, the company that took over the factory and won over many patriotic Canadians in the process.\n\nAfter fierce consumer backlash, Kraft Heinz returned to producing ketchup in Canada in 2020. The company went back to Canadian tomatoes, \"with the first full crop occurring in 2022,\" according to the spokesperson.\n\nKraft Heinz says it uses more than 220 million pounds of tomatoes each year to make products like ketchup, tomato sauce and tomato juice, and it recently renewed its agreement with Highbury Canco to continue through 2027.\n\nPoliticians across the country have been encouraging consumers to buy Canadian, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened heavy tariffs on Canadian goods starting Feb. 1.\n\nLast week, Trudeau urged consumers to seek out Canadian-made products to avoid U.S. imports. \"The example from last time was Heinz's ketchup being replaced by French's ketchup because French's was still using Canadian tomatoes in its ketchup,\" he said.\n\nWhile Trudeau's statement was not completely wrong — it is true that Kraft Heinz was not making ketchup in Canada from 2015 to 2020, and he was speaking about the past — the company said it was misleading, since it has moved its production back to Canada.\n\nKraft Heinz and French's are both based in the U.S. So, while both companies employ Canadian workers and use Canadian ingredients, profits still flow south of the border.","summary":"The plot has thickened in the Justin Trudeau-Heinz ketchup controversy, as consumers with bottles that say “Product of USA” question how Canadian the popular condiment really is.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/heinz-ketchup-usa-bottles-1.7444163?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7444239.1738107180!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/heinz.jpeg?im=Resize%3D620","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:36:10","author":"Kevin Maimann","authors":["Kevin Maimann"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.388},{"id":284926340,"title":"'Will cause chaos': Trump administration offers 7-month salary to 3 million federal workers if they opt to resign by February 6","text":"The White House announced late on Tuesday that US federal employees are being offered buyouts equal to seven months of salary if they choose to leave their jobs by February 6. This is part of President Donald Trump's plan to restructure the US government. A memo from the office of personnel management outlines four directives for the federal workforce, including a requirement for most employees to return to full-time in-office work. The memo includes details of a \"deferred resignation programme\" for those opting to leave. It says, \"If you choose not to continue in your current role in the federal workforce, we thank you for your service to your country and you will be provided with a dignified, fair departure from the federal government utilising a deferred resignation programme. This programme begins effective January 28 and is available to all federal employees until February 6.\"The memo also says, \"If you resign under this programme, you will retain all pay and benefits regardless of your daily workload and will be exempted from all applicable in-person work requirements until September 30.\"President Donald Trump has repeatedly highlighted his commitment to disrupting Washington and has promised that his second term would further challenge traditional political norms. The impact of offering buyouts to a large number of federal employees, however, remains uncertain.The federal government employs over 3 million people, making it one of the largest workforces in the country. According to Pew Research Center data based on OPM figures, the average federal employee serves for 11.8 years. Even if a small portion of employees accept the buyout, it could lead to economic consequences and disruptions in federal services nationwide.Potential departures could affect a range of critical roles, including Veterans Affairs health workers, loan processors, military contractors, food inspectors, scientists monitoring water quality, and employees responsible for air travel and product safety. The scale and effects of such exits remain unclear.Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees union, criticized the buyout offer, describing it as a strategy to pressure employees viewed as disloyal to the administration into leaving. Kelley said, \"Purging the federal government of dedicated career federal employees will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government.\"The memo also includes instructions on how to accept the buyout program, saying: \"Upon review of the below deferred resignation letter, if you wish to resign: Select ‘Reply’ to this email. You must reply from your government account.\"It adds: \"Type the word \"Resign' into the body of this email and hit 'send.'\"","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-cause-chaos-trump-administration-offers-7-month-salary-to-3-million-federal-workers-if-they-opt-to-resign-by-february-6/articleshow/117660913.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-117661412/117661412.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:35:07","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.122},{"id":284922912,"title":"Hundreds gather in East San Jose to protest threats of mass deportations","text":"SAN JOSE — Hundreds of community members stopped traffic in East San Jose Tuesday afternoon while protesting against President Donald Trump’s threats of mass deportations.\n\nWith lowrider trucks parked along the intersection of Story and King roads playing music, protestors marched through traffic and brought the intersection to a standstill, waving flags and with posters reading “No human is illegal on stolen land” and “Stop deportation.”\n\nAt the rally’s peak, protestors young and old stood on the intersection corners while others marched up and down the surrounding streets. While cars could still pass, drivers honked in support. People chanted, “Si se puede,” which translates to “yes you can,” and “ICE out of San Jose” as they stood on the street corners and walked up and down the roads.\n\n“We just need to let [Trump] know he’s wrong,” said Teresa Alcaraz, a resident of San Jose. “We’re getting our voices across because that’s what we do.”\n\nThe protest came two days after the first reported activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Jose since the inauguration of Trump, who came into office threatening mass deportations across the country.\n\nA student walkout that began Tuesday afternoon at William C. Overfelt High School walked about a mile to join the protest, with students starting by sharing speeches at the school before being escorted by the lowriders on the walk. Shortly after 2:30 p.m., the two protests combined.\n\nAngel Lopez, a 15-year-old student from Overfelt, said that it is scary to hear what Trump has been saying about immigrants.\n\n“We all feel that we all have a reason to be here, even if we’re here illegally,” he said. “A lot of my parents or my family members have told me that we must not be scared. We have to stand up against them.”\n\nArmando Barbosa, who praised the students of Overfelt for their walkout, said he feels like his community is under attack and fears that hard-working families will be targeted. Barbosa escorted the students on the walk with other lowrider drivers.\n\n“I’m out here to support the youth,” said Barbosa. “I’m very proud to be part of this community.”\n\n“This is the land of the free, the home of the brave and opportunity,” Barbosa added. “We all have that opportunity to come and make a living and a future.”\n\nBarbosa, whose parents immigrated from Mexico, said he wants to fight for “what’s right.”\n\n“They came and made the sacrifices,” he said of his parents. “I need to continue to make that sacrifice.”\n\nSome protestors gave speeches, prompting cheers of support from the crowd, and some protestors blew horns.\n\nAlejandra Corona, a resident of San Jose, said that she came to show solidarity.

That followed dozens of flights during the Joe Biden administration. \n\nLocal media reported that government officials were disturbed by the fact that Brazilians were kept handcuffed after an unscheduled stop in the Amazon’s biggest city, Manaus, prompted by technical problems with the plane.\n\nA Brazilian military plane brought them to their destination, the city of Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais, on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe next day, Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was seeking answers from Washington regarding the “degrading treatment” of nationals during the recent flight. It cited “the use of handcuffs and chains, the poor condition of the aircraft, with a broken air conditioning system, among other problems.”\n\nThe US Embassy declined to comment and the US’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency didn’t respond to an email request for comment. \n\nIt was unclear whether the 88 Brazilian deportees were taken into custody during the tenure of Donald Trump or former President Joe Biden.\n\nThere have been almost four dozen deportation flights from the U.S. to Brazil over the past three years.

There have been passenger reports that the plane’s air conditioning suffered problems, causing intense heat in the cabin, and they exited through the emergency door upon landing in Manaus.\n\nCommenting on the humanitarian center, Evaristo said the objective was to “ensure that these passengers have good conditions for water, food and even temperature, which I think was the most damaging aspect” in the first flight.\n\n“We don’t want to provoke the American government, but it’s essential that deported Brazilians are treated with dignity,” Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski said on Monday.","summary":"The Brazilian government says it is going to create a reception center for deported migrants from the United States following controversy over conditions on a recent flight","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-ap-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-foreign-ministry-rio-de-janeiro-b2688078.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/29/00/Brazil_Lula_Cabinet_55717.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:33:21","author":"Elonore Hughes","authors":["Elonore Hughes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":284922910,"title":"Letters: Halting U.S. foreign aid hurts our nation and the world","text":"Halting foreign aid hurts\nU.S. as well as world\n\nI am outraged that in a Friday night pronouncement, the Trump administration issued a “Stop-Work Order” for all U.S. foreign assistance programs. This action is catastrophic for communities around the world and undermines U.S. credibility internationally.\n\nOvernight, people are losing access to lifesaving medicines and treatment. Prenatal care, safe childbirth and nutrition assistance for malnourished children will be compromised. HIV-positive people will lose access to medication and new infectious diseases like mpox can flourish and spread. Programs to combat human trafficking, to provide shelter for war victims, and for nutrition, water and sanitation will evaporate.\n\nU.S. assistance has made America safer, stronger and more prosperous.

As a result of the lack of these chargers, apartment renters are forced to either charge in public places such as grocery stores or not own an EV.\n\nIf apartments were required to provide EV chargers it would help prevent global warming and incentivize renters to make the switch to electric vehicles. Charging at home would likely cost less, allow for charging overnight, and assist in the fight against climate change especially since almost two-thirds of California renters live in mid-sized to large apartment complexes.\n\nIn short, electric vehicle chargers would benefit all Californians by reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAaron Rudnick\nPleasant Hill\n\nTrump’s call to clear\nGaza echoes dark past\n\nRe: “Trump calls for clearing of Gaza” (Page A1, Jan. 27).\n\nAs I read this article, I was very disturbed by the words, “You’re talking about probably a million-and-a-half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.”\n\nMy first thought was if my sewer line is backed up it needs a “clean out.” My second thought was if my house had a roach infestation, it would need an exterminator “clean out.” And my third thought was if my house had a rat infestation, it would need a vermin “clean out.” I am sure that Trump knows exactly what the code words “clean out” mean. He probably wants Gaza “cleaned out” so he can build a Trump golf course and condominiums on the excellent Gaza beachfront property.\n\nMy disgust and loathing for Trump has just reached a newer, higher level.\n\nSan Lorenzo\n\nTrump’s crypto embrace\nharkens to age of kings\n\nRe: “Trump’s crypto venture divides the industry he aims to support” (Page A4, Jan. 26).\n\nDonald Trump has declared a currency with his name on it: $Trump.\n\nIn olden times, people were forced to use currency established by kings and emperors.

I only hope that he knows what he is doing.\n\nWhen I lived in Arizona, then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio did the same thing, and between the workers he deported and the ones who left the state of their own accord, when it came harvest time, there were no workers to pick the crops. Needless to say, the farmers ended up tilling the crops under and quite a few went bankrupt because of no income for that year.\n\nMaybe the farmers and vineyard owners in California should think about taking out some kind of insurance to prevent that from happening here.\n\nExecutive orders reveal\nTrump’s phony populism\n\nAs I observe how Donald Trump’s intention to reverse any programs that benefit us commoners but are not needed by his plutocrats, I am reminded of an old Turkish proverb:\n\n“The forest was shrinking but the trees kept voting for the axe, for the axe was clever and convinced the trees that because his handle was made of wood he was one of them.”\n\nDictators hobble their\ncountries and people\n\nIf Donald Trump could look past the glory of power, he would realize that the dictators he so eagerly wants to emulate are actually destroying their countries by subjugating their citizens.\n\nThe real shame of this lies in the fact that, of those who are in a position to draw the line and call a halt to his plans, not one has the spine to do so.

It’s no longer just about hard finance.”\nThe Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle of animal signs – rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.\nEach year’s animal is paired with one of the five elements – metal, wood, water, fire and earth – whose characteristics and powers affect those born that year and also those under other signs. This will be the Year of the Wood Snake.\nFamous Snake personalities include Chinese President Xi Jinping, pop star Taylor Swift, celebrity talk show host Oprah Winfrey, author J. K. Rowling and Cantopop legend Aaron Kwok Fu-shing.\n\nFew upbeat signs for economy\nThe soothsayers did not expect the city’s economy to improve dramatically until 2028.\nThey noted that 2025 was the second year of Period Nine, a 20-year feng shui era that began last year and was ruled by the powerful, exciting fire element.\nThe current era, part of a 180-year cycle, heralded transformation, innovation and drastic change, making the new year auspicious for the filmmaking, creative and innovation industries.\nBut there were less favourable prospects for sectors such as construction, human resources, catering and retail.\nFeng shui master Andrew Kwan Wan-kei said Period Nine prioritised spirituality and more abstract areas of life, paving the way for creativity and innovation to shine.\nAhead of the new year, he consulted the ancient divination text, the I Ching, and drew a lot randomly to see what lay ahead.\nInterpreting it, he said: “Things will not turn worse, but I also do not see a way up. Hong Kong needs change, new mindsets and new ways of operating to survive.”\nAstrologer Sunny Fung Ka-yik said he expected sectors related to “invisible” forces – such as technology and artificial intelligence – to do well in the Snake Year.\nHowever, the prevailing fire element would result in short spurts of success rather than consistent good performance.\nFung said the Snake would favour women taking on positions of power, but cautioned that jealousy and back-stabbing might be on the rise.\nFeng shui master To did not expect Hong Kong’s fiscal deficit to be resolved within the Snake Year.\nFinance chief Paul Chan Mo-po has said the city’s deficit will more than double to nearly HK$100 billion (US$12.8 billion) in the 2024-25 financial year from the earlier forecast of HK$48 billion.\nTo predicted that the property market would only rebound in 2028, bringing the government more revenue from land sales.\n\n‘John Lee will fare better than others’\nThe soothsayers predicted a better year for Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu, as his birth year animal, the Rooster, was considered an ally of the Snake.\nTo said he expected Lee to have a relatively stable year compared with other world leaders, but did not anticipate sparkling results for his policies.\nKwan said Lee was born during a full moon and had a strong career star, but powerful metal elements in his birth chart could weigh down his actions during the Snake Year.\nHe felt it might be better if the city leader focused more on “things that can produce obvious results instead of taking risks”.\nGood year for Trump, challenges for Xi\nUS President Donald Trump, who kicked off his term in office with a series of major and controversial executive actions, would have good fortune in interpersonal relationships, several feng shui masters agreed.\nThat is because the Snake favoured the Dog, the 78-year-old’s birth year animal.\nTo predicted that Trump “could have the upper hand in negotiations and diplomatic exchanges”.\nThings appeared less rosy for Chinese leader Xi, 71, born in the Year of the Snake and soothsayers said it was because the Snake clashed with the Chinese guardian deity for the new year.\nIn Chinese mythology, there are dozens of gods who take turns to reign as the guardian deity, or taisui, ruling over prosperity and fortune for each year.\nThose born in the Snake Year could expect challenges because the Snake clashed with the taisui for the new year.\nFor Xi, this could mean his good intentions might not produce the best results, To said.\n“He might face added pressure and experience fluctuating emotions,” he added.\n\n‘Fiery’ element already on display\nAlthough the Snake Year was still days away, the soothsayers said there already were signs of its fiery element at work, in the ongoing California wildfire disaster and South Korea’s Jeju Air crash of December 29 that left 179 dead.\n“The coming year will see more natural disasters such as earthquakes and fires, and traffic and aviation accidents,” Master Seven said.\n“We should also be careful of travelling to countries in the northeast direction, such as Japan and South Korea, and a pandemic might start spreading from Europe.”\nShe cautioned against travelling during the partial solar eclipse in March and the total lunar eclipse in September.\nOffering some solace, astrologer Wang said that according to numerology, 2025 would be driven by the number nine, indicating the end of a cycle and a time to reflect on a new kind of identity for the future.\n“The Snake energy is about shedding old skin, leading to a new beginning, rebirth and healing,” he said.\n“Always remember that we have to unload whatever is unnecessary, otherwise it’s too heavy.”","summary":"City leader John Lee will benefit in a stable year while Donald Trump is set for good fortune, say feng shui masters.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3296609/year-snake-will-hong-kong-scale-new-heights-or-just-slither-along","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/28/a15d39a5-0536-4a99-ad37-449e17e72b0c_34de02e5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:30:09","author":"Lo Hoi-ying","authors":["Lo Hoi-ying"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.33},{"id":284920486,"title":"Trump aid freeze stirs chaos before it is blocked in court","text":"WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid was temporarily blocked in court on Tuesday, even as it sowed chaos throughout the government and stirred fears that it would disrupt programs that serve tens of millions of Americans.

US District Judge Loren AliKhan issued the two-day temporary restraining order after a brief hearing in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nIt came after a memo issued late on Monday by the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget,ordered federal agencies to temporarily pause “all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance.”\n\n“This temporary pause will provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities,” the memo read.\n\nOther controversial orders signed by Trump have included the removal of the U.S. from the World Health Organization and Paris Climate Agreement, and the firing of all federal employees on DEI programmes.\n\nA separate executive order, effectively banning transgender people from serving in the military, has already resulted in a lawsuit from a group of transgender service members.\n\nOn his first day in office, the president also pardoned nearly all January 6 defendants, granting roughly 1,500 “full, complete and unconditional pardons” for those charged in connection with the Capitol attack, including 169 who confessed to attacking police officers.","summary":"Donald Trump has been accused of carrying out a ‘blitzkrieg’ of executive orders in his first week in office","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/chris-murphy-trump-executive-order-blitzkrieg-b2688046.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/27/23/2194444069.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/A9HLpwmT-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:23:56","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":284920064,"title":"Trump’s oil drilling support will end funding challenges — NUPRC","text":"The Federal Government is hopeful that United States President Donald Trump’s support for oil drilling will put an end to the funding challenges faced in the course of hydrocarbon production.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Gbenga Komolafe, stated this on Tuesday while addressing newsmen shortly after he won the ThisDay CEO of the Year Award in Lagos.\n\nKomolafe explained that the oil sector has faced funding challenges for years as many foreign financial institutions are no longer willing to fund fossil fuels.\n\nAccording to him, the momentum gathered by renewable energy made funding fossil fuels somewhat difficult thereby impacting new investments in the oil sector.\n\nHowever, with Trump’s ’Drill, baby drill’ slogan, and his disposition to ramp up crude production in the US, Komolafe projected a positive outlook for Nigeria in 2025 and beyond.\n\n“As a regulator, it is our opinion that the programme, that is the ’Drill, baby drill’ programme of President Trump, would have a positive effect on us as a nation with large hydrocarbon reserves.\n\n“What that means is that the challenge of funding for the development of hydrocarbons will relapse. If you remember, one of the major challenges facing the optimisation of hydrocarbon reserves is funding. Because the momentum in renewables and the investment in renewables were already having a negative impact on the funding of hydrocarbon.\n\n“But given the position of President Trump, it means that funding challenges in fossil fuel will be relapsed, and that will have a favourable impact on the development of hydrocarbon in Nigeria,” Komolafe said. \n\nReacting to Trump’s call that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries should reduce the price of crude oil, Komolafe said the organisation does fix the price of crude oil.\n\nThe US President had opined that when the price of crude oil goes down, the war between Russia and Ukraine would come to an end.\n\n“I’m also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You got to bring it down, which frankly, I’m surprised they didn’t do before the election. I was a little surprised by that. If the price came down, the Russia, Ukraine war would end immediately,” Trump was quoted as having said.\n\nSpeaking to this, Komolafe replied, “I’m not sure he said OPEC should reduce the price of crude because OPEC does not fix the price of crude. Rather, what OPEC does is regulate production among member countries. It is the market fundamentals that dictate the price of crude, not OPEC.\n\n“So, if the idea will be to control growth, that is global inventory. If there is a cut in the global inventory, that itself will regulate the price. But if there is an increase in production from the US based on the ‘Drill, baby drill’ plan, that will increase the global inventory. And if the inventory increases, then that will have an impact on the price. The price will come down.”\n\nOn its zero-routine emission plans, the chief executive maintained that the commission initiated the Nigeria Gas Commercialisation Programme which implementation it is monitoring to reduce gas flaring.\n\n“It’s one of the programmes we are monitoring the implementation. In fact, we believe that given the diligent implementation of the programme, the nation will begin to feel the effect in terms of cutback in gas flaring in the Year 2025. We are very much committed as a commission to effective implementation of the gas commercialisation programme so that it will have a positive impact,” he stated.","summary":"The Federal Government is hopeful that United States President Donald Trump’s support for oil drilling will put an end to the funding challenges faced in the course of hydrocarbon production.

You might recall what happened to those who doubted Anthony Fauci’s wild claim that he was “science” and those COVID shots were the saving of the nation. Or those who questioned the undue influences on the 2020 presidential election, including the FBI’s interference.\n\nFrom the White House pressure on social media companies to banish ideas with which Joe Biden and his administration disagreed, to the willing cooperation of those companies, to the shunning of those who had alternative views to the stunningly extra-constitutional “canceling” of those individuals, President Donald Trump has pledged to end it.\n\nBut now there’s appearing a scheme by European bureaucrats to pick up where Biden, Kamala Harris and Facebook left off.\n\nAccording to a report from the Washington Stand, those bureaucrats are considering plans to apply their “online censorship” agenda to Americans.\n\nFree speech promoters warn what is being lined up is dangerous.\n\n“Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) debated expanding the Digital Services Act (DSA) last week, according to Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) International,” the report explained, noting the controversial DSA took effect just last year and already requires the removal of “illegal” content from social media software.\n\nNow those bureaucrats want to move far beyond cracking down on illegal material to pursue their claimed objective to “protect democracy” in Europe from “foreign interference.”\n\nThey specifically are concerned about Elon Musk, who restored free speech to the X platform when he took it over, and the leftists in Europe are accusing him of promoting the “far right” because he’s spoken in support of Trump’s pro-America agenda.\n\nCuriously, it was Democrats in America who for years have claimed to want to be protecting democracy by attacking Trump and conservatives in America. For that agenda, they insisted on controlling what people saw and read, and they even tried to restrict the candidates for whom Americans could vote.\n\nThe report said Iratxe Garcia, a lawmaker and chief of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, claimed, “In recent months, we have seen how Elon Musk and his social network X have become the main promoter for the far right by supporting Donald Trump and Alice Weidel’s AfD party through fake news and hate messages.”\n\nShe is demanding that all those social media platforms follow the rules she wants to impose.\n\nThe European Union also has plans to expand its censorship staff to 200 people, a move that “would potentially allow the European Union (EU) to target American citizens for online speech considered hateful or criminal under European laws.”\n\nThere already are situations that have developed in Europe in which a simple statement of Christian faith has been considered hate speech.\n\nThe DSA already allows the EU to impose massive fines on social media corporations.\n\nThe report noted that while progressives in Europe, like their counterparts in America in recent years, like the idea of government censorship, conservatives there have warned that such programs are a “tool” for limiting political discussion.\n\nPaul Coleman, chief of ADF International, said in the report, “We are living in a new bipolar order of speech. On the one hand, Europe is doubling down on censorship, while the U.S. is recommitting to its free speech heritage.\n\n“This will usher in an unprecedented era of tension within the West itself over this most basic of human rights, and it is the responsibility of all who value freedom to side with the protection of free speech. The effects of the DSA will not be confined to Europe. There are legitimate worries that the DSA could censor the speech of citizens across the world, as social media companies could regulate their content globally to comply with European standards,” he told the Stand.","summary":"The agenda 'will not be confined to Europe'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/now-european-bureaucrats-look-at-schemes-to-censor-americans/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/censorship-gagging-girls-chhildren-silence-free-speech-first-amendment-transgenders-unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:16:46","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.023},{"id":284925500,"title":"Musk vows to bring stranded NASA astronauts home 'as soon as possible' at Trump's request as tech titan slams Biden for not acting sooner","text":"Musk vows to bring stranded NASA astronauts home 'as soon as possible' at Trump's request as tech titan slams Biden for not acting sooner\n\nPODCAST: On Welcome to MAGAland, we dive into the JFK files, that Gavin Newsom kiss & Trump’s latest sparring matches\n\nBy MELISSA KOENIG FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 22:44 GMT, 28 January 2025 | Updated: 00:16 GMT, 29 January 2025\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk vowed on Tuesday to bring the two astronauts who remain stuck in space home 'as soon as possible.'\n\nThe spacecraft company had been tasked in August with bringing Butch Wilmore, 62, and Sunita Williams, 59, back to Earth in February after NASA officials deemed Boeing's Starliner was not up to the mission.\n\nYet Williams' and Wilmore's replacements are not set to arrive at the International Space Station until late March or early April - meaning that the stranded astronauts will have to stay until then to conduct a handover. \n\nIn a post on X, though, Musk said he was tasked by President Donald Trump to immediately bring the stranded astronauts home.\n\nHe then hit out at former President Joe Biden for not acting sooner. \n\n'Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long,' he lamented.\n\nCommentator Ian Miles Cheong then replied that the Biden administration 'hated you more than they wanted to rescue those astronauts,' which Musk said was 'True.'\n\nWilmore and Williams first landed at the International Space Station on June 5, and have been left stranded there ever since.\n\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore have been stuck at the International Space Station since June 5. They are pictured giving a news conference in July \n\nElon Musk claimed on Tuesday that President Donald Trump asked SpaceX to bring the astronauts home as soon as possible\n\nThe pair's visit was originally only supposed to last eight days, but due to safety concerns, NASA decided to send the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they arrived in back to Earth without anyone inside. \n\nEarlier this month, Wilmore and Williams were heard telling NASA bigwigs 'eventually, we want to go home.'\n\nWilliams also told students at the Massachusetts high school she graduated from that she is now 'trying to remember what it's like to walk,' CBS News reports.\n\n'I've been up here long enough right now, I've been trying to remember what it's like to walk,' she recently told students at Needham High School. 'I haven't walked. I haven't sat down. I haven't laid down. \n\n'You don't have to, you can just close your eyes and float where you are right here.'\n\nThe astronaut also told the students the delay in coming home was 'a little bit of a shock.\n\n'We knew that it would be probably a month or so, honestly,' she said of her and Wilmore's voyage.\n\n'But the extended stay was a little bit different.' \n\nThe pair had been doomed by a cascade of vexing thruster failures and helium leaks in the Boeing capsule, which marred their trip to the space station.\n\nMusk hit out at former President Joe Biden for not acting sooner\n\nCommentator Ian Miles Cheong then replied that the Biden administration 'hated you more than they wanted to rescue those astronauts,' which Musk said was 'True'\n\nThey ended up in a holding pattern as engineers conducted tests and debated what to do about the trip back. \n\nUltimately, NASA decided that it was too risky to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth on Boeing's capsule - and said they would instead arrive back on a SpaceX spacecraft.\n\n'This has not been an easy decision, but it is absolutely the right one,' Jim Free, NASA's associate administrator, said at the time. \n\nBut the Crew-10 mission that was set to fly up to the International Space Station to retrieve Williams and Wilmore has been delayed by at least a month because SpaceX's new fifth Crew Dragon spacecraft was not yet operational, according to the Orlando Sentinel. \n\nThat mission is not slated to begin until late March or early April, meaning Williams and Wilmore will have to stay several more months before they can return to Earth.\n\nThe decision to use SpaceX to retrieve the astronauts was a blow to Boeing, adding to the safety concerns plaguing the company on its airplane side. \n\nBoeing had counted on Starliner's first crew trip to revive the troubled program after years of delays and ballooning costs. \n\nThe company had insisted Starliner was safe based on all the recent thruster tests both in space and on the ground.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore also initially said they had trust in the thruster testing being conducted. They had no complaints, they added, and enjoyed pitching in with space station work. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore had been doomed by a cascade of vexing thruster failures and helium leaks in the Boeing capsule, which marred their trip to the space station\n\nWilliams told a group of students this month she is 'trying to remember what it's like to walk'\n\nYet Starliner's woes began long before Williams and Wilmore took it up to the space station.\n\nBad software fouled the first test flight without a crew in 2019, prompting a do-over in 2022. \n\nThen parachute and other issues cropped up, including a helium leak in the capsule's propellant system that nixed a launch attempt in May. The leak eventually was deemed to be isolated and small enough to pose no concern. But more leaks sprouted following liftoff, and five thrusters also failed.\n\nAll but one of those small thrusters restarted in flight. But engineers remain perplexed as to why some thruster seals appear to swell, obstructing the propellant lines, then revert to their normal size.\n\nThese 28 thrusters are vital. \n\nBesides needed for space station rendezvous, they keep the capsule pointed in the right direction at flight's end as bigger engines steer the craft out of orbit. Coming in crooked could result in catastrophe.\n\nStill, NASA isn't giving up on Boeing, with Administrator Bill Nelson saying he is '100%' certain that Starliner will fly again.\n\nSpaceXEarthDonald TrumpNasa\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMusk vows to bring stranded NASA astronauts home 'as soon as possible' at Trump's request as tech titan slams Biden for not acting sooner\n\nAdd comment","summary":"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk vowed on Tuesday to bring the two astronauts who remain stuck in space home 'as soon as possible.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14335679/trump-calls-musk-stranded-nasa-astronauts-slams-biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/28/23/94617735-0-image-a-25_1738107163177.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/07/4782349110072854404/1024x576_MP4_4782349110072854404.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:16:30","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":284919216,"title":"Rachael Kirkconnell breaks silence on Matt James split and cheating rumors ahead of Call Her Daddy interview","text":"Black Friday\n\nThe Traitors\n\nThe Masked Singer\n\nLove Island All Stars\n\nDancing On Ice\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachael Kirkconnell breaks silence on Matt James split and cheating rumors ahead of Call Her Daddy interview\n\nHave YOU got a story?

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:03 GMT, 29 January 2025 |Updated:00:15 GMT, 29 January 2025 \n\nRoseanne Barr revealed she is ready for her TV comeback seven years after ABC canceled her revived TV comedy series, Roseanne, over a series of racist tweets.\nOn Tuesday, the actress, 72, teased her return to the small screen with a new comedy series, which she wrote with TV producer Allan Stephan, best known for his work on HBO's Arli$$ and Roseanne. \nAccording to Variety, the show, which will be be four to six episodes starring Barr, is said to be a 'cross between The Roseanne Show and The Sopranos.' \nThe Emmy winner also revealed to the outlet that the series will center on a 'small-town farmer in Alabama who is saving the United States from drug gangs and China.'\nThe protagonist will also apparently dabble in 'growing and selling drugs like cannabis and magic mushrooms.' \n'It's silly and out there,' she raved. '[It will contain] very offensive ideas and a lot of swearing. I live with my daughter and her husband and their six children on a farm. And they have goats running through their house and stuff.' \n\nRoseanne Barr revealed she is ready for her TV comeback seven years after ABC canceled her revived TV comedy series, Roseanne, over a series of racist tweets; seen in 2018\nBarr noted it was loosely based on her 'life as a farmer in Hawaii.' \nThe mother-of-five, who moved to her 46-acre farm on the Big Island in 2010, also described the project as 'kind of like the Coen brothers thing.'\n\n The Conners canceled, will end with season 7 on ABC \nThis will mark her first acting gig since getting axed over her remarks about former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, which the network called 'repugnant and inconsistent' with their values. \nIn one of her highly offensive tweets, she referred to Jarrett as the offspring of the 'Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes.' \nAfter receiving substantial backlash, she deleted the racist post and apologized to Jarrett.\n'I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,' she tweeted. 'I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.' \nMonths later as she sat down for her first TV interview since getting fired for the tweet, Barr reflected on how the tweet cost her 'everything.' \n'I wish I worded it better,' she said on Sean Hannity's Fox News Channel show. \n\nOn Tuesday, the actress, 72, teased her return to the small screen with a new comedy series, which she wrote with TV producer Allan Stephan, best known for his work on HBO's Arli$$ and Roseanne (pictured in 2017)\n\nAccording to Variety, the show, which will be be four to six episodes starring Barr, is said to be a 'cross between The Roseanne Show and The Sopranos' (seen in 2017)\n\nShe continued: 'I am a creative genius, and this is not a good feeling for an artist to be treated this way, and it's not a good feeling for a citizen, either.' \nStill, Barr insisted that she felt her tweet was mischaracterized and that she had apologized enough for her actions. \n'I feel like I have apologized and explained and asked for forgiveness and made recompense,' she said. \nLater she stated: 'I'm not a racist and the people who voted for Trump, they're not racist either, and Trump isn't a racist, sorry. We just have a different opinion.' \nABC cancelled Roseanne right after its first season earned the top spot for scripted primetime TV shows in the 18-49 age demographic. \n\nThe Emmy winner also revealed to the outlet that the series will center on a 'small-town farmer in Alabama who is saving the United States from drug gangs and China' (seen in 2018)\n\nBarr, who was dropped by her longtime agents at ICM over the tweet, declined to say who is selling the series. \n'If Hollywood doesn't buy it, then I'm just gonna make it myself,' she told Variety. 'Does anybody in [Hollywood] like America or the people who watch TV? Because the people who watch TV would really like to see a show where working-class people win against the enemies of America.'\nShe added that the family in the series will be a lot like the Conners, featured in her series, Roseanne.\n'There's a scene where I have to strap myself into a corset. My granddaughter helps me, and then I go into town to flirt with all the shopkeepers that are just grotesque people,' she mused. 'It's just kind of a cartoony kind of thing.' \n\n'It's silly and out there,' she raved. '[It will contain] very offensive ideas and a lot of swearing. I live with my daughter and her husband and their six children on a farm. And they have goats running through their house and stuff' (pictured in 2018)\n\nThe actress also said Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election shows that people in the U.S. want content from Hollywood that is 'irrelevant to the American people.'\n'If they want to survive, they should work with the new president. American people elected him in an overwhelming victory,' she said. 'They should get back in touch with [them] and make some money, which I don’t know if they do or not ’cause they’ve proven to be ideologues rather than [business people].'\nShe continued: 'What shocks me is the fact that they prefer to lose money and then explain that to the shareholders who apparently have no problem with that.'\nAlthough Barr has taken a step back from acting, she currently hosts The Roseanne Barr Podcast. \nAs for whether she would return to ABC, the star said: 'F**k no.' \n'I’d like to get paid handsomely to bring another shit f**king network back from doom as I’ve done twice for ABC,' Barr said. 'But I just don’t see how they would keep their nose out of my business. We’ll see. If not, I’ll just go somewhere else and put it on my own website.'\nAlabamaChinaRoseanne BarrHBO\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRoseanne Barr reveals wild new idea for a TV series comeback... 7 years after being cancelled\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nWynne Evans 'splits from girlfriend after she was left \"humiliated\" by his X-rated remark' as he breaks silence on Strictly tour withdrawal and issues apology\n\nEXCLUSIVETexts reveal Blake Lively's VERY flirty exchanges with Justin Baldoni before they went from friendly co-stars to enemies\n\nKendall Jenner's bizarre semi-nude gown causes pal Hailey Bieber to break down in tears\n\nEXCLUSIVECaught on video!

amid backlash","text":"“For all the hate, I’m going to answer with love,” the Long Beach-born rapper born Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. said in a recent video posted to his Instagram. He received fierce backlash after performing at a Jan. 18 event in Washington D.C. called the Crypto Ball, which celebrated the dawning election of Donald Trump.\n\nSmoking and listening to The Winans’ “Ain’t No Need to Worry” in his car, Snoop said, “Y’all can’t hate enough I love too much. Get your life right stop worrying about mine. I’m cool, I’m together. Still a Black man. Still 100% Black. All out ’til you ball out, or ’til you fall out.”\n\nTrump did not attend the Crypto Ball, and the event wasn’t a part of the once and current president’s official inaugural weekend program. But the Crypto Ball, held at the Andrew W. Mellon auditorium two days before the inauguration, was an explicit celebration of his victory in the 2024 election, and attended by Trump boosters and leaders in the cryptocurrency market, per Reuters.\n\nThe rappers Soulja Boy and Rick Ross also performed at the Crypto Ball, but the ire drawn by Snoop was particularly pointed, as the 53-year-old rapper and entrepreneur has been vocally critical of Trump in the past.\n\nSnoop pantomimed shooting a clown dressed as Trump for his 2017 remix of the BadBadNotGood song “Lavender,” and referenced him again in the song “M.A.C.A (Make America Crip Again)” from the same year. “The president say he wants to Make America Great Again, F— that s—,” he rapped.\n\nAt the end of Trump’s first term in office, Snoop called the president a “f—ing weirdo” on X, telling his fans, “if you voted for him, I have no problem with that, but if you’re still with him, f— you.”\n\nBut things seemed to change in 2021, when Trump commuted the sentence of Michael “Harry-O” Harris, the co-founder of Death Row Records who had served 30 years of a 25-to-life sentence for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. “That’s great work for the president and his team on the way out. They did some great work while they was in there,” Snoop told the New York Post at the time.\n\nHe changed his tune completely last year, when in conversation with The Sunday Times said, “Donald Trump? He ain’t done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me… I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump.”\n\nhe musicians who answered the call to perform at the Jan. 20 inauguration also faced backlash from fans, and some, like Snoop, have responded with evasive calls for peace and privacy.\n\n“I’m not political. I’m not out here trying to tell anybody who they should vote for,” the rapper Nelly told Willie D on YouTube after performing at the inauguration. “But what I will say is that, I respect the office. This isn’t politics. The politics, for me, is over. He won! He’s the president.”","summary":"“For all the hate, I’m going to answer with love,” the Long Beach-born rapper born Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. said in a recent video posted to his Instagram.

Speaking to House Republicans at a Florida retreat, the US President said the three countries, founding members of the increasingly influential BRICS bloc, were acting in their own best interests.“We're going to put tariffs on outside countries and people that really mean harm to us,” he said. “Well... they mean us harm, but they basically want to make their country good.

Kennedy Jr. begins his Department of Health and Human Services confirmation hearings, his cousin Caroline Kennedy came out swinging against his nomination.\n\n Caroline, 67, issued a scathing letter to senators on Tuesday, Jan. 28, calling her cousin, 71, a “predator,” as well as several other shocking claims against him. Caroline’s comments follow his siblings’ August 2024 statement denouncing him for promoting conspiracy theories and siding with President Donald Trump.\n\n See below what the daughter of John F. Kennedy said of her cousin and his beliefs.\n\n She alleges he is \"A 'predator' who encouraged others into substance abuse\" \n\n “It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets, because Bobby himself is a predator. He’s always been charismatic — able to attract others through the strength of his personality, his willingness to take risks and break the rules,” Caroline claimed. “I watch his younger brothers and cousins follow him down the path of drug addiction.\"\n\n Bobby’s late brother, David Anthony died from a drug overdose in April 1984, and three drugs were found in his body fluids at the time of his death, per The New York Times. Bobby’s niece, Saoirse Kennedy Hill, the only child of Courtney Kennedy Hill and Paul Hill, died of an accidental overdose on Aug. 1, 2019.\n\n Caroline continued: “But siblings and cousins that Bobby encouraged down the path of substance abuse suffered addiction, illness and death, while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie and cheat his way through life.”\n\n He allegedly showed others “how he put baby chickens and mice in a blender” \n\n Caroline alleged that when Robert “encouraged others into substance abuse,” he would have people in his basement, his garage and his dorm room, locations that “were always the center of the action where drugs were available.”\n\n She claimed that her cousin “enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed to his hawks,” adding, “It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.”\n\n Despite his opposition to vaccines, he vaccinates his children \n\n “Bobby preys on the desperation of parents of sick children, vaccinating his own kids while building a following hypocritically discouraging other parents from vaccinating theirs,” Caroline alleged. \n\n Robert has six children. He shares Robert Francis “Bobby” Kennedy III, 40, and Kathleen Alexandra “Kick” Kennedy, 36, with his ex-wife Emily Ruth Black. He shares Conor Kennedy, 30, Kyra Kennedy, 29, Aidan Kennedy, 26, and William \"Finn\" Kennedy, 23, with his ex-wife, Mary Richardson, who took her own life in 2012.\n\n Robert has one of the loudest voices behind the modern anti-vaccine movement. He previously lobbied Congress to allow parents to opt-out of state requirements for vaccinating their children.\n\n He “exploits his own painful family tragedies,” including the assassinations of his father and his uncle \n\n Towards the end of her letter, Caroline wrote that Robert “continues to grandstand off my father’s assassination, and that of his own father.” \n\n “It’s incomprehensible to me that someone who is willing to exploit his own painful family tragedies for publicity would be put in charge of America’s life and death situations,” she said.\n\n Caroline wrote that, unlike her cousin, she tries not to speak for her late father.\n\n “But I am certain that he and my uncle Bobby — who gave their lives in public service to this country — and my uncle Teddy, who devoted his long senate career to the cause of improving health care, would be disgusted,” she said.\n\n Caroline was referring to Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy, who served in the U.S. Senate for nearly five decades, representing Massachusetts.

Efforts to ban menthol cigarettes have been ongoing for multiple administrations, but, in April 2021, the Biden administration's FDA announced plans to finalize the rule. The move was met with praise from anti-smoking advocates, such as the Truth Initiative, which argue that menthol in cigarettes makes them more addictive and disproportionately impacts minority communities. The Biden administration subsequently delayed implementation of the rule out of concern that more time was needed to consider public comments and concerns. DIET AND NUTRITION EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON HOW RFK JR'S NOMINATION COULD IMPACT HOW WE EAT But a regulatory filing from President Donald Trump's Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the federal rulemaking process, slashed any hopes that the ban might come back any time soon. According to the filing, Trump moved to rescind the proposed rule during his first day in office. When reached for comment, the FDA cited an ongoing communications freeze imposed on all Health and Human Services Department sub-agencies. HHS WILL REEVALUATE PROGRAMS, REGULATIONS TO ENSURE TAXPAYER FUNDS ARE NOT PAYING FOR ELECTIVE ABORTIONS \"It is deeply disappointing that the FDA’s rule to prohibit menthol cigarettes was not finalized in a timely manner and has now been withdrawn,\" the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said in a statement. \"We strongly support eliminating menthol cigarettes to end the tobacco industry’s decades-long, predatory marketing of these deadly products to kids, Black Americans and other communities.\" The campaign said it will remain committed to building support to eliminate menthol cigarettes nationwide, noting \"it is more critical than ever that states and cities step up their efforts to end the sale of menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco products.\" Those challenging a menthol cigarette ban, meanwhile, argue the move could create a massive black market for cigarettes. People against the ban also fear the impact it could have on policing in minority communities. THE YEAR IN CANCER: ADVANCES MADE IN 2024, PREDICTIONS FOR 2025 \"Remember Eric Garner? New York City’s exorbitant taxes on cigarette packages generated an underground market in untaxed individual cigarettes, called ‘loosies.’ In 2014, police infamously encountered 43-​year-​old Eric Garner selling loosies on a street corner, and a policeman’s chokehold led to his death as he repeated ‘I can’t breathe.’ And this happened without a menthol ban,\" Jeffrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute's Department of Health Studies, wrote after the Biden administration moved to finalize the ban. \"With menthol cigarettes more prevalent among Black and Hispanic Americans, expect police to focus their attention on minority communities.

Out of many, one.\n\nWe honor and respect the uniqueness of every citizen. But we also have a common turf, a common set of transcendent values, that brings us together and we become one nation. \n\nSometimes, cracks appear. Sometimes, they grow and get larger and deeper. Things get dangerous when the cracks so severely deepen that they threaten to totally sever our common turf and our social cohesion. \n\nGenerally, the cracks reflect erosion of agreement about the nature of the core principles that hold us together. \n\nWe have arrived at the brink numerous times. But only once, the Civil War, did we cross it. Our principles were challenged over the question of slavery. It took the blood of individuals to heal the wounds of the nation.\n\nFor sure, I am not predicting civil violence in our country. But our common turf, our social reality, is clearly deeply, deeply frayed as there is increasing disagreement about our social reality, about the ideas and principles that bind us together and define us as a nation.\n\nNothing is more illustrative of what’s happening than President Donald Trump’s executive order, signed on day one of his presidency, to terminate “diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) discrimination in the federal workforce and in federal contracting and spending.” The order says that it is the “most important federal civil rights measure in decades.” \n\nTrump’s anti-DEI order revokes President Joe Biden’s DEI executive order, issued on his first day in office, which imposed DEI throughout the federal government in the name of “advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity.”\n\nTwo presidents, two parties both use the language of civil rights, both with a vision of what constitutes civil rights and social justice that are day and night. Complete opposites. \n\nTrump assumes leadership of a deeply fractured country that is leaning slightly to the side of his party. We see this in the thin margins by which Republicans control the House and Senate.\n\nDemocrats, the left, will work the current situation to fan the flames to brand Republicans and Trump racist.\n\nI would urge Black Americans to check the facts before buying into this narrative.\n\nAccording to a profile of Black Americans just produced by Pew Research, Blacks now constitute 14.4% of the American population. Other data reported by Pew say that Blacks constitute 18.6% of the federal workforce. So, if anything, Blacks should be concerned about disproportionate dependency on federal government employment rather than lack of equity.\n\nThe data also show that the median age of Black Americans is 32.6, almost six years less than the national median age. The increasing burden of debt accumulated by the federal government, the result of the dramatic growth in government – now around 100% of our GDP and projected to continue to worsen – will fall disproportionately on these younger Black citizens. As will be the burden of the essentially bankrupt state of affairs of our major entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare.\n\nPer Pew’s data, Black economic reality is solidly rooted in the middle class and above. Fifty-four percent of households headed by a Black American earn over $50,000. Thirty-seven percent earn over $75,000, and 25% earn over $100,000. This is not a profile of an oppressed Black America unable to work and achieve. \n\nBack to e pluribus unum. \n\nWe are facing competing claims about what holds us together as a nation. One vision focuses on individual freedom. Another vision focuses on government power. \n\nTrump was elected championing the vision of restoring individual freedom. Symptoms that drove more voters into the Trump/Republican camp – inflation, slow growth, diminishing international competitiveness – all are symptoms of excessive government. \n\nLike the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, our new Republican president has a sense of mission for a “new birth of freedom.” \n\nLet’s support him.","summary":"Our new president has a sense of mission for a 'new birth of freedom' – let's support him","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/trumps-dei-order-good-for-blacks-good-for-america/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/candy-race-racism-diversity-equity-inclusion-DEI-Unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:01:43","author":"Star Parker","authors":["Star Parker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.11},{"id":284922906,"title":"Letters: Hold politicians accountable for toxic Moss Landing fire","text":"Politicians must be\naccountable for fire\n\nRe: “Fire leads to toxic metals in the soil” (Page B1, Jan. 28).\n\nThe governor, state Sen.

Investors (read speculators) play a critical role in both reducing the supply of housing as well as increasing its costs. Some owners of apartment complexes purposely keep units off the market in order to maintain high rental prices. It’s not unusual for overseas buyers to obtain housing units as a means to move their capital offshore. They don’t always occupy these units. \n\nThe housing shortage is, to a large degree, manufactured. Why?

Does he believe these countries won’t experience the same problems he is currently having with refugees? Will citizens of those nations welcome them? Is he offering these nations any monetary help?

This does not seem to be the case with [China], although I suppose someone can hold out the hope that Beijing may come around,” Chong said.\nIn 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favour of the Philippines in its case against China over the South China Sea, declaring Beijing’s claims, including the nine-dash line, unlawful. China does not recognise this decision.\n\nMalaysia and Singapore have been involved in various disputes, including over Pedra Branca which the International Court of Justice ruled in favour of Singapore in 2008.\nIndonesia and Malaysia’s main maritime disputes have occurred in the Celebes Sea or Sulawesi Sea, with both countries claiming sovereignty over the Ligitan and Sipadan islands. The dispute over the Ambalat block of the Celebes Sea seabed, believed to be rich in mineral resources, remains unresolved.\nChong said that as the Malaysian leader, Anwar has the prerogative to determine what he considers appropriate regarding his country’s claims, subject to pressure from parliament and Malaysian voters.\n“He can absolutely choose to accommodate and set aside differences to seek cooperation and perhaps economic returns. Should Anwar’s government so desire, they can begin to cede all Malaysia’s claims in the South China Sea to [China] or any other actor.”\n“That is Malaysia’s sovereign right, and one of Asean’s foundational principles is non-interference in members’ domestic affairs,” Chong said.\nOh from the Pacific Research Centre believes that during his speech in Davos, Anwar was also trying to point out how ineffective Washington is at supporting free trade while criticising the US for standing “unconditionally and wholeheartedly with Israel”, contrasting it with the support China and Malaysia give to the Palestinians.\n“The US is ambivalent to free trade, which is the economic bloodline to Malaysia,” Oh said, adding that it is a sentiment shared among Asean countries.\n“Most Southeast Asian countries are developing ones, and you need to buy their hearts with cold hard cash, which the US was increasingly unwilling to do, in stark contrast to China.”\nRegarding the Palestinian issue, Indonesia, the largest and most powerful Asean country, shares a similar perspective with Malaysia, as both are Muslim-majority nations, Oh added.","summary":"Anwar’s statement at the World Economic Forum emphasises the need to balance strong relations with China while addressing maritime issues.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3296633/malaysias-anwar-urges-asean-not-single-out-beijing-over-south-china-sea-tensions-davos","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/28/069824da-0fc8-424a-823a-632495fc8ddb_4be1bb78.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 00:00:11","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.265},{"id":284917818,"title":"Trump administration offers buyouts to federal workers.

Across the board, GOP members of Congress and governors generally said they backed the idea of reviewing federal spending and that the order was in line with President Donald Trump's campaign promises. Still, a few said it was important for the White House to provide additional clarity to ensure certain services weren't affected. “This is not unusual for an administration to pause funding and to take a hard look and scrub of how these programs are being spent and how they interact with a lot of the executive orders that the president signed,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters when asked if Republicans plan to accept Trump's move or assert the power of the purse given to Congress. “I think that’s the main criteria they’re using, is: Do the executive orders implicate funding in this particular way? They have taken certain things off the table. ... They’re providing additional clarity and guidance on that. And hopefully they will further clarify what exactly will be impacted by this.” As Democrats blasted it as an authoritarian move by Trump to withhold money from middle class Americans to help finance tax breaks for the wealthy, many Republicans praised his aid freeze — offering remarks that served as a reminder that the president's honeymoon period is continuing with members of his party. At the House Republicans’ annual retreat at the Trump National Doral Miami golf club, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the president's move \"a common application of common sense.\" \"I fully support it,\" Johnson said. \"We want to make sure that the executive orders of the new president are being fully complied with with regard to these programs.\" A federal judge temporarily blocked Trump’s plan to pause federal aid spending Tuesday evening, kicking off a legal battle that could end up before the Supreme Court. \"There will always be a balance-of-power struggle going on here, but I think that the spending of the federal government is so out of control that we need a pause here,\" said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas. \"So I support the president pausing.\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said that Trump’s order to halt federal grants is “right on target” for accomplishing his agenda. And Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., said: “I also think that a lot of these grants were predicated on divisive, discriminatory and illegal DEI, so we’ll find out more.” One of the few skeptics in the party of Trump's move was Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is in a category of one as the only GOP senator representing a blue state. She's also the chair of the Appropriations Committee, which oversees the part of the U.S. budget subject to annual review. \"There certainly is justification to take a hard look at some programs, but this is far too sweeping, and will cause disruption in the Administration of a lot of important programs and services,\" Collins said in a statement, adding that she was \"concerned about the impact\" it would have. At the House GOP retreat in Florida, only one lawmaker, centrist Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., raised concerns about Trump's federal freeze. He said Tuesday morning he had received several calls from constituents worried that programs back home would be interrupted. “This stuff is appropriated by Congress. It’s already been signed on the law, so I would say disagree with it,” said Bacon, who represents an Omaha-based district won by Kamala Harris in 2024. Hours later, Bacon said he received backlash from fellow Republicans for criticizing Trump. “I got asked about ‘Hey why did you speak up?’ I said how are we supposed defend if we don’t even know what’s coming out or what it really means and I’ve got constituents calling. It’s just part of life. There’s a book calling 'Relationships are messy,' so this is just messy,\" Bacon said Tuesday afternoon, adding that he got \"just a little bit\" of backlash. \"I’m not going to say who,\" he added. \"I had to express my perspective. ... It was a surprise.” Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., a member of the House Oversight Committee's new \"DOGE\" subcommittee, said Trump’s freeze is sending the right message on federal spending. “That’s the way you gotta do it. You got to stop them. And then you make sure there’s no abuses, and then, if possible, you bring some of them back,” Burchett said at the House Republican conference. Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, chair of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, also cheered Trump’s first week in office, including the attempted freeze. “The man is back in office. This time, he is prepared better than he was the first time. He’s got great people take his Cabinet positions and these appointments, and he has a plan, and he is moving at a speed that no one can anticipate. And I could not be happier to see what is happening in this country,” Babin said in an interview at Trump's resort in Doral. “I’m not hearing any concerns about what he’s doing from back home. All I am getting is just congratulations and thanking me and the president for taking this country away from the woke direction we’ve been in for four long years,\" Babin said. Meanwhile, Republican governors across the country were largely silent on the matter, although a pair of them offered some cautious criticism. Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, in a statement issued jointly with other Republican leaders in the legislature, praised Trump’s move as one “we whole heartedly embrace” while also urging the OMB to come up with a plan to “untangle” the ongoing mess. New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte said in a statement that she supported the action, but cautioned about the disturbance to services it could cause. “While I support a commonsense review of federal spending to ensure it is in the taxpayers’ best interest, we cannot allow interruptions to critical services for those who depend on them,” Ayotte said. “My office has been in communication with the White House to ensure that our citizens are not negatively impacted by any unintended impacts and that critical services continue without interruption.” On the other hand, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin defended Trump, while noting that he’d confirmed with the White House that the plan wouldn’t interrupt a number of crucial services. “The partisan stunt to disseminate knowingly misleading information is dangerous fearmongering and completely wrong.

The court simultaneously issued a warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif for his role in the attack on October 7, 2023, against southern Israel.\n\nThe ICC has denied bias in its actions.\n\nSpeaking before the vote, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Party leader in the Republican-controlled Senate, said the sanctions bill is “one I largely support and would like to see become law”.\n\n“However, as much as I oppose the ICC bias against Israel, as much as I want to see that institution drastically reformed and reshaped, the bill before us is poorly drafted and deeply problematic,” he said, arguing the bill could hurt both US allies and businesses that deal with the court.\n\nHe called for Republicans to go back to the negotiating table to tweak the language in the legislation.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor in support of the bill, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, said the targeting of a “close US ally should concern all of us”.\n\n“While the ICC is targeting Israelis today, it could easily set its sights on Americans,” he said.\n\nSenator John Fetterman was the sole Democrat to vote in favour of the legislation. He swiftly earned praise from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the vastly influential pro-Israel lobby.\n\nIn a post on the social media platform X, the group thanked Fetterman for his “principled pro-Israel leadership and for standing with Israel against the ICC’s baseless attacks”.\n\nIn the past, President Donald Trump took a hard line against the ICC, imposing sanctions on its officials in 2020 over concerns that the court was probing US military actions abroad.\n\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden later revoked that order, but Trump reversed Biden’s decision upon taking office last week.\n\nHis move has so far been symbolic, as the reversal did not automatically re-impose the sanctions.\n\n‘Culture of impunity’\n\nNeither the US nor Israel are parties to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC.\n\nHowever, the court has argued that, because the alleged war crimes occurred in Gaza, Israeli officials could be held liable for their actions.\n\nThe State of Palestine has been a member of the ICC since 2015.\n\nThe court had used a similar argument in issuing arrest warrants for Russian officials for alleged abuses in Ukraine, a move hailed by US officials at the time. Russia is not a party to the ICC, but Ukraine is.\n\nIn issuing warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant, ICC prosecutors have argued that Israeli restrictions on aid to Gaza, including water and medicine, amounted to starvation as a method of warfare.\n\nThe two Israeli officials were also accused of crimes against humanity, including murder and persecution, as well as the war crime of directing attacks against civilians.\n\nTo date, Israel’s war in Gaza has killed 47,354 Palestinians, while displacing nearly the entire population of the enclave. There has been a tenuous ceasefire since January 19.\n\nThe ICC had also sought warrants for Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and its top leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, before both men were killed in Israeli strikes.\n\nEarlier this month, UN experts called on the US Senate to reject the bill after it was passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\n“It is shocking to see a country that considers itself a champion of the rule of law trying to stymie the actions of an independent and impartial tribunal set up by the international community, to thwart accountability,” the experts said.\n\nThey added that threats to the ICC “promote a culture of impunity”.\n\nIn an article published by the Just Security website on Monday, current and former presidents of the Assembly of States Parties of the International Criminal Court, the body that manages the court, warned that sanctions could “severely hinder” at least 20 investigations across the world.\n\n“While challenges remain, we are committed to the ICC’s vision of justice and its mandate to ensure that no one is above the law, regardless of power,” they wrote.\n\n“Efforts to undermine the ICC are attacks on the principle that law protects the weak against the powerful.”","summary":"UN experts have warned that US sanctions over Benjamin Netanyahu&#039;s arrest warrant would erode international order.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/28/us-senate-blocks-bill-sanctioning-icc-over-israeli-arrest-warrants?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-28T212315Z_1871291616_RC29JCAZQXRL_RTRMADP_3_USA-CONGRESS-1738105540.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 23:58:09","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":284923456,"title":"CNN staff ‘embarrassed’ by post-election direction: ‘They’re paying people to kiss Donald Trump’s ass’","text":"CNN is not a happy place in the first weeks of the new administration, we hear.\n\nInsiders fume that execs are paying people to “kiss Trump’s ass” and fear the network — which lauds itself as “the most trusted name in news” — is veering right to bring in viewers.\n\nWe’re told that — under new boss Mark Thompson, who has been accused of pandering to the White House — it’s gotten so bad that some employees are ashamed to even work there.\n\nAfter Jim Acosta, one of Trump’s most vocal on-air critics, announced he was leaving the network on Tuesday after being bumped to the graveyard shift, a source told Page Six, “longtime CNN employees, who are actual journalists, are embarrassed.”\n\nConservative contributor Scott Jennings is a regular on Abby Phillip’s 10 p.m. roundtable show “CNN NewsNight,” and we’re told he is alienating employees with his MAGA talking points. \n\n“They pay him to kiss Donald Trump’s ass… Some of the editorial people don’t even want their names associated with it, but [CNN brass] think it’s good television and encourage it. It’s embarrassing,” the source said.\n\nCNN vets Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown are replacing Acosta’s 10 a.m.”CNN Newsroom” show. \n\nAcosta was slated for the graveyard shift before he decided not to accept his new timeslot and flee the network. \n\nTrump posted on social media, “Jim Acosta, one of the worst and most dishonest reporters in journalistic history, a major sleazebag, has been relegated by CNN Fake News to the Midnight hour, ‘Death Valley,’ because of extraordinarily BAD RATINGS (and no talent!).” He added, “Word is that he wants to QUIT, and that would be even better. Jim is a major loser who will fail no matter where he ends up. Good luck Jim!”\n\nAcosta is the latest of a slew of veteran CNN broadcasters – including Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon, Aliyson Camerota and Poppy Harlow – to exit in recent years as the network “struggles to find its voice.” \n\n“It’s clear they’re acquiescing to Trump, especially with what they did to Acosta. Morale is low!,” said a source.\n\nNot to mention, “everyone’s upset by another round of layoffs,” they added. \n\nAnd to make matters worse, the network is suffering horrific ratings, and it’s been hit with several rounds of layoffs — the latest of which hit just this week.\n\nA third source said, “people have been really unhappy for a long time,” but “the layoffs weren’t a shocker.”\n\n“A lot of people in television know and understand that Trump was elected, and there are certain ways you have to program around this new administration when you’re in the business of getting viewers,” said the third source.\n\nStill, “People are not happy because they’re not doing what hey love, and are overworked doing things they’re not passionate about,” they added. \n\nSurprisingly, we hear they loathe their jobs so much, they’re even longing for the days of unpopular boss Chris Licht, whom Thompson replaced. \n\n“People were much happier under Chris because he was so hands off and didn’t really touch the programming. [Thompson] is doing just that,” the third source said. \n\n A fourth insider acknowledged, “we certainly have our challenges – as most media companies do during this historical disruption – CNN has the most motivated, committed and hardworking workforce in the world, and that’s one of our greatest strengths.” \n\nMeanwhile, in his final farewell message, Acosta encouraged viewers not to “give in to the lies.” “Don’t give in to the fear. Hold on to the truth. And to hope, even if you have to get out your phone, record that message,” he said, while equating Trump to a “tyrant.”\n\n“I will not give in to the lies. I will not give in to the fear. Post it on your social media, so people can hear from you, too,” he said. \n\nA CNN spokesperson told us, “We have always held power to account without fear or favor.

It cast an aspirational vision for Americans to rally around. \n\n“The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation,” he said. “And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.”\n\nThat would be incredible. Given all that Elon Musk and SpaceX have done, it even seems possible. From the start, Americans have been exploring, pushing boundaries and creating new settlements. Instead of apologizing for the things that made America great, Trump is embracing them. Trump is proud to be an American, and he wants you to be, too. \n\nBut making America – and Mars – great again requires something else. More babies. \n\nLast April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that America’s fertility rate had dropped to a “historic low.” The total fertility rate was 1,616.5 births per 1,000 women. The country needs 2,100 births per 1,000 women to maintain its population. America’s fertility rate “has generally been below replacement since 1971 and consistently below replacement since 2007,” a CDC report stated.\n\nA shrinking population presents major challenges. Even with technological advantages, the country needs young adults to serve in the military. Some of tomorrow’s greatest innovators aren’t being born. As people age, they become more dependent on others and less economically productive. The country’s massive national debt and unfunded pension obligations will exacerbate this demographic problem. \n\nThe human cost will be brutal, too. Even though parenting can be exhausting, children bring meaning and purpose. Many will miss out on the chance to become grandparents. Each year, tens of thousands of people die without someone to claim the body. If births keep falling, that number will only increase. \n\nLegal immigration can paper over some of these economic problems. But it isn’t a cure-all. Assimilation doesn’t happen when immigrants arrive in such numbers that they overwhelm the melting pot. \n\nLow fertility is often seen as primarily a financial issue. But the data doesn’t show that. High-income households have a lower birth rate than lower-income households. Also, the U.S. is the richest country in the history of the world. If wealth resulted in more children, this wouldn’t be an issue.\n\nFundamentally, the problem is cultural. Our society urges young people to prioritize their careers over forming families. It tells young women to dream about being “girl bosses,” not stay-at-home moms. A major argument for abortion is that women will be hurt financially if they can’t slaughter their unborn children. Religious women have more children, but an increasing number of women are nonreligious. \n\nAnother factor is that more people aren’t getting married. Nearly half of women who have never married by their early 40s have not had children. Among married women, it’s 9%. But even couples that do tie the knot are waiting until their early 30s on average, giving them fewer fertile years together. \n\nReversing these trends would improve birth rates. There’s no magic button here, but culture can change rapidly. Look at how quickly DEI is fading in the private sector as Trump roots out racial discrimination in the federal government. \n\nTrump should use his marketing genius to give social status to moms, especially those with four or more children. Send them a medal or give them special parking privileges. Anything to signal to them that society sees motherhood as uniquely valuable and worth aspiring to. \n\nTrump should also directly encourage his younger, married supporters to have one more child than they were planning to. \n\nWho knows? That baby could grow up to be the one who plants the American flag on Mars.","summary":"'Trump should use his marketing genius to give social status to moms'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/making-america-great-again-requires-more-babies/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/babies-cloning.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 23:51:35","author":"Victor Joecks","authors":["Victor Joecks"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.096},{"id":284917004,"title":"Federal funding freeze: Impact on Medicaid and global HIV treatment programs","text":"The recent decision by President Donald Trump to suspend federal financial assistance has sparked widespread outrage and alarm, with significant ramifications for both domestic health insurance and global health initiatives. From blocked Medicaid portals in the United States to halted HIV treatment programs in developing nations, the funding freeze has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers, international organizations, and healthcare professionals..Medicaid Portals Blocked NationwideOnline portals for the Medicaid program, which provides health insurance to low-income families, seniors, and other vulnerable populations, have been inaccessible since the funding freeze took effect. Reports of portal outages came from all 50 states, as confirmed by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden.“This is a blatant attempt to rip away health insurance from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,” Wyden stated on X (formerly Twitter). The Medicaid freeze has also disrupted payment systems for healthcare providers. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy highlighted the consequences, stating that doctors in his state were unable to process payments.Medicaid plays a critical role in the U.S. healthcare system, covering millions of seniors and approximately 40% of all births in the country. Democratic lawmakers have labeled the funding suspension unconstitutional and warned of its potentially deadly effects..Global HIV Programs in JeopardyThe World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed “deep concern” over the freeze’s impact on global HIV treatment initiatives. Many developing countries rely on U.S.-funded programs to provide lifesaving care and medications to those living with HIV. The WHO has urged the U.S. to grant exemptions to ensure that treatment efforts continue without disruption.“We call on the government of the United States of America to enable additional exemptions to ensure the delivery of lifesaving HIV treatment and care,” the organization stated on X.The suspension of foreign aid follows a directive issued by acting director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Matthew Vaeth. While the freeze was initially aimed at halting federal spending, critics argue that it disproportionately affects the world’s most vulnerable populations..Temporary Block on the Funding FreezeIn a recent development, a U.S. district court judge temporarily blocked President Trump’s federal aid freeze, citing the potential for \"irreparable harm.\" District Judge Loren AliKhan, presiding over an emergency hearing, made the decision on Tuesday and scheduled another hearing for Monday. The freeze is blocked until 5:00 pm (2200 GMT) that day, as reported by multiple U.S. media outlets. This decision adds a layer of uncertainty to the ongoing crisis, with advocates viewing the block as a temporary reprieve for affected programs and populations..Shared Impacts on Vulnerable PopulationsThe funding freeze highlights a troubling commonality: its disproportionate effects on populations that rely heavily on government assistance. Domestically, low-income families, seniors, and healthcare providers are left in limbo. Internationally, millions of individuals dependent on HIV treatment face the risk of losing access to essential care.This move has drawn accusations of constitutional violations, with experts and lawmakers warning of dire public health consequences. As the freeze’s impact continues to unfold, the urgency for action grows, with advocates calling for immediate solutions to mitigate harm..Funding freeze creates global health crisisPresident Trump's federal funding freeze has sparked a widespread crisis reaching far beyond US borders. The decision has left millions vulnerable - from Americans depending on Medicaid to people living with HIV in developing countries. The sudden halt in funding reveals how easily health systems can collapse when stable financial support disappears.

I haven’t laid down. \n\n‘You don’t have to, you can just close your eyes and float where you are right here.’\n\nThe astronaut also told the students the delay in coming home was ‘a little bit of a shock.\n\n‘We knew that it would be probably a month or so, honestly,’ she said of her and Wilmore’s voyage.\n\n‘But the extended stay was a little bit different.’ \n\nThe pair had been doomed by a cascade of vexing thruster failures and helium leaks in the Boeing capsule, which marred their trip to the space station.\n\nThey ended up in a holding pattern as engineers conducted tests and debated what to do about the trip back. \n\nUltimately, NASA decided that it was too risky to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth on Boeing’s capsule – and said they would instead arrive back on a SpaceX spacecraft in February.\n\nStill, Williams and Wilmore’s replacements will not arrive at the International Space Station until late March or early April – meaning that the stranded astronauts will have to stay until then to conduct a handover. \n\n‘This has not been an easy decision, but it is absolutely the right one,’ Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator, said at the time. \n\nThe decision to use SpaceX to retrieve the astronauts was a blow to Boeing, adding to the safety concerns plaguing the company on its airplane side. \n\nBoeing had counted on Starliner’s first crew trip to revive the troubled program after years of delays and ballooning costs. \n\nThe company had insisted Starliner was safe based on all the recent thruster tests both in space and on the ground.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore also initially said they had trust in the thruster testing being conducted. They had no complaints, they added, and enjoyed pitching in with space station work. \n\nYet Starliner’s woes began long before Williams and Wilmore took it up to the space station.\n\nBad software fouled the first test flight without a crew in 2019, prompting a do-over in 2022. \n\nThen parachute and other issues cropped up, including a helium leak in the capsule’s propellant system that nixed a launch attempt in May. The leak eventually was deemed to be isolated and small enough to pose no concern. But more leaks sprouted following liftoff, and five thrusters also failed.\n\nAll but one of those small thrusters restarted in flight. But engineers remain perplexed as to why some thruster seals appear to swell, obstructing the propellant lines, then revert to their normal size.\n\nThese 28 thrusters are vital. \n\nBesides needed for space station rendezvous, they keep the capsule pointed in the right direction at flight’s end as bigger engines steer the craft out of orbit. Coming in crooked could result in catastrophe.\n\nStill, NASA isn’t giving up on Boeing, with Administrator Bill Nelson saying he is ‘100%’ certain that Starliner will fly again.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk vowed on Tuesday to bring the two astronauts&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Elon Musk pledges to rescue NASA astronauts stuck in space quickly after being asked by Trump, criticizes Biden for delay first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/elon-musk-pledges-to-rescue-nasa-astronauts-stuck-in-space-quickly-after-being-asked-by-trump-criticizes-biden-for-delay/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rewrite-this-title-Musk-vows-to-bring-stranded-NASA-astronauts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 23:43:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":284913776,"title":"Three cheers for John Fetterman refusing to blindly toe the Dems’ — and Sunny Hostin & Co’s — party line","text":"What if I told you the most sensible person in Washington, DC, is a tattooed Democrat from Pennsylvania who shows up to work in a sloppy black hoodie?\n\nTwo years ago, I would have laughed at such a suggestion. \n\nBut post-election, Sen. John Fetterman has continued his metamorphosis into one of the most refreshing politicians of our time — bravely crossing partisan lines to call out nonsense and champion America’s bedrock values.\n\nOn Monday, he humbled the women of “The View,” who seem to exist in 2025 simply to henpeck to death anyone who hasn’t enthusiastically enlisted in the Trump resistance.\n\nFetterman patiently dismantled their extremely narrow view — calling Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s prosecution of Donald Trump politically motivated and defending his own right to execute his job as he sees fit.\n\nHe did it without being a hysterical lunatic fishing for social media clout.\n\nAnd without raising his voice or, I suspect, his blood pressure.\n\n“Whether that’s a Democrat going after a Republican or a Republican going after a Democrat, I like to think I call it strikes and balls because the judicial system has to remain impartial. That’s really the cornerstone of our society,” he said of Bragg, who passed on prosecuting real criminals in the streets of New York City but threw the book at Trump.\n\n“I’m on record criticizing, going after Hunter Biden. And I also agree that the [Trump hush-money] trial in this city, in New York, was politically motivated,” Fetterman said.\n\nSunny Hostin — one of the shrillest voices of “The View” — couldn’t take it. \n\n“Just for clarification,” she condescendingly said, shaming this man for refusing to toe the party line. “Did you mean that the 34-count case in which Donald Trump was found guilty of various financial crimes was politically motivated here in New York?” \n\nNot to be outdone by haughty Hostin, co-host Ana Navarro chimed in. In the preamble to her lecture, she noted that she had generously supported Republicans Mitt Romney and former Ohio senator Rob Portman working with President Joe Biden. However …\n\n“I didn’t love the optics of you going to Mar-a-Lago .. .which is [Trump’s] palace,” she told Fetterman in her most scolding tone.\n\nBecause it’s only Republicans who should meet with Dems in power — not the other way around, you see.\n\nFetterman, though, was controlled and good humored as he told her that “engaging the president when you’re in this business, that’s part of the job.”\n\nHe described Trump as “kind” and “cordial,” adding, “It wasn’t any kind of theater. It wasn’t trying to get your picture taken to put something out on social media, it was just really a conversation.”\n\nHe compared it to Gov. Gavin Newsom, another Democrat, welcoming our president to California to get things accomplished.\n\nFetterman’s appearance underscored how he is unmoved by team jerseys. And that he’s way more in touch with the American people than the co-hosts of “The View,” who continue to act like they’re on a pink pussy hat reunion tour, playing all the hits from 2017.\n\nThis man is the normie whisperer of DC. And the beleaguered Democrats, who abandoned governing for virtue signaling, could use some of that normie energy about now.\n\nEven his ridiculous “style” has grown on me. If clothes make the man, Fetterman makes the hoodie.\n\nI admit that when Fetterman, who suffered a serious stroke in 2022, ran for his Senate seat that year, I was horrified that a man so seemingly diminished was off to Capitol Hill.\n\nBut he has emerged clear eyed and pragmatic, as evidenced by his unshakeable support of Israel in the wake of the October 7 massacre by Hamas.\n\nAnd while I know I disagree with Fetterman on certain issues now, and will in the future, I’ll respect his fearlessness in the way he does business. And his willingness to speak to anyone — rather than burrow in his partisan warren, like so many creatures of our swamp.\n\nWe need more Fettermans in politics today. But few have his conviction, common sense or, let’s face it, cojones.","summary":"John Fetterman is the normie whisperer of DC.

Dumping refers to when a country exports products to other countries at a much lower price than in those countries' existing markets. While Topalian said Nucor will \"compete against anybody in the world,\" this dumping \"creates a very unbalanced and unlevel playing field that has hurt the steel industry for decades.\"\n\nTopalian also briefly discussed U.S. Steel, following rumors that peer Cleveland-Cliff's wants to acquire the company after the government blocked Japan's Nippon Steel from buying it. CNBC reported that Cleveland-Cliffs intends to buy U.S. Steel and then sell the company to Nucor. Nucor said last year that it had been interested in acquiring some of U.S. Steel's assets, but ultimately did not do so because of pricing concerns.\n\n\"We're the largest steel company in North America, so of course we took a look a year and a half ago and, and, we'll continue to look and see if those assets come back,\" he said. \"But, part of the reason we didn't move forward is valuation. We're not going to overpay for assets.\"\n\nAccording to Topalian, U.S. Steel is \"a shell of itself\" because leadership didn't recognize technological innovation, changes in the industry and emerging competitors. He claimed that looking at his company's net earnings, \"it would take the next three competitors combined to get anywhere close to what Nucor has done.\"\n\nCleveland-Cliffs and U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to request for comment.","summary":"In a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Nucor CEO Leon Topalian expressed optimism about what Trump's tariff policies mean for the U.S. steel industry.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/nucor-ceo-says-hes-optimistic-about-trump-policies-for-steel-trade.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105527980-1540412556672ap_18212438793214.jpg?v=1643315891","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 23:40:31","author":"Julie Coleman","authors":["Julie Coleman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.422}]}
