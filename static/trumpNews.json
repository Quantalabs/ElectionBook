He was ultimately confirmed by a vote of 50-49, with two Republican senators voting against him and one GOP senator not voting.The ContextBove's elevation to the third circuit court of appeals—which hears cases from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware—came after he was accused by whistleblowers of suggesting that the Trump administration may have to ignore judicial orders. Bove has vehemently denied the allegations against him.What To KnowThe two Republican senators who voted against confirming Bove were:\nAlaska Senator Lisa Murkowski\nMaine Senator Susan Collins\nSenator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee did not vote.The first whistleblower complaint against Bove came from Erez Reuveni, a former DOJ lawyer who was fired in April after conceding in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who had been living in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison.In his complaint, Reuveni detailed attempts by top DOJ officials in the weeks before his firing to stonewall and mislead judges as part of a broader effort to deliver on Trump's pledge to ramp up deportations.He described on DOJ meeting in March about Trump's plan to invoke the rarely-used Alien Enemies Act to carry out the deportations of migrants the administration has accused of being members of the notorious Tren de Aragua Venezuelan gang.At that meeting, Reuveni said, Bove said that a court might block the deportations before they could happen and said the DOJ might have to \"ignore any such order\" from the courts.Bove rebuked Reuveni's allegations, saying earlier that he had \"no recollection of saying anything of that kind.\"What People Are SayingSenate Judiciary Committee Democrats said in an X post ahead of Bove's confirmation on Tuesday: \"Three whistleblowers have come forward to tell us the truth about Emil Bove. It's troubling that Senate Republicans refused to hear their testimonies in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"Democratic Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey wrote on X on Monday: \"We must say no to Emil Bove. Over 900 former DOJ officials say he's unfit — accusing him of silencing career prosecutors and undermining court decisions. We need judges with independence and integrity, not loyalty to a single man.\"Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana defended Bove on Tuesday, telling CNN's Kasie Hunt: \"I know we have a lot of whistleblowers, but let me see how I can put this, Kasie. If everyone's a racist, no one's a racist. If everyone's corrupt, no one is corrupt. If my Democratic colleagues are going to trot out whistleblowers two and three at a time every time we have a nominee they don't agree with, they sort of lose their efficacy. And that's the situation we're in right now.\"This is a breaking news story.

Cory Booker opposed the unanimous approval of a bipartisan set of police funding proposals.\n\nThe unexpected confrontation revolved around seven initiatives, previously endorsed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, aimed at enhancing resources and safety measures for first responders and police officers.\n\n“I’m exhausted by the president of the United States breaching the Constitution, undermining our traditions, and how does the Democratic Party respond? By complying? Permitting? Settling for less? I demand justice,” declared Booker, D-N.J., in the Senate chamber.\n\n“It’s time for Democrats have a backbone. It’s time for us to fight. It’s time for us to draw lines,” he added.\n\nBooker’s stance on the package was countered by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., a law enforcement supporter in the Senate who was advocating for the legislative package on the floor.\n\nBooker sought to adjust the funding proposals, contending that the public safety grants would favor law enforcement agencies in Trump-preferred states while disadvantaging others. He stated that his amendment offered a crucial provision to protect the grants from being politically biased.\n\n“I propose we reject this and demand, in a united manner, an end to this constitutionally unfair allocation of resources that we endorse,” Booker stated regarding the legislative package.\n\nCortez Masto rejected Booker’s amendment, calling it a “poison pill” since the legislation had already passed through a committee of which Booker is a member.\n\n“I agree, withholding funding for law enforcement anywhere in the country, across the country, is just not acceptable,” Cortez Masto said. “But I also agree that two wrongs don’t make a right.”\n\nBooker said the contention that his amendment was a “poison pill” was “ridiculous.” He then blocked the package of bills, which all of the other Democrats in his caucus had agreed to pass unanimously with Republicans.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Democrats have engaged in “a long dispute over this type of funding” that predated the Trump administration. She appeared to choke back emotion in defense of the legislation.\n\n“I completely agree with Sen. Booker about what this administration is doing. But you can’t just pick out a few bills that came out of a committee and say, ‘I’m going to stop those,’ and then allow for other bills that fund other parts of your budget in your state,” Klobuchar said.\n\nCortez Masto and Klobuchar had worked alongside Republicans on the bills, which focused on providing additional protections, training and tools for officers and their families.\n\nBooker responded by sharply rejecting what he framed as assaults on his “integrity” and “motives.” \n\n“I am standing for my police officers. I’m standing for the Constitution, and I’m standing for what’s right. And dear God, if you want to come at me that way, you’re gonna have to pick it up with me, because there’s too much on the line right now in America,” he said. \n\n“When are we going to stand together for principles that I just heard that were agreed with?” he added.\n\nBooker also took aim at the Democratic Party as a whole, saying, “This, to me, is the problem with Democrats in America right now is we’re willing to be complicit to Donald Trump.”\n\n“We are standing at a moment where our president is eviscerating the Constitution of the United States of America, and we’re willing to go along with that today. No, no, not on my watch,” he added.\n\nCortez Masto later moved to unanimously pass just two of the seven bills, which were approved after Booker did not object. Those measures would include certain retired law enforcement officers in a death benefits program and establish standards for trauma kits.\n\nBooker said he supported them “because they will apply to every officer in the United States of America. That’s the way this body should work, and I have no objection whatsoever.”\n\nThe public sparring provided an extraordinary glimpse into an internal debate among congressional Democrats as they struggle to navigate the need to legislate in the face of a Trump administration that has at times put up roadblocks to congressional directives.\n\nCortez Masto, who was advocating for the passage of the package Booker objected to, also voted with Republicans to pass a short-term government funding package in March, a move seen as pragmatic by some but viewed as capitulation by many on the left looking for a fight in Trump’s second term.\n\nIn comments off the floor, Booker told reporters, “There’s a lot of us in this caucus that want to f—–g fight, and what’s bothering me right now is we don’t see enough fight in this caucus.”\n\nBooker has emerged as a key Democratic voice in opposition to the Trump administration. He set the record for the longest speech in Senate history this year in remarks that said the Trump administration presented a “grave and urgent” threat to the country.\n\nCortez Masto told NBC News after the floor debate that she “was disappointed” by some of Booker’s rhetoric that Democrats are “not doing enough to take on Donald Trump.”\n\n“I come from a swing state and have to beat back opponents to win my state and take on Donald Trump,” Cortez Masto said. “So it really is to me about how we work together to keep our communities safe and pass bipartisan, unanimous legislation that really came out of this committee, and that’s where our focus should be.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Senate witnessed an unusual and intense dispute among Democrats on Tuesday&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Senate Floor Sees Intense Debate as Democrats Disagree on Police Funding first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/senate-floor-sees-intense-debate-as-democrats-disagree-on-police-funding/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Democrats-clash-over-police-funding-in-heated-debate-on-Senate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-30 00:35:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":346432582,"title":"Colorado Family Moves to New Zealand for the Safety of Their Transgender Daughter Chase, Age 9","text":"A family from Colorado has relocated to New Zealand, fearing the potential persecution of their nine-year-old transgender daughter if they remained in the United States.\n\nParents Brandon and Candace, who would not reveal their last name over safety fears, left Denver earlier this month with their kids Holt and Chase.\n\nTheir daughter, Chase, who identified as transgender several years ago, prompted the family to start seeking a new home after Donald Trump was re-elected as President.\n\nOn his first day back, President Trump signed an executive order defining only two genders. Within 24 hours, the family decided to leave the country due to this action.\n\nCandace, speaking with 9news, mentioned, “We realized we needed some kind of escape plan, even if it wasn’t concrete initially, and we started discussing and seriously considering it.”\n\nBrandon told the outlet that people they knew had tried to calm their fears by saying Trump wouldn’t go after the trans or queer community.\n\n‘When he did, it was so much worse. We thought it was going to be one at a time and over a period of time’, he said.\n\n“Within the first 24 hours, it became evident that this was targeting not just the entire queer community but specifically trans individuals and trans youth, prompting us to act swiftly and begin planning,” she added.\n\nChase also commented on the family’s significant 8,000-mile relocation to Queenstown, New Zealand, expressing to her parents, “they don’t have to do this,” but also feeling “grateful” for their protective actions.\n\nBrandon and Candace said they had looked to their daughter to learn and support her in her identity, and as hostility towards transgender people grew, so did their concerns. \n\nA friend of theirs had moved to New Zealand previously and encouraged them to consider it as their new home, citing its progressive values. \n\nAfter researching, they decided on the move. Brandon, who works in the alcohol industry, was approved for an immigration visa through a job at a winery. \n\nHe added: ‘It is an extreme decision. And we are privileged to even have the means to do it. We don’t take that for granted. But this is for the safety of our daughter.’\n\nThe couple had concerns that Chase’s access to health could be cut off, with states now actively passing laws blocking gender-affirming care for minors. \n\nColorado, where they lived, still allows this type of care, but they feared that a ban would be passed on a federal level. \n\nCandace added: ‘There’s all these laws here to protect us. But it’s what is [Trump] going to do nationally that’s going to supersede any sort of state protection we had and how bad is it going to be.’\n\nOn July 1 they officially left their home in the Centennial State, before eventually arriving in New Zealand last week, according to the outlet. \n\nCandace told the outlet that the move proved harder than she originally expected it to be, having to say goodbye to family and friends.\n\nShe added: ‘There have to be brighter days ahead. When it gets really hard, I just imagine our lives in six months and how much better it feels. That’s what I keep holding on to.\n\nChase spoke with the outlet, saying: ‘It’s horrible you get no rights. My family does not feel safe with Trump as president.\n\n‘[My parents are] just putting in all this work just for me and my brother just so we can be safe. \n\n‘I told them they don’t have to do this. But they keep doing it. And it just makes me so grateful.’\n\nDaily Mail have contacted the family for comment. \n\nIt comes after an Arizona transgender woman applied for asylum in Canada over fears she was no longer safe. \n\nHannah Kreager, 22, ‘fled’ her home in the Grand Canyon State for the Canadian city of Calgary.\n\n‘I have fled in hopes of finding safety, security, and the freedom to continue to live my life, and access/take my medications as prescribed,’ she wrote on a GoFundMe page.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA family from Colorado has relocated to New Zealand, fearing the potential&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Colorado Family Moves to New Zealand for the Safety of Their Transgender Daughter Chase, Age 9 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/colorado-family-moves-to-new-zealand-for-the-safety-of-their-transgender-daughter-chase-age-9/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Colorado-family-flees-US-for-NEW-ZEALAND-over-fears-for.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-30 00:34:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.478},{"id":346429828,"title":"The 8 Best Portable Speakers for Your Dorm Room That (Hopefully) Won’t Annoy Your Roommates","text":"Skip to main content\n\nJuly 29, 2025\n\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nWhen we think of dorm room necessities, things like shower caddies, bedsheets and desk fans all immediately spring to mind.

As for the sound, it’s impressively clear for a speaker of this size, even if the bass doesn’t have as much authority to it. But again, given its tiny size, it puts out surprisingly rich sound, and the fact that it’s so light and portable means it’s the kind of speaker you’ll want to bring everywhere, and the IP67 rating means you don’t have to be too precious with it.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\n\nThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\n\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\n100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\n\nbest with lighting\n\nMusiBaby M88 Pro\n\nBuy Now on amazon\n\nThis portable speaker boasts high stereo sound quality, delivering a booming 40w of bass despite its smaller size.

Still, it’s a great option if you want something ultra-portable to take outside of your dorm room.\n\nbest boombox\n\nSoundcore Boom 3i by Anker\n\nBuy Now on amazon\n\nThis Bluetooth speaker from Anker is about the size of a tumbler, which combined with a neck strap, makes storing and transporting it a breeze.

In this case, we’re referring to waterproof electronics. Picture it: You’re engrossed in studying and completely forgot about that glass of water you kept within arm’s reach on your desk. Without even realizing it, you’ve just spilled your drink all over your speaker.\n\nIf you had the Altec Lansing HydraJolt, however, this wouldn’t be a huge issue because it’s rated IP67 waterpoof (in addition to being shockpoof and dustproof).

Additionally, dorm life isn’t forever, so we chose lightweight speakers (the heaviest on our list is just shy of two pounds) and prioritized picks with attached clips or straps so they’re not a headache to transport.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nRegina Spektor Confronts Pro-Palestine Protesters at Concert: ‘You’re Just Yelling at a Jew’\n\nTrump Used Your Tax Dollars to Open His New Scottish Golf Course\n\n‘Fort Bragg Has a Lot of Secrets. It’s Its Own Little Cartel’\n\nTexas Republican Admits Affair, Denies Other Disturbing Allegations\n\nBattery Life: Outlets can be few and far between depending on your individual dorm’s floor plan; you don’t want a speaker that is always plugged in. We looked for wireless speaker with a suitable amount of battery life (minimum 10 hours, but 12-16 hours were the sweet spot for these portable picks) so you’re not bogged down by charge time.\n\nSound Quality: It all comes back to how it sounds, and there’s nothing worse than terrible audio quality. You want a clear, crisp sound that doesn’t need the volume cranked up to the maximum level to immerse you in your favorite songs. A speaker with around 15 watts of power is perfectly adequate for your dorm room.\n\nBest Roku Deals: Save Up to 37% Off on Streaming Devices Ahead of Back-to-School Season\n\nDEALS OF THE DAY\n\nJonathan Zavaleta and Sage Anderson\n\nCreed Are Selling Out Arenas This Summer.

Maxwell, Markus added, would testify to the committee in a public setting if she were to be granted clemency.\n\nMaxwell is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Trump has said he was not considering a presidential pardon for Maxwell. Questions over Trump’s past relationship with Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors, and his administration’s handling of records related to the case have dogged the president for weeks, including during a weekend visit to Scotland.\n\nTrump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump has said that he cut off ties with Epstein years before Epstein’s death. Democrats in Congress and some of Trump’s core supporters have demanded the release of documents involving Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nEpstein served a 13-month jail sentence after pleading guilty in 2008 to a Florida state felony prostitution charge.\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday sought more information about the matter.\n\nDick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse wrote to the Justice Department, asking for a copy of the transcript of a recent conversation a department official had with Maxwell.\n\nIn addition, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on the FBI to conduct a “counterintelligence threat assessment” to determine the risk to U.S. national security if a foreign entity were to gain access to the Epstein files.\n\n“Could our adversaries use that information to blackmail someone like the president or other senior leaders in government?” Schumer asked.","summary":"Maxwell is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-house-panel-rejects-immunity-request-by-epstein-associate-maxwell/article69871169.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/bzf7yv/article69871181.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-07-25T090143Z_708427108_RC2KTFAQNUYI_RTRMADP_3_USA-COURT-EPSTEIN-MAXWELL.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-30 00:20:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":346431742,"title":"Harvard to comply with Trump administration demand to turn over employment forms","text":"Harvard University said on Tuesday it will comply with the demands of President Donald Trump's administration to turn over employment forms for thousands of university staff, but for the time being was not sharing records for those employed in roles only available to students.\n\nIn an email to university employees sent on Tuesday, Harvard said that earlier this month it received a notice of inspection and a related subpoena from the Department of Homeland Security, seeking to inspect the I-9, or Employment Eligibility Verification, forms and supporting documentation for university employees.\n\nThe I-9 forms, from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, are used to verify the identity and employment authorisation of individuals hired for work in the U.S., according to the agency's website.\n\nHarvard said federal regulations entitle the government to access a U.S. employer's paperwork, including information on employment eligibility.\n\nHarvard has been embroiled in a legal fight with the Trump administration to have its billions of dollars of frozen federal funds restored.

Many Senate Republicans suggested Tuesday that the conference may pursue changes to Senate rules to allow the upper chamber to quickly confirm Trump’s picks rather than let Democrats’ roadblocks continue to delay the confirmation process. (RELATED: ‘Dangerous Game’: Senate GOP Warns Of Retribution If Dems Do Not Relent Blockade Of Trump’s Nominees)\n\n“Everything is under consideration,” Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This has been an unprecedented, historic blockade by the Democrats. Presidents deserve to get their team in place as does President Trump.”\n\n“If the Democrats don’t change their behavior, we’re going to need to change the way things are done,” Barrasso added.\n\nHis vow for action comes as many Republicans have said they are done putting up with Democrats’ delay tactics. The Democratic caucus has thus far refused to confirm any of Trump’s picks by unanimous consent or voice vote despite Republicans allowing hundreds of Biden nominees to have expedited confirmations.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden had 44 nominees confirmed via voice vote by July 29 of his presidency. Senate Republicans ultimately signed off on allowing 57% of his nominees to be confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent during his presidency, according to the Senate GOP-aligned Senate Republican Communications Center (SRCC). \n\nAdditionally, Democrats have agreed to allow just one of the president’s nominees, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to skip a procedural vote. The caucus, however, still forced Rubio to be subject to a final confirmation vote despite no senators voting against his nomination. \n\nThe other 109 nominees that have been confirmed thus far were subject to multiple roll call votes, requiring Senate Majority Leader John Thune to burn through hours of floor time. Democrats’ stalling tactics have created considerable delays with some nominees that were appointed in January still waiting for floor consideration to be approved for their role.\n\n“What we’re seeing is so much obstruction, historic obstruction, that I think we’ve got to find a better way to get these [nominees] done,” Republican West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a member of Republican leadership, told the DCNF. “We can’t keep going on like this. It’s not fair to the president.”\n\nThe conference is considering various methods to expedite the confirmation process for some Senate-confirmed positions. Some of the rules changes could be approved by a simple majority vote.\n\nRepublican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said that he would be on board with revising the Senate’s rules to dramatically expedite the confirmation process.\n\n“One change would be to eliminate cloture motion on nominees and eliminate a motion to proceed and just have one vote and leave committee and have one vote,” Paul told the DCNF. \n\n“And I think, really, the caucus is inclined to do something like that,” Paul continued. “The push is going to come to shove if there is no negotiation and no settlement before that — I believe that the rules will change.”\n\nRepublican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson told the DCNF that he would like to change the number of positions in the executive branch that require Senate confirmations, proposing to slash the thousands of Senate-confirmed positions by at least a few 100 people. \n\nSenate Republicans have also discussed altering the upper chamber’s debate rules to quicken the process for each nominee under consideration on the floor.\n\n“We need to find ways like we’ve reformed in the past to get to simple 51 votes for the Supreme Court, to get to 51 votes for two hour cloture [votes] for some lesser important positions,” Daines told the DCNF. “But I think for some of the other nominations we should continue to reform the rules of the Senate that allows the Senate to move faster.”\n\nSenate Republicans’ enthusiasm for revising the upper chamber’s rules comes as many members of the conference have also said they are willing to stay in session during the planned August break to continue plowing through confirmation votes. \n\n“[I] hope that my Democratic friends come to their senses and cooperate, which is unlikely,” Kennedy told the DCNF, stating that he’s prepared to stay in session during August if necessary. \n\nAs Senate Republicans debated the best path forward to circumvent Democrats’ stalling tactics, the upper chamber continued to confirm multiple nominees Tuesday.\n\n“We’ve had to kind of grind through, and that’s what we’re going to keep doing,” Thune said at the Senate GOP leadership press conference Thursday. “It is the far left of their caucus that is preventing even good government people, people who are bipartisan, from getting confirmed. So that’s got to change, and if it doesn’t, we’re going to be here a while.”\n\nAndi Shae Napier and Caden Olson contributed to this report. \n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Some institutional managers are going a step further, shorting shares of unprofitable US tech companies that have seen sharp upswings.\n\nBefore talking about froth, one must ask if we are witnessing a structural change in the market. After all, if a different cohort is dominating trading, lofty valuations by historical standards can no longer predict future pullbacks.\n\nScott Rubner, Citadel Securities’ head of equity and equity derivatives strategy, has observed that mom-and-pop investors are market leaders this summer. That spurred him to make an audacious call two weeks ago: He expects a solid run in the S&P 500 all the way into the Labor Day holiday in early September. His prediction has panned out — so far.\n\nRetail accounts for 20% of total trading volume in the US, just shy of the 24% peak reached in early 2021 when meme stocks such as GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. entered the world stage. “Ever since April, retail investors have been resilient and fully participating in this rally,” Rubner wrote in a note.\n\nIn addition, individual investors seem to follow a strong seasonal trend, trading briskly in June and July before dropping off by September when school reopens. Fund managers, on the other hand, often step away for summer holidays.\n\nInsights like these from Citadel Securities are invaluable because the market maker handles more than a third of all US retail stock trades. In fact, the brokerage came into prominence in the era of meme stocks.\n\nOther Wall Street analysts are starting to recognize day traders’ lasting impact, too. In a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. observed that historically, sharp increases in speculative trading signaled abnormally high returns within a one-year horizon. In other words, don’t stand in front of a speeding liquidity train.\n\nWith retail participation twice as high as pre-pandemic levels, it would be presumptuous to brush them aside as dumb money that will just go away. On the contrary, many day traders are savvy and some of their behaviors reflect the same kind of worries that plague institutional money managers.\n\nFor instance, the resurgence of meme stocks could be a manifestation of the barbell strategy retail traders have been deploying — pouring billions into low-cost index funds on one end, while flocking to the stock market’s discount rack for, in their view, some good deals, such as Opendoor Technologies Inc. and Kohl’s Corp. After all, this rally needs to broaden from a handful of Big Tech bets: If you invest $1 into the S&P 500, 33 cents would go to the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nOr is the one-way rally a bit too calm, despite President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff negotiations? Retail investors have been piling into volatility-based products lately, such as 2x Long VIX Futures ETF, as a way to hedge their portfolios and protect against sudden market meltdowns.\n\nThere’s a change of guard at the top of the market this summer. With retail investors taking the lead, professionals must be pondering if they should chase the rally, or risk explaining why their portfolios are underperforming. Social media “finfluencers,” a new breed of financial advisors, might have some thoughts.\n\nCourtesy Bloomberg/Shuli Ren","summary":"With global stocks hitting record highs and meme trades making a comeback, investors are naturally asking if it’s time to take profit.

Now it may lose its only hospital.\n\nThis deeply conservative corner of rural America is getting a front-row education in what it means when Republicans say they want to “run government like a business.”\n\nBusinesses exist to make money. And they don’t waste their time in poverty-stricken Pemiscot County, home to less than 16,000 residents who have a median household income that barely clears $40,000. It’s Missouri’s poorest county. Why would any profit-driven, efficiency-minded system waste a dime here? \n\nThe Guardian paints a grim picture: “Three stories of brown brick just off Interstate 55 in the town of Hayti, the 115-bed hospital has kept its doors open even after the county’s only Walmart closed, the ranks of boarded-up gas stations along the freeway exit grew, and the population of the surrounding towns dwindled, thanks in no small part to the destruction done by tornadoes.” \n\nThis is one of those rural counties I’ve written about: dependent on the federal government they hate. \n\nNow, thanks to President Donald Trump and his Medicaid-gutting budget law, Pemiscot Memorial Hospital is hanging by a thread. \n\n“If Medicaid drops, are we going to be even collecting what we’re collecting now?” Jonna Green, the chair of the hospital’s board, asked The Guardian. With roughly 80% of the hospital’s revenue coming from Medicaid and Medicare, any cuts to a hospital already on the edge of insolvency is a death sentence. “We need some hope,” she added. \n\nShe doesn’t need hope. She and her neighbors need to stop voting for Republicans.\n\nTrump won 74% of the vote in the county last year. Jason Smith, their Republican congressman, did even better, winning with 76% of the vote. And Smith was thrilled to support the law that could shutter this hospital, saying in a statement, “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill is nothing short of the greatest piece of working-class tax relief in a generation. President Trump didn’t just sign a bill into law—he unleashed America’s Golden Age.” \n\nSure. If “Golden Age” means no hospital.\n\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley won 73% of the county. He had warned that Trump’s tax bill would devastate rural hospitals—and then he voted for it anyway.\n\nHowever, just days after that vote, he tried to reverse course, introducing a bill to “protect” the same rural-hospital funding he had just voted to gut.\n\n“I’m completely opposed to cutting rural hospitals period,” Hawley told NBC News. “I haven’t changed my view on that one iota.”\n\nExcept … he already had.\n\nLast week at an Axios forum, Hawley doubled down, warning against “experiment[ing]” with the “vitally important” federal funding that keeps rural hospitals afloat.\n\nBut when it mattered—when it came time to vote on a major bill—he chose instead to cut rich people’s taxes. He had a choice between Missouri hospitals and billionaire handouts, and he picked the billionaires.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: that “vitally important” funding he says he wants to protect? It doesn’t even come from Missouri. Missouri is a moocher state, propped up by federal dollars primarily from blue states like California, Illinois, and New York. Hawley’s constituents hate the federal government, but they sure love its money.\n\nAs for Pemiscot County, they wanted a smaller government to cut waste, fraud, and abuse. In fact, many voices quoted in that Guardian story insisted what Republicans did was okay because they knew that one guy. Not even kidding—check out this passage:\n\n“We got a guy around here, I guess he’s still around. He’s legally blind but he goes deer hunting every year,” Baughn Merideth, a county commissioner, told The Guardian. “There’s just so much fraud … it sounds like we’re right in the middle of it.”\n\nSo this one “guy” in Pemiscot County—if he’s “still around”—is so full of fraud that it’s acceptable for the county to lose its only hospital. (Also, “legally blind” doesn’t mean can’t-see-anything blind. In fact, Iowa’s Department for the Blind says that only about 18% of legally blind people are totally blind.)\n\nTrump supporters will bend themselves into knots to avoid blaming those enabling the crises they face.\n\nWhatever fraud may exist in Pemiscot County, it pales in comparison to the waste of maintaining a critical medical facility in a county where the population has plunged from nearly 47,000 in the 1940s to under 16,000 today. When the hospital closes, more people will leave. The area’s death spiral will accelerate.\n\n“This is our home, born and raised, and you would never want to leave it. But I have a nine-year-old with cardiac problems. I would not feel safe living here without a hospital that I could take her to know if something happened,” Brittany Osborne, Pemiscot Memorial’s interim CEO, told The Guardian. \n\nMeanwhile, Green—the hospital board chair worried about cuts—follows a Facebook group that recently posted a meme of Trump with the caption “Isn’t it great having a real president again?”\n\nShe says she needs “some hope”?\n\nHard to think of a worse place to go looking for it.","summary":"Pemiscot County, Missouri, lost its Walmart.

The presence of US officials in Kuala Lumpur during the mediation was seen more as observers, a gratuitous act that no one appreciates.It would probably be seen as meddlesome by the Thais and the Cambodians. So, get out and stay out.Anonymous_3f4b: Actually, it was Trump who forced both sides to the negotiating table, as he threatened to halt tariff negotiations with the two countries if they did not agree to a ceasefire.Malaysia merely played host and facilitator due to logistical convenience and being the chair of Asean for this year.Thailand and Cambodia had no choice but to agree to peace to continue their tariff engagements with the US, which Trump happily said would continue after congratulating them for the ceasefire settlement.Trump further declared that he was the “president of peace” for forging peace between Thailand and Cambodia. But there was no mention of Anwar by Trump.Pink: So what was Anwar’s role in this when he was at the mediation process? Why is Trump claiming credit?This mediation process was supposed to project Anwar as a world leader, but Trump is stealing the limelight.MalaysiaLiberty: If we take a step back and look at the bigger picture, we might see that Trump deserves the most credit for helping to bring about the ceasefire.Anwar did play a visible but lesser role in hosting the talks.It is not as if the two warring countries’ decision to stop fighting was due to Anwar’s counsel, but rather because they want to be in Trump’s good books to receive favourable deals on trade, the economy, and so on from the still-powerful US.Koel: The US administration sounds desperate to claim credit for playing “mediator”.Makes you wonder. Did someone start this skirmish for this purpose?Are they poring through the world map every day to find any skirmish to be packaged as “war” so they can muscle in for some pretend action?After all, the current White House resident is said to be desperate for a Nobel Prize.So what better way than to wait for an opportunity for a border skirmish between comparatively tiny, faraway nations?And then, this wannabe is all over the media, yapping away from Scotland about peace.What a pathetic and incredible source of international mirth.MarioT: While we are happy to note Anwar’s successful mediation in the dispute, our home front needs tidying up too.The crutches and extra assistance given to the major race must be reviewed for a more equitable distribution of wealth to all races.This racist policy has resulted in unimaginable looting of our money by those entrusted to safeguard our interests.Your reformation policies must include fairness to all.The checks and balances must not tilt too far to one side at the expense of the other.All citizens of this country deserve fair treatment.WhiteLlama4337: Wah Anwar - successfully mediating peace talks between Thailand and Cambodia.Anwar - could you also mediate the dispute between farmers and Perak state authorities, especially in your own constituency of Tambun?You know, the eviction of farmers from land they have farmed for decades, by claiming that it was actually state land all the while.The farmers there are growing food that Malaysians need. How come this issue doesn’t get your attention, huh?TaaS: Nice circus. Anwar is there to take photos, make himself look good and take credit.Typical of this chameleon. What did he really do to stop the skirmish? Malaysia knows all too well that Anwar can’t even solve simple issues in his own backyard.Sherlock: Good job, Anwar, proud of you. You have put Malaysia in a very favourable position on the world stage.Now, Trump will revise the tariff lower, making it easier for Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz to negotiate.

Booker’s objection came after he said the Office of Justice Programs, which administers grants through the Justice Department, was withholding funds for programs in so-called “sanctuary cities”, like Booker’s hometown of Newark.\n\nBooker clashed with Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Amy Klobuchar over an amendment that would have prevented the DOJ from blocking those funds. It also would have likely endangered the unanimous consent process, which senators were relying upon to pass the bill, given that it would likely trigger GOP opposition.\n\nThen, in comments to reporters, he slammed his fellow Democrats as “complicit” in the Trump administration’s attempts to bully blue states and districts into line.\n\n“Literally, they were about to be complicit in the very things they say out of the other side of their mouth that they object to. Democrats need to learn to fight and fight him and stop him from hurting people,” he said.\n\nHe added to The Independent: “Today, I saw people being complicit with something that is truly undermining the Constitution, the separation of powers and the kind of things that we should be standing up [against].”\n\nBooker didn’t explain why he didn’t object to the bills’ final passage when his amendment failed.\n\nCortez Masto, meanwhile, maintained her anti-Trump bona fides in a separate conversation with The Independent after the vote, pointing to her work at the DSCC to flip the Senate into Democratic hands in 2020, when her party secured a narrow 50-50 majority, with ties broken by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Nevada Democrat said that she was “proven” in “the fight against Donald Trump.”\n\nAnd she added: “ I chaired the DSCC. We flipped the Senate [to] control of the Democrats and pushed back on Donald Trump.\n\n“I am not opposed to taking on the challenges of Donald Trump and bad policies. I do it all the time. The question is, why aren't most Democrats supporting law enforcement?” the senator asked.\n\nKlobuchar, in her floor speech, took aim at her New Jersey colleague for not bringing up his concerns in committee. But Booker contended to reporters later that the threats were only leveled after the legislation advanced, making Klobuchar’s criticism a moot point.\n\nBooker gained notoriety on the left with a marathon floor speech earlier this year denouncing the Trump administration’s second-term agenda, a speech that broke Senate records. At the same time, he, like other Democrats in the chamber, has faced derision from some in their party for the persisting air of bipartisanship that still permeates part of the chamber, particularly involving the nominations of former senator Marco Rubio to be Trump’s Secretary of State.\n\nHis notion that the party is sick and tired of leadership and the strategy of appeasement some Senate Democrats like Chuck Schumer have exhibited when dealing with the new Republican majority is accurate, however.\n\nA national NBC News poll in March found that just 7 percent of Democrats have a very favorable view of their party, with just a quarter having positive views overall. A second poll in May from The Center Square, conducted by Noble Predictive Insights, found that three-quarters of Democrats want the party to push back against the president “more often”.","summary":"Corey Booker lectured Democrats over backing legislation that White House and DOJ say will be another cudgel against ‘sanctuary cities’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/booker-cortez-masto-senate-democrats-trump-b2798479.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/29/23/02/GettyImages-2215125774.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xKCQjCDS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-29 23:59:43","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.415},{"id":346432016,"title":"Kai Trump teases the president in video promoting Accelerator energy drink: ‘Sorry grandpa’","text":"First granddaughter and golf sensation Kai Trump teased her grandfather over his preferred caffeinated beverage in a video promoting her NIL deal with Accelerator Active Energy.\n\nIn the ad, the 18-year-old rising high school senior and University of Miami golf commit slaps a wicked drive off a tee and then makes her way to the cart where a crispy looking can of Diet Coke — President Trump’s go-to drink — and a can of the energy drink sit.\n\n“Sorry grandpa,” Kai Trump said while choosing to sip from the Accelerator Active Energy drink.\n\nKai Trump announced her NIL deal with Accelerator earlier this month. \n\nThe energy drink brand also has sponsorship deals with college gymnast and social media influencer Livvy Dune and Taylor Swift’s boyfriend and Superbowl winning Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\n“It’s pretty cool, especially being partners with such great athletes and being up there with them,” Kai Trump told Fox Business about the deal.\n\nThe daughter of first son Donald Trump Jr. became a breakout star of the Republican National Convention last summer where she delivered a well-prepared speech to throngs of adoring GOPers.\n\nCommenting on his daughter’s popularity after the speech, Donald Trump Jr. said to Fox News last year, “Get away, you little b-stards, and stay away.”\n\nEarlier this year, the teen opened up about life with a Secret Service detail.\n\n“It’s tough because you’re in high school and you want to have your privacy,” the golf phenom said in a video posted to her YouTube page.\n\n“But I feel on matter what I’ll probably never have the privacy as other kids my age so I kinda just have to deal with it,” she told her dad in the video.\n\nLast month, Secret Service agents arrested 23-year-old Anthony Thomas Reyes as he scaled the wall surrounding Mar-a-Lago — who told cops he was there because he wanted to marry Kai Trump.","summary":"Kai Trump, a rising high school senior and University of Miami golf commit, landed an NIL deal with energy drink company Accelerator Active Energy.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/29/sports/kai-trump-teases-the-president-in-video-promoting-accelerator-energy-drink/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/108943832.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dnE7zdb4-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-29 23:51:52","author":"Shane Galvin","authors":["Shane Galvin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.19},{"id":346424672,"title":"5 Revelations From the Newly Declassified Russia Records","text":"The Trump administration released three batches of records in July that shed new light on the decade-long controversy over Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe three lots of records concern the creation, at the behest of President Barack Obama, of an intelligence community assessment (ICA) that featured an allegation that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the presidential election in order to help then-candidate Donald Trump.","summary":"The U.S. intelligence community relied on a single ‘scant, unclear, unverifiable’ report to allege that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/5-revelations-from-the-newly-declassified-russia-records-5893474","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/07/29/id5894020-outside-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 23:51:16","author":"Ivan Pentchoukov","authors":["Ivan Pentchoukov"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":346428984,"title":"US accuses Venezuelan regime of narco-terrorism over alliances with Tren de Aragua, Sinaloa Cartel","text":"The U.S. government has named the Cartel de los Soles, a Venezuela-based criminal group led by President Nicolás Maduro, a global terrorist organization.

In addition, Brussels pledged to invest $600 billion into the US economy and purchase $750 billion worth of American energy over three years. No reciprocal tariffs were imposed on US goods.\n\nGorka, who serves as senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, said the agreement marks a geopolitical victory for Washington.\n\n“Even for somebody like me who has known the president for a decade now, it is hard to believe that the whole European Union bent at the knee of America First and said: ‘...You got us, President Trump, and we are going to surrender to a 15% tariff,’” Gorka told Newsmax on Monday.\n\n“I’ll just be very blunt with you… if you don’t understand that President Trump is engineering tectonic shifts in geopolitics that are of a global effect, that will change the world for the next 50 to 100 years, you are just an imbecile,” he added.\n\nThe agreement has been widely criticized across Europe.

Frank J. Mrvan, a Democrat who represents Northwest Indiana.\n\n“In your forecasting and with the uncertainty, what is your worst-case scenario,” Mrvan asked Mitchell, the chief executive of HealthLinc, a Valparaiso-based not-for-profit medical provider serving a five-county area in Northwest Indiana.\n\n“Close,” Mitchell responded. “I think that’s everyone’s worst-case scenario. Many of us are above 50 percent funded by Medicaid, and there is no other way to recoup those dollars.”\n\nMrvan met Tuesday with representatives of eight healthcare providers to get a feel for how they would be affected by the enactment this month of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes deep cuts to Medicaid funding. The roundtable discussion was held at Porter Starke Services, a mental health provider in Valparaiso.\n\nMitchell emphasized that her organization was stable, but it was difficult to weigh the full impact the cuts would have on patients and providers.\n\n“We’re good right now, but with the amount of uncertainty that’s out there, there’s nothing off the table,” Mitchell said. “If we end up taking a hit to 50 percent or more of our Medicaid, our operations as they exist today and the amount of people we serve, it’s absolutely not going to be a sustainable model in any way.”\n\nMitchell isn’t alone.\n\nDr. Janet Seabrook is the founder and chief executive of Community Health Net, which primarily serves Gary, Hammond and East Chicago. About 80 percent of the organization’s clients receive Medicaid.\n\n“Not only just Community Health Net but every single provider will be dramatically impacted when these cuts are to take effect,” Seabrook said. “When you’re looking at a Medicaid population that’s greater than 50 percent, anything that impacts Medicaid is going to impact those health centers.”\n\nSeabrook agrees with Mitchell that closing would be a worst-case scenario.\n\n“We don’t want that to happen, and I’m sure most of the health centers that were represented here today would look at other service lines, maybe staff reductions,” Seabrook said. “But eventually, if things don’t clear up, closing would be a consideration.”\n\nMrvan doesn’t want to see health facilities close their doors, but as one of only two Democrats in Indiana’s nine-member congressional delegation, he wasn’t able to stop passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill.\n\nHe estimates that about 211,000 people in his district receive Medicaid coverage. According to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, about 1.9 million Hoosiers are on Medicaid as of this month.\n\n“The message that I heard today is that the cuts are going to be devastating and life threatening,” Mrvan said. “To cut health care access in order to pay for tax cuts to the most wealthy in our country and the corporations that don’t need them is something that is going to devastate our economy, and it also is going to make sure that our most vulnerable populations aren’t getting the access to health care, mental health and other services that are provided.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/07/29/medicaid-northwest-indiana-mrvan-health","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5793fc/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1486x1115!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3e%2Fe5%2F8c59440d4a5394f8f0e5b35377a7%2Fimg-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29

He is running for the Republican nomination to face incumbent U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. \n\n The Georgia Republican co-owns a family trucking firm and first ran for Congress in 2014.

Jeans have gone from workwear to high fashion over the last 150-plus years. Dress them up, dress them down . . . they’re as flexible as American culture.\n\nPerhaps they are so enduring because everyone can wear them. Fat or skinny, tall or short, curvy to curve-less and everything in between — jeans are the fashion of unity.\n\nBut when we’re buying a pair, we’re not contemplating any of that.\n\nWe want to think about what we could look like wearing them, or who might be attracted to us while we’re wearing them.\n\nI am speaking, of course, about the power of advertising, and last week the latest ad for American Eagle jeans caused extreme distress among the Very Online crowd.\n\nIt’s a pretty basic ad: Current Hollywood “It Girl” Sydney Sweeney poses provocatively next to a classic Mustang, wearing classic jeans and a classic white shirt.\n\nShe sexily fiddles with the engine, sexily closes the hood, then drives away in her sexy car while wearing her sexy jeans.\n\nThe narrator tells us, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes.” (Genes/jeans, get it?)\n\nThe outrage seems two-fold.\n\nFirst, the usual suspects are screaming accusations of racism at the idea of a white, blond, blue-eyed starlet declaring the superiority of her genes. \n\nShades of eugenics, according to the congregants of the Church of the Perpetually Offended.\n\nTo a lesser extent, but still very obvious to those of us who have been observing the culture wars of the last 30 years, the left seems upset at the very notion of an attractive young woman being used to sell clothing.\n\nAmerican Eagle’s deliberate bucking of the “body positive” trend thrust upon us by the human resources cult utterly infuriates certain unstable members of our eclectic society.\n\nSome people blame all their failures in life on the fact that someone else was smarter, cuter or richer. It’s envy, of course, and it undergirds every ridiculous complaint about the new American Eagle campaign.\n\nBut I believe the overheated uproar over Sweeney’s ad is about more than just racism or envy.\n\nIt’s about Donald Trump — or more precisely, about the sharp right turn the American people took last November.\n\nWe are witnessing the desperate tantrums of a progressive left that is struggling to accept the verdict of the electorate.\n\nWe have rejected their bizarre views on gender and sexuality.\n\nWe have rejected their open-border, America Last programs.\n\nWe have rejected their safe spaces and brutal fragility.\n\nWe have rejected their pronouns and their creepy obsession with our children.\n\nThe pandemic response so effectively choked off information that it gaslit Americans into believing our national sensibilities had dramatically shifted.\n\nThe extreme left was mainstreamed and validated, while the rest of us were confined to our homes and computer screens.\n\nBut after November, the leftists must face a sudden reality: They were never the majority at all.\n\nAnd they are not stronger than the American spirit.\n\nIt’s a tough pill to swallow for the crowd accustomed to shouting down teenage girls complaining about boys in their school bathrooms.\n\nTheir problem with Sweeney is the same problem now shared by the entire Democratic complex — they are angry they were wrong.\n\nThey are angry the American people made them wrong, and that means everything average Americans love is wrong.\n\nWe don’t want to buy our jeans from people who look like us; we want to buy our jeans from people who look like our fantasy of us.\n\nAmerican men like looking at hot, busty women, and American women like looking hot in the eyes of American men.\n\nThat is a perfectly typical attitude, and one that has been used with great success since the dawn of corporate advertising.\n\nOf course the left had to frame their rage in terms of racism and Nazis. After their Tesla terrorism tirade, they’ve practically made the swastika their official symbol.\n\nBut what really offends them is the normal desire of normal Americans for normal things.\n\nBlue jeans, beautiful women, fast cars. We keep it simple in this part of the world, and the progressive left does not like simple, as evidenced by their 89-and-counting genders.\n\nThe Sydney Sweeney ad campaign perfectly embodies how Trump’s Golden Age is permeating every aspect of American society.\n\nAnd it’s got the progressive left — bereft of ideas, strategies and interesting spokespersons — seething.\n\nLong live blue jeans and beauty.

During an appearance on “Kudlow,” Gingrich laid out a strategy for how Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambitions to rebuild the Soviet Empire could be thwarted.\n\n“My hunch is if you go to very strong secondary boycotts, you can cut off an amazing amount of resources and almost create a heart attack for the Russian economy. If at the same time they start having very sophisticated weapons landing inside Russia, beginning to take apart the Russian military complex. At some point, he’s going to have to look at the wall and realize he’s not going to win,” Gingrich said.\n\nGingrich said Putin must decide whether to accept a loss early or allow the situation to worsen, potentially leading to a significant loss of life and further destabilizing Russia.\n\n“And the question is, how big a loss does he want to take? And does he agree early? Or does he allow the Ukrainians to regain the advantage and allow, gradually, the Russian people to break up just because the number of casualties they’re going to take if we get serious is going to be terrifying?” Gingrich asked. (RELATED: After Last Week’s Big Win, Gingrich Shares What Trump Does Next)\n\nGingrich said Putin’s failure to account for the balance of power has left him vulnerable.\n\n“It’s truly a tragedy that Putin, who really should know better, has now put himself in this position and has not behaved in any way in terms of what the Soviets would have called a correlation of forces. In this fight, if we’re serious, he has no forces,” Gingrich said.\n\nTrump said Monday that he would shorten the deadline for Putin to reach a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to “10 or 12 days.” Trump said that failure to reach a deal would result in severe secondary tariffs and sanctions targeting key Russian industries.\n\nIn recent months, Trump has accused Putin of delaying peace talks to press on with his war efforts, which have escalated in recent days with ongoing missile and drone attacks from both sides. On July 11, Trump resumed arms shipments to Ukraine through NATO, aiming to push the Kremlin toward negotiations.\n\nDespite Trump’s warnings, Putin remains unfazed, claiming that Russia can withstand the West’s economic measures. While Russia insists that any peace agreement must include recognition of territory seized during the war, Ukraine firmly rejects the idea of conceding any land to the Kremlin.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump has attempted to tamp down questions about the case, expressing annoyance that people are still talking about it six years after Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial, even though some of his own allies have promoted conspiracy theories about it.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s imprisoned former girlfriend, was recently interviewed inside a Florida courthouse by the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, though officials have not publicly disclosed what she said. Her lawyers said Tuesday that she’s willing to answer more questions from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony.\n\nAboard Air Force One while returning from Scotland, Trump said he was upset that Epstein was “taking people who worked for me.” The women, he said, were “taken out of the spa, hired by him — in other words, gone.”\n\n“I said, listen, we don’t want you taking our people,” Trump said. When it happened again, Trump said he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAsked if Giuffre was one of the employees poached by Epstein, he demurred but then said “he stole her.”\n\nThe White House originally said Trump banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago because he was acting like a “creep.”\n\nGiuffre died by suicide earlier this year. She claimed that Maxwell spotted her working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, when she was a teenager, and hired her as Epstein’s masseuse, which led to sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough Giuffre’s allegations did not become part of criminal prosecutions against Epstein, she is central to conspiracy theories about the case. She accused Epstein of pressuring her into having sex with powerful men.\n\nMaxwell, who has denied Giuffre’s allegations, is serving a 20-year-prison sentence in a Florida federal prison for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nA spokeswoman for the House Oversight Committee, which requested the interview with Maxwell, said the panel would not consider granting the immunity she requested.\n\nThe potential interview is part of a frenzied, renewed interest in the Epstein saga following the Justice Department’s July statement that it would not be releasing any additional records from the investigation, an abrupt announcement that stunned online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump’s political base who had been hoping to find proof of a government coverup.\n\nSince then, the Trump administration has sought to present itself as promoting transparency, with the department urging courts to unseal grand jury transcripts from the sex-trafficking investigations. A judge in Florida last week rejected the request, though a similar request for the work of a different grand jury is pending in New York.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewing Maxwell over the course of two days at a Florida courthouse last week.\n\nIn a letter Tuesday, Maxwell’s attorneys said that though their initial instinct was for Maxwell to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, they are open to having her cooperate provided that lawmakers satisfy their request for immunity and other conditions.\n\nBut the Oversight Committee seemed to reject that offer outright.\n\n“The Oversight Committee will respond to Ms. Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony,” a spokesperson said.\n\nSeparately, Maxwell’s attorneys have urged the Supreme Court to review her conviction, saying she did not receive a fair trial. They also say that one way she would testify “openly and honestly, in public,” is in the event of a pardon by Trump, who has told reporters that such a move is within his rights but that he has not been not asked to make it.\n\n“She welcomes the opportunity to share the truth and to dispel the many misconceptions and misstatements that have plagued this case from the beginning,” they said.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump ultimately defeated her. \n\nGabbard explained how high-level DNC emails detailed how Clinton was allegedly suffering from \"intensified psycho-emotional problems, including uncontrolled fits of anger, aggression and cheerfulness,” which Russia was aware of. \n\nThe then-Secretary of State was allegedly \"on a daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers,\" Gabbard said about the report. The files claimed Clinton was placed on the drugs out of her deep fear of losing the election to Trump, as she was \"obsessed with a thirst for power.\"\n\nThe documents also alleged that there was evidence that Clinton suffered from dangerous health issues, including type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and deep vein thrombosis.\n\nThe report stated that \"then-President Barack Obama and other Democratic party leaders found the state of Clinton's health \"extraordinarily alarming\" and felt it could have a \"serious negative impact\" on the likelihood of her winning the election.'Possible Criminal Acts'Russian intelligence was aware of more than just Clinton's health problems. “The report goes into great detail about the information that Russia and Putin had on Hillary Clinton, which included possible criminal acts,\" Gabbard revealed. \n\nThose included \"secret meetings with multiple named U.S. religious organizations in which State Department officials offered, in exchange for supporting Secretary Clinton's campaign for the presidency, significant increases in financing from the State Department.\"\n\nClinton served as then-President Obama's Secretary of State in his first term, from 2009 to 2013.Infamous CollapseWhile the Russians were aware of Hillary Clinton's secret health ailments during her presidential run, Americans also were alerted to how she suffered a medical crisis after attending a 9/11 memorial service in New York in September 2016.\n\nA video of Clinton appearing unable to stand and on the verge of fainting as she waited for a van while departing the event went viral. Several aides grabbed her by her arms to keep her from falling over before quickly loading her into the vehicle. \n\nAt the time, the candidate's team initially blamed her near-collapse on heat and dehydration. They later claimed Clinton had been given a pneumonia diagnosis before attending the event and was \"recovering well with antibiotics and rest.\" \n\nThe former first lady later told Jimmy Fallon during an appearance on The Tonight Show: \"There's nothing like a little rest when your doctor tells you to and you don't do it.\"\n\n\"I'm used to just kind of getting up and powering through it, and that's what I thought I could do,\" Clinton continued. \"Turned out I couldn't, so I took a few days off, and actually I think it was good.\"Issues With BidenWhile Clinton's health was an issue during her presidential campaign, she was one of the first to raise the alarm about Joe Biden's viability before the 2024 presidential election, as the octogenarian was initially hoping to seek a second term.\n\nThe revelation came amid the House Oversight Committee's investigation into whether or not Biden administration officials covered up signs of cognitive decline.\n\nSources said Clinton and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan approached Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain, \"stating they believed Joe Biden was not politically viable,\" before the president dropped out of the race in July 2024 following his disastrous debate with Trump. \n\nSullivan allegedly told Klain the ex-president \"was less effective in 2024 compared to 2022.\"\n\nBiden eventually dropped out of the race and handed his candidacy over to Vice President Kamala Harris.

Speaking to journalists aboard Air Force One on his return from a five-day trip to Scotland , Trump was questioned about remarks he made over the weekend, implying that he had barred Epstein from his Palm Beach club for poaching staff. He confirmed to reporters that Epstein \"took people that work for me\" and continued to do so even after being warned not to recruit Mar-a-Lago employees by Trump himself. Trump said: \"He took people that work for me, and I told him, don't do it anymore. And he did it. I said, stay the hell out of here.\" Trump, describing Epstein as having \"stolen\" his spa workers, said: \"I told him, I said, listen, we don't want you taking our people, whether it was spa or not spa. I don't want him taking people. And he was fine. And then, not too long after that, he did it again. And I said, get out of here.\" When quizzed about whether one of the individuals was Giuffre, who tragically took her own life at 41 earlier this year, Trump responded: \"I think she worked at the spa. I think so. I think that was one of the people. \"I don't know. I think she worked at the spa. I think so. I think that was one of the people, yeah, he stole her. And by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know, none whatsoever.\" Giuffre alleged that Maxwell spotted her working at Mar-a-Lago's spa in 2000 when she was just a teenager and recruited her to be Epstein's masseuse, which led to sexual abuse. Despite her allegations not forming part of the criminal charges against Epstein, Giuffre remains a key figure in theories surrounding the case. She accused Epstein of coercing her into sexual encounters with influential men, but never directly implicated Trump in her accusations. Maxwell, who has refuted Giuffre's claims, is currently serving a 20-year sentence in a Florida federal prison for conspiring with Epstein to sexually exploit underage girls. The White House initially stated that Trump barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago due to his \"creepy\" behaviour. The Republican president has been met with a public outcry over his administration's reluctance to disclose further records about Epstein, despite pledges of transparency. This is an unusual instance of tension within Trump's otherwise tightly-knit political coalition. Trump has tried to quell questions about the case, expressing irritation that it remains a topic of discussion six years after Epstein took his own life while awaiting trial, even as some of his own allies have fuelled conspiracy theories surrounding it. Maxwell, Epstein's incarcerated ex-girlfriend, was recently questioned inside a Florida courthouse by the Justice Department's second-in-command, although officials have not publicly revealed her statements. Her legal team stated on Tuesday that she's prepared to respond to more inquiries from Congress if she is granted immunity from future prosecution for her testimony. A representative for the House Oversight Committee, which subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition, informed The Associated Press that the panel would not contemplate granting the immunity she requested.

Kevin Mullin, D-San Mateo, last month introduced the Groundwater Rise and Infrastructure Preparedness Act of 2025, a bipartisan bill co-authored with Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., that seeks $5 million in initial funding to assess the risks rising groundwater poses to public health and critical infrastructure like roads, utilities, and sewer systems. The measure would also support the development of long-term mitigation strategies.\n\nMullin held a press conference Tuesday morning in South San Francisco to discuss his new legislation and the region’s flood and groundwater rise threats with local environmental and government leaders.\n\n“As we continue to witness the devastating and deadly impacts of flooding across America, we need to help communities understand their risks so they can better prepare,” Mullin said. “Too many lives, homes, businesses, and vital infrastructure have been upended by extreme flooding. Rising groundwater is a hidden threat that can remain unseen until it’s too late.”\n\nThe effort comes as the Bay Area has experienced more frequent atmospheric river storms and inches closer to sea level rise projections that experts warn will increasingly bring groundwater to the surface in low-lying areas. Mullin said his bill would fill a critical gap in understanding where groundwater rise will cause the most damage — and how to prepare for it.\n\nData is limited, but studies show the risks are significant. According to the bill, groundwater rise can mobilize toxic chemicals buried underground, increase the chance of chronic flooding, weaken the foundations of roads and buildings, and spread contamination to creeks and drinking water systems.\n\n“Flooding won’t just damage communities in familiar ways,” Mullin said. “It will carry toxic contamination to places we never expected to find it.”\n\nOne of the most vulnerable regions is the Bay Area, home to thousands of contaminated sites, including former industrial zones and military bases. Among them is Bayview-Hunters Point, a former naval shipyard in San Francisco with a long history of environmental cleanup.\n\nA 2024 report by the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR) found that East Palo Alto, a historically disadvantaged and majority-minority community, is also at high risk of groundwater-related contamination due to its proximity to toxic sites and low elevation.\n\n“In the Bay Area, there are over 5,000 toxic sites at risk of sea level and groundwater rise,” said Sarah Atkinson, SPUR’s senior policy manager for hazard resilience. “Rising water can cause contaminant mobilization into sewer systems and creeks. Community leaders are concerned about the resulting public health impacts and are demanding action — and this isn’t just a Bay Area problem.”\n\nMullin’s bill focuses on data gathering and planning for now, but he said it could lead to more substantial mitigation programs in the future.\n\n“When I ran for Congress, I made it clear that I wanted to work in a bipartisan way,” Mullin said. “By focusing on the economic impacts, community impacts, infrastructure, and public health, I think we all know — everybody here knows — that climate change is real.”\n\nLocal flood resilience leaders say this kind of data is critical for smarter planning. Len Materman, CEO of One Shoreline, San Mateo County’s flood and sea level rise district, said cities and counties should be factoring in groundwater conditions when approving public and private construction projects.\n\n“Local jurisdictions should require an analysis of the soil conditions that accounts for groundwater so that when projects are designed and then ultimately approved, they’re doing it thinking about future conditions — 20 or 30 years from now — with higher groundwater,” Materman said.\n\nOne Shoreline is urging local governments to require this type of soil analysis and long-term risk mapping before approving new housing or infrastructure projects.\n\n“This study is especially crucial,” Materman said. “It’s a foundational piece of the planning we need to do to keep people safe.”\n\nThe urgency has grown following a series of deadly floods in the United States. Earlier this month, extreme flooding in central Texas killed at least 136 people and caused widespread devastation. While the Bay Area doesn’t typically experience floods on that scale, Mullin warned the region isn’t immune.\n\n“We’ve had very major rain events in the last four years, especially in San Mateo, where there have been deaths,” Materman said. “And it’s not to the scale of Texas, for sure, the loss of life. But certainly, the atmospheric rivers — the major storms that come through a few times a year or more — that’s having major impacts.”\n\nStill, Mullin faces an uphill climb in getting the bill passed. Funding for climate resilience programs has faced repeated cuts in Congress. Under President Donald Trump, FEMA and NOAA budgets have been slashed as part of a broader push to reduce federal spending.\n\nIn May, another Peninsula lawmaker, Rep. Sam Liccardo, announced that $50 million in federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities funds had been cut, impacting coastal erosion mitigation efforts in Pacifica.\n\nMullin said the current climate in Congress makes it difficult to secure funding — but waiting isn’t an option.\n\n“We may have a more friendly Congress in a couple of years, but we’re not waiting,” Mullin said. “We’re going to keep going on this because we can’t afford to wait.”\n\nHe emphasized that the risk groundwater rise poses affects the entire country.\n\n“Rising groundwater doesn’t care if a state is red or blue,” Mullin said. “We are going to really focus on making communities more resilient.”","summary":"Groundwater rise can mobilize toxic chemicals buried underground and increase the chance of chronic flooding.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/29/bay-area-groundwater-risk-mullin-flood-study-bill/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SJM-L-BAYFLOODS-0725-3.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 23:14:29","author":"Ryan Macasero","authors":["Ryan Macasero"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.203},{"id":346433944,"title":"Dropkick Murphys show video of “loser” Trump, Jeffrey Epstein at Warped Tour","text":"Dropkick Murphys have made no secret of their dislike of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Celtic punk band has generated headlines in recent months for pulling out of a festival over the organizer’s ties to Republican politics and hectoring fans for their Trumpian merch.

The proposal would also revoke the standards the agency has set for greenhouse gas emissions from all motor vehicles. The so-called endangerment finding is a formal determination affirming that planet-warming greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane pose a threat to human health and the environment. It forms the legal and scientific basis for regulating these emissions under the Clean Air Act and is derived from decades of expert research and analysis. If it is reversed, many standards that rely on it could crumble — leaving the auto industry and other polluting sectors free to emit greenhouse gases without limits. But experts and state regulators say it could also represent a golden opportunity for California to set a national example, as the move may open the door for stronger regulations at the state level. \"Here in California, we recognize the science, we recognize the need for urgency, and we plan to continue doing the important work that will protect the public,\" Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told The Times. The plan marks the latest in a string of actions by the Trump administration to reverse years of climate-change policy — including the EPA's proposed repeal of power plant emissions standards in June, and its recent affront on California's ability to set strict tailpipe emission standards. A 2007 Supreme Court case, Massachusetts vs. EPA, affirmed that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and that the EPA has the authority to regulate them. The finding became the legal foundation for regulating carbon emissions from vehicles, power plants and other polluting sectors and led to the formation of the endangerment finding two years later. A chorus of advocates and experts on Tuesday condemned the administration's plans to reverse this finding as dangerous and shortsighted. Independent researchers around the world have long concluded that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by the burning of fossil fuels are dangerously warming the planet and contributing to worsening wildfires, extreme heat, floods and other natural disasters. The effect on California is unclear at this point. Some experts said the EPA's proposal could make it harder for California to achieve its climate goals — particularly because the effects of greenhouse gas emissions do not respect state or national borders. \"What these actions are going to mean is that there are more emissions, which causes more extreme weather, which ultimately harms the residents of California as well as the residents of the United States writ large,\" said Kathy Harris, director of the clean vehicles program at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. By in effect creating the weakest possible standard, Harris said, the EPA is attempting to undermine California and other states’ authority to set stronger rules and \"taking away the levers that states might have to be able to protect their citizens and their residents.\" “The Environmental Protection Agency has one job, which is to protect the environment, and they’re giving up on that responsibility,” she said. However, other experts said California is uniquely positioned to weather the storm. The state has notoriously struggled with smog and air pollution and has been a leader in adopting aggressive environmental regulations far exceeding national standards. In fact, much of the state's ambitious work around clean air and climate predates the development of the endangerment finding and even the Clean Air Act. For example, California implemented the nation's first tailpipe emissions standards in the 1960s and became the first state to pass a law requiring greenhouse gas emissions reductions from vehicles in 2002. Randolph, of the air resources board, noted that California also led the nation with 2002's Renewables Portfolio Standard requiring utilities in the state to source increasing percentages of electricity from renewable energy sources, and 2006's Assembly Bill 32, which mandated the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 — a goal the state met four years of ahead of schedule. Senate Bill 100, enacted in 2018, further pioneered the clean energy space by mandating that all retail electricity sales in the state be powered by carbon-free resources by 2045, she said. These items fall under state authority and would not be affected by a repeal of the endangerment finding, Randolph said. Legal experts anticipated that if Donald Trump were reelected, he would drastically roll back federal greenhouse-gas regulation. \"With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,\" read a statement from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. \"In our work so far, many stakeholders have told me that the Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year. \" Zeldin said the endangerment finding has been used to justify over $1 trillion in regulations that have throttled consumer choice. Ann Carlson, director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA, said that although some may see the EPA's move as another attempt to champion the fossil fuel industry, the decision could backfire. By ceding federal authority to regulate greenhouse gases, the Trump administration could unintentionally relinquish regulatory powers to California and other progressive states to carry out their own climate agenda, Carlson said. \"If the EPA is saying greenhouse gases aren't supposed to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, then that means they can be regulated under traditional state authority,\" Carlson said. \"So this could have a silver lining for California. It would undoubtedly be litigated, but it may give California a strong legal argument that it can, in fact, go ahead and regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles.\" Others said similarly that EPA's move might also have a galvanizing effect. \"They're proposing to walk away from all protections for public health and against these really damaging impacts of climate change,\" said Peter Zalzal, associate vice president with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. \"But states have always had an important role in regulating this pollution, and I think that role is even more pronounced in the environment we’re living in.\" That said, California is not immune to decisions made by the federal government. Fifty years ago, California asked for — and received — EPA waivers allowing it to set stricter tailpipe emissions than those mandated by the federal government. The waivers formed the foundation of the state's nation-leading ban on the sale of gas-powered cars in California by 2035. The Trump administration in June took the unprecedented step of revoking those waivers, which prompted an immediate lawsuit from California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, who argued that the move was unlawful. Meanwhile, Trump administration officials and auto industry representatives celebrated the EPA's latest announcement Tuesday. \"The trucking industry supports cleaner, more efficient technologies, but we need policies rooted in real-world conditions. We thank the Trump Administration for returning us to a path of common sense, so that we can keep delivering for the American people as we continue to reduce our environmental impact,\" read a statement from American Trucking Assns. President and Chief Executive Chris Spear. \"Today’s announcement is a monumental step toward returning to commonsense policies that expand access to affordable, reliable, secure energy and improve quality of life for all Americans,\" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. The EPA proposal will undergo a public comment period and review process before being finalized. Multiple environmental groups said they are prepared to challenge the rule in court.","summary":"Experts say the EPA's move to reverse the endangerment finding is dangerous for the nation.

Tahira Baig, the department’s deputy commissioner of finance, said the money would come from within the cultural affairs department, and Hedspeth directed the department to look for areas to reduce spending to make the pot available. Baig did not elaborate.\n\nThe announcement that Chicago will try to plug gaps left by the shifts at the national level comes at a trying moment for arts funding. The NEA canceled grant dollars in May for some Chicago cultural groups.\n\nAfter announcing major changes to the NEA’s grantmaking programs in February, President Donald Trump said in May that he would claw back grant dollars already promised for this year — including funds set to be paid to Chicago arts organizations. Trump has also proposed eliminating the organization’s budget for the future. Chicago cultural organizations that got word they would lose their pledged NEA dollars include the architecture-focused Open House Chicago and Black Harvest Film Festival.\n\nIn January, prior to Trump being inaugurated for a second term, the NEA said it would give nearly $2 million in funding to 80 arts organizations in Illinois.\n\nNEA dollars often go to larger, more established organizations, and the new grant program may not provide relief for many small, local arts entities that face a rocky financial situation. Those groups often rely on the city through its regular grant programming. DCASE announced that, starting in 2026, organizations will only be able to receive the department’s CityArts grant for up to two consecutive years before taking a year off from getting support through the program.\n\nAt Tuesday’s meeting, advisory council member Omar Torres-Kortright, executive director of Segundo Ruiz Belvis Cultural Center in Hermosa, said the required funding pauses put small organizations in a tough position.\n\n“The consistency of that grant is even almost more important than the amount that you get,” he said. “It’s that number that you know that you can put in the budget that’s going to be there every year.”\n\nIn addition to funds for organizations, DCASE gives grants to individual artists in Chicago. This year, 245 individuals received grants through the Individual Artists Program, according to a list released last week by the city. That is a near-record number of individuals who have received grants in a single year since 2019. The program gave funds to 248 individuals in 2023.\n\nThe grants are capped at $6,000 an individual, although DCASE did not say how much money was awarded through the program this year. In 2024, 200 grantees shared a pot of slightly more than $1 million, a considerable increase from the $496,300 awarded through the same initiative in 2019.\n\nAccording to DCASE, the department received more than 1,300 applications for the program this year — meaning about 19% of applicants received funds. The department said in a statement that 59% of awardees are first-time grantees across disciplines, including film, music, theater, dance and visual arts.\n\nCourtney Kueppers is an arts and culture reporter at WBEZ.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/07/29/chicago-arts-grants-dcase-nea-federal-cultural-funding-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/375386c/2147483647/strip/false/crop/7643x5098+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F14%2F53fe3f644b3ba0516bb45fb33802%2Fdcase","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 23:07:07","author":"Courtney Kueppers | WBEZ","authors":["Courtney Kueppers | WBEZ"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":346424696,"title":"Trump says Epstein ‘stole’ young women staff from his Mar-a-Lago resort","text":"United States President Donald Trump has said that he ended his relationship with disgraced financier and convicted sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein because he “stole” young female workers from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way home from a trip to Scotland on Tuesday, Trump alleged that one such worker was the late Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein‘s highest-profile accusers.\n\n“People were taken out of the [Mar-a-Lago] spa, hired by him. In other words, gone,” Trump said. “When I heard about it, I told him, I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people.’\n\n“And then, not too long after that, he did it again. And I said, ‘Out of here.’”\n\nThe US president, who had a close relationship with Epstein for years, has become increasingly defensive as he faces growing scrutiny over his administration’s refusal to release government records with information about Epstein’s abuses.\n\nOfficials including Attorney General Pam Bondi have said that releasing further documents would risk disseminating victim information and child pornography collected as evidence.\n\nBut Bondi’s comments have helped fuel the controversy. In a February interview with Fox News, Bondi said that Epstein’s supposed client list was “sitting on my desk right now”.\n\nConspiracy theorists have long maintained that Epstein kept a list or book of contacts in order to coerce powerful figures in arts and politics. They also have cast doubt on Epstein’s jailhouse suicide in 2019, calling it, without proof, a cover-up.\n\nCurrent members of Trump’s administration, including FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino, had played up those theories in past media appearances.\n\nBut the Department of Justice and FBI later released a review concluding that there was no reason to believe such a list existed and that Epstein had died by suicide, as the government originally concluded.\n\nThat assertion was met with frustration from some corners of Trump’s own far-right base, who have speculated for years about Epstein’s ties with powerful figures and the circumstances of his death.\n\nGiuffre has been a prominent figure in online conspiracy theories. She had accused Epstein of pressuring her to have sex with the powerful men in his orbit.\n\nUntil her death by suicide earlier this year, Giuffre maintained that she had been approached as a teenager by Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, while she was working at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nGiuffre had been employed at the time as a spa attendant. Her father worked in maintenance at the resort.\n\nMaxwell, according to Giuffre, offered her money to work as a masseuse for Epstein, who then sexually abused her. She described Maxwell and Epstein as grooming her to perform sex acts for other men. Giuffre alleged that “massage” was sometimes used as a code word for sex.\n\nGiuffre ultimately filed a civil suit against Maxwell in New York. While Maxwell has denied Giuffre’s allegations, she settled the suit for an undisclosed sum.\n\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence in a Florida federal prison for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nIf you or someone you know is at risk of suicide, these organisations may be able to help.","summary":"Trump says he cut off his relationship with Epstein because the sex offender poached workers from his Florida resort.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/29/trump-says-epstein-stole-young-women-staff-from-his-mar-a-lago-resort?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/getty_6878f0c781-1752756423_947d24-1752756573.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 23:07:01","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":346424934,"title":"Trump claims WSJ ‘wants to settle’ $10B lawsuit over alleged ‘wonderful secret’ birthday message to Epstein","text":"Donald Trump claims The Wall Street Journal wants to settle his $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, its parent company, media mogul Rupert Murdoch and two journalists whose bylines appeared on a story about the president’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n“It’s in the lawyer’s hands,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday.\n\n“I have been treated very unfairly by The Wall Street Journal on everything,” he said. “I would assume Rupert Murdoch controls it, but maybe he does, maybe he doesn’t. And they are talking to us about doing something, but we’ll see what happens. They would like us to drop that. So we’ll see. … They want to settle it.”\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from Dow Jones, the newspaper’s publisher.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Miami on July 18, claims the newspaper, its publishers, media company News Corp, and executives and journalists falsely smeared the president by accusing him of writing a sexually suggestive birthday card to the convicted sex offender in 2003.\n\nThe birthday greeting is described by the newspaper as also including a birthday wish that says, “may every day be another wonderful secret.”\n\nA letter reportedly bearing Trump’s name, which the WSJ report claims was reviewed by the newspaper, contains several lines of typewritten text framed by a drawing of a naked woman. His signature is a squiggly “Donald” below her waist, mimicking pubic hair, according to the report.\n\nThe defendants “failed to attach the letter, failed to attach the alleged drawing, failed to show proof that President Trump authored or signed any such letter, and failed to explain how this purported letter was obtained,” according to Trump’s lawsuit.\n\n“The reason for those failures is because no authentic letter or drawing exists,” the complaint claims.\n\nTrump’s relationship with Epstein — who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of minors before he was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 — has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following a Department of Justice memo that says no such “list” of Epstein’s alleged clients exists. Trump’s supporters and allies have demanded a full accounting of Epstein’s death and alleged ties to a wider child trafficking conspiracy implicating powerful figures.\n\nOn Monday, Trump’s attorneys filed an expedited request for Murdoch’s deposition, citing his age (94) and prior health issues. \n\nTrump “reached out to, and spoke directly with, Murdoch and advised him that the letter referenced in the article was fake,” according to the president’s legal team. “Murdoch advised President Trump that ‘he would take care of it.’”\n\nThe president has repeatedly threatened media outlets, publishers and journalists with legal action, and he routinely suggests he can revoke broadcast licenses for networks over their antagonistic coverage.\n\nHis blockbuster lawsuits against broadcast news giants ABC News and CBS News resulted in large settlements that have sparked fears among press freedom advocates that publishers are only emboldening the president’s chilling message to the media.\n\nLast week, the White House removed WSJ reporters from the pool of journalists covering the president’s trip to Scotland in an apparent retaliation for the story.\n\n“Due to the Wall Street Journal’s fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the [13] outlets on board,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement shared with The Independent. “Every news organization in the entire world wishes to cover President Trump, and the White House has taken significant steps to include as many voices as possible.”\n\nDow Jones declined to comment on the reporters’ removal.","summary":"The president says he ‘assumes’ that his once-former ally and right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch ‘controls’ the

After CBS announced the left-leaning comedian’s show being canceled weeks earlier, several people ranging from commentators to lawmakers called out the move as authoritarian, suggesting CBS bent the knee to Trump after recently settling a lawsuit.

It’s a tradition to make fun of whoever’s in power, like, that’s what the job entails,\" Bazer said. Local comic James Dugan, who frequently performs for the Chicago improv show Whirled News Tonight, told the Chicago Sun-Times that his team largely pulls jokes from the headlines, which have heavily featured Trump recently. In fact, he described concerns about an oversaturation of Trump jokes. \"A lot of times with our show in particular, we get four or five newspapers and spread them out,\" Dugan said. \"And there is a little bit of a sense of like, should we take out the Trump stuff?

John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican who backs President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration crackdown.\n\nUntil this week, Mexican national Paola Clouatre had been one of tens of thousands of people in ICE custody as the Trump administration continues to press immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day suspected of being in the U.S. illegally.\n\nEmails reviewed by The Associated Press show that Kennedy’s office said Friday that it put in a request for the Department of Homeland Security to release her after a judge halted her deportation order earlier that week. By Monday, she was out of a remote ICE detention center in north Louisiana and home in Baton Rouge with her veteran husband Adrian Clouatre and their two young children.\n\nKennedy’s constituent services representative, Christy Tate, congratulated Adrian Clouatre on his wife’s release and thanked him for his military service. “I am so happy for you and your family,” Tate wrote in an email to Adrian Clouatre. “God is truly great!”\n\nKennedy’s office proved “instrumental” in engaging with the Department of Homeland Security, according to Carey Holliday, the family’s attorney. Kennedy’s office did not provide further comment.\n\nAnother Louisiana Republican, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, also intervened recently with the Department of Homeland Security to secure the release of an Iranian mother from ICE detention following widespread outcry. The woman has lived for decades in New Orleans.\n\nKennedy has generally been a staunch supporter of Trump’s immigration policies.\n\n“Illegal immigration is illegal — duh,” Kennedy posted on his Facebook page on July 17, amid a series of recent media appearances decrying efforts to prevent ICE officers from making arrests. In April, however, he criticized the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting a Maryland man.\n\nSenator’s office requests mother’s release from ICE custody\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security previously told The AP it considered Clouatre to be “illegally” in the country.\n\nAn email chain shared by Adrian Clouatre shows that the family’s attorney reached out to Kennedy’s office in early June after Paola Clouatre was detained in late May.\n\nTate received Paola Clouatre’s court documents by early July and said she then contacted ICE, according to the email exchange.\n\nOn July 23, an immigration judge halted Paola Clouatre’s deportation order. After Adrian Clouatre notified Kennedy’s office, Tate said she “sent the request to release” Paola Clouatre to DHS and shared a copy of the judge’s motion with the agency, emails show.\n\nIn an email several days later, Tate said that ICE told her it “continues to make custody determinations on a case-by-case basis based on the specific circumstances of each case” and had received the judge’s decision from Kennedy’s office “for consideration.”\n\nThe next working day, Paola Clouatre was released from custody.\n\n“We will continue to keep you, your family and others that are experiencing the same issues in our prayers,” Tate said in an email to Adrian Clouatre. “If you need our assistance in the future, please contact us.”\n\nBack with her children\n\nPaola Clouatre had been detained by ICE officers on May 27 during an appointment related to her green card application.\n\nShe had entered the country as a minor with her mother from Mexico more than a decade ago and was legally processed while seeking asylum, she, her husband and her attorney say. But Clouatre’s mother later failed to show up for a court date, leading a judge to issue a deportation order against Paola Clouatre in 2018, though by then she had become estranged from her mother and was homeless.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Clouatre’s release.\n\nAdrian Clouatre said he wished the agency would “actually look at the circumstances” before detaining people like his wife. “It shouldn’t just be like a blanket ‘Oh, they’re illegal, throw them in ICE detention.’”\n\nReunited with her breastfeeding infant daughter and able to snuggle with her toddler son, Paola Clouatre told AP she feels like a mother again.\n\n“I was feeling bad,” she said of detention. “I was feeling like I failed my kids.”\n\nIt will likely be a multiyear court process before Paola Clouatre’s immigration court proceedings are formally closed, but things look promising, and she should be able to obtain her green card eventually, her attorney said.\n\nFor now, she’s wearing an ankle monitor, but still able to pick up life where she left off, her husband says.
