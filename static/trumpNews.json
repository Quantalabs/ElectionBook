{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":11664,"news":[{"id":262686684,"title":"Warriors’ Steve Kerr centers closing message on US presidential election around ‘big lie’","text":"WASHINGTON D.C. — Asked about what it’s like to be in the nation’s capital on the eve of the U.S. presidential election, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr laid out — over nearly three minutes — his concerns of Donald Trump’s repeated election fraud conspiracies he considers “a direct assault on democracy.”\n\nKerr, who endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a Democratic National Convention speech this summer, said he has had conversations with the team about the anxiety surrounding the election. Kerr and the Warriors coaches wore white “VOTE” shirts over the weekend and continued to don them on Monday night at Capital One Arena, where they played the Wizards.\n\n“There’s a reason we’re wearing these shirts, it’s not just an NBA-mandated thing,” Kerr said. “We believe in our democracy, we believe in voting, we want to encourage everybody to get out and vote. And honestly, regardless of who you’re going to vote for: Get out and vote.\n\n“I think the biggest thing that will come out of tomorrow will be election integrity, which has never been a thing in my entire life until Donald Trump decided it was going to be a thing. In order for our democracy to thrive, not only do we as citizens have to take part, but we also have to trust that these elections are not tainted — which they aren’t.”\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, but has pushed unfounded claims that the election was rigged or stolen from him. He recently said at a campaign rally that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House. A bipartisan House Select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol concluded Trump’s false allegations of fraud provoked his supporters to storm the capitol.\n\nThe Department of Justice indicted Trump with obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to knowingly make a false statement, and assisting, aiding or comforting an insurrection. The indictment’s allegations were later narrowed following a Supreme Court ruling on immunity for former presidents, but the charges remained.\n\nTrump has also been indicted in Georgia for his role in pressuring state officials and lawmakers to reverse Biden’s win and “find” enough votes to tip the election results his way.\n\nTrump also became the first president in U.S. history to be convicted of felony crimes when a New York jury found him guilty of all 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels.\n\nSome conservative media outlets lined up behind Trump’s claims. Fox News settled a defamation case against Dominion, a voting machine company, for $787 million.\n\nTrump and his allies have failed to produce evidence of widespread voting irregularities. A Brookings Institute study of Heritage Foundation data found minuscule instances of voter fraud in key states. For example, Arizona has been home to 36 reported cases of voter fraud in its last 36 elections, with more than 42 million ballots cast.\n\n“There’s been all these lies that have been spread over the last eight years about election integrity,” Kerr said. “People have been fooled into thinking there’s irregularities. It’s the most important part of our democracy, is for people to trust the election system. And so, I would urge everybody to vote.\n\n“Pick your reason to vote. I vote on issues like gun violence prevention, which is very important to me, (and) abortion rights for women. Not that it’s any surprise, I’m voting for Harris. But I’m also voting for democracy. I’m voting because I know whichever side wins, I know I’m going to respect the election integrity.”\n\nTrump has spent much of his final week on the campaign trail baselessly trying to discredit the legitimacy of this year’s election. He hasn’t committed to accepting the results of the 2024 election and has claimed that the only way he can lose would be if there is fraud.\n\nAn NBC survey of local election officials found that 38% reported experiencing threats, harassment and abuse and 54% are concerned about the safety of their colleagues.\n\n“It’s a direct assault on democracy,” Kerr said. “So get out and vote tomorrow. Pick who you want to vote for. But understand that these elections are legitimate, they’re real. It’s never been an issue, ever, in my lifetime. Not a single instance of anyone even thinking the elections weren’t legitimate. Until a convicted felon who’s running for office again decided to conjure up all this stuff to put fear in the air. Which is a direct threat to our system and our democracy.”\n\nKerr said he talked about the “angst” around the election with Draymond Green on Monday morning. Neither he nor the team has made specific plans for watching Tuesday’s election.\n\nPolls in swing states have consistently shown both Trump and Harris within the margin of error, signs of what is likely to be a tight race.\n\n“I don’t think anyone knows what’s going to happen,” Kerr said.\n\nKerr has been among the most outspoken professional sports figures when it comes to politics, particularly about gun control. Monday was the first time Kerr specifically called out Trump’s efforts to discredit fair elections publicly.\n\nWhen Kerr accepted the Democratic Party’s invitation to speak at the convention in August, shortly after leading Team USA to Olympic gold, he delivered a speech centered around unity and the values leaders should demonstrate.\n\n“The strength of our country is the diversity of our country,” Kerr said on Monday. “The strength of our country is us, our people. We’re all Americans. Whether you’re a Republican or Democrat, rural or urban, we are American. We need to unite, we need to be together. That was my message that night, and that’s what I wanted to get across. I hope that people recognize that.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of friends who live in countries where they don’t have democracy. And they tell me all the time, it is fragile, don’t take it for granted. When you start questioning the validity of elections to try to gain power, you’re dealing with a very fragile governmental system that you’re trying to bring down in the name of power, which is the most anti-democratic thing I can think of.”","summary":"Kerr spoke for three minutes in the nation's capital, imploring fans to vote and trust the electoral process, pointing to the extremely small number of voter fraud reports and Donald Trump's own efforts to overturn an election.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/04/warriors-steve-kerr-centers-closing-message-on-us-presidential-election-around-big-lie/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BNG-Z-KERRDNC-0820.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 01:07:15","author":"Danny Emerman","authors":["Danny Emerman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":262685782,"title":"Musk’s Misleading U.S. Election Claims On X Rack Up 2 Billion Views, Report Finds","text":"A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate reveals that billionaire Elon Musk’s social media posts containing misleading claims about the U.S. election have garnered over 2 billion views on X in 2024.\n\nThis surge in misinformation on X, which Musk owns, has raised alarm among government officials and voting rights advocates who are urging social media platforms to take decisive action against election-related falsehoods.\n\nWarnings From U.S. Officials and Advocacy Groups\n\nIn response to Musk’s high-profile posts, officials and voting rights groups have issued warnings about the spread of election-related misinformation. They stress the need for social media companies, particularly X, to actively counter such misinformation to protect public confidence in the electoral process. Musk’s high engagement on the platform, combined with his backing of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, has amplified the reach of his posts significantly.\n\nFact-Checked Claims On The U.S. Election\n\nAccording to the report, Musk has shared at least 87 posts this year that fact-checkers have labeled as false or misleading. The reach of these posts has been staggering, amassing 17.1 billion views since Musk publicly endorsed Trump in July—a figure more than double the combined views of all U.S. political campaign ads on X in the same timeframe. Despite multiple reports on these figures, X has yet to comment on the matter or outline specific actions to counteract the misleading content.\n\nContent Fueling Misinformation Concerns\n\nAmong the contentious posts were claims about “voter importation,” suggesting a “triple-digit increase” in undocumented immigrants within key battleground states over the past four years, and assertions questioning the “integrity of voting.” Both claims have been flagged by fact-checkers as misleading. Furthermore, the report highlights the role of X’s Community Notes feature, a crowd-sourced fact-checking tool that has so far been insufficient in curbing election-related misinformation on the platform.\n\nAs Musk’s content reaches a vast audience, pressure mounts on social media companies to establish and enforce robust fact-checking protocols. Voting rights groups and government entities underscore that unchecked misinformation has serious consequences, potentially affecting election outcomes and eroding public trust in democratic processes.\n\nMUST READ | Kamala Harris’ Ancestral Village In India Holds Prayers for Her Success On U.S. Election Day","summary":"A report reveals that Elon Musk's misleading claims about the U.S. election on platform X gained 2 billion views in 2024, fueling concerns over election misinformation.\n\n\nThe post Musk&#8217;s Misleading U.S. Election Claims On X Rack Up 2 Billion Views, Report Finds appeared first on NewsX World.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/us-elections-2024/musks-misleading-u-s-election-claims-on-x-rack-up-2-billion-views-report-finds/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Elon-Musk-3.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 01:03:25","author":"Satyam Singh","authors":["Satyam Singh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":262683656,"title":"Donald Trump says 'I don't mind' if reporters are shot in demented campaign rally rant","text":"The request could not be satisfied.\n\nRequest blocked.\nWe can't connect to the server for this app or website at this time.

Which moment was your favorite? Let us know in the comments!\n\n Tetris Kelly:\n\n As the election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is coming to a close, we’re looking back at the music that defined the campaigns. Like when Kamala announced that she was entering the race for the presidency, and Charli XCX tweeted out, “Kamala is brat.” The British pop star helped create more buzz around Vice President Harris, which prompted “KamalaHQ,” the official rapid response of the VP, to change their header to Charli’s signature ‘brat’ green. Since then, several edits and memes of Kamala Harris were made to songs off of ‘Brat’ like “360,” “365,” and “Von Dutch.” From Kamala to Trump, the former president is apparently in charge of picking the music for his rallies and seems to have some repeat favorites that span a wide range of artists, like opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, Frank Sinatra, and the Village People, even dancing along with the signature “YMCA” moves! But that’s not the only song on Trump’s playlist; his campaign has repeatedly used Lee Greenwood’s rendition of “God Bless the U.S.A,” throughout his three campaigns. The 82-year-old singer even performed it at the RNC. Kamala Harris has her own go-to campaign song for her rallies, Beyoncé’s “Freedom.” To see more stories like this, head over to Billboard.","summary":"As the presidential race nears the end, we’re running through some of the most iconic music moments from Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’ campaigns.

Korea; stresses 'ironclad' US commitment, Seoul's 'sizable' USFK contributions","text":"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Saturday touted the South Korea-U.S. alliance as a \"linchpin\" of security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world, while underlining Seoul's \"sizable\" contributions to the upkeep of the 28,500-strong U.S. Forces Korea (USFK).\n\nVice President Harris made the remarks in a special contribution to Yonhap News Agency, reiterating America's \"ironclad\" security commitment to South Korea, vowing to preserve its global leadership and accentuating the importance of the bilateral alliance forged in blood during the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nTitled \"Let's Go Forward, Together: Creating a Prosperous Future for Korean Americans,\" her exclusive contribution is the first of its kind to a South Korean media outlet in this year's election cycle. It came just days ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"In 2022, I stood at the DMZ and reaffirmed the United States' ironclad commitment to the defense of South Korea. I know our alliance has been a linchpin of security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world,\" she wrote, recalling her trip to the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.\n\n\"Trump, by contrast, is demanding that South Korea pay $10 billion a year to host our troops despite its already sizable contributions — disparaging our alliance and disregarding America's standing in the Indo-Pacific,\" she added as she is set to face off against her Republican rival in Tuesday's showdown.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News last month, former President Donald Trump said if he were in the Oval Office, Seoul would be paying $10 billion per year for the stationing of the USFK personnel. He called South Korea a \"money machine.\"\n\nEarly last month, Seoul and Washington struck a defense cost-sharing deal, called the Special Measures Agreement. Under the deal for the 2026-2030 period, Seoul is to pay 1.52 trillion won ($1.10 billion) in 2026, up from 1.4 trillion won in 2025.\n\nIn the special contribution, the vice president highlighted the ultimate sacrifices of South Korean and American service personnel during the Korean War, which have underpinned the deepening bond and alliance between the two nations.\n\n\"More than 36,000 Americans and over 137,000 Korean soldiers gave their lives during the Korean War, fighting side by side to defend freedom and liberty,\" she said. \"During last year's state visit with President Yoon Suk Yeol, I promised to honor this bond as we commemorated the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK alliance.\"\n\nROK stands for South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea.\n\nHarris took stock of headway in the increasingly multi-faceted relationship between South Korea and the U.S. in recent years.\n\n\"Under my vice presidency, we have advanced our people-to-people ties and deepened our economic partnership by catalyzing huge South Korean private sector investments in America, which are creating good-paying jobs for Americans in industries like semiconductors and electric vehicles,\" she said.\n\nTouching on sacrifices that her late Indian-born immigrant mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, made for her family, the Democratic standard-bearer expressed her deep respect for the Korean American story of \"courage\" and \"resilience.\"\n\n\"Countless Korean immigrants have worked long hours — many in their family-owned grocery stores, dry cleaners and restaurant — to build a brighter future for their children,\" she said. \"Today, over two million Koreans enrich every corner of America.\"\n\nShe added that Biden and she were proud to host the first-ever White House celebration of Chuseok, the Korean equivalent of Thanksgiving Day, and commemorate Korean American Day — events that she said recognized the community's \"contributions to the American story\" since the first Korean immigrants arrived in the U.S. in 1903.\n\nReciting her core election slogan of a \"New Way Forward,\" Harris drove home a message of hope and support for Korean Americans — a key segment of Asian Americans seen as a rapidly growing voting bloc for the upcoming election.\n\n\"This election is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other on the past,\" she said. \"I represent a new, optimistic generation of leadership and will chart a New Way Forward — one that protects the aspirations of the Korean American community and ensures you can not just get by, but get ahead.\"\n\nShe underscored that Korean Americans represent \"the very best of what is possible in this country.\"\n\n\"I promise to carry on the legacy of our parents and their sacrifices, so that our children can achieve the promise of America,\" she said.\n\nRenewing her pledge to create an \"opportunity economy\" aimed at boosting the middle class and small businesses, Harris vowed to increase access to credit and capital for small businesses and make federal funding more accessible in a message for Korean American entrepreneurs.\n\nFor those in the \"sandwich generation\" who are providing care to both children and parents, she pointed out that her \"Medicare At Home\" plan will cover the cost of home care for the elderly and include vision and hearing coverage for seniors.\n\nThe vice president lambasted Trump, calling him an \"unserious\" man and warning that the consequences of him ever getting back into the White House are \"brutally serious.\"\n\nHarris also argued that Trump's \"failure of leadership\" fueled a \"wave of anti-Asian violence\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"I worked with President Biden to enact legislation to combat anti-Asian hate crimes,\" she said. \"We welcomed BTS to the White House, where they spoke up for inclusion amid attacks on Asian Americans,\" she added, referring to the K-pop superband.\n\nShe ended her contribution by saying, \"Let us continue to 'Go Together.' Gam-sa-hap-ni-da (Thank you in Korean).\"\n\nIf elected, Harris will become the nation's first female and first Asian-American commander-in-chief. Previously, she served as a senator of California, the attorney general of the Golden State and district attorney of San Francisco.

If Trump comes to power, the government may signal more aggressive stimulus to offset market concerns about China,” Su said.\nThe EIU expects about 6 trillion yuan (US$42.7 billion) in special sovereign bonds for debt swaps and large bank recapitalisation, and 4 trillion yuan in special local government bonds for the acquisition of idle land and unsold housing inventory, primarily aimed at easing liquidity issues for developers.\n“If Trump is elected, the stimulus is likely to exceed this scale, or the NPC will issue a more proactive commitment,” Su added.\nWe believe the US election results will have some impact on the size of Beijing’s stimulus package\nNomura economists\nNomura economists Lu Ting, Wang Jing and Harrington Zhang expect the stimulus package could range from 2 to 3 per cent of gross domestic product annually over the next several years, with a Trump victory likely pushing it toward 3 per cent.\n“We believe the US election results will have some impact on the size of Beijing’s stimulus package, though its impact should be quite limited, as the major challenges for Beijing emanate from within rather than outside,” they said.\nLawmakers began the meeting on Monday in Beijing, with a potential stimulus package expected to be among the key issues discussed.\nAnalysts broadly expect lawmakers to approve an injection of around 1 trillion yuan into banks via special sovereign bonds, alongside a government bond issuance for debt swaps over the next few years, with a range estimated of between 6 trillion yuan and 10 trillion yuan.\nDuring his campaign, Trump threatened a 60 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, while Harris has not signalled a divergence from the tech restrictions implemented under the Biden administration.\nExports have remained a crucial driver for the world’s second-largest economy, which is still grappling with shrinking domestic demand, with the US still one of the top destinations for Chinese shipments.\n\n“If higher tariffs materialise, policymakers appear willing to launch more stimulus to offset any growth drags,” economists at investment bank Goldman Sachs said at the end of October.\nThe report said Trump was expected to “quickly move to raise tariffs on imports from China,” while adding his proposed 60 per cent rate was plausible on certain strategic imports, and that tariffs on Chinese consumer products would increase by less.\n“[This may result] in an average tariff hike on imports from China of around 20 percentage points – less than proposed but still more than double the rise during the 2018-19 trade war,” the report added.\nIt pointed out an estimated drag of 0.65 percentage points on China’s cumulative GDP by the trade war amid lower exports, increased uncertainty and tighter financial conditions.\nA 60 per cent tariff, they added, would impact real GDP by around 2 percentage points.\nThe final size may be bigger in Trump’s victory, but it may only come slowly\nGary Ng, Natixis\nAdditional countermeasures from Beijing could include allowing the yuan to depreciate, cutting US imports, imposing retaliatory tariffs and restricting exports of critical materials, including rare earths to the US, the report said.\nCustoms data showed the US was China’s top market in September, with shipments up by 2.16 per cent year on year, surpassing exports to the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n“While China has remained ambiguous about the actual fiscal stimulus, I doubt whether it would step up the size massively at this stage regardless of the US election outcome,” said Gary Ng, a senior economist at French investment bank Natixis.\nHe added Beijing would continue to back the economy to meet its growth target of “around 5 per cent”, but the package would be more of a “painkiller”.\n“The final size may be bigger in Trump’s victory, but it may only come slowly,” Ng said.","summary":"China’s top legislative body is meeting this week in Beijing, at the same time as Tuesday’s US presidential election.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/policy/article/3285148/us-election-could-shape-chinas-long-awaited-fiscal-stimulus-package-analysts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/04/18fd01e5-99cf-410f-938c-e4b65af7af93_648f07a0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 01:00:24","author":"Ji Siqi,Sylvia Ma","authors":["Ji Siqi","Sylvia Ma"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.124},{"id":262686680,"title":"US election: What can South Asia expect?","text":"By P.K.Balachandran/Daily News\n\nColombo, November 5:: In the post-World War II era, relations between the US and South Asian countries have been both close and growing as the US had replaced Britain as the dominant power in the region. Therefore, an American Presidential election is of critical importance to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Nepal and the Maldives.\n\nAccording to International Relations (IR) experts interviewed by the US journal Foreign Policy in October, Washington’s policy vis-à-vis South Asia will be one of “continuity” whether it is Donald Trump or Kamala Harris who wins. \n\nAs India is the pivot of US policy on South Asia, Washington will look towards further defence tie ups with India and work with it to counter China in the Indian Ocean.\n\nMichael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Centre’s South Asia Institute, told the Turkish news agency, Anadolu that in the US, there is a strong bipartisan support for close ties with India. Therefore, whether it is a Trump or a Harris Administration, there will be continuity in the India policy. The US has differences with India over Russia and China, but still, India and US will cooperate, Kugelman stressed. \n\nHowever, it is undeniable that, right now, India-US relations are at a low ebb, to say the least. To India’s discomfiture, the US joined Canada in charging that its intelligence agency was plotting to kill Indian dissidents in North America. The US said that an American Sikh separatist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, had been a target of India-handled assassins. The Pannun case is in court and an Indian agent allegedly involved in the plot was extradited from the Czech Republic and brought to the US for trial.\n\nCanada went to the extent of naming Indian Home Minister Amit Shah and the National Security Advisor of India Ajit Doval as persons behind the alleged assassination plots. India stoutly denied any involvement. But it is in talks with the US at the National Security Advisors’ level to find a way out of the logjam.\n\nDespite that Kugelman said both Harris and Trump would not let it go. “They would pressure India to carry out an investigation.”\n\nThough India and US are strategic partners vis-à-vis China, they have divergent interests. India is now seeking a détente with China on the border issue and also more Chinese investments. This should worry both Trump and Harris.\n\nIndia’s relations with Russia, however, is a different kettle of fish. Trump is suspected to be in cahoots with Putin but Harris is resolutely opposed to Putin. Trump is strongly supportive of commercial ties with India, but at the same time, he is highly critical of India’s high tariffs.\n\nBe that as it may, India and the US have too much at stake in the relations to allow ties to be hampered. The arms trade between India and the US has touched USD 25 billion. In 2023, US investments in India were valued at approximately USD 49.6 billion and Indian investment in the US amounted to USD 4.6 billion. Millions of Indians live in the US. \n\nNo matter who is in White House, Pakistan will not be a priority, is the dim view of Kamran Yousaf of Express Tribune. The US abandoned Pakistan, its ally in the Afghan war, after it walked out of Afghanistan in 2021. The Afghan war thrust two million Afghan refugees on Pakistan but the US walked out without helping Pakistan cope with them.\n\nOn top of it, Trump accused Pakistan of playing a double game taking American money to fight the Taliban while supporting the Taliban clandestinely. He blocked military aid to Pakistan. \n\nHowever, Pakistan’s geographical location makes it important to the US. To keep Pakistan from turning totally hostile, the US has turned a blind eye to the Beijing-funded multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nPresident Joe Biden put US-Bangladesh relations on an even keel after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina who had clashed with the US on human rights and other matters such as her refusal to join the anti-China QUAD.\n\nThe student movement, which ousted Hasina, had the backing of the US. The present Chief Advisor to the interim government Prof. Muhammad Yunus is sad to be the joint choice of the US, the agitating students and Bangladeshi civil society. The US has been a strong supporter of civil liberties in Bangladesh, even sanctioning some of the top men in Hasina’s security establishment. Human rights issues cement ties between the Yunus regime and Washington.\n\nWhile it is clear that Kamala Harris will follow Biden’s footsteps vis-à-vis Bangladesh, Trump has taken a pro-Hasina stand apparently with an eye on the influential Indian-American voters in the US.\n\nGreeting American Hindus on Deepavali day, Trump said on X: “ I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos. It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America.”\n\n“Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi.”\n\nTrump could well have made these pro-Modi or pro-Hindu noises only to get the votes of the Hindu-dominated Indian American community. Given the presence of US protégé Muhammad Yunus at the helm in Dhaka, Trump is more likely to strengthen US ties with Bangladesh than weaken them.\n\nSri Lanka’s relations with the US are unlikely to be different from the past, though the newly elected National Peoples’ Power (NPP) government portrays itself as radical leftist. The NPP leader and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has indicated that he can play ball with capitalism and the US-led West. \n\nMoreover, Colombo has not said or done anything which would suggest a pro-China tilt. These factors should pave the way for a smooth relationship with the US.\n\nHowever, the US has a long-standing and deep interest in drafting Sri Lanka into its anti-China maritime security architecture, the QUAD. But Sri Lankan governments have dreaded involvement in QUAD. No Sri Lankan government has wanted the island to become a battle ground for regional or world rivals. \n\nNevertheless, the US, whether under Trump or Harris, will press Sri Lanka to sign agreements on defence and security cooperation, even those Sri Lanka had traditionally baulked at such as the Status of Forces Agreement(SOFA) which is a bilateral (or multilateral) agreement that outlines the legal status of US military personnel, their dependents, and their assets in a foreign country. SOFA also establishes rights and responsibilities between the US and the host country.\n\nThe US will also raise human and minority rights, irrespective of the occupant at the Wight House. Although Trump could be expected to be less human rights-oriented than Harris, he might not be able to disentangle himself from a legacy issue like human rights entirely. \n\nIn fact he hasn’t.This is indicated in his message to American Hindus voters in which he sharply criticized the way Hindus were being attacked in post-Hasina Bangladesh. He declared that under his watch, that would not have happened. \n\nAfghanistan and Nepal\n\nThe Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would probably like to have Trump as President. As US President earlier, Trump had pulled out US troops from Afghanistan.\n\nNepal is ruled by a coalition between the pro-China Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) and the pro-India Nepali Congress party. Nepal and China had signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework agreement in May 2017.\n\nBut Nepal has been expressing serious reservations about the text of the BRI. Nepal has said that it is not interested in commercial loans but only investments. Talks over the BRI projects and an implementation plan remain suspended.\n\nNepal has strong ties with the US. Nepal signed the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) agreement to get US$ 500 million for development projects in 2017. The compact was ratified by Nepal's Federal Parliament in 2022.\n\nUS relations with Maldives is expected to be smooth as the Mohamed Muizzu government has completely given up its pro-China and anti-Indian character and is now heavily dependent on India financially.\n\nChina appears to have abandoned the Maldives for reasons not clear. Since Maldives is in the care of strategic partner India, the US has little to worry about.","summary":"Be it Harris or Trump, continuity rather than change is indicated \n\n\nThe post US election: What can South Asia expect? appeared first on NewsIn.Asia.","url":"https://newsin.asia/us-election-what-can-south-asia-expect/","image":"https://newsin.asia/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Harris-and-Trump-Nov-3-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:57:48","author":"Editor","authors":["Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":262683250,"title":"Musk's PAC Admits It Picked Winners Of $1M-A-Day Voter Giveaway","text":"The director of Elon Musk's America PAC testified Monday that he selected the winners of a $1 million daily giveaway despite Musk's claim that they would be selected \"randomly.\"The revelation led a lawyer representing Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner to argue, \"If their story is true, it's one of the greatest scams of the last 50 years,\" Reuters reported.But Common Pleas Court Judge Angelo Foglietta denied Krasner's bid to stop the swing-state giveaway program one day before this year's presidential election, saying in a one-sentence written order that he'd explain his reasoning later.America PAC director Chris Young took the witness stand in a courtroom in Philadelphia City Hall to rebut Krasner's allegations that Musk and his political action committee were running an illegal lottery.Young said he picked the winners from a pool of people who appeared in videos after PAC workers met them outside campaign events for former President Donald Trump and reviewed their social media accounts.They were vetted to \"feel out their personality, make sure they were someone whose values aligned\" with the PAC, Young said, according to the Associated Press.The winners were also required to sign nondisclosure agreements that prohibited them from discussing the deal, Young said.\"They couldn't really reveal the truth about how they got the money, right?\" Krasner lawyer John Summers asked.\"Sounds right,\" Young said.More than 1 million registered swing-state voters signed up for the purported sweepstakes by signing a petition that pledged their support for the rights to free speech and to bear arms, which are guaranteed by the first two amendments to the U.S. Constitution.The seven swing states expected to decide this year's election are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.At one point during Young's testimony, Summers played a video clip of an Oct. 19 Trump rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where Musk said, \"We're going to be awarding a million dollars randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election,\"Young said he was surprised to hear Musk use the word \"randomly.\"\"Not the word I would gave selected,\" he said.Musk, who's donated more than $118 million to America PAC, didn't attend Monday's hearing.Musk lawyer Chris Gober said the final two giveaways would take place in Arizona on Monday and in Michigan on Tuesday, according to AP.\"We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million recipient today and tomorrow,\" he said.It's unclear if anyone has received their money yet, AP said, but an exhibit shown in court indicated the PAC pledged they would get it by Nov. 30.Krasner testified Monday that the giveaways were \"political marketing masquerading as a lottery.\"\"That's what it is. A grift,\" he said.Krasner also alleged that those who signed up \"were scammed for their information.\"Krasner has said he could still consider criminal charges and the U.S. Justice Department has warned America PAC that the giveaways may violate federal law.","summary":"The revelation came during a hearing after which a Pennsylvania judge declined to stop the billionaire's big-bucks, swing-state stunt.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/musks-pac-admits-it-picked-winners-1m-day-voter-giveaway-3749493","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4559108/elon-musk-giant-check.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:56:43","author":"Bruce Golding","authors":["Bruce Golding"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":262685990,"title":"Morning Digest: PM Modi condemns attack on Hindu temple in Canada; Indian Army resumes patrolling in Depsang, first since disengagement, and more","text":"Indian Army resumes patrolling in Depsang, first since disengagement\n\nThe Indian Army has successfully patrolled one of the five Patrolling Points in Depsang Ara of Eastern Ladakh, the Leh-based 14 Corps announced late on Monday (November 4, 2024).

Swift has publicly endorsed Harris, but unlike other A-list peers, it doesn’t appear she’ll be sighted with the vice president before the election. Randi Mahomes being able to wear her MAGA hat into Arrowhead stadium is also very significant considering what has happened in recent weeks with the accessory. For one, San Francisco 49ers edge rusher Nick Bosa crashed his quarterback Brock Purdy’s post-game interview after beating the Dallas Cowboys while wearing the same red MAGA hat. The NFL has yet to lay down any discipline for Bosa, though he is not expected to be suspended for doing so. Also, a family at that same 49ers game went viral after video showed security at Levi’s Stadium not allowing one of them to wear his red MAGA hat. It was an argument that lasted well over a half hour before they were allowed into the stadium. Finally, a fan at Highmark Stadium for the Buffalo Bills-Miami Dolphins contest on Sunday was asked to removed his shirt showing support for Trump. \"It’s an NFL policy he cannot wear his Trump shirt in the first row of a game,\" a man in the video was heard saying to a security guard right below the fence separating the field from the seats.

The aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted the GOP's struggle to pick a leader in 2023, when former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was selected after 15 votes.Congress is required to hold a joint session on January 6, 2025, to certify the 2024 presidential election results. The new House session will convene on January 3. If the House fails to choose a leader in three days, the chamber will be unable to establish governing rules and would be required to continue to vote on a speaker until a leader is selected.\"As a result of the protracted Republican infighting of 2023—we are concerned about the possibility that a similarly messy Speaker fight could slip past Jan. 6 and prevent the House from convening the joint session,\" the Democratic aide told Politico, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\"Staff are looking into that scenario as it's unclear how Congress would be able to comply with the Constitution's demand for a joint session when the House, effectively, doesn't exist,\" the source added.Newsweek sent an email to Johnson's office for comment on Monday.Republicans currently hold a three-seat majority in the House, although Democrats have a chance to flip the lower chamber of Congress this fall. According to election models run by The Economists, Democrats have a 56 percent chance of taking a slim lead in the House, while Republicans have a 44 percent chance.Per YouGov's final election model released on Friday, Democrats have a 58 percent chance of taking a slim lead in the House, compared to Republicans' 42 percent chance.If Democrats take control of the chamber, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would likely be elected as Speaker without much delay or party infighting.House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was elected to his seat after four vote sessions that spanned over three weeks last October, has faced pushback from members of his caucus despite having the full support of former President Donald Trump. In the spring, the House rejected a motion to oust Johnson from the speaker chair less than seven months after he was elected to the position.That motion was brought by Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who despite being a close Republican ally of Trump wanted to kick out Johnson after the House passed a Ukraine funding package.","summary":"Politico reported that House Democrats are \"alarmed\" that a speaker won't be selected before Congress certifies the election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-republicans-house-representatives-january-6-1980159","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2512220/democrats-fear-possible-lack-speaker-afterelection.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:48:47","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":262686036,"title":"Pregnant teenager died trying to get help on three trips to Texas ERs","text":"A healthcare policy professor believes that strict abortion laws enacted by Republican states have made pregnant women \"untouchables\" — and have resulted in their deaths. \n\nNevaeh Crain was 18 years old when she died on October 29, 2023. She was pregnant at the time, was suffering from a fever, vomiting, weakness, and intense abdominal pain. \n\nWithin 12 hours, Crain — a Texas resident — had visited two hospital emergency rooms, and was blocked from receiving life-saving treatment both times, according to a report by ProPublica. \n\nAt her first stop doctors diagnosed her with strep throat, but did not address her abdominal pain. A doctor at a second hospital confirmed that she was suffering from sepsis, a potentially deadly reaction to infection. Doctors told her that the six-month-old fetus she was carrying had a heartbeat and dismissed Crain from the hospital. \n\nShe went a third hospital, where an obstetrician insisted on performing two ultrasounds to \"confirm fetal demise,\" according to a nurse's note. After the ultrasounds, she was finally placed in intensive care. \n\nIt was too late; by the time she was receiving appropriate treatment, Crain's blood pressure had tanked and her lips had turned \"blue and dusky,\" according to a nurse's account.\n\nHer organs failed, and she died at 18. \n\nCandace Fails, Crain's mother, told ProPublica that she cannot understand why doctor's refused to treat her daughter's situation like an emergency, but Sara Rosenbaum, a health and law police professor emerita at George Washington University has a theory. \n\nShe was a pregnant woman in a Republican state with strict abortion laws. \n\n“Pregnant women have become essentially untouchables,” she told ProPublica. \n\nIn Governor Greg Abbott's Texas, abortion bans threaten healthcare professionals with prison time if they perform medical interventions that end a fetal heartbeat. While the law does allow for exceptions for lie-threatening conditions, doctors told ProPublica that the murky legal waters surrounding the issue have warped the way their colleagues treat pregnant women. \n\nFor example, they say that pregnant women — like Crain — are bounced from hospital to hospital because health providers are reluctant to provide treatments that could land them in the crosshairs of a conservative prosecutor, according to doctors who spoke with the outlet. \n\nThey described treatment time wasted debating the merits of treatment and creating air-tight documentation, fearing what might happen to them if they become the subject of a criminal complaint. \n\nThat has left pregnant women unable to trust the advice they're receiving from healthcare providers. \n\n“Am I being sent home because I really am OK? \" Dr Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine told ProPublica. \"Or am I being sent home because they’re afraid that the solution to what’s going on with my pregnancy would be ending the pregnancy, and they’re not allowed to do that?”\n\nWhile federal law prohibits emergency room doctors from withholding lifesaving care, Texas has fought hard to change the interpretation of its law. Greg Abbott's Texas has warned doctors that it's state law supersedes the Biden administration's guidance on the federal law. \n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit in 2022 arguing that the federal guidance \"forces hospitals and doctors to commit crimes\" and that it was an \"attempt to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.\" \n\nThe lawsuit was upheld as it moved through federal courts overseen by Donald Trump-nominated judges, until US District Judge James Wesley Hendrix — also a Trump appointee — sided with Paxton. \n\nEarlier this year, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the ruling. The Biden administration has appealed the ruling to the US Supreme Court. \n\nViolating the state law can land health providers in prison for a maximum of 99 years. \n\nThis threat of life-shattering consequences has pressured doctors into walking on egg shells and wasting precious time needed to treat a patient, critics say. Case in point: the nurse who ordered two ultrasounds to confirm \"fetal demise\" before Crain was moved to intensive care. \n\n“This is how these restrictions kill women,” Dr Dara Kass, a former regional director at the Department of Health and Human Services, told the outlet. “It is never just one decision, it’s never just one doctor, it’s never just one nurse.”\n\nHealth providers at Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas and Christus Southeast Texas St Elizabeth, the facilities where Crain was treated, did not answer requests for comment from ProPublica. \n\nThe Independent has asked the providers for comment. \n\nProPublica compiled Crain's medical records and asked a collection of doctors to review the information. All of the doctors who reviewed Crain's information said she never should been allowed to leave after her first hospital visit. \n\n\"She should have never left, never left,\" Elise Boos, an OB-GYN in Tennessee, said after reviewing the information.","summary":"Doctors who spoke to ProPublica and reviewed Crain’s medical information said she should have been treated at the first hospital","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pregnant-teenager-died-texas-ers-b2641336.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/24/22/Abortion_Ohio_70974.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/H7ASAbkM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:48:42","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.739},{"id":262668834,"title":"‘Scares the sh*t out of me’: Albo’s Trump admission","text":"The 2017 video shows the now-Prime Minister’s appearance at a Q&A at Splendour in the Grass when he was serving as Labor’s transport and infrastructure spokesman while in opposition.\n\nAsked how he would “deal with Trump”, Mr Albanese replied: “With trepidation.”\n\nBut pressed further, he expanded his answer.\n\n“Well, you’ve got to deal with who is elected,” he said, six months into Mr Trump’s administration.\n\n“We have an alliance with the US, we’ve got to deal with him, but that doesn’t mean that you’re uncritical about it.\n\n“He (Trump) scares the sh*t out of me and I think it’s of some concern the leader of the free world thinks that you can conduct politics through 140 characters on Twitter overnight.”\n\nAsked if he would say that to Mr Trump’s face, Mr Albanese said he would “probably be more polite than that.”\n\nThe video has resurfaced a day before Americans cast their vote, with the latest election eve polls putting Kamala Harris and Mr Trump neck and neck.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles brushed concerns that Mr Albanese would be unable to work with a Trump White House.\n\n“Look, I think that the Prime Minister has demonstrated in all the work that he has done around the world, in repairing Australia’s standing in the world, in stabilising relationships, in building others, that he is capable of working with anyone,” Mr Marles told reporters in Canberra. \n\n“And I have no doubt that no matter who wins the election in the United States over the coming 24-48 hours, whether we’re talking about a future President Harris or a future President Trump, our Prime Minister will be working very closely with that person, and the alliance will be in good shape.”\n\nIn comments made earlier on Tuesday, Mr Marles said he and Foreign Minister Penny Wong said they had met with Mike Pompeo, tipped to be US secretary of state if Mr Trump wins the election.\n\nMr Marles told the ABC the “meeting did go well”.\n\n“But obviously, whoever is elected as the president of the United States is a matter for the American people,” he said.\n\n“But be it a President Harris or a President Trump, we’re really confident that, firstly, the alliance will be in good shape, but that our critical equities within the alliance will also be maintained. \n\n“And that that includes AUKUS, it includes Australia’s procurement of our future submarines, it includes building a seamless defence industrial base between our two countries.” \n\nMr Marles said the US-Australia alliance and its deep defence ties had bipartisan support in Washington.\n\n“And so I think Australians, as they watch what unfolds over the course of today and tomorrow, can do so with a sense of confidence that no matter who wins, the alliance is in good shape,” he said.","summary":"An old video has resurfaced a day out from the US presidential election showing Anthony Albanese making a bombshell admission about Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/old-video-resurfaces-of-anthony-albanese-saying-donald-trump-scares-the-sht-of-me/news-story/7b4f793a11874a66ee7bf677f0c60d1c?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b7b01471d7416d84ec4337a28f6d1190","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:48:36","author":"Lidia Thorpe","authors":["Lidia Thorpe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.035},{"id":262680434,"title":"About 24 states say they’ll send National Guard troops to DC for vote certification and inauguration","text":"By LOLITA C.

He said it will depend on what the District of Columbia wants, but he noted that the National Guard Bureau and the states are leaning forward in anticipation of a request for assistance.\n\n“We’re here to support D.C. with sustainment, lodging, transportation — anything they need to prepare for this mission,” he said.\n\nOther officials have said it also will depend on intelligence reports assessing the potential threats to the city and the transition of power.\n\nFueling concerns about possible violence are Trump’s claims — without proof — that cheating is already underway in the election. At rally after rally, he has told supporters that the only way he can lose is if Democrats cheat, and he has repeatedly refused to say whether he will accept the results regardless of the outcome.\n\nGuard members have historically provided support for presidential inaugurations, going back to the one for President George Washington.\n\nBut the 2021 event involved an enormous response due to the riot on Jan. 6, which forced lawmakers to flee the Capitol, delaying the certification of the presidential vote for hours. In the days afterward, Guard forces poured into the city by the busload.\n\nIn 2021, a few states declined to send troops, also worried about violence within their own borders and capitals.\n\nDefense officials said Monday that 10 states have activated state Guard members to assist for the election — primarily doing cybersecurity missions. The total number of troops is about 125.\n\nIn addition, nine states and the District of Columbia have put a total of about 120 Guard troops on standby, ready to deploy if needed on Tuesday or in the following days — also mostly for cyber missions and some security.\n\nThose states are Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. Officials said those numbers could change on Election Day as states reassess their needs.","summary":"Guard members have historically provided support for presidential inaugurations.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/11/04/national-guard-vote-certification-inauguration/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP23348657010948.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:46:06","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":262661530,"title":"Rihanna jokes she will use son’s passport to vote in US election","text":"Rihanna has joked that she will “sneak into the polls” and vote with her son’s passport, as she encouraged Americans to vote in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer, who was born in Barbados and has not changed her citizenship, shares two-year-old son Rza and 15-month-old son Riot Rose with US rapper Asap Rocky.\n\nRihanna shared a video of herself looking out of a car window on Instagram, captioning it: “Me trying to sneak into the polls with my son’s passport.”\n\nThe 36-year-old used the hashtag #votecauseicant.\n\nThe Fenty Beauty founder is the latest celebrity to weigh in on the upcoming election, with a host of famous faces throwing their weight behind Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nRolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger said his children would be voting for Ms Harris, in an Instagram post shared before polling day on Tuesday.\n\nAlongside photos of him with six of his eight children, the 81-year-old wrote: “Don’t forget to vote – Jagger kids are voting for Kamala.”\n\nOne photo showed Sir Mick joined by his four daughters – Karis, Jade, Elizabeth and Georgia May – while another saw him with two of his sons James and Lucas.\n\nThe Rolling Stones have previously criticised Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for using their songs You Can’t Always Get What You Want and Start Me Up during his rallies.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Harris has harnessed star power as she focused on battleground states in her bid for the White House with Beyonce, Eminem, Bruce Springsteen and Jennifer Lopez among those to have appeared at her campaign events.\n\nPop superstars including Taylor Swift and Madonna are also among those to throw their support behind her.\n\nThe presidential hopeful appeared as the “mirror image” of herself alongside actress Maya Rudolph, who reprised her role impersonating the vice president, during the show’s cold open.","summary":"The star was born in Barbados and has not changed her citizenship.\n\n\nThe post Rihanna jokes she will use son’s passport to vote in US election appeared first on Jersey Evening Post.","url":"https://www.jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/entertainment/2024/11/05/rihanna-jokes-she-will-use-sons-passport-to-vote-in-us-election/","image":"https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Img39275954.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:43:32","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.381},{"id":262660564,"title":"Seoul shares open lower amid US election uncertainty","text":"South Korean stocks kicked off lower Tuesday as investors were cautious ahead of the US presidential election.\n\nThe benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 18.47 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,570.5 in the first 15 minutes of trading.\n\nOvernight, Wall Street closed lower as investors treaded water ahead of the US presidential election Tuesday (US time), where former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck and neck in the polls.\n\nInvestors' eyes are also on the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting that opens Wednesday, where the Federal Reserve will decide whether to issue another rate cut.\n\nIn Seoul, most big-cap shares started in negative territory.\n\nTech behemoth Samsung Electronics slid 2.39 percent, while its chipmaking rival SK hynix jumped 2.06 percent.\n\nLeading battery maker LG Energy Solution lost 1.41 percent, and its smaller rival Samsung SDI plunged 4.3 percent.\n\nTop automaker Hyundai Motor dropped 1.62 percent, with its sister Kia down 0.72 percent.\n\nMajor South Korean game maker NCSOFT also lost more than 3 percent following a disappointing earnings release the previous day.\n\nAmong the few gainers, bio giant Samsung Biologics increased 0.2 percent, and Korea Zinc, the world's largest smelter in the middle of a management control battle, soared 7 percent.\n\nThe local currency was trading at 1,374.4 won against the US dollar, down 3.5 won from the previous session.

There are really strong laws around foreign interference in elections – you can’t send money, you can’t donate – but it’s absolutely fine to volunteer.\n\n“So we just thought we’d get on a plane, come over here and knock on doors and just do whatever we can to lend a hand.”\n\nBoth fathers of young children, the pair described the election as a pivotal moment in history.\n\n“To us, it doesn’t feel like an act of charity in any way whatsoever, because there’s no-one in the world who isn’t going to be affected by what happens tomorrow,” Mr Cohen said.\n\nMr Glatman, best known as the co-creator and manager of British boyband Blue, told PA: “We were just extremely concerned in the UK.\n\n“We exist under the protection of the American defence umbrella, there’s a lot of rhetoric around that (but) ultimately, it’s the proximity of (Donald) Trump to (Vladimir) Putin that really, really terrifies us.\n\n“That’s terrifying. It is clear where his loyalties lie,” he said, later adding: “The other thing for us is climate, Trump’s stance on climate denial fills us with horror.”\n\nMr Glatman spoke about the “phenomenal camaraderie” of volunteers “united with the same cause” as they all campaign for the Democratic Party.\n\n“We are part of a team that is knocking 2,000 doors a minute, so to be part of this is a real privilege actually, and it’s a total and utter fantastic use of our time,” he said.\n\nThe 49-year-old also said that when their British accent has been noted on the doorstep “there’s been quite a lot of gratitude and it has been quite emotional”.\n\nMr Cohen told PA: “That sense of all being in it together and working hard together and knowing that you’re morally on the right side of things, it’s a fantastic feeling, but people are nervous – it is going to be close.\n\n“The interesting thing is on the other side, we haven’t seen anyone canvassing the streets for Trump, not a single person, and we’ve walked hundreds of streets so far, not seen a single person knocking on doors for Trump.\n\n“We want to feel positive, but the stakes are so high that everyone is also just a bit nervous, waiting to see what happens,” he said.\n\nAfter the “terrible shock” of the 2016 election “there is not complacency” this time around, Mr Cohen said, adding: “No-one is taking anything for granted.”\n\nDuring their days campaigning in Pennsylvania, the pair met governor Josh Shapiro, who was endorsing Anna Thomas running for state representative.\n\nReflecting on the people they had met during their trip, the pair said people are choosing to back Ms Harris following her pledge to support abortion rights after the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion services.\n\n“Yesterday we spoke to a grandmother who was saying, ‘I have to vote for my granddaughters, I have to protect their rights, I have to protect their freedoms, they’re under threat, that’s why I’m doing this, that’s why I’m voting for Kamala’,” Mr Glatman said.\n\n“We had a bit of a moment, it was actually quite emotional, and it really made us realise just how lucky we are.\n\n“I have got two teenage daughters, I feel an enormous amount of allyship with the women of America, as does Jon.\n\n“The abortion issue over here is very, very real, we don’t realise how lucky we are in the UK.”\n\nMs Harris spent her final day before the election in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes offer the largest prize among the states expected to determine the electoral college outcome.","summary":"Dan Glatman and Jon Cohen landed in Pennsylvania on Thursday.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/kamala-harris-british-josh-shapiro-pennsylvania-vladimir-putin-b1191995.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/11/05/00/04230851-6f84a019-1fb1-4161-a31c-6e68f5498a07.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:40:33","author":"Ellie Iorizzo","authors":["Ellie Iorizzo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":262663390,"title":"Trump made MAGA hats a staple of his campaign. More than 2 million are now on the streets","text":"It was a hat slogan that became a movement. \n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump introduced campaign merchandise that would arguably become the most well-known political clothing of modern times. Eight years later, the third iteration of the Trump campaign is still selling millions of red “Make America Great Again” hats a year, and sales have just hit a new milestone. \n\nMore than 2 million MAGA hats have been shipped out by the Trump campaign since the beginning of 2023 – with more than 1,285,000 of those sold between January and October of this year alone, Trump officials told The Independent. \n\nFor old and new Trump supporters, spending $40 to don the red hat is the easiest way to show your admiration for the former president and political affiliation.\n\nMoney will often go to help fund Trump's campaign or election efforts. That means the little red hats have become a huge moneymaker for the former president hoping to win back the White House. \n\nAt rallies, thousands of people show up with their red MAGA hats. During the former president’s Madison Square Garden rally, street vendors attempt to peddle knock-offs to the attendees without the red cap – so they would fit in with the others filling the strets of Manhattan. \n\nIf the MAGA movement had a dress code, the red hat would be the first must-have on the list.\n\n“President Trump is the most iconic presidential candidate in history—from historic rallies filling Madison Square Garden to record-breaking podcasts with giants like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk and over 2 million MAGA hats have been distributed to supporters this cycle,” Taylor Rogers, a Republican National Committee spokesperson said.\n\n“President Trump’s message of hope and his America First agenda resonates with hardworking Americans and their families. The momentum is on our side because voters know Kamala broke our country, and President Trump is the only one who can fix it,” Rogers said.\n\nFor years, Trump has been touting “Make America Great Again” as his slogan. He first thought of it as early as 2012, according to The Washington Post and filed a form to register it with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nThough it seems like a variation of Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign slogan, “Let’s Make America Great Again”, Trump maintained he did not know Reagan used it before unsuccessfully attempting to register it.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign that the public would come to know MAGA.\n\nWeeks after announcing his campaign, Trump met the legal requirement to trademark “Make America Great Again” and since August 16, 2016, the former president’s corporation Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. has owned the rights to it.\n\nFrom the get-go, it was clear the hat was different from other political campaign merchandise. For one, its bright red color and wide shape make it impossible to miss in a crowd.\n\nJared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, once claimed the debut of the hats made the Trump campaign $80,000 per day.\n\nNowadays, it’s impossible to wear a bright red baseball cap without getting stared at. Passing eyes lock eyes with the hat, trying to decipher if the wearer is a Trump supporter or perhaps sporting some sort of ironic variation of the political merchandise.\n\nIt also spread in other merchandise and headwear in all sorts of colors and styles. Recently, Trump has been spotted wearing a black one with gold lettering. \n\nBut, it was ultimately Trump’s own fondness for the hat that encouraged supporters to follow suit. Trump unapologetically wears his MAGA hat on and off the golf course, with or without a suit, president or not.\n\nHe stands by the red MAGA hat with the same conviction he continues to repeat falsehoods about the 2020 election or even that immigrants in Ohio are eating cats and dogs.\n\nThe hat did not become a stain on the Trump legacy, even after thousands of Trump supporters (some wearing the hat) stormed the Capitol on January 6.\n\nIt is ultimately a unifying symbol for those who see Trump as a beacon of light for the future – or the past. Those who feel isolated by the mainstream can find solace in knowing they have an ally just by spotting a bright red baseball cap in a crowd.","summary":"The red baseball cap has become ubiquitous with Donald Trump’s campaign and it hasn’t wavered in popularity","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-campaign-maga-hats-cost-b2641251.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/04/21/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/C3cky5l4-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:40:18","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":262658030,"title":"Will NY's Mondaire Jones have any allies left if he goes back to Congress?","text":"Mondaire Jones, a Democratic former congressmember running in a New York swing district, wants desperately to get back to Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd he’s shown he’s willing to discard his allies to get there.\n\nJones burned the influential New York Working Families Party and his former colleague, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, to better stake a position as a supporter of Israel. He publicly used a gendered expletive that was widely perceived to be directed at Gov. Kathy Hochul as she struggles to improve her own polling numbers.\n\nAnd he attempted to distance himself from President Joe Biden after the president attacked supporters of former President Donald Trump, despite taking credit for signature Biden initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Along with his allegiances, some of his political stances have shifted — presenting Jones as a candidate who rose with the Democratic Party’s tide of progressivism and shifted right, to the party's center.\n\nTo some political observers, it’s the price to pay for victory against a Republican incumbent in a swing district. But to his critics, Jones’ apparent willingness to discard his allies presents a conundrum for him after the election: If he wins, who will be left in his corner?\n\n“I don't know if he will have any friends at the lunch table left,” said former New York state Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou, a progressive who placed second over Jones in the 10th Congressional District primary in New York City in 2022. “He'll probably eat lunch in the bathroom, by himself.”\n\nJones represented an earlier version of the Hudson Valley’s 17th District after his first election in 2020. After new electoral maps made the district less safely Democratic, he moved to Brooklyn to run for a New York City seat in the 2022 midterms. He placed third.\n\nNow back in the Hudson Valley, Jones has been underperforming in the polls against Republican Rep. Mike Lawler in a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by 85,000. The 17th District has become one of the most contested seats of the 2024 House elections. Democrats suffered a humiliating loss there in 2022, when Lawler defeated Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, then the Democratic Campaign Committee chair.\n\nParty strategists have pointed to Maloney’s loss as symbolic of New York’s role in handing control of the House to the Republicans, fomented by a disastrous redistricting process.\n\nJones has blamed the Democrats’ failure in the 17th District on a singular factor — the fact that he was not the nominee in 2022. He has complained about how redistricting played out, saying former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Hochul’s predecessor, would not have let the process go off the rails.\n\n“I want my Democratic governor of New York to be a political animal — I want them to maximize Democratic power,” Jones told the New Yorker in September. “I want my Democratic governor of New York to be Nancy Pelosi, OK? And not some, like, little bitch who is afraid to stick his or her neck out.”\n\nJones added that he was “not talking about any specific person,” and later apologized to Hochul. His campaign did not make him available for this story.\n\nLupe Todd-Medina, a senior adviser on Hochul’s 2022 campaign, balked at Jones’ assessment — Cuomo, too, was accused of laying the groundwork for the botched redistricting — and said that if Jones is struggling now, he should look in the mirror.\n\n“Nobody made you run,” she said. “If you didn't feel confident and you had some previous concerns from years past that you felt were going to impact your candidacy this time around, then maybe you shouldn't have run.\"\n\nJones’ comments put him in tenuous territory with Hochul — and, in one respect, women. At a rally in Tarrytown with U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in late October, he said women galvanized by a desire to protect abortion rights could prove pivotal in his race.\n\n“I'm proud, by the way, to be in a district and a race that will be decided by women,” Jones said, to applause from a crowd of several dozen. “Every day I run into Republicans who say they're voting for me.”\n\nBut Todd-Medina warned of the effect that Jones’ “unsavory” comments — which many people believed to be about Hochul — could have with female voters.\n\n“It's not something you want to hear on the record coming out of the mouth of your chosen candidate,” she said. “That a man would use that term to describe a woman regardless of her being the governor or not — you don't want to hear that.”\n\nHochul was back in the Hudson Valley the weekend before the election to court voters for Hudson Valley Democrats. Rep. Pat Ryan, a Democrat in a competitive race to Jones’ north, broadcast the governor’s appearance in his district. Jones instead posted pictures of himself with her lieutenant governor Antonio Delgado and Westchester County Executive George Latimer, who won his grueling congressional primary this year over Bowman.\n\nJones had recently appeared on the campaign trail in Tarrytown with Hochul, but his team didn’t inform reporters beforehand or broadcast it on social media, as reported by the New York Times. In early September, the governor stumped for him at a bar in Ossining — though Jones did not show up, despite living 20 minutes away, a person present told Gothamist. The Jones campaign did not comment on Hochul's visit.\n\nJones has had the support of national Democrats like Biden in his comeback bid. The president mentioned him in a speech from Irvington this spring, saying Jones “needs to win in November.”\n\nBut when Jones was asked on Friday about a quote in which Biden seemingly called Trump supporters “garbage,” he took the opportunity to criticize the president. “Anybody who is referring to Donald Trump supporters as 'garbage' is completely inappropriately speaking,” Jones said during the last televised debate on PIX11.\n\nThe White House said the comment amounted to a misunderstanding over an apostrophe.\n\nWhen Jones endorsed Latimer during the primary season, the state Working Families Party withdrew its funding and ground support for Jones. The Lawler campaign seized on the development in mailers to Working Families Party voters that were sent out before the June primary, according to photos shared with Gothamist. Jones later lost the party’s line to a mysterious candidate named Anthony Frascone, a former Republican who has been accused of being a GOP plant.\n\nDespite any lingering resentment progressives might feel toward Jones, the Working Families Party is now asking voters to vote in his favor — and against their listed candidate.\n\n“Our folks are knocking doors around the district,” said Jasmine Gripper, codirector of the New York Working Families Party. “And we're talking to what we believe is our base of voters — people who typically vote on the Working Families ballot line — and making sure that they know we're asking them to vote on the Democratic line, and voters are listening.”\n\nJones campaign manager Shannon Geison defended his endorsement of Latimer as a decision with “clear morality” and one he “does not for a second regret.”\n\n“His endorsement did not result in the loss of the Working Families Party line,” Geison said in a statement. “Journalists would do well to cover the stakes in this election, given that Mike Lawler continues to bend the knee to Donald Trump and even attended his recent hate-fest at Madison Square Garden.”\n\nIt’s not only Jones' alliances that have changed during this election cycle. His political positions have shifted as well.\n\nHe was first elected to the district in 2020, when he embraced progressive rallying cries that included calls to “defund the police,” alongside Bowman, who was elected to the neighboring district that same year. Now, facing a more conservative electorate, Jones has attributed his comments to a time before he became an elected official, calling his words “stupid” and not representative of the full scope of his views on the matter.\n\nHe has also recalibrated his stance on the MTA's congestion pricing plan for parts of Manhattan to say he has always been critical of a program without exemptions. He said during his 2022 congressional run in the city that he supported the toll, while calling for \"adequate transportation infrastructure\" in the event there were no exemptions for the program.\n\n“Mondaire Jones, four years ago, he was saying ‘defund the police.’ Now all of a sudden he's claiming that he's this big supporter of the police,” said Paul Bidell, an independent voter from Rockland County who attended a Lawler rally on Thursday. “It feels like, why should I elect a liar?”\n\nJones has faced criticism from constituents for leaving the district — baggage made heavier by his delayed campaign presence in parts of the district, including the Dutchess County portion. Based on events posted on his social media, he only began visiting there in early October.\n\nStill, Democrats who feel the pull of national headwinds — a presidential election where former Trump is yet again the Republican nominee, now in the aftermath of the overturning of Roe v. Wade — say there’s more at stake than any one candidate for Congress.\n\nAlyse Alper, who on a recent Sunday attended a candidate breakfast by her shul that included both congressional candidates, said she felt strongly about abortion rights, gun control and other Democratic priorities. She said she supported Jones for those reasons.\n\n“He’s changed his positions, but … I have a very hard time voting for somebody who supports Donald Trump and his views and his actions and his thoughts,” Alper said, in a nod to Lawler. “So I have to go for Jones.”\n\nJon Campbell and Brigid Bergin contributed reporting.","summary":"Mondaire Jones stands at the podium during a recent forum.\n\n\n  \n\nThe former congressmember has shown that he will do whatever it takes to win in the Hudson Valley, including throwing his friends under the bus.

But since arriving in the United States, he said he’s witnessed rising anti-immigrant hostility and was alarmed by the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington, D.C.\n\n“I thought it would be a lot more stable here,” said Peña, 26, who lives in Corona and has protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. “But just seeing how in a matter of these years, we had an attempted coup, it's unreal.”\n\nTuesday will mark the end of a 2024 campaign where the migrant crisis and immigrants were prominently featured in both national and local candidate commercials, position platforms and general discourse, sometimes in crude and xenophobic terms.\n\nFor many on the receiving end of the negative attention, there will be no immediate opportunity to answer back as non-citizens are ineligible to vote in U.S. elections. But naturalized citizens make up a record 1 in 10 eligible voters, and their views could be pivotal in some key races.\n\nThe presidential race especially has left a mark with immigrant New Yorkers on the sidelines, as well as those who will cast votes.\n\n“I can't help but feel a lot of dread,” Bella, an immigrant and green card recipient from Canada whose family is originally from Eastern Europe, said of the election. The Brooklyn resident asked that her last name not be used due to fear of retribution from immigration officials.\n\nBella said that when she received her green card she got a notice from immigration authorities that they would monitor her social media activity.\n\n“That kind of sent the message to me that I'm not supposed to be talking about politics,” she said.\n\nThe presidential campaign of Republican Donald Trump has repeatedly invoked anti-immigrant language and ideas from the very start, and hasn’t let up since. At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump promised to launch “the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.”\n\nThe former president previously told supporters that immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country,” drawing immediate criticism from Democrats who said the phrase echoed the words of Adolf Hitler.\n\nMore recently, Trump and his vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance made false claims that Haitian immigrants ate dogs. Trump attributed Mayor Eric Adams’ federal indictment woes to Adams' complaints about the Biden administration’s handling of the migrant crisis, which has brought some 220,000 migrants to the city since 2022. And at Trump's campaign rally at Madison Square Garden last month, a speaker referred to Puerto Rico, whose residents are U.S. citizens, as a “floating island of garbage.”\n\nIn recent days, U.S. officials have charged that “Russian influence actors” have amplified Trump's false claims about non-citizens voting by circulating a fake video showing a Haitian man claiming to have voted multiple times in Georgia.\n\nBut Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has also gained notice from local immigrants for promising tough action to secure the border. And congressional candidates from both sides of the political aisle have pledged the same tough stand against migrants, responding to polls putting immigration at the top of voters’ concerns.\n\nPolling in the final days before the election indicate that voters from immigrant communities broadly support Harris.\n\nAccording to the National Hispanic Voters Public Opinion Survey conducted in October by Florida International University, Harris leads 57% to 33% among Latino voters. And 66% of Asian American voters intend to cast their ballot for Harris, versus 28% for Trump, according to a September survey by the group AAPI Data. Among Indian Americans, Harris leads 60% to 31%, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nBut recent polling reveals a “stark gender gap,” with rising support for Trump among men, especially men under the age of 40.\n\nNathaly Rubio-Torio, executive director of Queens-based nonprofit Voces Latinas, said a great deal is at stake in this election for immigrant communities, including the tens of thousands of new arrivals who remain in New York City after the recent influx of migrants.\n\n“It's a very important election,” Rubio-Torio said, “because what's been put in place to help these people apply for work authorization, apply for asylum, just get a chance to stay legally in the country and work for themselves and support themselves is at risk.”\n\nFor some immigrants, the ratcheting up of anti-immigrant rhetoric has been alarming.\n\nBella said she knew a number of Haitian Americans and pointed to the false claims propagated by the Trump campaign that Haitian immigrants in Ohio, many of whom are settled there with legal permanent status, were eating neighborhood dogs.\n\n“That had such a profound effect on Haitian immigrants, not only in Springfield, Ohio, but everywhere in this country,” she said. “I can see that people really take political talking points and they use it for violence.”\n\nDespite that misinformation, voter fraud by citizens and non-citizens is exceedingly rare, including in New York, according to election monitoring groups.\n\n“Voter impersonation is virtually nonexistent,” said the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School, “and many instances of alleged fraud are, in fact, mistakes by voters or administrators.”\n\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation listed 26 election fraud cases in New York between 1983 and 2023. These include that of Jason Schofield, a Republican elections commissioner for Rensselaer County Board of Elections in Troy, New York, who in 2023 pleaded guilty to voter fraud.\n\nIn New York City, the Queens district attorney in July announced the indictment six people who allegedly submitted fraudulent absentee ballot applications during the 2023 City Council primary race in District 20.\n\nWhile an array of poll results show immigrants lining up behind Harris, some take issue with the vice president’s promise to fight for “strong border security.”\n\nPeña, the Corona resident, noted that Trump had jokingly said he’d gift Harris with a MAGA hat, “because she's basically saying the same stuff that he said in 2016.”\n\nIt was “heartbreaking,\" Peña added, \"to understand that no matter who wins, there's still going to be pain.”","summary":"For many on the receiving end of the negative attention, there will be no immediate opportunity to answer back, but naturalized citizens now represent 1 in 10 eligible U.S. voters.

Mike Lawler of New York’s Hudson Valley and Tom Kean of New Jersey.\n\nThe PAC put another $900,000 behind Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro, a first-term representative fighting to hang onto a sprawling New York swing district stretching from the Catskills to Ithaca.\n\nIt’s all part of America PAC’s massive nationwide canvassing campaign, which has paid for thousands of hourly workers making upward of $30 an hour to knock on doors and encourage voters to support former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\nThat effort — which has cost $169 million so far and has been funded mostly by Musk himself — has largely focused on the presidential race in swing states. But Musk’s PAC has put about $20 million of the total toward 15 tight congressional races, including the two in New York and one in New Jersey, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nRepresentatives for the PAC couldn’t be reached for comment. New York’s Republican Party has openly touted the involvement of the Tesla and SpaceX owner, buoyed by an FEC advisory opinion from March that opened the door to outside groups collaborating with federal candidates and political parties on certain canvassing efforts.\n\nAmerica PAC’s work “is proving invaluable and we are thrilled to be partnering with Mr. Musk and his team to defend our majority-making U.S. House delegation to ensure that President Trump returns to Washington with Republican majorities in Congress,” said David Laska, a spokesperson for the New York state GOP.\n\nIn total, Musk’s PAC has spent more than $4.5 million on the three races that could be crucial in determining whether Democrats or Republicans take control of the House in January. The bulk of that money — more than $2.7 million — has gone toward the door-to-door canvassing effort. A chunk of the money has also gone toward digital advertising.\n\nSo far, America PAC has spent $1.7 million total on Lawler’s race against former Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones in a district that includes all of Rockland and Putnam counties and part of Westchester and Dutchess counties. It's the most the PAC has spent on any one district in the country.\n\nThe PAC has spent slightly less in Kean's and Molinaro’s districts — $1.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Kean is facing a challenge from Democrat Sue Altman, while Molinaro is locked in a rematch with Democratic attorney Josh Riley.\n\nMolinaro's and Lawler’s campaigns declined to discuss America PAC’s work, instead pointing to their own canvassing efforts. Both candidates claimed their teams knocked on 250,000 doors each within their respective districts.\n\nDemocrats pounced on America PAC’s spending in New York, relishing the chance to tie the Republican candidates to the richest person in the world.\n\n“Mike Lawler and Marc Molinaro relying on a right-wing billionaire who has dangerously peddled antisemitism at every turn tells you everything you need to know: Lawler['s] and Molinaro’s loyalties are to extremists, not New York families,” said Ellie Dougherty, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, referencing some of Musk’s posts on X, the social media platform he owns.\n\nAmerica PAC’s canvassing strategy has faced criticism — and at least two class-action lawsuits — in other states.\n\nIn California, workers filed suit against the PAC in a dispute over wages, while workers in Michigan claim they were threatened and transported in the back of a U-Haul truck without seats, according to Wired. In Pennsylvania, Philadelphia’s district attorney is alleging the PAC’s controversial promise to award $1 million a day to swing-state voters violates the law.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, have their own sophisticated door-knocking program. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul raised more than $5 million to help fund 37 field offices staffed with 93 employees and 200 “youth fellows” on college campuses to reach voters in a handful of key swing districts across the state.\n\nAn outside group, Battleground New York, has spent more than $6 million so far focused on mailers, phone banks and door-to-door canvassing to elect Democrats. The organization, funded in part by labor unions, says it has 274 canvassers in four key districts across the state, including Molinaro’s and Lawler’s.\n\nIn a memo this week summarizing its work this election cycle, Battleground New York said its strategy has been focused on engaging voters in person — knowing that other outside PACs would be spending big on ads blanketing the airwaves.\n\nThe group views itself as “New York’s first true statewide voter engagement” effort, “like those that have become a staple in other battleground states,” according to the memo.","summary":"Elon Musk&#39;s PAC has funneled big money for Republicans into three tight congressional races in New York and New Jersey.\n\n\n  \n\nMusk&#39;s America PAC has spent $1.7 million on Rep.

I’m Dick Van Dyke,” the “Marry Poppins” star began the black-and-white video. “You may remember I used to sing and dance and fall down a lot, actually.”\n\nDespite turning 99 in December, Van Dyke was full of energy and enthusiasm as he set the scene for his endorsement.\n\n“50 years ago — May 31st, 1964 — I was on the podium with Dr. Martin Luther King, who was addressing some 60,000 people in the Colosseum in LA and I was there to read a message written by Rod Serling, the guy who wrote ‘Twilight Zone,'” he said.\n\n“I got it out the other day and I think it means as much today — if not more — than it did then, so if you don’t mind, I’d like to read it.”\n\nVan Dyke, who wore a polo shirt and glasses, then read a short section of the original address, which Serling titled at the time, “A Most Non-Political Speech.”\n\n“Hatred is not the norm. Prejudice is not the norm. Suspicion, dislike, jealousy [and] scapegoating…. none of those are the transcendent facets of the human personality,” he recited. \n\n“They are diseases. They are the cancers of the soul. They are the infectious and contagious viruses that have been breeding humanity for years,” he continued. \n\n“And because they have been and because they are, is it necessary that they shall be?” he asked. “I think not.”\n\nAs long as there is “one voice left to say ‘welcome’ to a stranger,” “one hand outstretched to say ‘enter and share'” and “one mind remaining to think a thought of warmth and friendship” then there is still hope for humanity, according to Serling and Van Dyke. \n\nThe “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” star believes there is “essential decency,” “basic goodness” and “preeminent dignity” in everyone — even if we don’t always act on it. \n\n“There will be moments of violence and expressions of hatred and an ugly echo of intolerance, but these are the clinging vestiges of a decayed past, not the harbingers of the better, cleaner future,” he recited. \n\n“To those who tell us that the inequality of the human animal is a necessary evil, we must respond by simply saying that first, it is evil but it is not necessary,” he continued. “We prove it, sitting here tonight in 1964. We prove it by reaffirming our faith. We prove it by having faith in our affirmations.”\n\nVan Dyke closed out the speech by reciting a quote from Horace Mann, which read, “Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity. I’d like to paraphrase that tonight. ‘Let us be ashamed to live without that victory.'”\n\nWhile the actor noted that “a lot has happened” since he first read the passage 50 years ago, much has also remained the same.\n\n“It’s not what Martin Luther King dreamed of but it’s a start,” he concluded. “Thank you and God bless.”\n\nAlthough Van Dyke did not explicitly mention Harris in his video, he tagged the Vice President and her official campaign page in his caption. \n\n“VOTE!!!” he wrote.","summary":"The \"Mary Poppins\" star, 98, recited an old speech from Rod Serling — first read in 1964 — while endorsing Harris on Instagram Monday night.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/11/04/entertainment/dick-van-dyke-98-makes-rare-appearance-on-social-media-to-endorse-kamala-harris-for-president/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/93043394.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0CdfEHyd-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:39:43","author":"Nicki Cox","authors":["Nicki Cox"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.23},{"id":262677552,"title":"Shooting threat made against Detroit polling location: Police","text":"The threat was made over the phone on Monday against a polling location under 10 miles from downtown Detroit, on the 21600 block of West Seven Mile Road, the Detroit Police Department said in comments to the Washington Examiner. \n\n“The location is on special attention,” a spokesperson for the DPD’s media relations department added. \n\nThe DPD’s cyber crimes division is currently handling the investigation into the incident, which was reported by the Detroit Free Press as a “shooting” threat. \n\nHolding over half a million registered voters, Detroit will play a crucial role in determining which presidential candidate carries Michigan and likely the election on Tuesday.

Bennett, CQ-Roll Call\n\nWASHINGTON — Voters who have not yet cast ballots will head to the polls Tuesday, bringing one of the most wild and vitriolic presidential races in American history to an end — the campaigning at least, but perhaps not the legal battles.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the Democratic and Republican nominees, continued campaigning Monday in a contest that the latest polls suggest could be among the closest outcomes ever. True to the tone of their truncated race since late July, they both continued to plead for votes by warning as much about their opponent as trying to sell their own ideas.\n\n“We want to go to Mars and all,” Trump said Monday at a rally in Raleigh, N.C., before minutes later slamming President Joe Biden over terminating a permit for the XL Pipeline on his first day in office. “What I want it for is defense. … You’ve got to be in space. … We were being lapped by China. They’ve got a lot of stuff up there.” It was the latest example of what Trump refers to as “the weave,” his own distinct, if meandering, set of exhortations.\n\nHarris, on the flip side, mostly stuck to her stump speech at stop after stop, reprising lines even in interviews.\n\nIssues like the economy and the nixing of federal abortion rights protections by the Supreme Court’s six conservative justices have long been among voters’ top issues, according to polling data and reporting. But evidence suggests other factors in recent days and weeks would also play a major role.\n\nAfter some positive October polling data points for Trump, surveys released over the weekend suggest any momentum for him has stalled.\n\nVegas Insider, an oddsmaker, dropped his chances of winning over the weekend. “While Trump still holds the lead, the sudden drop over the weekend — from 64.49 percent to 58.49 percent — suggests that confidence may be waning among bettors,” a spokesperson said in a Monday statement. “Meanwhile, Harris’s surge by 5 points to 45.85 percent highlights her growing momentum, making this a tighter race than before.”\n\nHere is a snapshot of the issues and factors that should tip the election.\n\nKeystone ‘collar counties’\n\nAll eyes have been on Pennsylvania for months, even before Biden ended his bid for a second term.\n\nThe most recent polls in the Keystone State showed a dead heat, with a New York Times polling average updated Monday putting Trump narrowly ahead, 49 percent to 48 percent. During a Roll Call reporting trip to Bucks County, a Philadelphia suburb won by Democrats the last two elections, interviews were split, with voters describing their home as “divided” and split “50-50.”\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said in a telephone interview that “I’d rather be Harris than Trump right now,” adding: “She has the better ground game and more energy, and she certainly has more growth potential than Trump.”\n\nWith Trump likely to again take most of the state’s rural counties, Dent said the main counties to watch are the “collar counties” that wrap around Philadelphia, and “Bucks, in particular.” But also, in a twist, the City of Brotherly Love, too.\n\n“From what I’m seeing and hearing, it’s likely Harris won’t come out as strong in Philadelphia because of some erosion with Black and Latino voters from where [Hillary Clinton] was and where Biden was,” Dent said. “She’s going to win Philadelphia big. But the question is: Will it be big enough to offset Trump’s totals in all those red counties? She really needs those ‘collar counties.’”\n\n‘Whether the women like it or not’\n\nDuring a rally last week, Trump dropped another comment that could alienate women voters — a key voting bloc his campaign aides want to appeal to, but which the candidate has publicly said is not a problem.\n\nPolls show a clear gender gap.\n\nTrump last week vowed to “protect” women “whether the women like it or not.” The topic has been at the forefront of politics particularly since the 2022 decision by the Supreme Court to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion. All three of Trump’s nominees to the high court voted to overturn that right. The issue is a big part of Harris’ campaign theme of “freedom,” which also refers to her warnings about Trump having “unchecked” power, if elected again, that he would use to erode Americans’ freedoms.\n\nA New York Times-Siena College survey released Sunday showed a widening gender gap. Harris had a healthy lead among women, 56 percent to 40 percent, while Trump led 55 percent to 39 percent among men.\n\n“The economy probably registers as the top issue for most voters,” Dent said. “But it really does seem like abortion might be the top motivating issue when it comes to actually going out to vote, especially for women.”\n\nLate deciders\n\nA senior Harris campaign official on Friday told reporters its internal polling was showing “new votes” showing up for the vice president.\n\nThe more-confident tone was based on voters who are deciding in the race’s final days, the senior official said.\n\nAnd rather than stick to his campaign’s economy- and immigration-heavy script on the teleprompters at his rallies, Trump has provided headlines with some of his riffs.\n\n“I shouldn’t have left, I mean, honestly,” Trump said Sunday during a rally at a small airport in Lititz, Pa., adding before cutting himself off: “We did so well, we had such a great…”\n\nOn Monday, he told a Raleigh, N.C., crowd that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi was “crazy” and “could have gone to jail” for ripping up her copy of his State of the Union address at the conclusion of his February 2020 speech in the House chamber.\n\nEconomic anxiety\n\nOne of the issues hamstringing Harris is the economy. The White House has pointed to consistent indicators that show a healthy and growing U.S. economy.\n\nBut voters have largely not bought that, and Trump begins many events by asking the crowd if they are better off than four years ago.\n\nThe economy was the top issue for 24 percent of likely voters, according to the most recent Times-Siena poll, with abortion next at 18 percent and immigration at 15 percent. The economy also was the top issue for likely voters in all the battleground states, followed by abortion — except in Arizona, where immigration was second.\n\n“Trump has won the messaging battle in October,” Ford O’Connell, a GOP strategist, said during a telephone interview. “She’s not talking about issues she wants to talk about.

Japan’s Defense Ministry said the missiles were believed to have already landed at sea and there were no immediate reports of damages.\n\nThe launch came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the U.S. mainland. In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force. That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister, who on Tuesday accused the North’s rivals of raising tensions with “aggressive and adventuristic military threats.”\n\nThe latest launches came after South Korean officials said the North was likely to dial up its military displays around the U.S. presidential elections to command the attention of Washington. South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.\n\nOutside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions such as sanctions relief after a new U.S. president is elected. \n\nThere are widespread views that Kim would prefer a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, with whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, seeing him as a more likely counterpart to give him what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigning, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim, while Harris said she won’t “cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.”\n\nNorth Korean state media claimed last week that the Hwasong-19 it tested on Oct. 31 was “the world’s strongest” ICBM, but experts say the solid-fuel missile was too big to be useful in a war situation. Experts say the North has yet to acquire some critical technologies to build a functioning ICBM, such as ensuring that the warhead survives the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry.\n\nTensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years as Kim has repeatedly flaunted his expanding nuclear weapons and missile programs, while reportedly providing Russia with munitions and troops to support President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, North Korea was estimated to have moved a total of between 10,000 and 12,000 troops to Russia. If they start fighting against Ukraine forces, it would mark North Korea’s first participation in a large-scale conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that as many as 10,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia’s Kursk region near Ukraine’s border and preparing to join Moscow’s fight against Ukraine in the coming days. That’s up from the 8,000 troops that the U.S. government mentioned Thursday.\n\nAfter a meeting in Seoul on Monday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, expressed “deep concern” over the possibility that Russian transfers any nuclear or ballistic missile-related technology to the North in exchange for its arms and military personnel.\n\nSuch transfers would “jeopardize the international non-proliferation efforts and threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and across the globe,” they said, while calling on North Korea and Russia to immediately withdraw the troops from Russia.\n\nIn response to North Korea’s growing nuclear threats, South Korea, the United States and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and updating their nuclear deterrence plans built around U.S. strategic assets. \n\nNorth Korea has portrayed the joint military drills of its rivals as rehearsals for an invasion and used them to justify its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles. \n\nAt a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, North Korea’s ambassador, Kim Song, defended Pyongyang’s nuclear and ICBM programs as essential for the country’s self-defense and a necessary response to what it perceives as nuclear threats from the United States. He stressed that North Korea will accelerate the build-up of “our nuclear force that can counter any threat presented by hostile nuclear weapon states.”\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood warned that the U.S. cannot stand back from North Korea’s expanding nuclear and ballistic missile programs and the growing threat to U.S. security “without a response.”\n\nWood also repeated last week’s call for Russia to say whether there are North Korean troops on the ground in Russia. “We’re not in a court here,” Russia’s deputy ambassador Anna Evstigneeva replied, “and the questions of the United States, in the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Edith M.

It was carrying two Russian Ionosphere-M Earth observation satellites and several dozen smaller satellites, including the two Iranian ones.\n\nIran’s two satellites, named Kowsar and Hodhod, were the first launched on behalf of the country’s private sector. In 2022, a Russian rocket launched an Iranian Earth observation satellite called Khayyam that was built in Russia on Tehran’s order, and in February Russia put another Iranian satellite named Pars-1 into orbit. \n\nTuesday's launch comes as Russia and Iran have expanded ties in various spheres. Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of exploding drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine and helped launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine’s infrastructure.\n\nMoscow and Tehran are planning to further bolster their ties with a “comprehensive strategic partnership” that is set to be signed during Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s planned visit to Russia. The date for that visit hasn’t been set yet, but the Kremlin said it could happen soon.\n\nTuesday’s successful launch of the Iranian satellites atop a Russian rocket follows a series of failed launches suffered by Iran’s civilian space program in recent years. There have been five failed launches in a row for the Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket.\n\nA fire at the Imam Khomeini Spaceport in February 2019 killed three researchers, authorities said at the time. A launchpad rocket explosion later that year drew the attention of then-President Donald Trump, who taunted Iran with a tweet showing what appeared to be a U.S. surveillance photo of the site.\n\nAt the same time, a separate Iranian space program run by the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has seen successful launches from a military base outside of Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) east of the capital, Tehran. However, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show Israel likely bombed the site during its Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on Iran.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community’s worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran’s development of satellite launch vehicles “would shorten the timeline” for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology.\n\nIntercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for “several” nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned.\n\nIran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.","summary":"A Russian rocket has blasted off successfully to carry a pair of Iranian satellites into orbit, a launch that reflected growing cooperation between Moscow and Tehran","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russian-rocket-launches-iranian-satellites-orbit-moscow-tehran-115489233","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/62e6675c-ac09-43d7-8447-f21633e37890/wirestory_944a6bc87aa2511e38acf58e37c02c28_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 00:38:14","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":262677554,"title":"How the Libertarian presidential candidate could be a spoiler for Trump","text":"But those signs drifted away with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s withdrawal from the race, and voters are now left with few options other than Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut one of those options is the Libertarian Party’s candidate for president: Chase Oliver. And he has the potential, along with Green Party candidate Jill Stein, to spoil a state win for either Harris or Trump.\n\nOliver is just 39 years old, the youngest of the major third-party candidates. He’s from Atlanta and ran there twice as a House candidate in 2020, then a Senate candidate in 2022.\n\nOliver reached national prominence with his role in his latter run, in which he received 2% of the vote in the Senate race between then-candidates Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker. He debated, without Walker, against Warnock in a face-off hosted by Georgia Public Broadcast in October, gaining him additional exposure.\n\nOliver’s 2% ultimately helped force a runoff in the Senate election when neither candidate reached 50% of the vote. Warnock would go on to win.\n\nOliver now has a similar “spoiler” role in the 2024 presidential election. While he has had minimal funding for his presidential campaign — Oliver has raised just under $450,000 for his campaign — at least one Democratic group has reportedly spent significant funds to boost him in hopes that voters will see him as an alternative to Trump.\n\nCivic Truth Action has pushed Oliver to the tune of more than $1.5 million in YouTube ads touting him as a “true conservative” who wants to abolish the income tax, not dissimilar from a platform Trump has taken verbally. The super PAC’s largest backer is the Democratic-owned Evidence for Impact.\n\nWhile Stein is generally thought to take votes away from Harris’s progressive and far-left flank, Oliver could chip away at Trump’s support from libertarian-aligned voters. It wouldn’t be the first time Trump has been hurt by a libertarian candidate in the presidential election.\n\nIn 2020, Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen drew more support than President Joe Biden’s margin of victory in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Jorgensen received her highest vote totals, all above 2% of the vote, in eight different Republican-won states. Some libertarian ideals, like no income tax and minimal gun regulation, appeal to conservatives.\n\nOliver could serve to spoil Georgia, a slight Republican-leaning state, for Trump. A recent New York Times poll of Georgia showed him nabbing 2% support in the state, causing a 46%-46% tie between Harris and Trump.\n\nGeorgia could be where Oliver makes his largest impact. He’d likely draw support away from Trump, and a Harris win in the state makes it much more difficult for the Republican to win the election.","summary":"The 2024 presidential election showed signs earlier this year that a third-party candidate could make noise.

And then whatever portion they can pay. Now, some of the families here pay $50,\" he said, adding that they will then owe the rest at a high interest rate to the gangs. He said the discovery showed the lack of a human element of what the smugglers were dealing with. \"It's never been this brazen to where really when you read through this, and you translate it, it’s numbers on a page. There's a complete lack of humanity in this document,\" he said. \"When you read a document and it's names of children and their ages, and you start seeing monetary value next to them, you know, it's a reality we live through, but the American public don't understand how human lives are commoditized,\" he said. Booyens stressed how migrants who are brought in are not then left by the cartels but are tracked, and will be forced to pay back the money they owe, whether that be through prostitution or other forms of labor. If they don’t check in, they or their family members in their home country could be at risk of violence. \"The traffickers know where they are. They have a ledger on them, and they check in. They check in like you do with a parole officer because they are fearful for their family's lives back home, and they pay a debt. They have a debt to pay, so the system is very organized from that perspective,\" he said.

And he's going to collect,’\" he said. Smuggling has increased with the crisis at the southern border. The Biden administration has targeted transnational organizations who are bringing migrants in, often working with Mexico to crack down on the smuggling. But critics have said they have incentivized activity with \"open borders\" policies. In terms of what can be done to stop the smuggling, Booyens noted a \"vicious\" demand cycle for children from Americans. But he said that the laws of the U.S. must also be followed to stop incentivizing migrants. \"We got to just start with just letting the law be the law,\" he said. \"We have immigration law, albeit it needs reform. Yes, but we do have law, and the law has been abandoned.\" Booyens spoke just days before the presidential election, where border security and immigration reform have been top issues for voters.
