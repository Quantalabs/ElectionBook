Musk has used his social network, X, to call for a new election and demand Starmer be imprisoned. On Monday he posted an online poll for his 210 million followers on the proposition: “America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.”\n\nAsked about Musk’s comments during a question session at a hospital near London, Starmer criticised “those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible,” particularly opposition Conservative politicians in Britain who have echoed some of Musk’s claims.\n\nMusk often posts on X about the UK, retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir -– shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has “two-tier policing” with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators.\n\nRecently Musk has focused on child sexual abuse, particularly a series of cases that rocked northern England towns in which groups of men, largely from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of girls. The cases have been used by far-right activists to link child abuse to immigration, and to accuse politicians of covering up the “grooming gangs” out of a fear of appearing racist.\n\nMusk has posted a demand for a public inquiry into the cases. An inquiry was held under the previous Conservative government, though many of the recommendations it made in 2022 have yet to be implemented.\n\nMusk also has accused Starmer of failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England’s director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013.\n\nAnswering questions after a speech near London, Starmer defended his record as chief prosecutor, saying he had reopened closed cases and “changed the whole prosecution approach” to child sexual exploitation.\n\nHe also condemned language used by Musk about Jess Phillips, a government minister responsible for combating violence against women and girls. Musk called Phillips a “rape genocide apologist” and said she deserved to be in prison.\n\n“When the poison of the far-right leads to serious threats to Jess Phillips and others, then in my book, a line has been crossed,” Starmer said. “I enjoy the cut and thrust of politics, the robust debate that we must have, but that’s got to be based on facts and truth, not on lies.”\n\nMusk has also called for the release of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right activist who goes by the name Tommy Robinson and is serving a prison sentence for contempt of court.\n\nStarmer said people “cheerleading Tommy Robinson... are trying to get some vicarious thrill from street violence that people like Tommy Robinson promote”.\n\nStarmer largely avoided mentioning Musk by name in his responses, likely wary of giving him more of a spotlight — or of angering Musk ally Donald Trump, who is due to be inaugurated as US president on Jan 20.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, another target of the X owner’s ire, has taken a similar approach. Scholz said he is staying “cool” over critical personal comments made by Musk, but finds it worrying that the US billionaire makes the effort to get involved in a general election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n\nStarmer said the main issue was not Musk’s posts on X, but “what are politicians here doing to stand up for our democracy?”\n\nHe said he was concerned about Conservative politicians in Britain “so desperate for attention they are amplifying what the far right are saying.”\n\n“Once we lose the anchor that truth matters … then we are on a very slippery slope,” he said.\n\nWhile some Conservatives, including party leader Kemi Badenoch, have echoed Musk’s points, the main UK beneficiary of his interest has been Reform UK, the hard-right party led by Nigel Farage that has just five seats in the 650-seat House of Commons but big expansion plans. Farage said last month that Musk was considering making a multimillion-dollar donation to the party.\n\nBut Farage is critical of Tommy Robinson, refusing to let him join Reform, and on Sunday Musk posted: “The Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn’t have what it takes.”\n\nFarage tweeted in response: “Well, this is a surprise! Elon is a remarkable individual but on this I am afraid I disagree.”","url":"https://www.dailypioneer.com/2025/world/starmer-slams----lies-and-misinformation----after-attacks-from-elon-musk.html","image":"https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 01:02:13","author":"Daily Pioneer","authors":["Daily Pioneer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.162},{"id":279100780,"title":"Tërhiqet Zuckerberg, njofton heqjen e kontrolluesve në Facebook dhe Instagram: Të rikthejmë lirinë e shprehjes!","text":"CEO i Meta, Mark Zuckerberg po planifikon të bëjë ndryshime në Facebook dhe Instagram me qëllimin e “rivendosjes së shprehjes së lirë në platformat tona”.\n\nNdryshimet do të implementohen në SHBA dhe sipas Mark Zuckerberg kjo lëvizje e re do të lejonte rrjetin social të kthehet në rrënjët e saj rreth shprehjes së lirë.

In Tuesday's ruling, she temporarily blocked the release of Smith's report while an appeals court considers Smith's challenge to her dismissal and makes a decision about how to handle the report.What To KnowLisa Rubin, a former litigator and MSNBC legal correspondent, criticized Cannon's ruling, telling MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Cannon had \"no basis\" to issue it.\"As you noted, Judge Cannon ruled today that she is going to impose a stay on the release of any special counsel report. And according to her order today, that not only applies to the report itself, but also to any information contained in that report,\" Rubin said. \"And in both instances, she says Jack Smith, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Department of Justice employees and agents and those of the special counsel's office are precluded from sharing either the report or any information contained therein.\"Rubin added that, in theory, that means Smith can't share information about his findings with the appeals court weighing his challenge to Cannon's dismissal.\"It's not clear to folks like me, Andrea, whether she has that jurisdiction,\" Rubin said.She added: \"That's because earlier this year, she threw out the Mar-a-Lago documents case, explaining that from her reasoning, Jack Smith did not have constitutional authority to bring that prosecution under the appointments clause of the Constitution. And so there is no basis here to block the report, in part because it's not clear that there's a case or controversy in front of her.\"Smith quickly appealed Cannon's dismissal of the classified documents case after she tossed it out over the summer. The special counsel ultimately dropped the appeal where Trump was concerned after Trump won the election, but he's still pursuing it with respect to Trump's codefendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira.Both the president-elect and his former codefendants have asked for the report not to be released. Trump's lawyers made the request in a letter to Garland this week and Nauta and De Oliveira asked both Cannon and the appeals court to stop the report's release, arguing that it could unfairly prejudice them if their cases move forward.What People Are SayingTrump weighed in on Cannon's ruling and the report at a news conference: \"It'll be a fake report just like it was a fake investigation.\"Norman Ornstein, an emeritus scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote on X: \"Joe Biden has immunity. He should ignore what partisan hack Aileen Cannon just did and release the Smith report immediately.\"Robert Reich, the former U.S. Secretary of Labor and a fervent Trump critic, wrote on X: \"Judge Aileen Cannon was appointed by Donald Trump. It was Judge Cannon who dismissed Trump's classified documents case. Now she's trying to block Jack Smith from releasing a final report summarizing findings from his investigations into Trump. See how the MAGA world works?\"What Happens NextCannon wrote Tuesday that her order will be in effect until three days after the appeals court rules on the request to block the report's release.Rubin offered a theory on that timeline, telling Mitchell: \"One possibility is that the 11th Circuit doesn't sit again until next week, starting on the 14th of next week and going through the 17th. Could it be that she is trying to impose a stay that will last beyond the time at which Donald Trump is inaugurated?

Awesome country.”\n\nTrump jr said his father “says hello to everyone in Greenland”.\n\nTrump’s extraordinary statement came as he further outlined an expansionist agenda, less than two weeks before he is sworn into office at the January 20 inauguration in Washington DC.\n\nHe reiterated an apparent interest in making Canada into a US state and criticised US spending on Canadian goods and military support for Canada, one of the country’s closest allies.\n\nTrump suggested he would impose tariffs on Denmark if it resisted his offer to buy Greenland, which he said was vital to US national security.\n\nDenmark has said Greenland is not for sale.\n\nTrump also vowed to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and repeated his promise to impose significant tariffs on Mexico and Canada.\n\nOn Monday, Trump said in a social media post he had heard the people of Greenland were “MAGA”.\n\n“Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation.\n\n“We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nGreenland’s permanent secretary for foreign affairs, Mininnguaq Kleist, said Trump jr had scheduled no meetings with representatives of the Greenlandic government.\n\n“We have not been briefed on the nature of his program, and therefore this is a private visit,” Kleist said.\n\nA source familiar with the trip told Reuters that Trump jr was planning a one-day visit to shoot video content for a podcast and that he would not meet any government officials or political figures.\n\nGreenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark with a population of just 57,000, boasts mineral, oil and natural gas wealth.\n\nBut development has been slow, leaving its economy reliant on fishing and annual subsidies from Denmark.\n\nThe capital, Nuuk, is closer to New York than the Danish capital, Copenhagen.\n\n“Greenland is open and those who wish to visit us are welcome,” Greenland’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.\n\nPresident-elect Trump said his son and representatives were going to visit “some of the most magnificent areas and sights”.\n\nTrump also expressed interest in buying Greenland during his 2017-2021 term. He was publicly rebuffed by Greenland and Danish authorities before any talks could take place.\n\nLast week, Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede, in a New Year speech, stepped up a push for independence from Denmark, breaking it free from “the shackles of colonialism” to shape its own future, although he did not mention the US.\n\nAaja Chemnitz, a Greenland member of the Danish parliament, said the idea of a US takeover should be firmly rejected.\n\n“I don’t want to be a pawn in Trump’s hot dreams of expanding his empire to include our country,” she wrote.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Trump said on Truth Social that “the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.”","url":"https://www.indailysa.com.au/news/just-in/2025/01/08/trump-jr-visits-greenland-as-father-dials-up-takeover-threat","image":"https://wp.solsticemedia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/trump-jr.jpeg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:45:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":279099420,"title":"Stay informed, daily","text":"The resignation of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has prompted Donald Trump to renew calls for America’s northern neighbour to become its 51st US state.\n\nTrudeau announced on Tuesday he will step down as leader of Canada’s ruling Liberal Party after nine years in office.\n\nThe announcement came after months of pressure from within Trudeau’s own party to quit over fears it would be wiped out at the next election.\n\nIncoming US president Trump may have helped drive the final nail in Trudeau’s coffin with his pledge to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada’s economy.\n\nTrump was quick to use Trudeau’s resignation as an opportunity to call for Canada to be incorporated into the US.\n\n“Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Tuesday.\n\n“Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned. If Canada merged with the US, there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them. Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!,” he wrote.\n\nTrump has previously mooted Canada joining the US and was roundly mocked on social media in December when he shared a report on his Truth Social\n\nTrump even repeatedly taunted Trudeau with the title “governor”.\n\nSome, however, are taking Trump’s taunts seriously, especially at a time when Canada’s centre-left Liberal government is in disarray following the resignations of both Trudeau and deputy PM Chrystia Freeland in the space of weeks.\n\nFreeland, who is tipped to form part of the new Canadian leadership, placed the country’s response to Trump at the heart of her critique of Trudeau.\n\n“Among the many broadsides delivered to her former boss, the fact that Canada is ill-prepared to face the dire new threat of Trump’s second term was a recurring theme,” Canadian political scientist Stewart Prest wrote last week.\n\nPrest said Trump was flagrantly disrespecting Canadian independence and, along with it, Canadian identity.\n\n“He’s openly challenging the very idea of Canadian sovereignty. Canada must respond accordingly,” he said.\n\nPrest warned Trump’s annexation threats created a constant set of “multifaceted challenges to Canada’s economic prosperity, democratic norms and sovereignty”.\n\nCanadian IT mogul Kevin O’Leary, also often referred to as “Mr Wonderful”, raised eyebrows over Christmas when he floated the idea of going to Mar-a-Lago to talk to Trump about the idea of negotiating a European Union-style economic partnership between Canada and the US.\n\nA regular on Canadian reality TV show Shark Tank and a long-time supporter of conservative politics, O’Leary made good on that pledge when he met Trump at the incoming president’s Florida estate this week.\n\nIn an interview on the right-wing Fox News, O’Leary confirmed he had two topics he wanted to talk to Trump about.\n\n“No.1 was integrating Canada towards a North American union for greater strength, just period,” he said.\n\n“The world is a difficult place these days, and most Canadians would like to look at that opportunity without giving up their sovereignty.\n\n“So low-hanging fruit would be combined currency, for example, combining the Bank of Canada with the Fed (US Federal Reserve), things like that.”\n\nTariff threat\n\nTrump’s proposed 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian exports to the US would be incredibly costly to both countries, given the integration of their economies.\n\nGiven the size disparity between the two countries, the impact will be bigger in Canada.\n\nPrest said that in the face of Trump’s annexation taunts, Canada had so far acted in a manner that makes it seem as though Trump has a point.\n\n“Rather than pushing back by defending Canada’s strong record in managing its part of the border relationship, the government immediately promised more than $1 billion in new border spending. Canada’s leaders have failed to call out Trump’s threats as the bluster of a bully,” he said.","url":"https://www.indailysa.com.au/news/in-depth/2025/01/08/justin-trudeau-resignation-prompts-trump-to-renew-calls-for-canada-to-merge-with-us","image":"https://wp.solsticemedia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/trump-cdn.jpeg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:45:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.167},{"id":279099418,"title":"Stay informed, daily","text":"Social media company Meta Platforms has scrapped its US fact-checking program and reduced curbs on discussions around contentious topics such as immigration and gender identity.\n\nThe tech giant is bowing to criticism from conservatives as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time.\n\nThe move is Meta’s biggest overhaul of its approach to managing political content on its services in recent memory and comes as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been signalling a desire to mend fences with the incoming administration.\n\nThe changes will affect Facebook, Instagram and Threads, three of the world’s biggest social media platforms with more than three billion users globally.\n\nLast week, Meta elevated Republican policy executive Joel Kaplan as global affairs head and on Monday announced it had elected Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close friend of Trump, to its board.\n\n“We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. It’s time to get back to our roots around free expression,” Zuckerberg said in a video.\n\nHe acknowledged the role of the recent US elections in his thinking, saying they “feel like a cultural tipping point, towards once again prioritising speech.”\n\nWhen asked about the changes at a press conference, Trump welcomed them. “They have come a long way – Meta. The man (Zuckerberg) was very impressive,” he said.\n\nAsked if he thought Zuckerberg was responding to his threats, which have included a pledge to imprison the CEO, Trump said “probably”.\n\nIn place of a formal fact-checking program to address dubious claims posted on Meta’s platforms, Zuckerberg instead plans to implement a system of “community notes” similar to that used on Elon Musk-owned social media platform X.\n\nMeta also would stop proactively scanning for hate speech and other types of rule-breaking, reviewing such posts only in response to user reports, Zuckerberg said.\n\nIt will focus its automated systems on removing “high-severity violations” like terrorism, child exploitation, scams and drugs.\n\nThe demise of the fact-checking program, started in 2016, caught partner organisations by surprise.\n\n“We’ve learned the news as everyone has today. It’s a hard hit for the fact-checking community and journalism. We’re assessing the situation,” AFP said in a statement provided to Reuters.\n\nThe head of the International Fact-Checking Network, Angie Drobnic Holan, challenged Zuckerberg’s characterisation of its members as biased or censorious.\n\n“Fact-checking journalism has never censored or removed posts; it’s added information and context to controversial claims, and it’s debunked hoax content and conspiracies,” she said in a statement.\n\nKristin Roberts, Gannett Media’s chief content officer, said “truth and facts serve everyone – not the right or the left – and that’s what we will continue to deliver.”\n\nMeta’s independent Oversight Board welcomed the move.\n\nZuckerberg in recent months has expressed regret over certain content moderation actions on topics including COVID-19. Meta also donated $US1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, in a departure from its past practice.\n\n“This is a major step back for content moderation at a time when disinformation and harmful content are evolving faster than ever,” said Ross Burley, co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience.\n\n“This move seems more about political appeasement than smart policy.”\n\nFor now, Meta is planning the changes only for the US market, with no immediate plans to end its fact-checking program in places like the European Union which take a more active approach to regulation of tech companies, a spokesperson said.\n\nMusk’s X is already under European Commission investigation over issues including the “Community Notes” system.\n\nThe commission began its probe in December 2023, several months after X launched the feature.\n\nMeta said it would start phasing in Community Notes in the US over the next couple of months and improve the model over the year.\n\nAustralians will face more misinformation\n\n“It’s going to mean a free-for-all on misinformation, disinformation, abuse and trolling,” Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young told ABC radio on Wednesday\n\n“This is a very, very dangerous move at a time when members of the community, parents, young people – women in particular – are increasingly concerned (about) the unsafe environment on these big platforms.”\n\nA recent federal inquiry, which Senator Hanson-Young was part of, highlighted more Australians were concerned misinformation and disinformation than the global average.\n\nAn estimated 78 per cent of Australians are on at least one social media platform, with even higher proportions in younger populations.\n\nNearly half of all young Australian adults also turn to social media as their main source of news, according to a 2024 report by the federal media authority.\n\n“Those spaces need to be safe and platforms should have a responsibility to do that,” Senator Hanson-Young said.\n\nThe fact-checking program typically involves journalists at internationally accredited agencies investigating and reviewing claims on social media through rigorous questioning, consideration of evidence and verification using multiple sources.\n\nPosts deemed to be “False” or “Altered” have a fact-check article appended to them and may receive reduced distribution across Meta’s platforms Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nAustralian fact-checking agency AAP FactCheck played a critical role in responding to disinformation with factual, objective journalism and through media literacy education, Australian Associated Press chief executive Lisa Davies said.\n\n“Independent fact-checkers are a vital safeguard against the spread of harmful misinformation and disinformation that threatens to undermine free democratic debate in Australia and aims to manipulate public opinion,” she said.\n\n“AAP FactCheck’s contract with Meta in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific is not impacted by its US decision and our fact-checking work continues in 2025.”","url":"https://www.indailysa.com.au/news/just-in/2025/01/08/meta-to-drop-fact-checking-for-x-style-community-notes","image":"https://wp.solsticemedia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/facebook-meta.jpeg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:45:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":279098924,"title":"‘Hell will break loose’: Trump hints at military moves in Mideast, Americas","text":"United States President-elect Donald Trump has hinted at possible military intervention in the Americas and the Middle East, as well as other items on his foreign policy agenda, during a wide-ranging news conference in Florida.\n\nTrump spoke from his Mar-a-Lago estate on Tuesday, a day after Congress officially certified his victory in November’s general elections.

It has a “beautiful ring to it”, he quipped.\n\n‘Hell will break out’\n\nTrump spent considerable time discussing Israel’s war in Gaza, a conflict that has claimed more than 45,885 Palestinian lives and prompted fears of grave human rights abuses.\n\nThe president-elect called his nominee to be Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, up to the podium to give an update on negotiations.\n\nWitkoff, a real-estate investor with no foreign policy experience, had been part of recent ceasefire talks in the Middle East.\n\nIn apparently impromptu remarks, Witkoff said, “I think that we’ve had some really great progress, and I’m really hopeful that by the inaugural we’ll have some good things to announce on behalf of the president.”\n\nBut the president-elect took a harsher line, focusing on the release of the remaining captives held by Hamas after the attack on October 8, 2023, in southern Israel.

All hell will break out if those hostages aren’t back.”\n\n“If they’re not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. All hell will break out. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is,” he said.\n\nSyria policy\n\nTrump gave a characteristically cryptic answer when asked about the future of US troops in Syria. The Pentagon says about 2,000 US personnel remain in the country as part of a mission to curb the armed group ISIL (ISIS).\n\nBut questions have arisen about long-term US involvement in Syria after former President Bashar al-Assad was topped in early December.\n\nUS troops have supported the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria since 2014, as a multi-pronged civil war unfolded in the country.\n\nBut that backing put Washington at odds with its NATO ally Turkiye, which considers members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG) — the bulk of the SDF’s fighters — to be “terrorists”.\n\nTurkiye, by contrast, has supported the rebel groups that ultimately overthrew al-Assad.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump floated the possibility of withdrawing US troops from Syria. And as recently as December, he posted on his Truth Social platform that the US should have “nothing to do” with Syria.\n\nBut in Tuesday’s news conference, he opted instead for ambiguity about the future of US involvement in Syria.\n\n“I won’t tell you that, because that’s part of a military strategy,” he said.\n\nInstead, he heaped praise on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom he called a “friend” and a “very smart guy”.\n\n“He sent his people in there [Syria] through different forms and different names, and they went in, they took over, and that’s the way it is,” Trump said.\n\nSome analysts have speculated that Trump may be more amenable than past US presidents to turning over anti-ISIL operations to Turkiye.\n\nNATO to pay more\n\nTrump also weighed in on other NATO allies, saying the transatlantic alliance’s 32 members should increase their defence spending to five percent of their gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThat is a significant increase from the current minimum goal of two percent.\n\nTrump has regularly accused members of the alliance of underpaying and has suggested withdrawing if the spending does not increase.\n\n“They can all afford it, but they should be at five percent not two percent,” Trump said.\n\n“If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with NATO,” he added. But he warned he might revoke his support if he does not feel the US is treated fairly.\n\nIn one anecdote, he compared NATO allies to debtors delinquent on their bills: “If you are delinquent, we will not protect you.”\n\nThe threat comes as NATO has taken on increased significance amid Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022.\n\nTrump has long maintained Russia’s invasion would not have happened on his watch. On Tuesday, he again pledged to broker a speedy resolution.","url":"https://stkittsgazette.com/hell-will-break-loose-trump-hints-at-military-moves-in-mideast-americas/","image":"https://stkittsgazette.com/app/uploads/2024/12/AP24338625913437-1733254451-oKe6i6.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:42:14","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kn","sentiment":0.107},{"id":279098920,"title":"US judge temporarily blocks release of Trump investigations report","text":"A United States judge has temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack Smith from releasing a report on his investigation into President-elect Donald Trump for his mishandling of classified documents.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who presided over the now-dismissed case against Trump, directed the US Department of Justice not to release the report until a federal appeals court rules on a request from his two former co-defendants.\n\nThose co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, remain the subject of a continuing appeal. They have argued that the report’s release could interfere with their right to a fair hearing.\n\nA criminal indictment in the classified documents case was announced in June 2023, when prosecutors alleged that Trump and Nauta, his aide, defied a federal subpoena to turn over records containing defence intelligence and other sensitive materials after leaving public office.\n\nProsecutors also accused the two of attempting to conceal the documents and cover up the evidence that they had done so.\n\nDe Oliveira, a maintenance worker at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, was charged in August 2023 in an updated indictment, where he was implicated in an alleged conspiracy to delete surveillance footage.\n\nTrump is the first US president ever to face criminal charges. He has since been convicted in a separate criminal case, over falsifying business documents in New York.\n\nThe classified documents case, meanwhile, has hit several hurdles since it was first announced.\n\nJudge Cannon, a Trump appointee, tossed the case last July, arguing in her decision that the position of “special counsel” had not been congressionally approved.\n\nThat ran contrary to years of legal precedent: Special counsels have been commonly approved to provide independent legal counsel in cases where there may otherwise be a conflict of interest.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland, a member of the administration of President Joe Biden, appointed Smith in 2022 to serve in that role for investigations regarding Trump.\n\nIn addition to the classified documents case, Smith has also probed Trump’s alleged attempts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. That resulted in a separate criminal indictment in August 2023.\n\nBoth federal cases were dropped last November, after Trump won a second term in office. Smith also announced his intention to resign before Trump’s inauguration, at which point the Republican leader will control the Justice Department.\n\n“It has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President,” Smith wrote in a legal submission at the time.\n\nSmith’s report is said to contain two volumes: one about the classified documents case and the other about the election interference case. But a spokesperson for Smith’s office declined to comment on Judge Cannon’s order on Monday, barring its release.\n\nJustice Department regulations require Smith to submit a final report to Garland, who has previously pledged to make public all reports from special counsels during his tenure.\n\nTrump applauded Judge Cannon’s decision during a question-and-answer segment at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe has long denounced the prosecutions as a politically motivated attempt to block him from returning to power. On Monday, he repeatedly called Smith a “disgrace”.\n\n“He wanted to do a report just before I take office probably, so he’ll do like a 500-page report, and it’ll be a fake report, just like the investigation was a fake investigation,” Trump told reporters, upon learning the news.\n\n“So if they’re not allowed to issue the report, that’s the way it should be. Because he was thrown off the case in disgrace. Why should he be allowed to write a fake report?”","url":"https://stkittsgazette.com/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-release-of-trump-investigations-report/","image":"https://stkittsgazette.com/app/uploads/2024/12/AFP__20241226__36RH9ZP__v2__HighRes__TopshotIndonesiaAsiaTsunamiAnniversary-1735193497-iC6nGb.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:42:14","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kn","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":279098916,"title":"‘Hell will break loose’: Trump hints at military moves in Mideast, Americas","text":"United States President-elect Donald Trump has hinted at possible military intervention in the Americas and the Middle East, as well as other items on his foreign policy agenda, during a wide-ranging news conference in Florida.\n\nTrump spoke from his Mar-a-Lago estate on Tuesday, a day after Congress officially certified his victory in November’s general elections.

Security in Washington is higher than usual. The Capitol, where Carter will lie in state, is surrounded by miles of fencing ahead of Trump’s January 20 inauguration.\n\nCarter, a Democrat who served one White House term from 1977 to 1981, died December 29 at the age of 100.\n\nThe former Georgia peanut farmer struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis while in office and was handily defeated for re-election by Republican Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn the decades since, he earned a reputation as a committed humanitarian and is widely seen as a better former president than he was a president. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.\n\nCarter lived longer than any other US president and had been in hospice care for nearly two years before his death. His last public appearance was at wife Rosalynn’s funeral in November 2023, where he used a wheelchair and appeared frail.\n\nIn August, his grandson Jason Carter said Carter was looking forward to casting a ballot for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump.\n\nBiden has ordered flags at government buildings to be flown at half-staff for 30 days as a sign of mourning. That has irked Trump, who has said they should not be lowered during his inauguration.\n\nAt a news conference, Trump reiterated his desire to take back control of the Panama Canal, which Carter signed over to Panama during his presidency.\n\nMembers of Congress will pay their respects at a 4:30 p.m. (2130 GMT) service in the Capitol Rotunda. Members of the public will be able to pay their respects from 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) until midnight (0500 GMT).\n\nOn Wednesday, public viewing hours will resume at 7 a.m. (noon GMT), and Carter will lie in state in the Rotunda with a military guard of honour for 24 hours.

After that, Carter’s remains will be flown back home to Georgia. His body will be interred later that day in his hometown of Plains.

Ratner, best known for directing the Rush Hour trilogy, hasn’t directed a film since 2014’s Hercules. \n\nIn 2017, Ratner was one of the first people to be accused of sexual assault as part of the the #MeToo movement. Six women, including Olivia Munn and Natasha Henstridge, accused Ratner of multiple crimes, including sexual assault and harassment. Additionally, he has been accused of rape by a former talent agency employee, the actor Elliot Page has accused Ratner of sexual harassment, and a former fashion model claimed he coerced her into a sex act. \n\nRatner has denied all the allegations. \n\nThis documentary signifies another key connection between one of America’s most influential billionaires and Donald Trump, this time with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. \n\nBezos has already announced that Amazon will donate $1 million (€950,000) to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed in December. \n\nThe e-commerce giant will also stream Trump’s inauguration on its Prime Video service, which is viewed as a separate in-kind donation – worth another $1 million.\n\nThis represents a shift in tone between the two men. Bezos previously criticised Trump’s rhetoric – while Trump attacked political coverage at The Washington Post during his first term. Bezos has owned the paper since 2013.\n\nIn December, Bezos expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years and said he was “optimistic” about Trump’s second term.\n\nBezos in October did not allow the Post to endorse a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and to protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper. This weekend, a cartoonist quit her job after an editor rejected her sketch of the newspaper’s owner and other media executives bowing before the president-elect.\n\nIn 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump’s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.\n\nAmazon’s announcement came after Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said earlier in the day that it had donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.\n\nThis week, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that he would also donate $1 million to the president-elect’s inauguration. \n\nCook, Zuckerberg and Bezos seem to now have fallen in rank with fellow tech billionaire Elon Musk in coveting Donald Trump’s favour. While his first term was defined by a raft of anti-Trump media, could the new documentary on Bezos’ platform signal a change for what will be produced in the future?","summary":"A new documentary on Amazon Prime from the future first lady suggests a changing, perhaps warmer, relationship between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the Trumps.

there will be hell to pay if Hamas hostages aren't released\n\n(Web Desk) - President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday again said “all hell” will break out in the Middle East if the hostages taken by Hamas aren’t set free by the time he’s sworn in on Jan 20.\n\n“If those hostages aren’t back — if they’re not back by the time I get into office — all hell will break out in the Middle East and it will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone.\n\n“All hell will break out. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is and they should have been back a long time ago,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference from Mar-a-Lago in Florida after warning similarly last month.\n\nTrump said he’s had parents of hostages approach him and ask if he could help bring back their son or daughter.\n\nThe president-elect also praised his new Midwest envoy, Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate investor who will be tasked with negotiating with leaders of nations in the region.\n\n“They respect him over there,” Trump said. “It’s what we needed over there. We have people that know everything about the Middle East, but they can’t speak properly.”\n\nHamas on Tuesday reiterated its demand that Israel fully end its assault on Gaza as part of any deal to release the hostages. Officials from the terror group and Israel have been holding talks with Qatar and Egyptian mediators, the most intensive effort to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHamas has said it will free its remaining hostages only if Israel agrees to withdraw all its troops from Gaza, which Israel says it won’t do until Hamsa is dismantled and the hostages are released.","url":"https://www.dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/World/861084-trump-says-there-will-be-hell-to-pay-if-hamas-hostages-arent-releas","image":"https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2025/January/01-08-25/news_big_images/861084_22913537.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08

NATO","text":"The public articulation by Donald Trump of a new desired target for NATO allies to spend 5% of national income on defence will surely plunge governments across Europe into crisis mode – not least here in the UK.\n\nBritain presents itself to the world and in particular to the United States as the biggest defence spender in Europe and NATO’s most powerful European military.\n\nYet Sir Keir Starmer has not even managed to set out a timeline for what he describes as a “path to 2.5%” of GDP being invested in his armed forces, up from just over 2% today.\n\nIf the prime minister merely sticks to this pledge, he risks being viewed by the new administration as woefully unambitious and not credible on defence.\n\nThen there is the extraordinary threat by Mr Trump to seize Greenland by force if necessary, even though this valuable piece of territory belongs to a fellow NATO ally in the form of Denmark.\n\nThe move – were it to happen – would demonstrate the limitations of the alliance’s Article 5 founding principle.\n\nIt is supposed to guarantee that all allies would come to the defence of any member state which is under armed attack.\n\nBut what about if the aggressor is also meant to be an ally?\n\nThe president-elect also appeared to dash any hope of Ukraine being offered membership to the alliance anytime soon – a core request of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nInstead, Mr Trump sounded sympathetic to Vladimir Putin’s absolute opposition to such a move.\n\nHe said he would meet the Russian president after taking office – reiterating a promise to end the war in Ukraine, though again without spelling out how.\n\nThe outbursts came in a lengthy press conference on Tuesday that marked the starting shot in what could be a make-or-break test for NATO – an alliance of transatlantic friends that rose from the ashes of the Second World War.\n\nRead more:Trump speaks on Canada, Gaza and reversing Biden banA guide to everything about Trump’s inauguration\n\nEuropean members of NATO, as well as Canada, already took a battering the last time Mr Trump was in the White House – and rightly so.\n\nThe US had for far too long largely bankrolled the security of Europe, while the majority of its allies – including the UK – reaped the so-called “peace dividend” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, swapping expenditure on defence for peacetime priorities such as economic growth, healthcare and education.\n\nMr Trump made clear during his first term his displeasure about what he saw as Washington being ripped off and vowed to make Europe take its fair share of the burden.\n\nHe even warned member states that the US would not come to the aid of an ally that was not hitting at the very least a minimum NATO spending targeting of 2% of GDP – something they had previously pledged to do by 2024 but were slow to deliver on.\n\nSuch language electrified allies in a way that even Putin’s initial 2014 invasion of Ukraine, with the annexation of Crimea and attacks in the east of the country, had not.\n\nYet, with the threat from Russia growing in the wake of its full-scale war in Ukraine in 2022, coupled with conflict in the Middle East and the challenge posed by China, it has become clear that this heightened level of expenditure by allies was still far short of what is required to rebuild militaries across Europe that have been hollowed out over decades.\n\nRead more from Sky News:Trump’s Gaza warning risks becoming less threateningTrump asks court to dismiss hush money conviction\n\nMark Rutte, the new secretary general of NATO, set the stage for what is expected to be another push to ramp up investment when he delivered a landmark speech last month in which he called on allies to return to a “war mindset” and “turbocharge” defence spending.\n\nHe said this was to counter growing threats, but observers said it was also a pre-emptive response to the anticipated demands of the next Trump administration.\n\nEither way, it poses a huge challenge for all allies, in particular for Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nHe and Rachel Reeves face a choice: change course when it comes to their top priorities of economic growth, hospital waiting lists and new housing and instead invest more in defence or defy what will doubtless be growing demands from the United States to spend billions of pounds more on the UK armed forces – and maybe even leave the country in a position whereby the US would not come to its aid if attacked.","summary":"The public

The special elections, both in districts in suburban Loudoun County, were the first to occur since President-elect Donald Trump won a second term last November. While Democrats were favored in the races, the results offered an early test of the political environment in Virginia, which is hosting a major gubernatorial race this year and where Republicans have made inroads in recent years. In a special state Senate election, Democrat Kannan Srinivasan, currently a member of the state House, defeated Republican Tumay Harding. The seat had been vacant after state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam was elected to Congress in November. And in a special state House race, Democrat JJ Singh, a former Capitol Hill aide and small business owner, defeated Republican Ram Venkatachalam. That seat was left vacant after Srinivasan decided to run for the state Senate. A third special election Tuesday in a state Senate district in the Richmond suburbs saw Republican Luther Cifers, who runs a kayak sales company, defeat Democrat Jack Trammell. The seat was left vacant when state Sen. John McGuire, who narrowly defeated U.S. Rep. Bob Good in a bitter Republican primary last year, was elected to Congress. The candidates in all three races had been expected to win: Vice President Kamala Harris won the two Loudoun County districts comfortably while Trump easily carried the Richmond-area district last year, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. But special elections in off years, typically low-turnout affairs, can be unpredictable. Plus, voters had to deal with a winter storm that barreled the region this week. After Srinivasan and Cifers take office, Democrats will hold a 21-19 majority in the state Senate. If Democrats had lost the special election for the Loudoun County seat, control of the chamber would have gone to the Republicans, because GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears holds tie-breaking authority. After Singh is sworn in, Democrats will maintain their 51-49 majority in the House of Delegates. A win by the Republican candidate would have resulted in a 50-50 tie. In a statement, Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee president Heather Williams, whose group helped both of the party’s candidates in the Loudoun County races, said “the decisive victories of Delegate-elect Singh and Senator-elect Srinivasan reinforce our Democratic majorities in Virginia and keep our critical firewall of Democratic state legislatures strong.” Srinivasan and Singh both largely focused their races on partisan control of their chambers, reproductive rights and gun safety. Democratic lawmakers in Virginia have signaled that they’ll focus on advancing a constitutional amendment that would enshrine abortion rights. The results will also have ramifications for the final year of Republican Gov. Glenn Younkgin's tenure and the race to succeed him. With Democrats maintaining state legislative control, it could be more difficult for Youngkin to score any meaningful policy wins as he potentially lays the groundwork for a bid for higher office. This November's Virginia governor's race will also be among one of the most closely watched contests in 2025. On the Republican side, Earle-Sears, the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Virginia, is the frontrunner. For the Democrats, Rep. Abigail Spanberger is currently the only declared candidate.","summary":"Democrats won a pair of special legislative elections in Virginia Tuesday, allowing the party to maintain their narrow majorities in both chambers.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/virginia-special-election-democrats-legislative-majorites-rcna186375","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250107-virginia-election-jj-singh-ONETIMEUSE-mn-1510-465303.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:37:26","author":"Adam Edelman","authors":["Adam Edelman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.148},{"id":279097802,"title":"Elizabeth Warren Doubles Down on Discredited Smear of Pete Hegseth","text":"Sen.

Her actions are yet another example of the left’s attempt to silence those who challenge their narrative and push back against their radical agenda. \n\nIn a letter addressed to Hegseth, Warren began by first congratulating the former Fox News host before ripping his reputation to pieces. She said she had “serious concerns” about his qualifications, including his so-called “blatant disregard” of female servicemembers, his “drinking problems,” and accusations— emphasis on “accusations”— of sexual assault— all of which have either been debunked or simply untrue. Warren also accused Hegseth of undermining the Department of Defense and supporting “war” among political enemies. \n\nBelow are a few excerpts from Warren’s 33-page letter accusing Hegseth of complete nonsense. \n\nYour record of gross mismanagement of organizations you previously led raises alarm about your ability to manage a department with a budget of almost $850 billion,4 which accounts for over half of requested discretionary federal spending. Your mismanagement of the VFF finances “grew so dire that the group’s donors hatched a plan to take control away from [you]” after hiring a forensic accountant to review the organization’s finances, which the donors’ representatives found “appalling.” These are not the only reports of your mismanagement, wasteful spending, and inappropriate behavior. At any moment, the Secretary of Defense can be called upon to provide critical national security advice to the President. But you have been repeatedly accused of exhibiting a pattern of alcohol abuse. A Secretary of Defense must exercise clear judgment and be ready to be called upon at any time, and a Secretary who struggles with excessive and inappropriate drinking undermines our national security. \n\nWarren persisted in her attacks on Pete Hegseth, accusing him of “blatant disrespect to women in uniform” and continuing to spread false smears about his tattoos. One such claim centers around his “Deus Vult” tattoo, which translates to “God wills it,” and has been unfairly linked to “right-wing extremism” despite no evidence to support such accusations. These baseless attacks distract from the real issues, as Warren doubles down on discrediting Hegseth instead of engaging in substantive debate.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance weighed in on the controversy surrounding Hegseth’s tattoos, saying that the left is “attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm. This is disgusting anti-Christian bigotry from the AP, and the entire organization should be ashamed of itself.”\n\nElizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth in which she claims that having a Deus Vult tattoo, Latin for “God’s will” and a Christian motto that dates back to the First Crusade, makes him a “potential insider threat.” pic.twitter.com/4lySEYI9vn— Greg Price (@greg_price11) January 7, 2025\n\nRepublicans currently hold a 53-47 majority in the U.S. Senate. While this margin does not constitute a supermajority, it is sufficient to confirm Hegseth and other Trump nominees without requiring any Democratic support.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2025/01/07/elizabeth-warren-continues-to-spread-debunked-smear-of-pete-hegseth-n2650164","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/327/ecf33a5c-0d83-4622-b224-c4d26f3fc472.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:35:14","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":279102426,"title":"The policy will bar transgender people from using single-sex facilities","text":"Transgender people will not be permitted to use single-sex bathrooms that align with their gender identities near the House Chamber, under a policy from Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., that was renewed Friday. \r\n\r\nAccording to NBC report, the ban was included in a list of Johnson’s policies for the 119th Congress, which were reflected in the Congressional Record, a daily account of Congress’ proceedings. The policy was not officially included in the House rules package that passed Friday during the House’s first session.\r\n\r\nThe policy states that “all single-sex facilities—such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms—are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,” according to the record of Friday’s proceedings. \r\n\r\nThe policy will be enforced by the sergeant-at-arms and applies to “all areas of the Capitol subject to the Speaker’s general control under clause 3 of rule I,” according to the Congressional Record. That includes the hall of the House, the corridors and passages in the part of the Capitol assigned to the House, and other unappropriated rooms in that part of the Capitol, according to the House rules. \r\n\r\n“It is important to note that each Member office has its own private restroom, and unisex restrooms are available throughout the Capitol,” Friday’s Congressional Record states.\r\n\r\nThe policy was initially introduced as a proposed addition to the House rules by Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., in November as a direct response to the election of Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., who is the nation’s first openly trans member of Congress. \r\n\r\n“I’m absolutely 100% gonna stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women’s restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms,” Mace, who has repeatedly misgendered McBride, told reporters at the time. “I will be there fighting you every step of the way.”\r\n\r\nShortly after, Johnson said he supported Mace’s effort, saying, “Women deserve women’s only spaces.”\r\n\r\nMace told NBC News on Friday that she would reintroduce legislation to codify the bathroom policy in Congress, though she said it’s been House policy since Johnson’s comments in November.\r\n\r\nnancy mace politics political politician\r\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 18, 2024.Kent Nishimura / Getty Images file\r\nIn multiple statements, McBride has described the measure as an attempt to distract from more important issues, but she said she will follow Johnson’s rules “even if I disagree with them.”\r\n\r\n“I always knew that there would be some members of the Republican caucus who would seek to use my service representing the greatest state in the Union in Congress as an opportunity for them to distract from the fact that they have absolutely no real policy solutions for the issues that actually plague this country,” McBride told The New Yorker. “I was not surprised that there was an effort to politicize an issue that no one truly cares about—what bathroom I use. I did think that it might wait until January. It happened a little earlier than I anticipated. I was still getting lost in the tunnels of the Capitol when we got the news that this was coming.”\r\n\r\nA spokesperson for McBride declined additional comment regarding Johnson’s policy.\r\n\r\nRepublicans have increasingly leaned into anti-trans rhetoric in recent years and particularly during the election. President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters spent nearly $60 million on eight anti-trans network-TV ads, one of them in Spanish, between Sept. 19 and Nov. 1, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending.\r\n\r\nHowever, Trump appeared to downplay trans issues in an interview with Time magazine last month, saying he agreed with McBride that lawmakers should be focused on more important issues.\r\n\r\n“I do agree with that. On that — absolutely,” he told Time. “I don’t want to get into the bathroom issue. Because it’s a very small number of people we’re talking about, and it’s ripped apart our country, so they’ll have to settle whatever the law finally agrees.”","summary":"Transgender people will not be permitted to use single-sex bathrooms that align with their gender identities near the House Chamber, under a policy from Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., that was renewed Friday.

He estimated the rings are now worth about $27,000.\n\nThe rings and the Florida condominium, which Giuliani insists is his legal residence and is protected from the judgment, are the remaining contested assets after the one-time personal lawyer to President-elect Donald Trump gave up other valuable assets including his Manhattan apartment, a Mercedes once owned by actor Lauren Bacall and watches.\n\nGiuliani has said he does not know what happened to a jersey signed by Yankees legend Joe DiMaggio or a photograph signed by another beloved Yankees slugger, Reggie Jackson.\n\nLawyers for the former election workers, mother and daughter Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, wrote in court papers that Giuliani's son had failed to provide any direct evidence “other than his own self-serving testimony” to show that he accepted the ring from his father on May 26, 2018, or any time prior to this past October.\n\nThey said he has never appraised the rings, cleaned them or listed the rings on his renter's insurance policy or taken out a separate policy to insure the rings. They also said he'd never undertaken any tax, estate or financial planning related to the rings.\n\nThe lawyers said that although Giuliani said he gave the rings to his son in 2018, his son testified that he received them no earlier than mid-year 2023, when Giuliani put his Manhattan apartment up for sale. They wrote that if the judge found the rings indeed were given away in 2023, then he should rule that the exchange was fraudulent.\n\nTed Goodman, a publicist for Giuliani, said the lawyers for the Georgia women “can celebrate over their fight to take Mayor Giuliani’s most cherished personal belongings including his signed baseball jersey of his childhood hero and his grandfather’s pocket watch, but they can never take away his extraordinary record of public service.\"\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to an attorney for Andrew Giuliani.","summary":"Lawyers for two election workers who are owed $148 million in damages from Rudy Giuliani say the evidence proves their clients are entitled to three World Series rings that the former New York City mayor says he gave to his son","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/rudy-giuliani-ap-lawyers-new-york-yankees-georgia-b2675500.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/08/00/Giuliani_Election_Misinformation_99884.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:31:13","author":"Larry Neumeister","authors":["Larry Neumeister"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":279097978,"title":"Trump will not rule out force to take Panama Canal, Greenland","text":"NATO SPENDING\n\nTrump said NATO members should spend 5 per cent of their gross domestic product on defense, a significant increase from the current 2 per cent target.\n\n\"I think NATO should have 5 per cent,\" he said. \"They can all afford it, but they should be at 5 per cent, not 2 per cent.\"\n\nTrump has frequently complained that most NATO members are not paying their fair share, and he floated demanding an increase in NATO defense contributions during the campaign.\n\nNATO estimated that 23 of its 32 members would meet its goal of spending 2 per cent of GDP in 2024.\n\nNone of the alliance members, including the US, currently spends 5 per cent of GDP on defense, according to NATO figures.

To help with the latter, the Bad Bunny team contacted professor Jorell Meléndez-Badillo of the University of Wisconsin-Madison a year ago to collaborate in what was then an unnamed project. The end result was 17 visualizers — one for each of the album's tracks — that doubled as history lessons about Puerto Rico.  \"[Bad Bunny] was really interested in having that sort of historical component, so people were not only listening to the songs in YouTube, but learning their history while they do so,\" said Meléndez-Badillo. In April 2024, Meléndez-Badillo published his second academic book, “Puerto Rico: A National History” (Princeton University Press), which provides a panoramic introduction to the island's colonial history and contemporary political movements. It's a history attentive to marginalized groups: queer, Black and the working class that have shaped the idea of Puerto Rico as a nation and a diaspora. “[The book] was translated in Spanish and it circulated widely in Puerto Rico,\" said Meléndez-Badillo. \"So I guess that someone in the team had read the book or they knew about my work.” He put pen to paper — literally — writing fragments of the island's history dating back from 1508 to present day. “They were written by hand because I had no computer [while traveling] in Europe, so I basically produced 74 pages of historical facts and narratives,” said Meléndez-Badillo. These visualizers contain turning points in Puerto Rican history, from the lost Spanish expedition led by Christopher Columbus that was discovered by indigenous people (featured in \"Weltita\"), all the way to the island’s current dependency on foreign funds (featured in \"La Mudanza\"). The first track alone, \"Nuevayol,\" has over 6 million views, with the visualizer detailing the creation of the first Puerto Rican flag by revolutionary exiles in New York. Underlying in the blue placards are moments of resilience shown by the Puerto Rican people, such as the 1868 Grito de Lares revolt against Spanish colonial rule (in \"Turista\"), and Lola Rodríguez de Tió's 1986 song \"La Borinqueña,\" which remains a symbol of independence and the national anthem (in \"Dtmf\"). \" I think that it's a great learning tool about what's happening in Puerto Rico, but I think that the intentional behind,  is not to cater to outside audiences,\" said Meléndez-Badillo, who only wrote the snippets in Spanish. It’s a past not often taught in public schools — 45% of which have closed between 2007 to 2019 following a corroding debt crisis and the fallout after hurricanes Irma and Maria (a tidbit also included in the visualizers for \"La Mudanza,\"). “ Not a lot of people engage with Puerto Rican history, even as they go through the elementary school system,” said Meléndez-Badillo. Now that the album and visuals are finally out, Meléndez-Badillo says he was moved to tears by its message — delivered through Puerto Rican folk album, also known as música jíbara. “It was [Bad Bunny's] vision that thought about bringing Puerto Rican history into the conversation with music,” said Meléndez-Badillo. “It’s not only an aesthetic project that he has crafted, but also a political project.” This is not the first time that Bad Bunny has used his platform to elevate political messaging. Weeks before the 2024 election, he backed his support for Vice President Kamala Harris following a Donald Trump rally where a speaker referred to Puerto Rico as “a floating island of garbage.” In 2022, he released a 22-minute documentary that doubled as a music video for \"El Apagón,\" which comments on the island's chronic power outages — still ongoing in 2025. In it, journalist Bianca Graulau highlights the island's dwindling public housing resources and how lax tax laws benefiting wealthy foreigners have come at the expense of local life. It's also a theme he explores in a short film featuring renowned Puerto Rican film director Jacobo Morales. “ In the face of displacement, in the face of all these conversations about Puerto Ricans leaving the archipelago, about crisis, about power outages, [Bad Bunny] is celebrating that Puerto Rican-ness and I think it's a very political record as well,” said Meléndez-Badillo.","summary":"Released Jan. 5, the record pays homage to the island’s rich rhythms like plena and salsa, and delves into it’s seldom taught history.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/delos/story/2025-01-07/bad-bunnys-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-puerto-rico-jorell-melendez-badillo-visualizers","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fbbccae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+870/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2Fdd%2Fdbd472d149b1a7b7b0029929acc1%2Fartboard-1-1x-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:24:33","author":"Andrea Flores","authors":["Andrea Flores"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.134},{"id":279095718,"title":"Cybertruck bomber used generative AI to plan attack","text":"The highly decorated US soldier who exploded a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas used generative AI including ChatGPT to help plan the attack, police say. A laptop, mobile phone and watch are still under review nearly a week after 37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger fatally shot himself just before the truck blew up. A review of Livelsberger&apos;s searches through ChatGPT indicate he was looking for information on explosive targets, the speed at which certain rounds of ammunition would travel and whether fireworks were legal in Arizona. Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, called the use of generative AI a \"game-changer\" and said the department was sharing information with other law enforcement agencies. \"This is the first incident that I&apos;m aware of on US soil where ChatGPT is utilised to help an individual build a particular device,\" he said. \"It&apos;s a concerning moment.\" During a news conference, Las Vegas police and federal law enforcement officials unveiled new details about the New Year&apos;s Day explosion. Among the details law enforcement disclosed: Livelsberger stopped during the drive to Las Vegas to pour racing-grade fuel into the Cybertruck. The vehicle was loaded with 27 kilograms of pyrotechnic material and officials are still uncertain exactly what detonated the explosion, but said it could have been the flash from the firearm that Livelsberger used to fatally shoot himself. Livelsberger, an Army Green Beret who deployed twice to Afghanistan and lived in Colorado, left notes saying the explosion was a stunt meant to be a \"wake up call \" for the nation&apos;s troubles, officials said last week. He left phone notes saying he needed to \"cleanse\" his mind \"of the brothers I&apos;ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.\" The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no damage to the Trump International Hotel. Authorities said Livelsberger acted alone. Livelsberger&apos;s letters touched on political grievances, societal problems and domestic and international issues, including the war in Ukraine. He wrote that the US was \"terminally ill and headed toward collapse\". Investigators had been trying to determine if Livelsberger wanted to make a political point, given the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect&apos;s name. Livelsberger harboured no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, law enforcement officials said. In one of the notes he left, he said the country needed to \"rally around\" him and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Police had little information about the driving behaviours of those drivers unless they had previously observed their driving. Police selected only 110 of those drivers to refer to the ACT&apos;s Fitness To Drive Medical Clinic (FTDMC). The ACT government funded a study that reviewed the characteristics of those 110 drivers. All 110 were found to be medically impaired. The study did not consider the thousands of drivers who were not referred by police. So police identified at least 5 per cent of the impaired drivers involved in those crashes. Study author Dr Vanita Parekh made the bizarre claim that: \"The police detection rate was found to be 100 per cent - they get it right every time\". The study found that 68 per cent of the referred drivers self-reported as male and 52 per cent were aged over 70. It did not consider whether those statistics resulted from a police preference to refer old male drivers. The study made the disturbing recommendation that, \"ACT police referrals to the FTDMC should result in immediate suspension of a driver&apos;s licence.\" It concluded that \"Further investigation of the critical thinking involved by police in the detection of medically impaired drivers warrants investigation.\" The government should further investigate the study&apos;s authors&apos; critical thinking before acting on their advice. Your editorial (Canberra Times, January 6) decried false claims like those spread by Trump. Why, then, make false claims? The man in the Tesla in Las Vegas, Matthew Livelsberger, was a Green Beret on leave. No reports, other than your editorial, suggest that he was Islamic. No reports, other than your editorial, suggest that he \"espoused extreme, violent Islamism\". Many reports confirm that he was a strong Trump supporter, as well as a career special forces soldier. You call it important that Muslims or migrants aren&apos;t demonised. Don&apos;t call someone an Islamist who isn&apos;t; don&apos;t say someone espoused extreme violent Islamism who didn&apos;t. Andrew Donnellan (Letters, January 4) has his head in the sand regarding the ludicrous costs associated with light rail in Canberra, which impact the delivery of essential services. Brisbane once had a tram system, but now is streets ahead with Brisbane Metro - a high-capacity, high-frequency public bus rapid transit system linking the city to the suburbs. This is so much smarter and more cost-effective than Canberra&apos;s light rail project, the latter plagued by ridiculous costs and inflexibility. The recent Australia-India Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series was an entertaining, hard-fought series that attracted the most spectators in Australia ever-it even caused me to watch many a session. Australia won the series 3-1, culminating in a three-day victory at the final test in Sydney. This should have been a shining moment for Cricket Australia, but the way the Border-Gavaskar Trophy presentation was conducted shamed us all. Despite Sunil Gavaskar being present at and on the ground during the presentation, he was snubbed in not being asked to join Allan Border to present their Border-Gavaskar Trophy to the winning captain. As an Australian, I felt ashamed that Sunil was excluded from such a significant presentation event. Cricket Australia&apos;s embarrassing omission deserves a public apology, and I understand Mr Gavaskar has been most gracious about it. Andrew Donnellan (Letters, January 4) is spot on about the advantages of light rail for Canberra. After spending five days at Darling Harbour in Sydney at Christmas, I can confirm that the Emerald City has achieved a distinct win with its light rail system. Now, our very different vibe in Canberra (a superior one in my opinion) has already benefitted from the light rail experience and will do even more so once the southern parts of our city are reached. Let the beauty of our quieter city shine. We sometimes take for granted the kindness of Canberra people. While shopping at Woden Plaza my wife tripped and fell. It seemed the ground at the outdoor parking area just off Corinna St was very uneven which contributed to the fall. My wife and I are aware that we are of an age when a fall can result in serious medical implications. My thanks go to the three very kind people who came to her assistance. Regretfully, I forgot to get their names, and I trust they read this and understand how much their help is appreciated. On Friday, my bench saw warned me not to be complacent. This lesson sent me to the day clinic in Belconnen, the emergency section of North Canberra Hospital, and now the plastic surgery section of South Canberra Hospital. All so far paid for by our taxes. I have not had to worry about how much this will cost, whether I am in a facility my private insurance covers me for, or whether the bandages wrapping the first two fingers of my left hand are going to turn out to cost thousands of dollars. Anyone still thinking that a USA-style system of private medical care is better, or wishing that their taxes didn&apos;t pay for Medicare, needs to learn a lesson - hopefully not directly from my bench saw. Crispin Hull (\"The slide at the end of the world\", December 31) says that when confronted with the real possibility of catastrophic sea rise in our lifetime, scientists must convey a sense of alarm and measured panic. Mr Hull draws attention to a scarcely reported September 2024 scientific study, Antarctica and Sea-Level Rise, by the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership and the ARC Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science. Alarmingly, it suggests that the whole eastern Antarctic ice sheet may soon start sliding down into the ocean, potentially leading to a catastrophic sea rise of up to 58 metres. Several predictions of the consequences of climate change have, in practice, been found approaching or exceeding worst-case scenarios. Preparing for the worst is the only responsible action. Urgent exhortations from the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to take immediate action have failed to produce effective action. Scientists are duty-bound to step up and take an even stronger, bolder stance in waking society from its dangerous slumber. A role exemplified by a courageous, lucid girl from Sweden: \"I want you to act as if the house is on fire. Because it is.\" - Greta Thunberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 25, 2019. Tom Brazier complains that the whole of Palestine is now under Israeli control (Letters, January 6). In fact, the vast majority of Palestinians in the West Bank live under the control of the Palestinian Authority, which is corrupt and incompetent, gives terrorists generous financial incentives, and hasn&apos;t held elections since 2006. From 2005 Gaza was under Palestinian control. Look what Hamas did with that. Devoted the entire enclave and its resources to terrorism against Israel. Politicians&apos; entitlements do not just include airline perks such as free upgrades and club and lounge memberships. When they travel they receive a daily allowance higher than what an unemployed person or student receives in a week. There&apos;s also an allowance to dine and wine. And let&apos;s not forget the rort that goes on with the housing allowance, which lets them stay in their own and each others&apos; tax-deductible away-from-home properties. This is on top of already very generous salaries, even for a backbencher. All these entitlements need to be reviewed and brought into line with the reality experienced by so-called \"ordinary\" Australians. So we are effectively imposing a sporting boycott on Israel in the name of fear. How pathetic is that? President-elect Donald Trump is suggesting to Canadians their country should become America&apos;s 51st state. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese should get on the blower to him right away and remind him that Australia is that already. What surprised me about Jill Sutton&apos;s letter (\"Dickson&apos;s woes are bad planning\", January 6) was that Jill thought a town planner had input into development design. We may employ planners in Canberra, but there is little evidence of their input. It&apos;s developers who \"plan\" looming towers with no privacy or access to recreation. That&apos;s what \"outcome-based\" planning means. The two misfit countries, Russia and America, should be left to slog it out, while the rest of us just get on with our lives. I refer to Thomas Mautner&apos;s interesting historical piece and the potential relevance of those events to present-day Afghanistan (Letters, January 5). As a one-time Argonaut (an ABC children&apos;s radio program) I do not recall mention of the fortunate and ultimately productive role of the original Argonauts while engaged on their odyssey. Saying \"we are fighting human animals\" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant \"let slip the dogs of war\" on hapless Palestinians, causing countless deaths, untold destruction and human suffering beyond comprehension. It has been reported a former Israeli soldier on vacation in Brazil fled the country after a case was brought against him there alleging he was responsible for war crimes while serving in Gaza. What a perfect way to bring Israelis back to their senses. Every country in the world should follow suit. You can&apos;t please the Poms. They are tired of Keir Starmer already, saying he has no sense of humour. So why didn&apos;t they stick with the comedic Boris Johnson? Your editorial of January 5, refers to the arrival of \"hundreds of Australia&apos;s finest cars\". How can the car with the giant supercharger protruding from the engine bay captioned \"How big&apos;s your engine?\" be one of the \"finest\". Perhaps it&apos;s the \"finest\" example of the triumph of horsepower over traction and pollution over common sense. So the US plans an $8 billion arms sale to Israel. What better way than that to promote regional and global peace? Ask the women and children who survive the indiscriminate Israeli bombardment with US arms if you want a confirmation. The dead can&apos;t speak. Another La Nina event this summer? Bring it on. Just let it rain.","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8860937/act-driver-fitness-study-raises-police-referral-concerns/?cs=27763","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/LLBstgPA4H8EG9DTTGcXBL/d8358757-9a22-4b05-a5ca-8fff6cf1a229.jpg/r0_0_5000_3333_w5000_h3333_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:18:20","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":279095690,"title":"Trump&apos;s comeback hailed amid democracy doubts","text":"It&apos;s ironic, given the role Donald Trump played in the January 6 riots four years ago, his confirmation as US President-elect is being hailed as a win for democracy and proof that while the US electoral system may have picked up a few dents it was not damaged beyond repair. The big difference between democracies such as the US, the UK, ourselves and others and the various oligarchies, one-party dictatorships and outright tyrannies that prevail elsewhere is the peaceful transfer of power from one regime to the next. That, with the exception of the war between the states, had always been the case in America. Even when they lost by the absolute smallest of margins leaders such as Richard Nixon (who was just pipped at the post by JFK) and Al Gore (controversially defeated by George W. Bush) respected the verdict. Vox populi, vox dei. The voice of the people is the voice of God. When Mr Trump illegally directed his then-deputy Mike Pence not to validate the 2020 election result four years ago he broke with centuries of tradition and law. Mr Pence, to his great credit, refused to accept the \"stolen election\" narrative even at the risk of his personal safety. He, like hundreds of others, was forced to take refuge when an estimated 2500 demonstrators - who had been egged on by Mr Trump - stormed the building. The then president, who claimed the election had been \"stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats\", told the mob \"If you don&apos;t fight like hell, you&apos;re not going to have a country anymore\". He appeared to echo this sentiment when, in the wake of a 2024 assassination attempt, he urged his supporters to \"fight, fight, fight\". The deaths of five people have been linked to the insurrection, which Mr Trump and his supporters continue to play down; dozens more were injured, and in the aftermath, about 1500 people were arrested and charged. Hundreds were sentenced to jail. There is a widespread expectation one of Mr Trump&apos;s first actions on January 20 will be to pardon any and all of his supporters for their involvement in what must considered a day of infamy. This is a remarkable turn of events given that in the immediate wake of December 6, political pundits were almost unanimous in expressing the view his political career was over, that he had done so much damage to his brand he had become unelectable. But what a difference a few years makes. Last November the Republicans, united behind the master manipulator from Mar-a-Lago, won a decisive victory over Kamala Harris and the Democrats. While it is true that the Democrats, who had let an obviously cognitively challenged Joe Biden hang on for far too long, were their own worst enemies, it is undeniable Trump&apos;s mantra - borrowed from Ronald Reagan - \"are you better off than you were four years ago\" clearly resonated with voters who appear to have been won over by attempts to whitewash what occurred in 2021. To his credit, President Biden is having none of it. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, he wrote: \"An unrelenting effort has been under way to rewrite even erase the history of that day. To tell us we didn&apos;t see what we all saw with our own eyes ... to explain it away as a protest that just got out of hand. This is not what happened. We cannot allow the truth to be lost.\" That may be easier said than done. George Orwell&apos;s observation: \"Those who control the present, control the past and those who control the past control the future\" is as true today as it ever was. And, as of January 20, Mr Trump, with the support of Elon Musk and others, will have more control over the present than any previous US president.","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8861198/trumps-comeback-hailed-amid-democracy-doubts/?cs=27763","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/LLBstgPA4H8EG9DTTGcXBL/330370df-5cd1-4470-aac5-f0e7ce20b1fd.jpg/r0_0_8256_5504_w8256_h5504_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:18:20","author":"The Canberra Times","authors":["The Canberra Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.403},{"id":279095632,"title":"Politicians pay tribute to Jimmy Carter at US Capitol","text":"US leaders have paid tribute to former President Jimmy Carter - who had the longest and most admired post-presidency in history - as he lays in state at the US Capitol ahead of his funeral. Members of Congress and several Supreme Court justices gathered around Carter&apos;s flag-draped coffin under the Capitol dome on Tuesday. Several praised Carter&apos;s actions as the 39th president and the humanitarian work he pursued for decades after leaving office in 1981. \"Jimmy Carter was an all too rare example of a gifted man who also walked with humility, modesty and grace,\" said Vice President Kamala Harris, who belongs to the Democratic Party as Carter did. Republicans John Thune, Senate leader, and Mike Johnson, House of Representatives speaker, also spoke as Carter family members and other lawmakers observed. The carefully choreographed ceremony came at a time of transition in Washington as Republican President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office from Democratic President Joe Biden on January 20. Security is higher than usual, with fencing surrounding the Capitol. Carter&apos;s flag-draped casket arrived at the Capitol on a horse-drawn caisson after a funeral procession down Pennsylvania Avenue. Family members followed on foot, in a nod to Carter&apos;s walk down the boulevard during his 1977 inauguration. Cadets from the US Naval Academy saluted the former Navy submarine officer. Carter&apos;s remains will lie in state in the Rotunda of the Capitol for the next three days for members of Congress and the public to pay their respects. His body will travel by motorcade on Thursday for a funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral. Carter, who served one White House term from 1977 to 1981, died December 29 at the age of 100. The former Georgia peanut farmer struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis while in office and was handily defeated for re-election by Republican Ronald Reagan. In the decades after, he earned a reputation as a committed humanitarian and was widely seen as a better former president than he was a president. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. Carter lived longer than any other US president and had been in hospice care for nearly two years before his death. His last public appearance was at wife Rosalynn&apos;s funeral in November 2023, where he used a wheelchair and appeared frail. In August, his grandson Jason Carter said Carter was looking forward to casting a ballot for Harris in the November 5 election, which she lost to Trump. Biden has ordered flags at government buildings to be flown at half-staff for 30 days as a sign of mourning. That has irked Trump, who has said they should not be lowered during his inauguration. Both Biden and Trump were expected to attend Carter&apos;s funeral service on Thursday. Biden was expected to deliver the eulogy. After the funeral, Carter&apos;s remains will be flown back home to Georgia. His body will be interred later that day in his hometown of Plains.

A single honest old 155mm projectile landing anywhere nearby has the potential to ruin one's whole day, and if it's really close, one might discover one's self starting a new career as a fine pink mist.\n\nNow the US Army Field Artillery, the \"cannon cockers\" (no, that's not what the term means; \"cocker\" is an old term from when artillery pieces had locks, like a musket, and required \"cocking\" before firing) are going to be getting some new high-tech toys.\n\nThe United States military has selected London-headquartered aerospace and defense security company BAE Systems to develop the prototype of a new 155 mm anti-aircraft artillery system equipped with hypersonic projectiles.The system, named the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon (MDAC) and Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP) prototype, was announced through a public notice on December 20, 2024. The Pentagon sole-sourced the contract to BAE, bypassing a competitive process among private vendors.\n\nThe new system appears to have some pretty impressive capabilities:\n\nThe MDAC is a highly mobile, airborne, self-propelled 155 mm artillery system, as outlined in the published requirements. The system is expected to feature a high degree of automation, a large ammunition capacity, and a rapid rate of fire.The MDACS battery will consist of eight MDAC artillery units, four MFPR multi-function radars, two MDBM battle management systems, and a minimum of 144 HVP hypersonic projectiles.The primary role of the MDACS is to defend stationary and semi-stationary positions from attacks by drones, cruise missiles, aircraft, and helicopters. It is also designed to integrate with existing air and missile defense systems. While particulars of the funding remain undisclosed, the Army plans to allocate $67 million for initial work in 2025, with additional investments in the following years.\n\nThe anti-drone capability is particularly relevant. Warfare today, especially asymmetric warfare against unorganized but creative opponents, is more and more about drones. Drones are cheap, they can be bought anywhere, and they are not only great reconnaissance tools but can carry explosive payloads as well.\n\nSee Related: China Hits US Defense Firms With Trade Sanctions - Why?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump ran on rebuilding our military. One of his first moves in seeing this done is to nominate for Secretary of Defense an Army veteran, Pete Hegseth, who has been there and seen the elephant. While the poison of DEI needs to be rooted out, tree and branch, the other task that must be done is to re-train and re-arm our service members. This new artillery capability looks like a step in that direction; one might even call it a good start, with the awareness that much, much more is needed.\n\nOne of the more fun things I got to do in my time in Uncle Sam's colors was to call in 155mm and 8-inch gunfire during a 5-day field exercise at Ft. Lewis, Washington. It always struck me as one of the world's nastiest practical jokes; sitting in a hole on a hillside, talking into a radio, and directing the rain of death and destruction from afar. We were just targeting junk vehicles and some plywood mockups, but if it had been real, it would have been really bad luck to have been anywhere near those targets.\n\nAnd now, the cannon-cockers have some new toys that will make them even more effective. That's how it's supposed to work. \n\nTarget!

Though Trudeau used his resignation address to defend his record in fighting for the middle class, growing dissatisfaction with his government’s economic policies was a key factor in his declining political fortunes. Here, the Financial Post looks back at 10 key decisions that will shape Trudeau’s economic legacy, for better or worse.\n\nAppointing Bill Morneau as finance minister\n\nWhen Trudeau’s Liberal Party swept to power in 2015, he tapped business leader Bill Morneau to be his first finance minister. The former executive chairman of Morneau Shepell, a human resources firm founded by his family, Morneau was seen as a seasoned executive who could keep Bay Street happy while helping Trudeau sell ideas to support the middle class. Despite some controversy over Morneau’s financial holdings, the pair seemed to be aligned through the start of the pandemic, with Morneau serving as the face of the Trudeau government’s wage supplement and loan programs. But the partnership would soon run aground, in part due to Morneau’s role in the Liberal Party’s WE Charity scandal, for which Morneau was eventually found to have breached the Conflict of Interest Act. Morneau’s resignation in 2020 also exposed behind-the-scenes clashes with the prime minister over fiscal policy and the path of pandemic spending. In his memoir in 2023, Morneau claimed “political points” and public perception won out over sound fiscal policy when it came to federal aid programs. Ultimately, the priorities Bay Street had laid out — business-friendly tax and regulatory reform and decisive action to curb deficits — were never accomplished, and Morneau’s departure raised questions about what, if anything, would anchor government spending going forward.\n\nPurchasing the TMX pipeline\n\nIn 2018, British Columbia and Alberta were in a bitter dispute over the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which would triple the pipeline’s capacity to 890,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Edmonton to the coast of British Columbia. Facing mounting legal challenges from environmental and Indigenous groups, the Liberal government bought the project for $4.5 billion from Kinder Morgan Inc. after the company threatened to cancel it. Morneau promised at the time it would not involve a big financial hit and that the purchase would be an investment in Canada’s future. But construction suffered many delays and setbacks and the overall cost quickly ballooned, rising to its current estimate of $34.2 billion. In 2024, the project finally came online. While the cost has risen, the value has, too: that includes increased revenue for Canadian oil companies and better access to Asian markets. Getting a pipeline built at all in Canada is no small feat. Whether the financial cost was worth it may not be known until a viable buyer is found to take it off the government’s hands.\n\nImplementing the carbon tax\n\nAs part of his green agenda, Trudeau’s government implemented a national minimum price on carbon pollution starting at $20 per tonne on gasoline in 2019. That price has increased every year and now currently sits at $80 per tonne. The tax quickly became a political headache for the governing party, with the Conservatives vowing to scrap it as inflation soared. Though Trudeau has relentlessly defended the measure as a necessary one in the fight against climate change, he also waffled, announcing in the fall of 2023 a three-year exemption for Canadians who use home heating oil. The move was largely seen as an effort to boost the Liberals’ political fortunes in Atlantic Canada, where many residents use the heating method, and only bolstered concerns that the tax had political motivations on top of environmental ones. The carbon tax will be a wedge issue in any coming election, and could divide Liberals themselves when it comes time to select a new leader.\n\nExpanding government and the debt\n\nTrudeau’s legacy will include the significant expansion of the size of the federal government and of the national debt under his tenure. Part of this was unavoidable: The pandemic years, when lockdowns resulted in a major contraction in the global economy, led to unprecedented fiscal interventions in countries around the world. New programs such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Business Account were introduced in 2020 and, though designed to help people who lost their jobs and keep businesses afloat, came at huge cost to the federal coffers. Some also argued that while well-intentioned, they went too far, were poorly designed and were ripe for fraud. Overall, the federal debt almost doubled to $1.236 trillion in 2024 from $619.3 billion in 2015. Trudeau’s reign also saw a huge expansion of the federal public service workforce, which increased to 367,772 employees from 257,034.\n\nIncreasing immigration\n\nWhen Trudeau entered office, Canada’s population stood at 35.8 million people. In 2024, Canada’s population hit 41.4 million, an expansion that accelerated significantly as the economy began to re-open following the lifting of pandemic lockdowns. In 2021, Canada broke the previous record set in 1913, by welcoming more than 401,000 new permanent residents. The following year, Canada surpassed that record, adding another 431,645 new permanent residents. While the government’s initial decision to increase immigration was in part a response to a labour shortage coming out of the pandemic, many began to question the impact the influx was having on an already tight housing market and strained services. As the country slogged through a GDP-per-capita recession, attitudes toward immigration — long a consensus topic — began to sour. In the fall of 2024, following dismal approval ratings, Trudeau and his immigration minister, Marc Miller, announced a 21 per cent cut to permanent resident levels while announcing changes to other programs as well. While any kind of permanent turn against immigration seems unlikely, future governments will have to consider where to draw the line.\n\nFailing to address the housing crisis\n\nOne issue that has plagued Trudeau’s government has been housing affordability. In 2017, the government announced a national housing strategy and funding to tackle homelessness and build 100,000 new affordable homes. But with rising immigration fuelling demand and few concrete solutions in place, meaningful improvements in overall housing supply and affordability have been elusive. Some measures, including the housing accelerator fund, which provided direct funding to municipalities to build more homes, have made incremental progress, but have hardly changed the overall equation. Trudeau’s government was also slow to address concerns about foreign ownership. In 2022, the government passed legislation to implement a two-year ban on foreign investors buying property in Canada. This ban was set to expire at the end of 2024, but was expanded for another two years until January 2027.\n\nEstablishing universal childcare\n\nThe establishment of a universal $10-per-day childcare program has long been a Liberal goal, and if it survives could be one of Trudeau’s biggest legacies. In 2021, the Liberal government pledged $27.2 billion over five years to fund the program, which would cut the daily cost of childcare to $10 by 2025-26, through bilateral agreements with the provinces. As of 2024, all provinces had signed on. The measure was pitched as not only a social policy, but an economic policy as well, designed to help more women participate in the workforce. The program has faced criticisms, particularly from daycare operators who argue the funding is not enough to cover the cost burdens, but it has widespread support from families. Trudeau also introduced the Canada Child Benefit, a non-taxable amount paid monthly to help families with children under 18. The benefit has been hailed as a success for lifting thousands of children out of poverty, though the cost has been contentious.\n\nPursuing free trade\n\nThe Trudeau government was no stranger to trade deals. These included USMCA (The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), a tensely negotiated pact that replaced the North America Free Trade Agreement. The Liberals notched some wins for Canada, including stronger intellectual property protections, but then-U.S. president Donald Trump’s threats to slap quotas or a 10 per cent tariff on Canadian aluminum dampened enthusiasm for the deal. Now back for a second term, Trump has threatened a blanket 25 per cent tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods and said he is going to “have a lot of fun” reopening the trade talks. During Trudeau’s nine years in power, his government was also instrumental in negotiating the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union and its member states, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement between Canada and 10 countries in the Indo-Pacific, as well as the United Kingdom.\n\nBetting big on the EV industry\n\nTrudeau’s government has spent billions on the promise of an electric vehicle revolution, funding manufacturing through direct investment and incentives such as tax credits and subsidies. The money for the EV supply chain has come even as critics questioned whether enough EVs could be sold to meet a pledge to get gas-fuelled cars and passenger trucks off the road by 2035. The Liberals’ commitments represent the largest influx of investment into Canada’s auto sector in at least a generation, and will make for one of Trudeau’s biggest economic legacies — provided everything works out. And there have been setbacks: Lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles has been cited for production delays by Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co., while Sweden’s Northvolt AB, which planned to build a battery-cell factory near Montreal, announced a strategic review in August and then sought creditor protection in November. While Trudeau billed these as mere bumps in the road to the EV future, it’s too soon to tell how significant the impact will be.\n\nFalling out with Chrystia Freeland\n\nThe bombshell resignation of Trudeau’s closest ally and second finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, will be remembered as the tipping point that ended his run as prime minister. Her resignation came just hours before she was set to table the government’s fall economic update. If her resignation letter is taken at face value, the root cause of the falling out, as with her predecessor, Bill Morneau, was the federal government’s fiscal spending. She outlined the need to keep the country’s “fiscal powder dry” given the threat of tariffs by the incoming Trump administration. The fall economic statement revealed a nearly $62-billion deficit, blowing past the fiscal guardrail Freeland had set the year before. When asked about whether Freeland’s resignation was the catalyst that led to his resignation, Trudeau told reporters: “I had really hoped that she would agree to continue as my deputy prime minister and take on one of the most important files that not just this government, but this country is facing, but she chose otherwise.”\n\n—with files from Gabriel Friedman\n\n• Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com \n\n• Email: jgowling@postmedia.com\n\n Share this Story : These 10 key decisions will shape Justin Trudeau’s economic legacy — for better or worse Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr","url":"https://windsorstar.com/news/justin-trudeau-economic-legacy-10-key-decisions","image":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/trudeau-resignation-gs0107-1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:13:15","author":"Barbara Shecter,Jordan Gowling","authors":["Barbara Shecter","Jordan Gowling"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.077},{"id":279098484,"title":"What the papers say – January 8","text":"Fact-checking changes at social media company Meta lead the nation’s Wednesday papers.\n\nThe Financial Times and The Guardian splash on Mark Zuckerberg’s company moving away from third-party fact-checking in an attempt to build bridges with President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, the i says Mr Zuckerberg has joined X owner Elon Musk in criticising the EU and UK over online safety rules.\n\nElsewhere on social media, Metro leads on the Labour Party apologising after using a TikTok backing track with lyrics boasting about drugs and violence against women.\n\nWhistleblowers have told a public enquiry special forces allegedly had a “deliberate policy” of executing Afghan civilians, the Daily Telegraph reports.\n\nBoth the Daily Mail and The Times report A&E departments across Britain are full due to a winter flu outbreak.\n\nMore than 700 current and former McDonalds employees are suing the fast-food giant over allegations teenagers were sexually abused, according to the Daily Mirror.\n\nThe Daily Express writes the UK’s wintry blast could bring temperatures as low as minus 20C.\n\nThe Sun splashes on a “cash crisis” on the popular soap opera Coronation Street, with Charlotte Jenkins the fifth star to leave in just a month.\n\nLastly, the Daily Star leads on advice from actor Brian Blessed, who gives readers tips on surviving a yeti attack.","summary":"Here are the biggest stories leading Wednesday’s front pages.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/meta-guardian-presidentelect-elon-musk-the-guardian-b1203496.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/01/08/00/0447c21ad133f3f45915350d9f1e9411Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM2Mzc5NTM3-2.33243395.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:10:37","author":"Jessica Coates","authors":["Jessica Coates"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.09},{"id":279096762,"title":"Gregg Jarrett slams ‘key players’ in the ‘crooked lawfare campaign’ against Trump","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Evening Edit January 07, 2025 04:46 \n\n Gregg Jarrett slams ‘key players’ in the ‘crooked lawfare campaign’ against Trump \n Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett discusses the legal battles facing President-elect Donald Trump on ‘The Evening Edit.’\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE EVENING EDIT | LATEST EPISODESTHE EVENING EDITV-VIDEOSPOLITICS","summary":"Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett discusses the legal battles facing President-elect Donald Trump on ‘The Evening Edit.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6366791861112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/b1dcec46-672a-40fd-a6a1-7b8db1576745/5417c529-3d68-4b38-8b41-268354c75b39/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:09:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.242},{"id":279093936,"title":"Will Donald Trump Govern From Florida?","text":"The president has been spending a lot of time there in recent months. He watched the results come in on Election Night and held an exclusive watch party for his closest friends and family. He's also been making decisions about his upcoming administration and hosting world leaders there since his November victory. At the end of his first term, he took advantage of the Former Presidents Act and set up an official office at the resort, so using it as a home base makes sense, but now, some are wondering if he'll even govern from there once he officially takes office on January 20. \n\nBased on a \"series of exclusive interviews with sources close to Trump and his family,\" People magazine published an article today speculating that this may be the case. They even had a quote from a \"political source\" that said, \"I think Trump will try to run the nation from Mar-a-Lago. He has always wanted to do that. He is blissfully happy in Palm Beach.\" \n\nEarlier, I wrote about the current winter storm impacting the D.C. area, and when you compare that to what I imagine Palm Beach is like today, well, let's just say I can understand why Trump wants to be there. While it's going to take more than an \"exclusive source\" from People magazine to convince me that he'll govern from Mar-a-Lago, my question is: Does it matter? \n\nI guess to the left it does. \n\nA few weeks ago, Tim Smart, executive editor of U.S. News & World Report, published an article entitled \"Trump Is Making America Florida,\" in which he points out that the president \"holds court much like Louis XIV did at the Palace of Versailles.\" He goes on to point out the number of Floridians who will likely be a part of the upcoming administration and reminds us that \"The history books say that America’s seat of government is in Washington, D.C.\" \n\nHe ends the article with this: \"Trump is not a creature of Congress or state politics, and his brand is built around the idea of challenging the established rules and mores of Washington. To the extent that those Floridians he has chosen are seen as outsiders, it may bode well for their future political fortunes – and those of their state.\" I suppose that's meant to be negative, but I'd argue that's why Trump won the election, and those people running things in Florida are why record numbers of Americans want to move to the Sunshine State. \n\nAlso, \"making America Florida\" seems a lot more fun than making America North Korea, which is what the last four years have felt like, but I digress. \n\nAnyway, I did a little research to find out if there are any legal reasons that the president has to live in the White House and work in the Oval Office, and it doesn't appear that it's required. The Oval Office wasn't really even a thing until 1909, according to the White House Historical Association (WHHA). Thomas Jefferson did his work in the State Dining Room. \n\nBut even so, most presidents before that still worked in various parts of the White House. And aside from George Washington, who chose the site for the White House, every other president has lived there thus far. Several governors, however, have turned down living in their state's mansions. And according to WHHA historian Joel Treese, some presidents may not move into the White House right away. \n\nIf any president is going to buck tradition, I suppose it would be Trump. That's what he does best. The People article also suggests that living in the White House would make it difficult for Trump's advisor and good buddy Elon Musk to have the access he does now — Musk is reportedly living in a rented home near Mar-a-Lago — but it's hard to say how any of this will play out. \n\nPersonally, I'm sure Trump will be back and forth, and I really don't care where Trump spends most of his time as long as he does the things he says he's gonna do. If it takes a little extra Florida warmth and sunshine to make that happen, so be it. And I mean, it's not like we don't hear about Joe Biden being trotted off to a \"Delaware beach\" every other week. I guess the difference is that Biden isn't really governing at this point.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/sarah-anderson/2025/01/07/will-donald-trump-govern-from-florida-n4935762","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/7/9ce8d59e-c2c7-4bd4-927d-af56b040ddd9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:09:19","author":"Sarah Anderson","authors":["Sarah Anderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.045},{"id":279093938,"title":"Okay, Trump Is Serious About Acquiring Greenland, and the Game Is Heating Up","text":"When Trump first broached the idea of the U.S. buying Greenland during his first term, the media treated it as a joke. It is clear now, however, that Trump himself is not laughing, and never has been. He is deadly serious, not just about Greenland, but about the Panama Canal, as well as, most likely, about Canada. When questioned on Tuesday about his designs on Greenland, Trump offered two reasons for why he thought it was in America’s interest to obtain the territory and even threatened Denmark if it didn’t comply.\n\nTrump said that the U.S. needed Greenland as a matter of national security:\n\nWe need Greenland for national security purposes. I’ve been told that for a long time, long before I even ran, I mean, people have been talking about it for a long time. You have approximately 45,000 people there. People really don’t even know if Denmark has any legal right to it, but if they do, they should give it up, because we need it for national security. That’s for the free world. I’m talking about protecting the free world. You look at — you don’t even need binoculars. You look outside, you have China, ships all over the place, you have Russian ships all over the place. We’re not lettin’ that happen. We’re not letting it happen.\n\nThen came the threat to Denmark:\n\nAnd if Denmark wants to, uh, get to a conclusion — but nobody knows if they even have any right title or interest, the people are gonna probably vote for independence, or to come into the United States. But if they did do that, then I would tariff Denmark at a very high level.\n\nLeaving aside the question of whether or not Denmark really has any legal title over Greenland, Trump’s warning of tariffs was perfectly reasonable. Acquiring Greenland, he said, was a matter of “protecting the free world.” That includes Denmark, which, after all, was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and so relies on the United States for its security. Trump seems to be working from the premise that the security that the U.S. provides for Denmark should not be a one-way street and that the Danes, along with the other NATO countries, should be expected to do what was best for the entire alliance.\n\nTrump left open the possibility of more than just tariffs. Regarding Greenland and the Panama Canal, a reporter asked him: “Can you assure the world that as you try to get control of these areas, you are not gonna use military or economic coercion?” Trump answered flatly: “No.” He explained: “I can’t assure you. You’re talking about Panama and Greenland. No, I can’t assure you on either of those two. But, uh, I can say this: we need them for economic security.” \n\nSo America needs Greenland for both national security and economic security. Is there any truth to this? Absolutely. Clingendael Research, a Dutch think tank that produces “state-of-the-art analyses and policy research in international affairs for governments, businesses and NGO's,” reported that “in 2018, the People’s Republic of China published its first Arctic strategy, claiming that the Middle Kingdom is a ‘near-Arctic state.’” It added that “it is quickly becoming clear that China has built a geostrategic presence in the Arctic that is not to be sniggered at. It is already reshaping circumpolar politics in fundamental ways.” \n\nThe report detailed intense Chinese activity in Greenland beginning in 2005 and noted that “the void created when Greenland was given greater autonomy [in 2009] from central authorities in the Kingdom of Denmark and subsequently left the EEC was happily filled by China. Even though the Kingdom of Denmark remains responsible for foreign policy and defence, Greenland can now conclude international agreements with foreign states on its own. This raises issues for both the Kingdom of Denmark and the EU.” Yet “While the Arctic rises in geopolitical and geo-economic significance, the EU has been slow to reconsider its strategic interests.”\n\nCanada, the Panama Canal, and Now Greenland. What’s Behind Trump’s Expansionist Rhetoric?\n\nDonald Trump, however, has not. He appears to understand the strategic interests involved in Greenland better than most Western foreign policy analysts and is ready to counter the growing Chinese activity there. He knows that the Danes are both unable and unwilling to stand up to China. America will not be.\n\nTrump’s position on Greenland, as derided and ridiculed as it has been, thus makes perfect sense from an America-First standpoint. Will he be able to convince the Danes — and a sufficient number of Americans — that his Greenland policy is sound and worth pursuing? That remains to be seen. Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredericksen has already reiterated Denmark’s position from Trump’s first term, that Greenland is not for sale. But this story is not over.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/robert-spencer/2025/01/07/okay-trump-is-serious-about-acquiring-greenland-and-the-game-is-heating-up-n4935764","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/170/09b92d6b-7d2a-4a81-a9cd-029680f47470.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:09:19","author":"Robert Spencer","authors":["Robert Spencer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":279093788,"title":"‘Hell will break loose’: Trump hints at military moves in Mideast, Americas","text":"United States President-elect Donald Trump has hinted at possible military intervention in the Americas and the Middle East, as well as other items on his foreign policy agenda, during a wide-ranging news conference in Florida.\n\nTrump spoke from his Mar-a-Lago estate on Tuesday, a day after Congress officially certified his victory in November’s general elections. The news conference also comes just 13 days before Trump is set to the oath of office for his second term on January 20.\n\nThe president-elect touched on several domestic subjects, pledging to roll back environmental restrictions and pardon supporters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nBut his most consequential statements concerned foreign policy. Trump expounded on a sweeping expansionist vision, with consequences for countries across the world.\n\nHe repeated his desire for US control of the Panama Canal, Greenland and Canada, while emphasising that “all hell will break out” if captives held in Gaza are not released before he takes office.\n\nIn one exchange with reporters, Trump was asked if he would rule out the use of military force or economic coercion to take control of the Panama Canal or Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. He refused.\n\n“I’m not going to commit to that,” Trump said. He then pivoted to the canal, an arterial trade route that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. “It might be that you’ll have to do something. The Panama Canal is vital to our country.”\n\nHe later added, “We need Greenland for national security purposes.”\n\nBoth Greenland’s and Denmark’s prime ministers have ruled out the prospect of the sprawling Arctic island being transferred to US control.\n\nAnd the government of Panama has likewise maintained that the canal will remain Panamanian, as it has been since the US relinquished control in 1999, following a treaty negotiated under late US President Jimmy Carter.\n\nEyes on Canada\n\nTrump also made bold statements about his intentions towards Canada, one of the US’s largest trading partners.\n\nThe country shares a 8,891-kilometre (5,525-mile) border with the US, and Trump in recent weeks has suggested it should become the US’s 51st state.\n\nBut during Tuesday’s press conference, he ruled out using military force against Canada, which has traditionally been a close ally — though not “economic force”.\n\n“You get rid of the artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what it looks like, and it would also be much better for national security,” Trump said, referring to the US-Canada border.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quickly responded to the prospect on social media.\n\n“There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” Trudeau wrote.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, renewed his pledge to impose “substantial tariffs” on Mexico and Canada if they do not acquiesce to demands to stem irregular migration and drug trafficking into the US.\n\nTrump had previously threatened to slap 25-percent tariffs on the two countries, despite warnings from economists that trade wars could mangle heavily interconnected North American industries.\n\nIn another reference to changing the regional map, Trump said the Gulf of Mexico should be named the “Gulf of America”. It has a “beautiful ring to it”, he quipped.\n\n‘Hell will break out’\n\nTrump spent considerable time discussing Israel’s war in Gaza, a conflict that has claimed more than 45,885 Palestinian lives and prompted fears of grave human rights abuses.\n\nThe president-elect called his nominee to be Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, up to the podium to give an update on negotiations.\n\nWitkoff, a real-estate investor with no foreign policy experience, had been part of recent ceasefire talks in the Middle East.\n\nIn apparently impromptu remarks, Witkoff said, “I think that we’ve had some really great progress, and I’m really hopeful that by the inaugural we’ll have some good things to announce on behalf of the president.”\n\nBut the president-elect took a harsher line, focusing on the release of the remaining captives held by Hamas after the attack on October 8, 2023, in southern Israel. Israel estimates about 100 people remain in Hamas custody.\n\nTrump vowed that “all hell will break out” in the Middle East if Hamas does not release captives by the time he takes office.\n\nSome observers have interpreted Trump’s statement as a threat of possible US military intervention in Gaza, a line that outgoing President Joe Biden has refused to cross, despite surging military aid to Israel.\n\nWhen asked to explain what he meant at the news conference, Trump baulked: “Do I have to define it for you? All hell will break out if those hostages aren’t back.”\n\n“If they’re not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. All hell will break out. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is,” he said.\n\nSyria policy\n\nTrump gave a characteristically cryptic answer when asked about the future of US troops in Syria. The Pentagon says about 2,000 US personnel remain in the country as part of a mission to curb the armed group ISIL (ISIS).\n\nBut questions have arisen about long-term US involvement in Syria after former President Bashar al-Assad was topped in early December.\n\nUS troops have supported the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria since 2014, as a multi-pronged civil war unfolded in the country.\n\nBut that backing put Washington at odds with its NATO ally Turkiye, which considers members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG) — the bulk of the SDF’s fighters — to be “terrorists”.\n\nTurkiye, by contrast, has supported the rebel groups that ultimately overthrew al-Assad.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump floated the possibility of withdrawing US troops from Syria. And as recently as December, he posted on his Truth Social platform that the US should have “nothing to do” with Syria.\n\nBut in Tuesday’s news conference, he opted instead for ambiguity about the future of US involvement in Syria.\n\n“I won’t tell you that, because that’s part of a military strategy,” he said.\n\nInstead, he heaped praise on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom he called a “friend” and a “very smart guy”.\n\n“He sent his people in there [Syria] through different forms and different names, and they went in, they took over, and that’s the way it is,” Trump said.\n\nSome analysts have speculated that Trump may be more amenable than past US presidents to turning over anti-ISIL operations to Turkiye.\n\nNATO to pay more\n\nTrump also weighed in on other NATO allies, saying the transatlantic alliance’s 32 members should increase their defence spending to five percent of their gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThat is a significant increase from the current minimum goal of two percent.\n\nTrump has regularly accused members of the alliance of underpaying and has suggested withdrawing if the spending does not increase.\n\n“They can all afford it, but they should be at five percent not two percent,” Trump said.\n\n“If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with NATO,” he added. But he warned he might revoke his support if he does not feel the US is treated fairly.\n\nIn one anecdote, he compared NATO allies to debtors delinquent on their bills: “If you are delinquent, we will not protect you.”\n\nThe threat comes as NATO has taken on increased significance amid Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022.\n\nTrump has long maintained Russia’s invasion would not have happened on his watch. On Tuesday, he again pledged to broker a speedy resolution.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/hell-will-break-loose-trump-hints-at-military-moves-in-mideast-americas/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2024/12/AP24352849950492-1734821667-ACJUSv.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:07:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":0.107},{"id":279093786,"title":"US judge temporarily blocks release of Trump investigations report","text":"A United States judge has temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack Smith from releasing a report on his investigation into President-elect Donald Trump for his mishandling of classified documents.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who presided over the now-dismissed case against Trump, directed the US Department of Justice not to release the report until a federal appeals court rules on a request from his two former co-defendants.\n\nThose co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, remain the subject of a continuing appeal. They have argued that the report’s release could interfere with their right to a fair hearing.\n\nA criminal indictment in the classified documents case was announced in June 2023, when prosecutors alleged that Trump and Nauta, his aide, defied a federal subpoena to turn over records containing defence intelligence and other sensitive materials after leaving public office.\n\nProsecutors also accused the two of attempting to conceal the documents and cover up the evidence that they had done so.\n\nDe Oliveira, a maintenance worker at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, was charged in August 2023 in an updated indictment, where he was implicated in an alleged conspiracy to delete surveillance footage.\n\nTrump is the first US president ever to face criminal charges. He has since been convicted in a separate criminal case, over falsifying business documents in New York.\n\nThe classified documents case, meanwhile, has hit several hurdles since it was first announced.\n\nJudge Cannon, a Trump appointee, tossed the case last July, arguing in her decision that the position of “special counsel” had not been congressionally approved.\n\nThat ran contrary to years of legal precedent: Special counsels have been commonly approved to provide independent legal counsel in cases where there may otherwise be a conflict of interest.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland, a member of the administration of President Joe Biden, appointed Smith in 2022 to serve in that role for investigations regarding Trump.\n\nIn addition to the classified documents case, Smith has also probed Trump’s alleged attempts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. That resulted in a separate criminal indictment in August 2023.\n\nBoth federal cases were dropped last November, after Trump won a second term in office. Smith also announced his intention to resign before Trump’s inauguration, at which point the Republican leader will control the Justice Department.\n\n“It has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President,” Smith wrote in a legal submission at the time.\n\nSmith’s report is said to contain two volumes: one about the classified documents case and the other about the election interference case. But a spokesperson for Smith’s office declined to comment on Judge Cannon’s order on Monday, barring its release.\n\nJustice Department regulations require Smith to submit a final report to Garland, who has previously pledged to make public all reports from special counsels during his tenure.\n\nTrump applauded Judge Cannon’s decision during a question-and-answer segment at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe has long denounced the prosecutions as a politically motivated attempt to block him from returning to power. On Monday, he repeatedly called Smith a “disgrace”.\n\n“He wanted to do a report just before I take office probably, so he’ll do like a 500-page report, and it’ll be a fake report, just like the investigation was a fake investigation,” Trump told reporters, upon learning the news.\n\n“So if they’re not allowed to issue the report, that’s the way it should be. Because he was thrown off the case in disgrace. Why should he be allowed to write a fake report?”","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-release-of-trump-investigations-report/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2025/01/AP23215803846679-1732623988-dtyukw.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-08 00:07:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":279093744,"title":"Indian stocks will benefit from the Trump 2.0 era, portfolio manager says","text":"Investors eyeing up firms with the potential to become the “blue chip companies of the future” should look to India, according to GIB Asset Management’s Kunal Desai.\n\nThe portfolio manager said India’s geopolitical positioning is “favorable in this Trump 2.0 era” as investors assess the country’s ability to take advantage of a possible trade war between China and the U.S.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has pledged to impose big tariffs on goods from China when he takes office.

Biden warned on Monday that America risks a repeat of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot if the history of the day is forgotten, and called on the country to \"commit to remembering\" the incident annually. \"But we should not forget.

The hosts savaged the op-ed as being out of step with the American electorate, conceding that the majority of voters \"didn’t care\" about the events of January 6. \"Biden’s op-ed didn’t say anything,\" Favreau said. \"An op-ed about Jan. 6 is the perfect encapsulation of how feckless everything feels in this moment.\" The Democratic Party has faced increasing calls to change how it communicates with voters, with critics alleging that it relies on overly \"woke\" and academic rhetoric that alienates ordinary people. Clinton campaign alum James Carville called on Democrats to tone down the \"idiotic NPR jargon\" when talking to voters in an interview Sunday with MSNBC host Jen Psaki. \"Let’s just be authentic and to the point,\" Carville said. The hosts continued to bash Biden’s op-ed for failing to offer any concrete steps to fight back against what they see as a \"coup attempt\" by Trump.
