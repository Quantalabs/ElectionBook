The event, which drew a packed house, highlighted Trump's strategy and messaging as he faces a tightening race against Vice President Kamala Harris in this crucial battleground state.Trump's appearance came just days after Harris' own rally at the same venue this week, which attracted an estimated 10,000 supporters, including a performance by rapper Megan Thee Stallion.The former president had no musical guests but invited other Republican politicians and community leaders onto the podium throughout his speech.Here are the main takeaways from Saturday's rally in Atlanta:Relitigating the 2020 Election and Attacks on Local LeadershipTrump continued to falsely claim victory in Georgia, stating he won the state twice. He attacked Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who had refused to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump suggested, without evidence, that they were working against him in the 2024 election.The former president earlier in the day took to Truth Social to blast Kemp being disloyal to the Republican party while ripping apart his crime record in the state.The Georgia governor responded on X, formerly Twitter, asking Trump to leave his family alone: \"My focus is on winning this November and saving our country from Kamala Harris and the Democrats - not engaging in petty personal insults, attacking fellow Republicans, or dwelling on the past.\"He ended the post with, \"You should do the same, Mr. President, and leave my family out of it.\"Newsweek contacted Kemp and Trump's office via email on Saturday for comment.Focus on Legal ChallengesThe former president discussed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and the Georgia election interference case against him, making mocking and provocative comments about Willis's relationship with former lead prosecutor Nathan Wade.In June, lawyers for Trump filed an opening brief in the Georgia Court of Appeals seeking to remove Willis from the former president's election subversion case in Georgia.In a statement, Trump's lead defense counsel Steve Sadow argued that Willis' improper relationship with former Fulton County prosecutor Wade is grounds to have the district attorney disqualified from the case.The former president and 18 other co-defendants face racketeering charges accusing them of attempting to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden in the state of Georgia.Relations with RussiaThe former president commented on a recent prisoner swap involving Russia. Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin, asserting that the deal was favorable for the leader while criticizing the terms for the United States.The historic prisoner swap with the Biden administration this week that resulted in the release of the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and security contractor Paul Whelan. \"I'd like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal,\" Trump said of the Russian president.He concluded: \"Boy, we make some horrible, horrible deals.\"Outreach to Black votersPrior to the rally, Trump reportedly met backstage with Black business leaders, signaling an effort to expand his support among African American voters. During the rally, Trump invited Black political consultant and Conserve the Culture founder Michaelah Montgomery on stage with him twice, further emphasizing his attempt to appeal to Black voters.Montgomery praised Trump for \"saving\" her beloved Clark Atlanta University, a prominent Historically Black College and University (HBCU), located in Georgia. In 2019, Trump signed a bipartisan bill intended to provide more than $250 million a year to historic Black colleges, reported the Associated Press.However, previously speaking to The Washington Post, Marybeth Gasman, a Rutgers professor and authority on HBCUs, said Trump's involvement was likely to have been limited.\"Congress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it,\" Gasman said.As the election approaches, both campaigns are intensifying their efforts to mobilize supporters and win over undecided voters in Georgia. The state's 16 electoral votes could prove crucial in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, making every campaign stop and policy position in Georgia potentially significant in this hotly contested race.","summary":"The former president said he didn't need any musical guests at his Atlanta rally.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-georgia-atlanta-rally-key-takeaways-1934261","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442421/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 00:48:58","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":253325028,"title":"Aaron Judge’s Latest Big Day  Highlighted By A Unique Intentional Walk","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin New York Yankees' Aaron Judge singles on a sharp line drive during the eighth inning of a baseball ...

On Friday, the lack of hustle shown by Gleyber Torres was rightfully a key talking point of the Yankees getting their five-game winning streak stopped. Less than 24 hours later, the topic of Torres being pulled was still being discussed but that was before Toronto Blue Jays manager John Schneider showed some hustle of his own. Schneider was not batting or admiring any fly balls thought to be home runs only to turn into singles. Instead, tired of watching balls hustle off the bat of Aaron Judge and into the seats, Schneider opted to get Judge out of the batter’s box in the quickest possible way with an intentional walk. It was not quite the strategy of Carlos Mendoza, who opted to unintentionally walk Judge four times before allowing since released reliever Jake Diekman to pitch and strike out to slugger to end a 3-2 victory for the Mets on July 23. Instead this was a most unique intentional free pass and perhaps the most unique of any of the 56 times an opposing pitcher purposely walked Judge. It occurred with two outs and nobody on in the second inning, a feat so rare it had not happened since the Yankees were in the final years of playing at the original Yankee Stadium where the monuments were on the field.

Back then Rudy May was instructed to intentionally walk Glenn Borgman to face Ray Corbin since it was the final year in the American League where pitchers hit. May won 152 games in 16-year career that included two stints with the Yankees and stops with the Baltimore Orioles and Montreal Expos. Borgman wound up hitting .229 in 474 career games with the Twins and Chicago White Sox. So it was not quite the circumstance of Saturday afternoon when a manager exasperated with a superstar constantly going deep opted to do the best thing possible to avoid another repeat of the first inning even if was with two outs and nobody on in the second inning. “I honestly didn't feel like seeing him swing,” Schneider said. “That was kind of it. We talked about being really careful with him and I think like I said, that's what can lead to mistakes when you're really trying to be very fine. And at that point, it's 4-1. “He's in a different category I think than anyone else in the league where he can just flip the script of a game with one swing. Obviously he's done it twice this series, so didn't really feel like watching him swing.\" The difference between Mendoza’s strategy and Schneider’s game plan also involved in the length of the lineup. When Mendoza opted to rarely face Judge, J.D. Davis was hitting fourth and the Yankees were struggling to consistently produce while they missed Giancarlo Stanton. This time, an improving Austin Wells was hitting fourth, Torres was batting fifth and newcomer Jazz Chisholm Jr. was the sixth hitter as he continued to play well since being acquired a week ago. “We’ve seen it every now and then; we saw it a little bit in ’22, maybe,” manager Aaron Boone said. “You kind of understand, take your shots where you can. But I feel like we’re in a better spot to deal with those things. The length of our lineup has really improved here over the last few weeks.” The Yankees are about a .500 team in the 53 games Judge has been intentionally walked. In 2022 on the way to hitting 62 homers and breaking Roger Maris’ AL record, Judge was walked purposely 19 times in 16 games and the Yankees were 9-7 in those games. “It doesn’t surprise me. He’s the best hitter in the game,” Yankees starter Carlos Rodon said. “As a fan, it’s like, ‘He’s probably going to hit a home run or walk.’ He always puts a good at-bat together. There’s not much chase there, and when he makes contact, he does damage. It’s fun to watch, and it’s a must-watch every at-bat, that’s for sure.” It is hard to blame any manager for intentionally walking someone with 41 homers and 103 RBIs and especially after seeing Kevin Gausman allowed a 470-foot blast and Jose Berrios allow a 426-foot shot in the first innings of the last two games. “We’re watching greatness,” Boone said. “You try not to take that for granted, what we’re seeing [No.] 99 do.” It also is a sign of respect as noted by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. who is hitting over .500 during a 16-game hitting streak to possibly be hitting hotter than Judge and doing so in a lineup with George Springer leading off and several young players behind him due to Toronto’s unexpected pivot to being sellers at the trade deadline. \"Of course, intentionally walking him is the respect that he earned,” Guerrero said through translator Hector LeBron.

The former president, 78, declared that “Laken’s blood is on Kamala Harris’ hands,” during a rally at the Georgia State University Convocation Center in Atlanta Saturday — where Harris, 59, ripped Trump during a campaign event days earlier. “Kamala Harris let in the savage monster who killed Laken Riley,” Trump railed. “Kamala is responsible for the death as though she were watching it herself,” he added. Riley, a nursing student at the University of Augusta, was jogging on the campus of the University of Georgia on Feb. 22 when she was attacked and killed. Her battered body was found in a wooded area near Lake Herrick. Officials determined she died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her killer, 26-year-old Venezuelan national Jose Ibarra, entered the US illegally in El Paso, Texas, in September 2022, but was released after about a day in custody. He has been linked to the Venezuelan gang El Tren de Aragua. Ibarra pleaded not guilty to 10 charges linked to her murder. “Kamala Harris should not be asking your vote, she should be begging Laken Riley’s family for forgiveness,” he said to cheers. During his 90-minute remarks, Trump also “congratulated” Russian President Vladimir Putin for making “another great deal” in the latest prisoner swap with the US that saw Wall Street Journalist Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan and 14 others released from a Russian prison Thursday. “They released some of the greatest killers anywhere in the world,” Trump said of those President Biden, 81, and other Western leaders turned over to Russia to secure their release. “It’s nice to say we got them back but does that set a bad precedent,” he warned. Trump also chimed in on the controversy over Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who was previously disqualified from an international female boxing competition but was cleared by the IOC to compete in the Olympics, where she secured a medal on Saturday. Trump recalled the fight in which her Italian opponent, Angela Carini, quit just 46 seconds into the fight. He referred to Khelif, who was born a biological female, as “he.” “[Carini] got hit so hard she didn’t know what the hell hit her … he was a good male boxer. And she didn’t even go down. He hurt with two jabs and she said ‘I’m out,’” he said. Trump has repeatedly promised to keep men out of women’s sports, if elected.","summary":"\"Kamala is responsible for the death as though she were watching it herself.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/03/us-news/trump-blames-harris-for-laken-rileys-murder-allegedly-by-illegal-migrant/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-t94dxud4n-1722730264721.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722715931&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kZFRjMvM-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-04 00:29:15","author":"Patrick Reilly","authors":["Patrick Reilly"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.534},{"id":253324594,"title":"WWE SummerSlam 2024 Results: LA Knight Beats Logan Paul To Win First Title","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin LA Knight won his first singles title in WWE at SummerSlam. (Credit: WWE/Getty Images) Getty Images Logan Paul held the WWE United States Championship for nearly 300 days, but in just his third title defense during that span, the social media star dropped the title to fan favorite LA Knight at SummerSlam. In front of a massive crowd in Cleveland Browns Stadium, the beloved Knight blasted Paul with a BFT to a thunderous ovation from the crowd and pinned Paul to win his first singles title in WWE. The win for Knight, of course, was a long time coming after more than just a couple instances of WWE dropping the ball with “The Megastar.” At both last year’s Money in the Bank and this year’s event, Knight was a sentimental favorite to win the coveted briefcase, cash in and become world champion. But that never happened. Instead, Knight—despite his immense popularity—spent much of the past year being largely overlooked on SmackDown due to the blue brand’s focus on The Bloodline saga. Just as Knight was somewhat forgotten, so too was the US title. As fantastic as Paul is in the ring and as an on-screen character for someone so new to pro wrestling, his United States title reign was the anti-Gunther reign, if you will—a championship run that devalued rather than raised the prestige of that title.

After winning the belt from Rey Mysterio at Crown Jewel in November 2023, Paul defended the title roughly once every three months, once at Royal Rumble, another at WrestleMania and then at SummerSlam. Part of the reason why is that Paul had a brief WWE title feud with Cody Rhodes, one that demonstrated that the heel side of SmackDown is paper thin outside of The Bloodline. With Bobby Lashley potentially set to depart WWE as well, that problem has only been magnified by Paul’s sporadic appearances and the way he held the US title hostage. The United States Championship picture has been a stark contrast from Raw’s Intercontinental title scene, which was carried by Gunther for nearly two years and now is the centerpiece of a strong feud between Sami Zayn and rising star Bron Breakker. It’s been borderline bizarre seeing how masterfully WWE has booked the Intercontinental Championship only for the US title to become essentially an afterthought until Knight began to target it. Even then, Knight’s US title win—no matter how much the crowd loved it—feels a little like a consolation prize. With the WWE Championship scene booked out so far in advance and only a handful of top stars having a real shot at dethroning Rhodes, Knight settled for the US title instead. In fact, even Knight himself said he was “frustrated” in early 2024 when he wasn’t factored into the world title plans, which is understandable given his undeniable popularity. While the US Championship certainly isn’t the WWE title, Knight has a chance to do what Gunther did with the IC title and elevate the US belt to new heights on SmackDown. If anyone can do it, it’s Knight. And judging by that crowd reaction in Cleveland, the fans believe he can do it, too. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

He has had to step aside at the height of his re-election campaign, but immediately endorsed his Vice-President, Kamala Harris, to head the Demo-cratic ticket. He thereby averted any party chaos from his premature departure, giving his country and the world a chance to avoid disaster. Thank you, Joe. It led to a flood of support for Kamala Harris. In the first week of her campaign alone, she raised “a record-shattering haul” of US$200 million, with 66% coming from first-time donors, indicating “tremendous grassroots support”. Over 100,000 new campaign volunteers signed up in the first four days. Leading party figures Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jefferies, state governors and congressmen/women endorsed the new candidate along with the critical black and Hispanic caucuses. Identity groups have expressed support: the Black Women, White Women, South Asian Americans, Black Men for Harris and White Dudes for Harris. She leads nationally among blacks, Asians, Latinos, women, independents and younger voters including Generation Z. National Interest editor Jacob Heilbrunn, speaking in the Financial Times, thinks she can win big. She hit the campaign trail with confidence, wisely focusing first on the six swing states—Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia—where polls show the race tightening as Harris gains ground. In just one week, “Harris and Trump are now neck and neck nationally,” says the Financial Times. At a massive rally in Atlanta, she challenged Trump to the September debate, telling him stop throwing insults from afar. “Say it to my face,” she declared, and the crowd roared. There is great enthusiasm among Democrats. Crowds are dancing, celebrities are turning up, all auguring well for turnout, paramount in this election. Kamala now has enough delegates to -secure the party’s nomination tomorrow. “I couldn’t be prouder,” says Joe Biden. The world is watching, the majority hoping fervently for a Harris victory. They see the threat from Donald Trump and know Harris will fundamentally follow the global path pursued by Biden, strengthening world democracy in its battle against autocracy, a critical challenge facing humanity. It is a danger that would be potentiated irretrievably with Donald Trump leading the most powerful nation on earth, threatening human rights and freedoms in America and the world. He recently exhorted evangelicals to go out and vote, promising that if he wins America will be “fixed” and they “would never have to vote again”. This man wants to eradicate elections in the United States! At the international level, he berated European leaders while coddling dictators Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un and threatening to withdraw America from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Biden quickly repaired the transatlantic relationship, critical for countering the threat from the world’s major autocracies, China and Russia supported by North Korea and Iran. He also ensured NATO grew stronger. Finland and Sweden joined, adding their potent militaries, making it a 32-nation military organisation, critical for the defence of its members. The Asia Pacific also received significant attention. Biden revitalised the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) with the US, Japan, Australia and India for a free and open Indo Pacific; created AUKUS with the US, UK and Australia to help Canberra acquire nuclear-powered submarines to counter Beijing; and established a three-way defence pact involving the US with its two East Asian allies, Japan and South Korea. His bilateral pacts rein-force the multilateral arrange-ments. The US now has access to multiple airfields and naval bases in the Philippines, reducing the necessity for aircraft carriers that could be targeted by China’s long-range missiles and submarines. Also, to strengthen the US/Japan Mutual Defence Treaty, Washington is sending the most advanced Tomahawk cruise missiles to Japan and has established a Marine Corps regiment on Okinawa capable of fighting from small islands and destroying ships at sea. The Australian government hosts US Marines in the north of the country, and Washington also has a new security agreement with -Papua New Guinea. Biden also developed a major defence partnership with India, a world military power, as they face a common challenge—China. He has also been actively supporting Taiwan in strengthening its military capabilities against a Chinese invasion. Through “Integrated Deterrence” and “force multiplication” among US allies, Biden produced an amazing network of bi-lateral and multi-lateral alliances for the protection of global democracy. “Alliances make a difference,” he has said. In the Middle East he was about to achieve a historic rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world, particularly Saudi Arabia. This was deliberately derailed by Iran with its sponsored Hamas attack on Israel, knowing it would precipitate the present war in Gaza and push back Biden’s new paradigm for the Middle East where all-out war now looms. This President has had phenomenal achievement in foreign relations. If Donald Trump wins in November, the Biden architecture for the protection of global democracy would be destroyed. The world is depending on a Kamala Harris victory to avert that tragedy. —Ralph Maraj","summary":"History will record Joe Biden as one of the best presidents of the United States, with outstanding achievements, particularly in the economy and international affairs.

The announcement drew a sharp reaction from Harris, who criticized Trump for what she saw as an attempt to avoid a fair confrontation.Trump announced his social media platform, Truth Social, saying that the debate would feature a \"full arena audience\" and take place in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.Trump's proposal echoes the format of the first debate he had with President Joe Biden, who has since exited the reelection race. The second debate was originally planned for September 10 on ABC News, but Trump suggested moving it to Fox News, a network favored by his supporters. Harris, who officially secured the Democratic nomination on Friday, responded by reaffirming her commitment to the original debate date.The change, which Trump announced, raised objections from the Harris campaign and appeared to throw a potential showdown between the rivals into question. 112256753A campaign official for Harris on Saturday accused Trump of scheming up the Fox News debate to distract from reneging on his commitment to the ABC debate. Trump had agreed to that debate in May, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.“Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out,” Michael Tyler, communications director for the Harris campaign, said. “He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10.”Tyler said that the Harris campaign was open to discussing further debates if Trump honored his commitment to the ABC debate.A spokesperson for ABC News would not say whether the network would go ahead with its debate and give time only to Harris, reported NYT.Harris took a direct jab at Trump, questioning his sudden change of plans. “It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe space,’” Harris remarked. She reaffirmed her commitment to the scheduled debate, adding, “I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there.”— KamalaHarris (@KamalaHarris) According to Trump’s post on his social media site, the Fox News debate would take place on Sept 4 at a to-be-determined location in Pennsylvania. The network’s anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum would moderate.Trump said on social media that the Fox News debate would have a live audience; the previous debate between him and Biden was hosted by CNN in an empty venue. Although both campaigns agreed to the format of the first debate, Trump had bemoaned the lack of a crowd.Besides, at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday night, Trump continued to take jabs at Harris, this time targeting her racial identity. He falsely suggested that Harris had downplayed her Black heritage, an accusation he made earlier to the National Association of Black Journalists. Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, identifies as both Black and Asian.During the rally, Trump mocked the pronunciation of Harris’ first name and called her a \"lunatic,\" further escalating the personal attacks that have characterized his campaign rhetoric.Trump also claimed that the ABC debate was \"terminated\" due to Biden’s withdrawal and his own ongoing litigation with the network. However, ABC had recently outlined qualification requirements for the debate without mentioning any specific candidates. These requirements, including polling support and state ballot access by September 3, reflect the tight race between Harris and Trump, who had maintained a lead over Biden after the first debate.ABC News and Fox News have both declined to comment on the status of the debate. Trump's proposal for the Fox debate came just after the Democratic National Committee launched an ad campaign accusing him of being \"afraid to debate\" and questioning his stance on abortion.David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who recently joined the Harris campaign, took to social media to criticize Trump’s move. “Now, he seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating someone his own age,\" Plouffe wrote, highlighting the age difference between Trump, 78, and Harris, 59.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-withdraws-from-abc-news-debate-proposes-fox-news-faceoff-with-harris-vp-taunts-safe-space-politics/articleshow/112256749.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-112256758/112256758.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 00:20:57","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.004},{"id":253324672,"title":"Judge overseeing Trump’s attempt to undermine federal election outcome denies defense motion to dismiss charges","text":"WASHINGTON – The federal judge presiding over the election subversion case against former President Donald Trump rejected Saturday a defense effort to dismiss the indictment on claims that he was prosecuted for vindictive and political purposes. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is the first substantive order since the case was returned to her Friday following a landmark Supreme Court opinion last month that conferred broad immunity for former presidents and narrowed special counsel Jack Smith’s case against Trump. In their motion to dismiss the indictment, defense lawyers argued that Trump was mistreated because he was prosecuted even though others who have challenged election results have avoided criminal charges. Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential race, also suggested that President Joe Biden and the Justice Department launched a prosecution to prevent him from winning reelection. But Chutkan rejected both arguments, saying Trump was not charged simply for challenging election results but instead for “knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings.” She also said that his lawyers had misread news media articles that they had cited in arguing that the prosecution was political in nature. “After reviewing Defendant’s evidence and arguments, the court cannot conclude that he has carried his burden to establish either actual vindictiveness or the presumption of it, and so finds no basis for dismissing this case on those grounds,” Chutkan wrote in her order. Also Saturday, she scheduled an Aug. 16 status conference to discuss next steps in the case. The four-count indictment, brought in August 2023, accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Biden through a variety of schemes, including by badgering his vice president, Mike Pence, to block the formal certification of electoral votes. Trump’s lawyers argued that he was immune from prosecution as a former president, and the case has been on hold since December as his appeal worked its way through the courts. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 opinion, held that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for core constitutional duties and are presumptively immune from prosecution for all other official acts. The justices sent the case back to Chutkan to determine which acts alleged in the indictment can remain part of the prosecution and which must be discarded.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – The federal judge presiding over the election subversion case against&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge overseeing Trump&#8217;s attempt to undermine federal election outcome denies defense motion to dismiss charges first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/judge-overseeing-trumps-attempt-to-undermine-federal-election-outcome-denies-defense-motion-to-dismiss-charges/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/9wScpSnT3xDtaWNCL_LNDKYoCnU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/NJQAIAG75NAKNORT3YGFRW5L3I.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-04 00:16:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":253324528,"title":"Kazakh uranium producer opens tender to buy sulfuric acid","text":"EN RU AZ TR FA News Terminal Menu Latest Azerbaijan Politics Economy Society Other News Economy Green Economy Oil&Gas ICT Finance Business Construction Transport Tourism Tenders Iran Nuclear Program Politics Business Society Central Asia Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan Turkmenistan Tajikistan Uzbekistan South Caucasus Armenia Georgia World Türkiye Russia Israel Arab World Other News Europe US Azernews.az İDMAN.BİZ DHA Press Kazakh uranium producer opens tender to buy sulfuric acid Home Economy Tenders Kazakh uranium producer opens tender to buy sulfuric acid Tenders Materials 4 August 2024 04:15 (UTC +04:00) Access to paid information is limited If You already have a account, please log in Login Register Subscription to paid content Gain access to all that Trend has to offer, as well as to premium, licensed content via subscription or direct purchase through a credit card.

As Business Insider's John Dorman reported, Walz could help connect with rural and working-class voters who are unsure about voting blue.Multiple Minnesota labor leaders have voiced support for Walz in an open letter to Harris, calling him an \"essential partner in winning in November.\"Walz also received support from United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain, who pointed out on CNN Walz's support for the 2023 UAW strike, which ended in October. Walz joined the picket line at a striking Stellantis facility in Plymouth, Minnesota.The Midwestern Democrat has also taken it upon himself to pit his rural roots against former President Donald Trump's VP pick, JD Vance, who is from Ohio.\"People like JD Vance know nothing about small-town America,\" Walz said during an appearance on \"Morning Joe.\"Walz is among several others being considered as a Harris running mate. Other contenders include Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, JB Pritzker of Illinois, and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, as well as Sen.

Adam Schiff predicted on Saturday that Harris' VP pick will be based on \"best running mate that will help her win.\"\"I think it's going to be less about who does she have the best chemistry with and more about who has the best chance of helping the ticket,\" he told CNN.Harris is expected to reveal her choice of running mate as early as Monday, sources told Reuters.The Harris campaign told Politico that Harris would stage her first rally with her running mate in Philadelphia on Tuesday.Representatives for Walz, Sanders, and Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Bernie Sanders, who endorsed Kamala Harris for president, said Gov.

In a series of Truth Social posts late Friday, the Republican nominee and former president said his agreement to a Sept. 10 debate on ABC “has been terminated” because he will no longer face Democratic President Joe Biden, who ended his campaign last month after a disastrous performance in their first debate. Trump now says he will appear on Fox News on Sept. 4 in Pennsylvania with rules that he called “similar” to his debate with Biden, but with a full audience instead of a mostly empty studio. Trump said that if Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, does not agree to the new network and date, he will do a “major Town Hall” with Fox News. Michael Tyler, a Harris spokesperson, said Trump “is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out.” It was not immediately clear whether ABC would turn its Sept. 10 event into a Harris town hall in Trump’s absence. Tyler said Harris is committed to the time slot and would appear “one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.” In a subsequent Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon, Trump said of Harris, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” Trump has gone back and forth on debating with Harris since she entered the presidential race. He had told reporters he felt an obligation to debate but also said in a recent Fox News interview that he thought Americans “already know everything” about both candidates Harris has pressed Trump to keep the commitment he made when Biden was in the race. Noting Trump’s criticisms of her, Harris dared him recently to “say it to my face.” In his Truth Social posts, Trump also cited his litigation against ABC News as “a conflict of interest” in his participation in the network’s debate. Trump sued the network in March following an assertion by anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found “liable for rape.” A New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll but rejected her claim that she was raped. But Trump agreed, two months after filing his lawsuit, to the Sept. 10 debate on ABC, as well as the June 27 debate on CNN that helped knock Biden out of the race. David Muir and Linsey Davis, not Stephanopoulos, are set to be ABC’s debate moderators. Trump has skipped debates before, including all the 2024 Republican presidential primary debates.

But Chutkan rejected both arguments, saying Trump was not charged simply for challenging election results but instead for “knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings.” She also said that his lawyers had misread news media articles that they had cited in arguing that the prosecution was political in nature. “After reviewing Defendant’s evidence and arguments, the court cannot conclude that he has carried his burden to establish either actual vindictiveness or the presumption of it, and so finds no basis for dismissing this case on those grounds,” Chutkan wrote in her order. Also Saturday, she scheduled an Aug. 16 status conference to discuss next steps in the case. The four-count indictment, brought in August 2023, accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Biden through a variety of schemes, including by badgering his vice president, Mike Pence, to block the formal certification of electoral votes. Trump’s lawyers argued that he was immune from prosecution as a former president, and the case has been on hold since December as his appeal worked its way through the courts. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 opinion, held that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for core constitutional duties and are presumptively immune from prosecution for all other official acts. The justices sent the case back to Chutkan to determine which acts alleged in the indictment can remain part of the prosecution and which must be discarded.","summary":"By ERIC TUCKER WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; The federal judge presiding over the election subversion case against former President Donald Trump rejected Saturday a defense effort to dismiss the indictment on claims that he was prosecuted for vindictive and political purposes.

It ran on ethanol made from hemp and other agricultural waste. Ford's bioplastic Model T was was lighter than fiberglass and times stronger than steel. Popular Mechanics, in its December 1941 issue, reported that \"Ford's experimental model was a step toward the realization of his dream to grow automobiles from soil and reduce greenhouse gases.\" When Ford was building his bio, car greenhouse gasses were already in the public eye and the car started a renewed public conversation on the merits of biomass versus fossil fuel. Shifting to a carbohydrate economy through hemp Curbing greenhouse gases and how to shift from a hydrocarbon economy to a carbohydrate economy lies in the use of crops like hemp. In 1992, Irshad Ahmed and David J. Morris wrote The Carbohydrate Economy: Making Chemicals and Industrial Materials with Plant Materials that looked at the potential for biomaterial replacement over the monopoly of petrochemicals. Industrializing societies were carbohydrate economies 200 years ago. In 1820, Americans used two tons of vegetables for every one ton of minerals. Plants were the primary raw materials in the production of dyes, chemicals, paints, inks, solvents, construction materials and energy.

The Hearst Corporation with investments in the forest products industry opposed hemp paper to protect its tree-based paper production. John D. Rockefeller, an investor in petroleum-based pharmaceuticals and the DuPont family, which introduced nylon, actively campaigned against hemp. According to Pankaj Srivastava, CEO of Renaissance Corp, hemp has the potential to help the US build a 21st-century industry that produces functionally superior products, meets the needs and demands of modern consumers and protects and restores the environment. \"Since the legalization of hemp cultivation in 2018, the industrial hemp industry is still in its infancy,\" said Srivastava. \"However, hundreds of forward-thinking entrepreneurs and companies are beginning to embrace hemp as a key ingredient across various industries—both consumer and industrial.\" Srivastava says these companies recognize that hemp offers an eco-friendly and more sustainable alternative to various toxic substances we use daily while also enhancing product performance and functionality. He added, \"Despite this promising start, the industry must address systemic challenges to enable scalable utilization of hemp, which is his company's mission.\" Green zeitgeist As a crop, industrial hemp can thrive in infertile soil conditions and can be applied to crop rotation to regenerate soil due to its natural biological ability to cleanse soils. Srivastava says hemp excels across various applications. “From textiles with improved wear patterns to high-protein and amino acid-rich food products, to lightweight yet strong paneling for cars, planes and trains, its conductivity also makes it ideal for clean energy (electric batteries and biofuels).” \"Our primary milestone is to broaden awareness of hemp's functionality, aligning it with environmental benefits; continued advancements in material and biological sciences will reveal even more applications, aligning with the green zeitgeist,\" said Srivastava. Industrial transformation In 2013, QZ reported that there were 25,000 products in nine submarkets—agriculture, textiles, recycling, automotive, furniture, food/nutrition/beverages, paper, construction materials and personal care where industrial hemp could be used. All the products could be made or manufactured from raw materials derived from the industrial hemp plant including fiber, hurds and the hemp seed or grain. \"Key industries utilizing industrial hemp are automotive and aviation, which are using hemp fibers in composite materials for car interiors and lightweight panels in aviation for extra strength and reducing weight,\" said Srivastava. In 1995, Giorgio Armani used hemp in an Emporio Armani collection. BMW has used hemp bio-composites since 2013, Porche’s 718 Cayman GT 4 Club Sport uses hemp and Audi and Volkswagen were one of the original automotive manufacturers that started using hemp in the early 2000s. And earlier this year in 2024, BMW, Mercedes and Volvo announced they were looking at natural fibers to make cars more sustainable to meet the demand of consumers. He added, \"These industries will be transformed, creating a trillion-dollar opportunity. The more we utilize hemp and other natural ingredients, the better products we will deliver, ultimately improving the health of our planet.\" Srivastava says that by addressing systemic issues in the industry, he hopes to raise consumer awareness around responsible products that also offer superior functionality in daily-use products like clothing, food, housing, and plastics, which will increasingly incorporate hemp. \"We hope to create a focus on research and science that will uncover new applications for hemp, driving demand and cultivation,\" said Srivastava. \"Hemp's versatility will prove consistent with functionality and economic viability.\" Addressing pressing challenges \"Industrial hemp, as a crop, offers numerous benefits across various domains and can address some of humanity's most pressing challenges, including improved agricultural practices and socio-economic impact, food insecurity and sustainable urban development,\" said Srivastava. Agriculture Hemp addresses the needs of the agricultural community with its multiple uses and simple edaphic practices, which translate into improved soil conditions and better long-term farming results. \"Each part of the hemp plant can be utilized, making it highly efficient. So by improving soil health and providing a sustainable crop, hemp can elevate the socio-economic status of farming communities through job creation and increased agricultural productivity.\" Hemp also requires significantly less water than many traditional crops, up to 70% less water than cotton. \"This makes it ideal for regions facing water scarcity,” he adds. Food Insecurity Hemp seeds are a highly nutritious food source, rich in protein, essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. \"By integrating hemp into our agricultural systems, we can enhance food security and provide a sustainable, nutrient-dense crop that thrives in diverse environments,\" Srivastava added. \"This is particularly beneficial in regions facing food shortages, as hemp can be grown with fewer resources compared to traditional crops,\" he said. \"Hemp's deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, enhancing soil structure and promoting nutrient cycling, which further supports agricultural sustainability and improves crop yields, thus reducing food insecurity.\" Sustainable Urban Development \"Hemp can play a critical role in sustainable urban development,\" said Srivastava. Hempcrete, a building material made from hemp, is highly insulating and fire—and mold-resistant, leading to energy savings of up to 50% compared to conventional buildings. \"This can help create more energy-efficient and resilient urban infrastructure, addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization while reducing the environmental footprint of construction,\" said Srivastava. \"Hemp's carbon-sequestering properties also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, making urban development more environmentally friendly.\" Moving forward “We’ve started to see more applications of industrial hemp each year as material science advances and sustainable ideologies gain traction,” said Srivastava. \"In technology, hemp-based plastics and graphene-like materials are being developed for electronics and batteries, offering sustainable alternatives to traditional materials.” \"Unlike others who are focused on singular aspects such as farming or food, we believe in the broad potential of hemp,\" said Srivastava. \"Our goal is to raise awareness across sectors and develop the technology, physical, and capital infrastructure needed for any company utilizing hemp to scale effectively.\" Srivastava says that by enabling companies to adopt natural ingredients more easily, Renaissance Park hopes to reboot industrial hemp and create an unstoppable movement.

Nancy Pelosi addressed reports that she worked to orchestrate President Joe Biden stepping aside as the Democratic Party’s candidate in a new interview for “CBS Sunday Morning.” When asked what she’d told Biden to persuade him to step aside, the House Speaker Emerita told CBS’s Lesley Stahl, “Well, I’ve never shared any conversations with a president of the United States publicly, no.” Pelosi was then asked about reports that Biden is “furious” with her, to which she responded, “Well, he knows that I love him very much.” Watch the excerpt previewing Sunday’s interview with Pelosi here: Stahl noted that Pelosi clearly didn’t want to “own” this action, but pointed to the extensive reporting around the campaign that led to Biden choosing to step aside. “No, I wasn’t the leader of any pressure in this party,” Pelosi responded. “Let me say things that I didn’t do: I didn’t call one person. I did not call one person. I could always say to him, ‘I never called anybody.’” Pelosi appeared on “CBS Sunday Morning” in connection with the promotion of her book, titled appropriately enough, “The Art of Power: My Story as America’s First Woman Speaker of the House.” It’s set for release on Tuesday. She has served 19 terms as a Democrat from the San Francisco Bay area and details her influence as a member of Congress and longtime speaker of the House in the new book. Their interview also covers the violent attack on her husband Paul Pelosi at their home that nearly killed him — the speaker emerita herself was the intended target — as well as the Jan. 6 Capitol Insurrection, her advice for Kamala Harris in her race against Donald Trump and her thoughts on the choice of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as Trump’s running mate. In an excerpt from Pelosi’s book shared with CBS, Pelosi argues that being speaker “is probably the most challenging position in government.” Contrasting it with being president, she writes, “You have to address the same vast array of issues as the president (but lack the advantage of making appointments across the executive branch and proposing judicial nominees).” She lays out in the excerpt that members of Congress are normally given time through hearings, town halls and other methods to “act deductively” as they make their decisions, but that “the speakership is different. It is both a uniquely powerful and an executive position that requires a combination of a policy background, strategic knowhow, and, above all, intuition.” In the speaker role, Pelosi writes, you can’t ever be surprised and must know all the possibilities at all times. “The minute you hesitate, your options are diminished,” she states. “The longer you wait, the more your options are diminished. Everyone with an agenda will chip away at your delayed decision.” She emphasized the importance of constant communication with the members of her caucus, both for your own information and to give them “confidence in your knowledge and judgment.” Pelosi closes the excerpt by emphasizing the importance in her work of “respect.” You can read the full excerpt from Pelosi’s new book here and see the full interview on this week’s “CBS Sunday Morning.”","summary":"The House speaker emerita faces questions about what she told the president and reports that he is \"furious\" with her\n\n\nThe post Nancy Pelosi Says She Didn&#8217;t Make Any Calls to Get President Biden to Leave Democratic Ticket in Carefully Worded Answers | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/nancy-pelosi-biden-interview-art-of-power/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CleanShot-2024-08-03-at-16.44.29@2x.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:47:05","author":"Mike Roe","authors":["Mike Roe"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.353},{"id":253323914,"title":"Race 2024: Vance’s ‘Childless Cat Ladies’-The Economic Realities","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Childless cat ladies Reddit In an election race that is starting to feel like a fever dream for many Americans, this week delivered contentious attack, against the experiences of childless Americans and their deserved 'stake' in the nation's future. In a resurfaced 2021 interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, then-Senate-candidate J.D Vance launched a tirade against democrats and their choices (or not) in family life, suggesting that as single people, they do not have a \"direct stake\" in the country, describing them as, \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" Attack on a growing electorate His remarks earned a rare rebuke from America's sweetheart actress Jennifer Aniston, whose childless life has been a media obsession throughout her blazing career. The 55-year-old called out Vance's highly insensitive stance towards the many women who, like herself, didn't have the opportunity to choose their outcomes, humanizing the pain of infertility and a glaring lack of empathy, compassion, and rational judgment from a man who sees himself as a born leader. Aniston is not alone. His words have come under fire from women across the broad spectrum of society, considered not just insensitive but poor politics. Most notably it is also in sharp contrast with a recent campaign tagline of Donald Trumps at the Republican National Convention' declaring himself a 'President for ALL Americans.' Just not the childless ones, aka 38% of the population. Childless Americans are a growing electorate with national fertility rates reaching a historic low in 2023 (the lowest level since the U.S. began tracking birth rate data in 1979). National health statistics data shows that now twenty percent of American women are childless at the age of 44, with the share of U.S. adults under 50 who say they are unlikely to have kids rising from 37% in 2018 to 47% in 2023.

JD Vance , Megyn Kelly, Jennifer Aniston - cat lady controversy X Via Outlook Where is the tally on past President's biological children? It is no coincidence these comments have come at a particularly jarring political moment, where American voters are less than four months away from deciding their next President, and all eyes are on Vice President and democratic nominee Kamala Harris, who Vance gave a specific mention in his remarks. Harris is not believed to have a cat; instead, she has two stepchildren who refer to her as 'Mamala.' She is most certainly a parent, just not the version Vance views as relevant. Instead he views the modern family as a manifestation of a godless America, where secularity threatens tradition and the choices of a significant segment of the electorate, particularly LGBTQ+ and women, are portrayed as \"anti-family and anti-child.\" A pointed reminder that this election is not being fought on facts, but instead, it is a cultural war on gender and free choice.

(Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images This glaring undertone of misogyny against Harris is evident by the fact that we have never before tallied the children of presidential candidates as a form of political meritocracy. George Washington, viewed as the nation's founding father, was also a stepparent. President James Madison, coined \"Father of the Constitution,\" had no children, and John Tyler, ranked among the worst U.S. presidents of all time, was a father of fifteen. Seven childless men have held the Oval Office, which has long been a mere trivial fact, irrelevant to political stature. That is until now when a woman with progressive views and a modern family took office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In defense of Vance, Donald Trump described him as a man who 'loves family,' somehow attempting to put a wholesome, innocent spin on the whole debacle. Yet, if these past eight years have taught us anything, its that a more wholesome America is not the goal here. Yet if, instead, we strip away the cultural baggage and look at this from the lens of what matters most to Republicans, the pursuit and protection of wealth, Vance's moral outrage also falls short on economics. He has run a political rise on the quest of rebuilding the economic foundation for those society has left behind. Yet ironically, for women who are deliberately childless their math makes a lot of sense. The economics of 'SINKs' IFS Survey May to June 2021 institute for family studies These are women who seem to confuse and infuriate men like Vance the most . They are not following tradition but living their lives according to their own ideals. They come from various backgrounds and experiences, and unlike the stereotype of 'childless cat ladies,' research has shown they are often happier than the average mom. They are educated professionals who prioritize careers, travel, and personal development, and dare they say, simply do not want children. There is financial merit to this choice in life path which The Skimm labeled as SINKs, aka \"Single income, no kids\" women, who are building more wealth as a result. They point to a study that shows single, childfree women had an average of $65,000 in wealth in 2019, compared with $57,000 for single, childfree men. The figure for single mothers was only $7,000 (aka motherhood penalty), and America has the highest rate of children living in single-parent households worldwide, leading to a significant wealth gap, compounded by a lack of access to childcare. A solution Vance has called a \"class war against normal people.\" J.D. Vance on universal childcare via X J.D Vance X Instead, he remains staunch in his nostalgia for the world of the 1950s, where Americans lived a form of traditional bliss via the nuclear family, aka one parent works, and the other raises the children at home (spoiler alert- that's mom's job). A romantic notion for a structure that would be almost impossible to replicate these days without government intervention. Which is a glaring anathema to Vance and republicans. This delusionary fixation on what Atlantic writer David Brooks calls a 'freakish historical moment' (1950-1965) when the nuclear family was the cornerstone of American life is a far cry from the world of 2024. Americans in the 1950's were united by a sentiment that coincided with a postwar patriotism, the cultural relegation of women to the home, high unionization, and above all, made possible by economics. In 1961, the median American man aged 25 to 29 earned nearly 400 percent more than his father had earned at about the same age. Fast forward to 2024 and Americans are more divided than ever. Patriarchy, Power, and Pay: The Transformation of American Families, 1800–2015 Report Ruggles Vis Springer Fast forward to 2024, and the current economic climate is a significantly more depressing picture. These days people are faced with the realities of skyrocketing house prices and stagnant wages. Gen Z dollars have 86% less purchasing power than baby boomers in their twenties. There is a stark disparity between family values and economic realities, underscoring the urgent need for a new approach that addresses wealth and gender inequality. The 'childless cat lady' trope is not just offensive but a way to deflect from economic realities grounded in systemic inequality. Vance can politicize nostalgia all he wants, but it is only with the right policies that support working families, affordable childcare, and financial security, we can empower women to make decisions that align with their aspirations and circumstances. This is a hopeful vision for the future, one that is far from the pantomime of the culture wars.

(Credit: WWE/Getty ... [+] Images) Getty Images Rhea Ripley will have to wait a little longer to get her revenge after falling short against Liv Morgan at WWE SummerSlam 2024—and she will now have her sights set on Dominik Mysterio, too. In a heated battle for the Women’s World Championship, one that’s been months in the making, Morgan was able to retain her title by thanks to an assist from Mysterio. While many fans expected Ripley to win the title she was forced to forfeit in April, it was a shocking betrayal by Mysterio that prevented that from happening. Fans of Ripley need not worry, however. When it comes to Ripley vs. Morgan, WWE is clearly playing the long game. One of the hottest rivalries in pro wrestling this year, the bitter feud between Ripley and Morgan has elevated both stars to the highest points of their respective careers. It’s rare for WWE to utilize a rivalry to seamlessly pull off a double turn—when the hero and villain switch roles—and yet, this feud has done precisely that, with Mysterio officially aligning with Morgan after helping her defeat “Mami” inside Cleveland Browns Stadium. ForbesWWE SummerSlam 2024: Roman Reigns Returning And 5 Smart Booking DecisionsBy Blake Oestriecher In-storyline, it was Morgan who injured Ripley shortly after WrestleMania 40, put her on the sidelines and made her relinquish the top title in the women’s division. During Ripley’s three-month long absence, Morgan, of course, infiltrated The Judgment Day with a steamy soap opera-esque storyline with Mysterio that has been the talk of pro wrestling circles for months. Ripley, even without being on TV for several weeks, has benefitted tremendously from her rivalry with Morgan. Just a year ago, Ripley’s popularity—and merchandise sales—began to soar, putting her in the same category as top superstars like Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins. Now the beloved anti-hero after Mysterio’s betrayal, Ripley’s fan base continues to expand, with impressive merchandise sales continuing as The Judgment Day has become one of WWE’s most must-see acts.

Morgan, who’s spent much of her career as an underdog babyface, is doing the best character work of her career as a heel in a scandalous storyline involving Ripley and Mysterio. The real apex of this angle should take place whenever Ripley ultimately dethrones Morgan and takes her rightful place at the top of Raw’s women’s division once again. SummerSlam was seemingly the stage for Ripley’s victory, but if WWE fans know anything about Triple H’s creative process, it’s that he loves to play the long game. That’s precisely what he will do with Morgan and Ripley, who are embattled in an incredibly heated rivalry that shouldn’t reach its climax so early on. There are more stories to tell here—like what comes next after Mysterio chose Morgan over Ripley—and more matches to be had, bouts that necessitate Ripley being the beloved challenger. On paper, a SummerSlam win for Ripley sounded great, but in reality? SummerSlam was just the first step in a long-running rivalry that should extend well into the fall—when Ripley finally unseats Morgan and gets her revenge, this time as a babyface.

It may be another story when it comes to a running mate. As Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly have emerged as among the possible finalists, both have faced criticism from some organizations and activists who might otherwise be supportive of Democratic causes, potentially undermining the party’s newfound unity barely two weeks after Harris entered the race. The vice president’s team says she is interviewing six possible choices over the weekend before an announcement expected Monday. The next day, she and her running mate will appear together at a rally in Philadelphia, then visit six more swing states. In addition to Shapiro and Kelly, Harris is said to be considering Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Walz changed his weekend travel plans, but his office didn’t answer a question Saturday about whether it was for an interview with Harris. “The governor’s schedule has changed, and he is no longer traveling to New Hampshire this weekend,” Walz spokesman Teddy Tschann said. Some congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse attacks by the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, who argues that Biden administration’s immigration policies are too relaxed. Shapiro has high-profile supporters, too, including Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate — appearing to suggest that the mayor had inside knowledge about Harris’ decision. But a person with knowledge of the mayor’s thinking said the video was simply a case of Parker showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker’s friend, would be the vice presidential pick. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Both Kelly and Shapiro have also seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris’ closes in on a decision. While that may not ultimately sway Harris, it is an indication that the honeymoon period for the vice president, where the distinct wings of the Democratic Party coalesced behind her, may be ending in the less than two weeks since President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her. Some labor groups have criticized Kelly, saying he opposes proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. The senator’s office counters that while he did not co-sponsor the proposed legislation, he has said he would vote for it on the floor. Still, Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly as a potential running mate. Fain also said the union does not favor Shapiro, who has previously proved willing to join with Republicans in calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Fain did single out Beshear, Walz and Pritzker for praise. “She’s probably got a thousand people telling her the same thing, you know, of what they think,” Fain said in an interview. “And so she’s got to make the decision based off of what she feels is, you know, is best for her.” The nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding has been publicly vocal, saying in a statement that Shapiro “is not the right candidate for the job, and selecting him would be a step in the wrong direction.” Shapiro, who says he plans to be at Harris’ rally Tuesday in Philadelphia, has aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as it Israel battles the militants in Gaza. Shapiro called out universities for not acting quickly to tackle antisemitism and he became a prominent critic of the University of Pennsylvania’s president, Liz Magill. She resigned after testifying at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy. Shapiro has also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while suggesting that any end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power. The governor has been criticized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations for not condemning Israel for the killing of civilians in Gaza or for not calling for Israel to stop the fighting in the territory. Shapiro has countered that he has met with Muslim Americans and understands their pain. The progressive activist organization RootsAction.org opposes Shapiro’s views on Israel, school vouchers and the environment, among other issues. It says that in considering Shapiro, Harris “has set off alarm bells among young people, racial justice organizers, Arab Americans, Muslims and others whose votes and campaign activism were crucial to defeating Trump four years ago.” Meanwhile, The Philadelphia Inquirer resurfaced an opinion article Shapiro wrote in 1993 as a 20-year-old college student at the University of Rochester where he said peace “will never come” to the Middle East and that Palestinians were “too battle-minded” to coexist with Israel. Asked about it, Shapiro responded, “I was 20” adding that he long has supported a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. “It is my hope that we can see a day where peace will reign in the Middle East,” he said. Also opposing Shapiro are some environmental leaders and residents of the rural town of Dimock, Pennsylvania. They have drafted a letter to Harris urging her not to choose Shapiro and charging that the governor failed to keep his promises to clean up area groundwater contaminated by natural gas production via hydraulic fracturing. ___ Associated Press writers Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, and AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report.

The Oblivion came when Dominik distracted the referee, and after the Liv Morgan win, he seemed pleased with himself, signaling he had a change of heart. Rhea walked to the ring accompanied by Dominik Mysterio, but Mysterio kissed Morgan after the win and they left together. “Domink, you sorry two-timing son of a b—h!” said Michael Cole of Dom. The story of the match was Rhea Ripley re-injuring her shoulder and valiantly battling through after she finally got her hands on Morgan. Ripley popped her shoulder back into place multiple times throughout the match. Rhea Ripley and Liv Morgan has been a bedrock feud for WWE SummerSlam 2024, even with Rhea Ripley injured for most of it (shoulder). The feud served as Liv Morgan’s coming out party. In 2022, Liv had a feel-good Money in the Bank win that she parlayed into a cash-in that same night, where she won the WWE SmackDown Women’s Championship from Ronda Rousey. But the moment proved to be too big for Morgan, or at least WWE didn’t give her a proper chance to prove she was worthy of it.

Cinematic Liv vowed to take everything from Rhea Ripley, and she did just that by winning the Women’s World Championship. Liv then engaged in a hot pursuit of Ripley’s boyfriend Dominik Mysterio, who just about folded before Rhea Ripley returned. “I have feelings for Dominik, and Dominik has feelings for me, too,” said Morgan during a heated exchange on the July 22 broadcast of WWE Raw. “Do you want to know why you can’t deny that, Rhea? It’s because gorgeous men like Dominik, he doesn’t go for girls who look like you. Gorgeous men like Dominik go for girls that look like me.” In addition to WWE’s storyline between Liv Morgan, Rhea Ripley and Dom, WWE has woven in all the pieces of the Judgment Day as this storyline forces the viewer to question where their loyalties lie. All members of the Judgment Day vowed to compete solo, but the storytelling suggests that Rhea Ripley and Damian Priest are vulnerable babyfaces. And among the many scenarios that can come about when the dust clears, the most likely could be Liv Morgan and Dominik Mysterio atop the Judgment Day after Priest and Ripley are screwed out of it.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is the first substantive order since the case was returned to her Friday following a landmark Supreme Court opinion last month that conferred broad immunity for former presidents and narrowed special counsel Jack Smith’s case against Trump. In their motion to dismiss the indictment, defense lawyers argued that Trump was mistreated because he was prosecuted even though others who have challenged election results have avoided criminal charges. Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential race, also suggested that President Joe Biden and the Justice Department launched a prosecution to prevent him from winning reelection. But Chutkan rejected both arguments, saying Trump was not charged simply for challenging election results but instead for “knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings.” She also said that his lawyers had misread news media articles that they had cited in arguing that the prosecution was political in nature. “After reviewing Defendant’s evidence and arguments, the court cannot conclude that he has carried his burden to establish either actual vindictiveness or the presumption of it, and so finds no basis for dismissing this case on those grounds,” Chutkan wrote in her order. Also Saturday, she scheduled an Aug. 16 status conference to discuss next steps in the case. The four-count indictment, brought in August 2023, accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Biden through a variety of schemes, including by badgering his vice president, Mike Pence, to block the formal certification of electoral votes. Trump’s lawyers argued that he was immune from prosecution as a former president, and the case has been on hold since December as his appeal worked its way through the courts. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 opinion, held that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for core constitutional duties and are presumptively immune from prosecution for all other official acts. The justices sent the case back to Chutkan to determine which acts alleged in the indictment can remain part of the prosecution and which must be discarded.

West is also a former Obama Justice Department attorney, the Washington Free Beacon reported on Friday. “Vice President Kamala Harris has a \"powerful\" new campaign adviser: her brother-in-law Tony West, the former Obama Justice Department attorney who **defended** a convicted terrorist sentenced to 20 years in prison for fighting with the Taliban and colluding with al-Qaeda.” pic.twitter.com/wdGKrEHxhx — We Have It All (@WeAreWoke1776_3) August 2, 2024 The Free Beacon noted: West in 2002 signed on to defend “American Taliban” John Walker Lindh, who was captured in Afghanistan one year earlier and subsequently indicted for providing services to the Taliban and al-Qaeda—and for conspiring to murder Americans. During the trial, West—then an attorney at the San Francisco law firm Morrison & Foerster, which was known for defending enemy combatants detained by the United States—dismissed claims that Lindh was a terrorist. “He is not a terrorist,” West said of Lindh during a 2002 Washington Post interview. “He did not go to Afghanistan to kill Americans.” Lindh, who also goes by Sulayman al-Faris and Abu Sulayman al-Irlandi, was later sentenced to 20 years in prison. He has refused to renounce his Islamic extremist ideologies. In May 2019, Lindh wrote letters to reporters and authors praising Afghan Taliban jihad and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) which prompted recipients to label him unrepentant after his release into American communities, according to Breitbart News. He initially expressed remorse about jointing the Taliban but later said he was proud “to take part in the Afghan jihad,” the outlet said. Kamala Harris adds brother-in-law who represented ‘American Taliban’ John Walker Lindh to campaign team https://t.co/5zmDXQlOAM pic.twitter.com/saxDyfjq1O — New York Post (@nypost) August 3, 2024 “Lindh’s early release comes about three years before the end of his 20-year-jail stint, courtesy of a plea agreement,” the article noted. In reaction to his release in 2019, then President Donald Trump said, “I don’t like it at all,” Breitbart News reported. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) nominated Harris as the party’s presidential candidate. According to Breitbart News, the move ignored the 14 million Democrats who voted for President Joe Biden (D) in the primary. Breitbart News noted: The expeditious coronation underscored the speed at which Democrats moved to coronate Harris, who has received exactly zero presidential primary votes in her political career. Harris dropped out of the 2020 presidential race before the Iowa caucuses and did not enter the race in 2024 until Biden endorsed her. Former President Barack Obama’s (D) campaign mastermind, David Plouffe, is also joining Harris’s presidential campaign, taking up the role of senior adviser, according to Breitbart News.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris has added her brother-in-law Tony West, who defended a convicted terrorist, to her campaign as an adviser.\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris&#8217;s Attorney Brother-in-Law, Who Defended Convicted Terrorist, Joins Her Campaign appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/08/03/kamala-harriss-attorney-brother-in-law-who-defended-convicted-terrorist-joins-her-campaign/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/Tony-West-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:17:14","author":"Amy Furr","authors":["Amy Furr"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.037},{"id":253322986,"title":"City Hall of Kyrgyzstan's Razzakov opens tender to buy brown coal","text":"EN RU AZ TR FA News Terminal Menu Latest Azerbaijan Politics Economy Society Other News Economy Green Economy Oil&Gas ICT Finance Business Construction Transport Tourism Tenders Iran Nuclear Program Politics Business Society Central Asia Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan Turkmenistan Tajikistan Uzbekistan South Caucasus Armenia Georgia World Türkiye Russia Israel Arab World Other News Europe US Azernews.az İDMAN.BİZ DHA Press City Hall of Kyrgyzstan's Razzakov opens tender to buy brown coal Home Economy Tenders City Hall of Kyrgyzstan's Razzakov opens tender to buy brown coal Tenders Materials 4 August 2024 03:17 (UTC +04:00) Access to paid information is limited If You already have a account, please log in Login Register Subscription to paid content Gain access to all that Trend has to offer, as well as to premium, licensed content via subscription or direct purchase through a credit card.

Alleged details of the relationship were published by Britain’s Daily Mail. Rumors of the affair were first shared online by far-right commentator Laura Loomer earlier this week. “During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions,” Emhoff said in a statement to CNN. “I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.” Emhoff and ex-wife Kerstin ended their 16-year marriage in 2009, with a divorce settlement filed in 2010. He did not address the specifics of the Daily Mail’s report, which stated that Emhoff had cheated on his first wife with their daughter Ella’s nanny. The story also alleges that Emhoff impregnated the woman, who also taught at their children’s private school in Culver City. Harris and Emhoff met in 2013 on a blind date while he worked as an entertainment lawyer and she was California’s attorney general. They married the following year. CNN reported that Joe Biden’s vetting committee was aware of the relationship and surrounding circumstances during Harris’ vetting process to become his running mate in 2020, citing an anonymous source familiar with the conversations. Emhoff also told Harris about the affair before they married. In a separate statement reported by CNN, Kerstin said, “Doug and I decided to end our marriage for a variety of reasons, many years ago. He is a great father to our kids, continues to be a great friend to me and I am really proud of the warm and supportive blended family Doug, Kamala, and I have built together.” Emhoff has regretted the circumstances around his affair for a long time and knew it was possible they would become public, a source familiar with Emhoff told CNN. Kerstin has spoken positively of Harris on multiple occasions, including defending her recently from attacks by Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance. Emhoff has been on the campaign trail in support of his wife’s candidacy. The campaign just released merchandise featuring a throwback photo of Emhoff earlier this week, which had gone viral after many online noted how attractive Emhoff appeared in the image. Posts that spread on social media Saturday, including a popular parody post retweeted more than 5,000 times with more than 420,000 views, pointed out the irony of his marriage being questioned by Donald Trump due to his own history of repeated affairs and being an adjudicated rapist. Citing a close friend with direct knowledge of both the affair and the pregnancy, the Daily Mail adds that their source said the woman did not keep the child. However, her social media does show a video of a baby in 2009, when her child would have been born. Another source confirmed the affair and that the woman did not keep the child. The woman did not deny the story when approached by the Daily Mail, according to the outlet. She declined to comment on the allegations but said, “I’m kind of freaked out right now.” Emhoff’s ex-wife Kerstin did not comment when reached by the Daily Mail. A mother whose children attended the school prior to 2009 told the Daily Mail that she was aware of the affair, expressing disgust with Emhoff but praise for the woman. Several other sources told the Mail that they would not comment further without the woman’s permission. Since the alleged affair, the woman went on to work for Broadway Video and later Amazon’s Audible.","summary":"Doug Emhoff says that he \"took responsibility\" and since the affair, has \"worked through things as a family\"\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris&#8217; Husband Acknowledges Affair During 1st Marriage appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/doug-emhoff-affair-nanny-pregnant-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2162696466.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:16:06","author":"Mike Roe","authors":["Mike Roe"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.603},{"id":253322868,"title":"Trump congratulates Putin on 'great deal' on prisoner exchange","text":"NEW YORK, August 4. /TASS/. US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has congratulated Russian leader Vladimir Putin on a prisoner swap deal with a number of Western countries. Trump told supporters in Atlanta, Georgia that Putin \"had made another great deal.\" However, according to Trump, the deal was a terrible one for Washington. \"We got our people back, but boy did we make some horrible, horrible deals,\" the politician emphasized. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) reported on August 1 that eight Russian nationals, detained or convicted in several NATO countries, as well as two minors, had returned home following a prisoner swap conducted at Ankara’s airport. One of those swapped was Russian citizen Vadim Krasikov, who had been serving a life sentence in Germany. The Russians were exchanged for a group of individuals who acted in the interests of other countries. According to US President Joe Biden, Russia released 16 people as part of the prisoner swap, including former US Marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, convicted of espionage in Russia.","summary":"However, according to the US President, the deal was a terrible one for Washington","url":"https://tass.com/world/1825007","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:12:40","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.427},{"id":253322980,"title":"Rams Got Creative And Created Flexibility To Please Matthew Stafford","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had his contract reworked in the offseason, ... [+] passes during the team's training camp. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. The Rams avoided an unfortunate situation when tweaking quarterback Matthew Stafford’s contract just before training camp. The two parties are moving on from what was believed to be some hearty negotiations, with their sites set on Los Angeles having a successful season and and then making a deep postseason run. Many speculated that Stafford was looking to extend his deal which runs through 2026 when it was revealed he wanted his contract reworked. But actually Stafford just pushed money forward in his pact, with the Rams and their Pro Bowl quarterback agreeing to revisit their partnership after the season. For this season Stafford will earn a $12.5 million signing bonus, a $23.5 million guaranteed salary and a $4 million roster bonus, according to various reports. Stafford, a 16-year pro, was comfortable relinquishing his guarantees in 2025 and then revisiting his contract scenario after the season. Stafford, 36, continues to play at a high level for the Rams. He’s coming off another stellar season in which he passed for nearly 4,000 yards with 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Despite the Rams being in a rebuilding phase and Stafford being limited to 15 games, he led L.A. to a 10-7 record and a near upset of the Detroit Lions in the NFC wildcard game. If Stafford delivers another solid year, he’ll likely be in line for another hefty payday from the Rams. It’s doubtful they would move off a healthy Stafford, who is 24-17 during his Rams stint, but they do have insurance after signing veteran Jimmy Garoppolo in the offseason.

Rams coach Sean McVay said his bond with Stafford was strengthened, not derailed, by the give-and-take in the contract discussions. “What I always appreciate about our relationship is that I think that honest communications exists and it never got to a point where there was anything other than I think we’ll be even better,’’ McVay said. Before adjusting his contract, Stafford was scheduled to receive a $31 million base salary this year. Instead he’ll get $40 million, by moving $12 million which was guaranteed in 2025 to this season. While he retains a $26 million base payment in 2026, none of that is guaranteed. Obviously Stafford’s future potential compensation with the Rams after this year will be determined next offseason, based on his production, health and willingness to continue his career.

Despite the former first lady sometimes skipping the chance to be by her husband Donald Trump’s side during his intense campaign for the 2024 presidency, she made it clear where she plans to be at the start of 2025 by stepping out in New York City Saturday carrying Louis Vuitton luggage decorated with a “FLOTUS” tag. She also had “FLOTUS” emblazoned on a clothing bag a worker carried for her as she exited her husband’s Trump Tower. She did not travel lightly, utilizing three luggage pieces from the luxury Italian brand: the Sirius 55 Monogram Canvas ($2,490), Keepall 55 Monogram Canvas ($2,210) and the Cruiser Bag 45 ($3,050). Melania, 54, also chose to tote around a nearly $4,000 Burberry Belt handbag during her Saturday outing. Styling her outfit to match it, she wore wide-legged green trousers and a plain white T-shirt. She accessorized with oversized aviator sunglasses and finished her simple yet sophisticated look with gold sandals. Her hair was left down and parted in the middle. Once her pricey bags were loaded into a Secret Service vehicle, she hit the road for New Jersey. Meanwhile, Donald, 78, traveled to Atlanta Saturday to campaign at the Georgia State University Convocation Center with his vice president pick, J.D. Vance. Kamala Harris, who secured enough delegates to become the official Democratic nominee on Friday, held a rally at the same location and spoke in front of 10,000 supporters. Melania has remained fairly quiet throughout the former president’s bid for president this year, though she did speak out following his assassination attempt in July. “When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron’s life, were on the brink of devastating change,” she said in a statement. “I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.” Days before, she raised $1.4 million at a Trump Tower fundraiser wearing a red Valentino dress with appliqué flowers and Christian Louboutin heels.","summary":"The former first lady headed into a Secret Service vehicle after exiting Trump Tower in NYC as her husband campaigned in Atlanta.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/08/03/style/melania-trump-steps-out-with-4k-burberry-bag-flotus-luggage/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/86903344.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZDvNCuqV-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-03 23:05:35","author":"Sara Whitman","authors":["Sara Whitman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.28},{"id":253322362,"title":"Algerian boxer Imane Khelif reduced to tears as she clinches Paris Olympics medal","text":"Boxer Imane Khelif of Algeria clinched a medal at the Paris Olympics in an emotional fight Sunday morning (AEST) that followed days of sharp scrutiny and online abuse as misconceptions about her gender exploded into a larger clash about identity in sports. Khelif defeated Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary 5:0 in the quarterfinals of the women's 66kg division. Khelif will win at least a bronze medal after she comfortably earned the second victory of her tumultuous second trip to the Olympics. Khelif faced outcry fuelled by claims from the International Boxing Association (IBA), which has been banned from the Olympics since 2019, that she failed an unspecified eligibility test to compete last year over elevated levels of testosterone. She won her opening bout at the Paris Games on Thursday when opponent Angela Carini of Italy tearfully abandoned the fight after just 46 seconds. That unusual ending became a sharp wedge to drive into an already prominent divide over gender identity and regulations in sports, drawing comments from the likes of former US President Donald Trump, Harry Potter writer J.K. Rowling, and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender. At a Paris Games that has championed inclusion and seen other outcry over an opening ceremony performance featuring drag queens, LGBTQ+ groups say the hateful comments could pose dangers to their community and female athletes. Khelif's second win in Paris appeared to be an emotional catharsis for the 25-year-old boxer from a village in north-west Algeria. After her hand was raised in victory, Khelif went to the centre of the ring, waved to her fans, knelt and then slammed her palm on the canvas, her smile turning to tears. She left the ring to hug her coaches while her fans roared, weeping during their embrace and as she walked out. Back home in Algeria, her family and fans watched with pride as she won her second bout. \"I am happy for my daughter. She is courageous despite racist and sexist attacks to break her,\" her mother, Irene, said on Algerian television. Hungary's boxing association said on Friday that it planned to contest the match-up with the International Olympic Committee, but still let the fight go ahead. After the bout, Hungarian IOC member Balazs Furjes said alongside Hamori that she was adamant that it was \"never an option … not to fight.\" \"I'm so proud of myself, because I had to fight, and I like to fight,\" said Hamori, who won two fights earlier in Paris. \"This was a hard fight, but I think I got to do everything I wanted for the fight, and I think in this fight, I'm so proud of myself, and I'm so grateful to be here. This was really a childhood dream.\" Furjes read an equivocal statement in which he praised both Hamori and the IOC while indicating Hungary wasn't completely content. \"We, Hungarians, are always ready to fight bravely, and fiercely, and that's what Luca has just done and showed us,\" Furjes said. \"Of course, the Paris boxing competitions have their consequences. These consequences must be carefully evaluated after the Games.\" Khelif stopped briefly to speak to an Algerian television crew, then walked straight to the dressing room without stopping for dozens of waiting reporters. IOC president Thomas Bach earlier in the day defended Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan. Khelif and Lin were disqualified in the middle of last year's world championships by the IBA, the former governing body of Olympic boxing, after what it claimed were failed eligibility tests. Both had competed in IBA events for several years without problems, and the Russian-dominated body — which has faced years of clashes with the IOC — has refused to provide any information about the tests, underscoring its lack of transparency in nearly every aspect of its dealings, particularly in recent years. The IBA also announced it would pay Carini, her coaches and her federation a total of $153,000 (AUD) after the Italian abandoned her fight with the Algerian. \"Let's be very clear here: We are talking about women's boxing,\" Bach said. \"We have two boxers who are born as a woman, who have been raised a woman, who have a passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women. And this is the clear definition of a woman. There was never any doubt about them being a woman.\" The IBA, which is led by an acquaintance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, disqualified Khelif last year and said information about the tests was confidential. \"What we see now is that some want to own the definition of who is a woman,\" Bach said. \"And there I can only invite them to come up with a scientific-based new definition of who is a woman; and how can somebody being born, raised, competed and having a passport as a woman cannot be considered a woman? \"We will not take part in a sometimes politically motivated cultural war,\" he added. Against Hamori, Khelif fought aggressively from the opening bell, snapping a crisp left jab while the fighters circled. Her fans chanted her first name repeatedly midway through the opening round, and she won on all five judges' cards. She showed her sharp skill while stalking Hamori in the second round, working behind the jab and catching Hamori repeatedly with short right hands along with an occasional combination to win the second round unanimously. Hamori landed several significant shots of her own and never appeared shaken by Khelif's power, which wasn't really considered remarkable in her weight division before this week. The referee deducted a point from Khelif midway through the third round when both fighters fell to the canvas from a clinch with Khelif on top. Hamori then received a warning for punches to the back of the head, and she fell again from a clinch 10 seconds before the bell. The exhausted fighters had a half-hearted hug after the bell, but they touched fists and exchanged warm smiles right before the verdict was announced. They touched hands again when Khelif held down the ropes to allow Hamori to leave the ring in a traditional boxing gesture of sportsmanship. Khelif, who failed to medal at the Tokyo Games three years ago, will face Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand in the 66kg semifinals at Roland Garros. A silver medallist at last year's world championships, Suwannapheng upset defending Olympic champion Busenaz Surmeneli of Turkey a few minutes before Khelif's victory. As for Lin, also a two-time Olympian, she would clinch her first medal if she beats Svetlana Staneva of Bulgaria. Lin won her opening bout Friday comfortably over Sitora Turdibekova of Uzbekistan. The reduced field at the Paris Olympics boxing tournament — which has the fewest number of total boxers since 1956 — means that many fighters can clinch medals with just two victories. Boxing awards two bronze medals in each weight class, which means every semifinalist wins a medal. The Olympic sport reached gender parity for the first time in Paris, inviting 124 men and 124 women just 12 years after women's boxing made its Olympic debut.

The policy prevents the use of congressional office equipment and supplies, along with congressional staff time, for campaign activities, including making statements. \"Those rules are in place, not just to make sure that taxpayer funds aren't used in an inappropriately partisan way, but also to make sure that that government officials don't create the impression that their access to government and their access to government services is going to be limited because they are a member of a particular party or no party at all,\" Donald Sherman, executive vice president and chief counsel for ethics watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told Raw Story. Tom Rust, staff director and chief counsel for the House Committee on Ethics, said “no comment,\" when contacted by Raw Story. The next day, Johnson's campaign page, published a nearly identical post about the CNN debate that ultimately turned up the pressure on President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race. \"An objective truth that cannot be denied: Only one of the men on the stage last night is qualified and capable of being elected President in 2024. It was the biggest mismatch in the history of presidential debates. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain,\" said the X post on June 28. Johnson's congressional office and campaign did not respond to Raw Story's requests for comment. Sherman said the prompt removal of the congressional post supporting Trump is important, and such mistakes can occur when staffers are managing both congressional and campaign social media accounts. \"It's long since been established that taxpayer funds should not be used for partisan electoral politics in that way,\" Sherman said. \"You want people who are, for example, seeking constituent services from their elected representatives to feel like they're going to get service ... whether they are a Republican or a Democrat.\" Johnson has been a vocal and traveling supporter for Trump, from attending his trial in New York where he was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, to speaking at the Republican National Convention earlier this month.

(AP) — Donald Trump says he is pulling out of a scheduled September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC and wants them to face off on Fox News, making it increasingly unlikely that the candidates will confront each other on stage before the November election. In a series of Truth Social posts late Friday, the Republican nominee and former president said his agreement to a Sept. 10 debate on ABC “has been terminated” because he will no longer face Democratic President Joe Biden, who ended his campaign last month after a disastrous performance in their first debate. Trump now says he will appear on Fox News on Sept. 4 in Pennsylvania with rules that he called “similar” to his debate with Biden, but with a full audience instead of a mostly empty studio. Trump said that if Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, does not agree to the new network and date, he will do a “major Town Hall” with Fox News. Michael Tyler, a Harris spokesperson, said Trump “is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out.” It was not immediately clear whether ABC would turn its Sept. 10 event into a Harris town hall in Trump’s absence. Tyler said Harris is committed to the time slot and would appear “one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.” In a subsequent Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon, Trump said of Harris, “I’ll see her on September 4th or, I won’t see her at all.” Trump has gone back and forth on debating with Harris since she entered the presidential race. He had told reporters he felt an obligation to debate but also said in a recent Fox News interview that he thought Americans “already know everything” about both candidates Harris has pressed Trump to keep the commitment he made when Biden was in the race. Noting Trump’s criticisms of her, Harris dared him recently to “say it to my face.” In his Truth Social posts, Trump also cited his litigation against ABC News as “a conflict of interest” in his participation in the network’s debate. Trump sued the network in March following an assertion by anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found “liable for rape.” A New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll but rejected her claim that she was raped. But Trump agreed, two months after filing his lawsuit, to the Sept. 10 debate on ABC, as well as the June 27 debate on CNN that helped knock Biden out of the race. David Muir and Linsey Davis, not Stephanopoulos, are set to be ABC’s debate moderators.

The audience continued with interjections and cheers throughout the 37-minute conversation with Trump and Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News, Harris Faulkner, anchor of \"The Faulkner Focus\" and co-host of \"Outnumbered\" on Fox News, and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor. Trump's sparring with the moderators, particularly Scott, elicited audience responses from cheers to outbursts of \"Jesus Christ\" to \"That's false.\" These 10 Trump quotes evoked the most reaction from audience members, which included convention attendees and members of the press. 'You don't even say hello' Scott launched the conversation with a lengthy first question \"addressing the elephant in the room,\" calling out a number of racist actions from Trump such as questioning the citizenship of his Republican presidential opponent Nikki Haley and former President Barack Obama to describing Black district attorneys as \"animals\" and \"rabid\" and dining with a white supremacist. \"Now that you are asking Black supporters to vote for you, why should Black voters trust after you have used language like that?\" Scott asked. Trump's immediate response led to an uproar of shrieks and laughs from the audience. \"Well first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner, first question. You don't even say, 'Hello. How are you?'\" Trump said. 'Fake news network' Trump proceeded to ask Scott, \"Are you with ABC? Because I think it's a fake news network, a terrible network,\" prompting even more shrieks from the audience. \"I think it's disgraceful that I came here in good spirit. I love the Black population of this country. I've done so much for the Black population of this country,\" Trump continued, garnering a few claps amidst more cheers. \"Historically black colleges and universities were out of money, stone-cold broke, and I saved them, and I gave them long-term financing, and nobody else was doing it,\" Trump said, which led to some applause. 'False pretenses' Trump called the introduction \"very rude\" and that he expected his Democratic opponent to be in attendance, whether it was President Joe Biden, who has since dropped out of the race, or Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. \"I was invited here, and I was told my opponent, whether it was Biden or Kamala. I was told my opponent was going to be here. It turned out my opponent, isn’t here. You invited me on under false pretense,\" Trump said. Audience members shouted out the correct pronunciation of Harris' first name, which is kahm-uh-luh not kuh-mahl-uh, as Trump pronounced it. 'Best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln' As Scott tried to ask another question, Trump continued, \"I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,\" which led to a roar from the audience. One solo person shrieked when Trump called himself the best. \"Better than President Johnson who signed the Voting Rights Act?\" Scott, asked, which Trump ignored. 'Now she wants to be known as Black' Scott moved on to ask Trump if Republicans calling Harris a \"DEI hire\" was \"acceptable language,\" prompting Trump to push her for a definition of the term, which she pointed out stands for \"diversity, equity and inclusion.\" When pushed by Scott if Harris is \"only on the ticket because she is a Black woman,\" Trump said he has known Harris for a long time indirectly. \"She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.\" Trump said. \"I don’t know is she Indian or is she Black?\" Shock from the crowd was audible, yet Trump continued. \"You know, I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person,\" she said. 'Black jobs' Faulker took over and asked why Trump came to speak at the convention during such a divided time for the country. \"What is your message today?\" she asked. Trump said his message is to \"stop people from invading our country.\" \"A lot of the journalists in this room are Black,\" Trump said at the event for Black journalists, prompting laughter from the crowd. \"I will tell you that coming from the border are millions and millions of people that happen to be taking Black jobs,\" Trump said. \"What exactly is a Black job, sir?\" Scott followed up. \"A Black job is anybody that has a job that’s what it is. They’re taking the employment away from Black people. They’re coming in. They’re invading,\" Trump said. 'Friendly manner' Goba asked Trump questions about his vice presidential running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) who made comments about \"childless cat ladies\" running the country. \"He has a lot of opinions about childless women like myself or divorced people like yourself,\" Goba said, which elicited laughter. \"But at least it was said in a friendly manner,\" Trump said. Goba continued, \"My point is do you think the Republican Party is getting a little bit too judgy about people’s lives when you think about abortion or when you think about what J.D. Vance is saying? \"I think that the Democrat party is really the one that has the problem,\" Trump said. 'Mentally, he’s shot' Goba asked Trump if he'd consider stepping down if his health was declining. \"If you win, you’ll still be president at 82, which is older than Biden is right now,\" she said. \"But not mentally. Mentally, he’s shot. He’s shot,\" Trump said to audience laughter. Trump proceeded to say \"absolutely,\" he would know if he needed to step down if he were re-elected. 'I’d pardon them' When discussing the assaults on 140 officers during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Trump said of those arrested for their involvement in the riot, \"If they’re innocent, I’d pardon them.\" Scott retorted, \"They’ve been convicted,\" which elicited laughter from the audience. \"Well, they were convicted by a very tough system,\" Trump said. Scott asked Trump about rioters beating officers with flagpoles and dragging them down stairs. \"Have you seen that video?\" Trump instead discussed other protestors who clashed with police in places like Seattle and Minneapolis for comparison. \"But what about the police that are ushering everybody into the Capitol, 'go in, go in,' what about that?\" Trump said. \"I was there. That's a lie,\" shouted an audience member. 'I like you very much' When talking about inflation, Trump said, \"Your grocery bills are up 40, 50, 60 percent, right?\" then pointed at an audience member. \"She screamed to me. Oh, she’s agreeing, I like you very much,\" Trump said, which prompted more audience laughter.","summary":"CHICAGO — Right before former President Donald Trump was about to be introduced for a question-and-answer session at the National Association of Black Journalists convention Wednesday, the crowd erupted into cheers over the announcement that the conversation would be fact-checked in real-time.\n\nThe audience continued with interjections and cheers throughout the 37-minute conversation with Trump and Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News, Harris Faulkner, anchor of \"The Faulkner Focus\" and co-host of \"Outnumbered\" on Fox News, and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor.\n\nTrump's sparring with the moderators, particularly Scott, elicited audience responses from cheers to outbursts of \"Jesus Christ\" to \"That's false.\"\n\nThese 10 Trump quotes evoked the most reaction from audience members, which included convention attendees and members of the press.\n\n'You don't even say hello'Scott launched the conversation with a lengthy first question \"addressing the elephant in the room,\" calling out a","url":"https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/black-female-journalist-fight-with-trump/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=53099104&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C164","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:37:18","author":"Alexandria Jacobson,Raw Story","authors":["Alexandria Jacobson","Raw Story"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.137},{"id":253322332,"title":"Judge in Trump election interference case sets Aug. 16 hearing date for pretrial schedule","text":"WASHINGTON — The judge overseeing the election interference case against former President Donald Trump scheduled an August conference with defense and prosecution teams to determine a schedule for pretrial proceedings. In the Saturday filing, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan announced that the conference would be scheduled for Aug. 16. In the same one-page filing, Chutkan denied Trump’s motion to dismiss the indictment, though she added that he could “file a renewed motion once all issues of immunity have been resolved.” Chutkan’s move comes one month after the Supreme Court ruled that Trump has some level of immunity for the conduct related to the case. The high court sent the case back for lower courts to determine what conduct Trump could be prosecuted for. The Supreme Court also ruled that any of Trump’s conduct that is determined to be official — and therefore immune — cannot be admitted as evidence during a trial. Trial proceedings before Chutkan had been paused as the case made its way to the Supreme Court. Now that the case is back with Chutkan, the judge will ultimately determine what aspects of Trump’s conduct as alleged in the indictment were official and therefore immune from prosecution. Both parties now face an Aug. 9 deadline to file a status report to Chutkan regarding a proposed schedule for pretrial proceedings. The status report is supposed to be jointly filed to the extent that both sides can find common ground. That would require that the sides meet to discuss a proposed schedule, which is typical in federal cases. It remains unclear when the case may move forward to a trial. Trump is not required to attend the Aug. 16 meeting. Trump and his lawyers had repeatedly argued that the former president had prosecutorial immunity for actions he took on and before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The former president and his allies praised the Supreme Court’s ruling, while Democrats slammed it. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges.","summary":"Judge Tanya Chutkan, who's overseeing the election interference case against former President Donald Trump, scheduled an August conference with defense and prosecution teams to determine a schedule for pretrial proceedings.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/judge-trump-election-interference-case-august-16-hearing-rcna165029","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-08/230807-Tanya-Chutkan-mb-1412-63bebf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:36:06","author":"Megan Lebowitz","authors":["Megan Lebowitz"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.657},{"id":253321836,"title":"Meta offering millions in AI deals to Judy Dench, Awkwafina and Keegan-Michael Key: report","text":"It’s a deal that could provide a license to kill.

But negotiations between Meta and some talent representatives have been strained over the terms of use for the actors’ voices. The tech giant plans to spend at least $37-$40 billion in 2024 capital expenditures, up from a prior range of $35-$40 billion, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, said in the company’s second-quarter earnings call.

Star Tribune August 3, 2024 at 10:33PM Gov. Tim Walz took questions on July 23 about speculation he was being considered as Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate for Kamala Harris. (Glen Stubbe/Star Tribune) Gov. Tim Walz has canceled his plans to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris in New Hampshire this weekend, as Harris interviews a half-dozen potential running mates — a list believed to include Walz. ”The governor’s schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to New Hampshire this weekend,” Walz’s spokesman Teddy Tschann said. The vice president’s vetting team has been examining prospective running mates in a whirlwind process since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Harris is interviewing finalists this weekend ahead of an announcement expected early this coming week. Walz is on Harris’ interview list, the Associated Press reports, along with Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Others under consideration for the job have also reportedly canceled public appearances this weekend, including Shapiro, adding fuel to the heated speculation around the looming decision. Harris will hold her first rally with her running mate Tuesday in Philadelphia, her campaign has said, followed by a tour of other battleground states. Walz had planned to campaign for Harris on Sunday in New Hampshire. He was expected to speak at an event in Manchester with U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas and local Democratic lawmakers. The Harris campaign’s announcement for the event said it would contrast “Donald Trump’s and MAGA Republicans’ Project 2025 agenda” with Harris’ and Democrats’ “positive vision that would strengthen our democracy, protect reproductive freedom and ensure every person has the opportunity to not just get by, but to get ahead.” Walz’s national profile has quickly risen in recent weeks as he has stumped for Harris and landed on her short list. His comments calling Republicans “weird people” went viral, giving Harris and Democrats a label they have embraced. Staff writer Briana Bierschbach contributed to this report.

Her victory came just hours after International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach defended its decision to allow her and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting to compete, saying concerns over their gender identity are “totally unacceptable.” With Khelif’s latest win, she is guaranteed at least a bronze medal. “I dedicate this medal to the world, and to all the Arabs and I tell you, ‘Long live Algeria!’ ” she told reporters in a wild scrum after the match. She appeared to fight back tears and had an Algerian flag wrapping around her back as she spoke. “I want to tell the entire world that I am a female, and I will remain a female,” she said. During her fight on Saturday, Khelif appeared to have a sizable cheering section chanting her name, “Imane, Imane, Imane!” and waving Algerian flags. Five judges scored each of the three rounds for Khelif. The judges had it 10-9 for every round except for one who called the second round, 10-8, for the Algerian. Hamori had boasted she wasn’t afraid of Khelif and fueled allegations that the Algerian was not a woman. But at the end of the match, it appeared the combatants exchanged pleasantries with each other and their corners. Before the match, Bach forcefully defended the inclusion of Khelif and Yu-ting in the Olympics and blasted the pushback as \"hate speech.\" “We have two boxers who were born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women,” Bach said. Questions surrounding Yu-ting’s and Khelif’s gender identity surfaced after it was revealed they had been disqualified from competing with women at a global event last year, but were cleared by the IOC to compete in the women’s 66-kilogram and women’s 57-kilogram matches at the Paris Games. The debate was further inflamed Thursday after Angela Carini of Italy quit 46 seconds into her match against Khelif, resulting in an automatic win for the Algerian boxer. Carini stopped the fight after only a few punches were exchanged and refused to shake Khelif’s hand. Carini, 25, fell onto the floor in tears. Bach said there was “never any doubt” about Yu-ting and Khelif being women. Both boxers have always competed in women’s divisions and there’s no indication that they identify as transgender or intersex, the latter referring to people born with sex characteristics that do not fit strictly into the male-female gender binary. “What we see now is that some want to own the definition of who is a woman,” Bach said, adding: “All this hate speech, aggression and abuse ... is totally unacceptable.” At a boxing event last year, the athletes failed to meet gender eligibility tests at the Women’s World Boxing Championships in New Delhi by the International Boxing Association. They were both disqualified after sporting officials said they failed an unspecified test because they allegedly had male chromosomes. The IAB, whose president is Umar Kremlev of Russia and is an associate of President Vladimir Putin, claimed the fighters had failed unspecified eligibility tests. The decision came shortly after Khelif beat Russian boxer Azalia Amineva, who was previously undefeated. The IAB's legitimacy has been called into question with USA Boxing terminated its relationship with that body last year, citing the “ongoing failures of IBA leadership.” Khelif, 25, who made her Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games, has said her disqualification was a “conspiracy.” Her father, Amar Khelif, said the attacks against the athlete are “immoral.” “It is not fair,” he recently told Reuters. He said his daughter has always loved sports since she was a child and used to play football. Amar Khelif insisted that she was born a female. “She made us proud many times, she honored our country and our flag many times and she always made us happy with her results,” he said. “These critics aim to destabilize her to fail in the wrestling ring but she is a champion and she will remain a champion.” Carini said after her loss on Thursday that she ended the match because of a “severe pain” in her nose. She said that she was not qualified to make decisions on whether Khelif should be allowed to compete. Others, including “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling, who has often come under fire over her anti-trans comments, quickly criticized the match and the IOC’s decision. “A young female boxer has just had everything she’s worked and trained for snatched away because you allowed a male to get in the ring with her,” Rowling wrote, reposting a video of an IOC official speaking on the committee’s mental health and safeguarding initiatives. “You’re a disgrace, your ‘safeguarding’ is a joke and #Paris24 will be forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini,” Rowling added. Former President Donald Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, in all caps: “I will keep men out of women's sports!” Others came to Khelif’s defense and celebrated her win. “I strongly condemn the baseless attacks on our athlete, Imane Khelif, by certain foreign outlets,” Abderrahmane Hammad, Algeria’s minister of youth and sports, wrote on X. He slammed questions about her gender identity as “cowardly attempts to tarnish her reputation.” Ismaël Bennacer, a soccer player for the Algerian national team as well as the club AC Milan, wrote that he fully supports Khelif. “Her presence at the Olympic Games is simply the result of her talent and hard work,” he said on X. Khelif acknowledged her supporters, posting an Instagram drawing of Algerians, men and women, rallying to her side. The contingent of supporters on Saturday chanted “Imane, Imane, Imane!” and waved Algerian flags as Khelif fought her spirited opponent. \"People tried to disqualify Imane, for nothing, for no reason. She was born female. She will die a female,\" said Taha Oundrouis, a 41-year-old physician from Paris. \"If you cannot prove she’s a male, then you must shut up and leave her alone,\" Oundrouis said. The Algerian fans said Khelif has been mistreated. \"She has been in competition before and no one had a problem,\" said Moncef Mahdgoubi, a 35-year-old ear, nose and throat physician. “She’s a real female. She never changed her orientation, her sex,\" Mahdgoubi said. \"Her father showed photos of her as a child. She’s grown up as a female.” The National Black Justice Collective, a civil rights organization that aims to protect Black LGBTQ people, said it stands in solidarity with Khelif. “Simply put, Imane Khelif and the other athletes being targeted met the criteria to compete in the Olympics. They deserve to compete as much as every other athlete who trained, prepared, and qualified for the most significant opportunity in their sport. An opportunity now dampened by internet trolls and evangelical zealots consumed with ignorance and a disregard for how weaponized hate can threaten one’s livelihood and life,” the organization said in a statement. Nonbinary Olympic American runner Nikki Hiltz called out transphobia at the Olympics. “Anti-trans rhetoric is anti-woman,” she wrote in an Instagram story on Friday. “These people aren’t ‘protecting women’s sports,’ they are enforcing rigid gender norms and anyone who doesn’t fit perfectly into those norms is targeted and vilified.” David K.

Now he has to face off against Kamala Harris things look very different. Trump has good reason to be scared. He might even lose, again, although it is quite likely he will claim he won, against all the evidence. But he knows now he is in a race. US presidential elections are usually consequential, even if those consequences are often surprising. After all, it was not the non-WASP US golden boy JFK who ended the Vietnam war. That was forced on Tricky Dickie Nixon, who was later forced to resign from office in disgrace. But it is quite possible that this could be one of the most consequential US presidential elections of modern history, which could affect every country on the planet. To understand the historical dynamics, we need to look into the background to the current contest. When Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency in 2016 he lost the popular vote by almost three million. This is because, as jurists from the US right now like to remind us, the US is not a democracy but a “constitutional republic.” In the electoral process, this means each state casts votes for the presidential rivals in a 538-strong electoral college that takes place after the popular vote has taken place. Ever since its founding as the modern United States after the civil war, smaller states have had a disproportionate weight in the delegates to the electoral college. Currently, these are skewed to the smaller, more rural or suburban states. But they are historically the smaller slave-owning states that were defeated in the civil war. The constitutional republic is built on a compromise with slavery. This largely explains the anti-democratic nature of the system which means that the last Republican president to win the popular vote was George W Bush in 2004, having lost the popular vote but won the presidency in 2000 to Al Gore. It was a massively increased turnout in 2020 that did for Trump, the first incumbent president to lose an election in almost 30 years. Joe Biden’s vote surged by almost 16 million votes compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016, an increase of almost a quarter. It is one of the great ironies of modern US politics that Biden’s presidency was secured by the Black Lives Matter movement, despite the fact that his whole career had been one of complete opposition to the most modest attempts to combat racism in the US. Yet it was this factor and this movement which defeated Trump. Black Lives Matter took off in 2013 after a series of cop killings of unarmed black people. Typically, no officers were ever charged, let alone convicted. These killings have become endemic in US society. Just this week Sonya Massey, an unarmed black woman, was shot dead by police officers in Chicago after she had called 911 to report a possible intruder. She was shot in her home while talking to the police officers. Years of painstaking work by Black Lives Matter activists erupted into an enormous national movement after the killing of George Floyd, a movement with international resonance as we saw nightly, on our TV screens. It is estimated that up to 16 million people took part in one or more Black Lives Matter protests. Floyd was another unarmed black man murdered in broad daylight by a cop. But, because of all that activism, and because it took place in an election year, it lit a touch paper of protest. It is no exaggeration to say that 2020 was the Black Lives Matter election. The New York Times produces an excellent breakdown of the exit poll demographics for each national election. They are far superior to the various attempts here to shoe-horn data into a preconceived narrative. Think Ashcroft or various distortions of National Readership Surveys provide. What the Times exit poll shows is that this was a “stop Trump’s racism” election: 90 per cent of black women voted for Biden and he easily led in every ethnic category except white (where he lost 58:41). Racial inequality topped the list of voter concerns, identified by 92 per cent of Biden supporters. To underline why people came out in such great numbers, 53 per cent of Republicans said they voted mainly for Trump, while 68 per cent of Democrats said they voted against Trump. By 2020, voters in general, but all ethnic minorities in particular, had seen enough of Trump to repel them. They either did not know or put to one side Biden’s history of allying with the Senate far right to oppose school desegregation or to incarcerate vastly more black and Latino men on minor charges. In a similar fashion, the 2022 midterm elections were widely expected to be a rout of the Democrats in both houses of Congress. But “Stop Trump” again became the battle cry after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade protections for a woman’s right to choose. In these elections, strangely, Democrats lost the popular vote by a wide margin but won every single battleground seat. This was based on the differential in turnout of women. Essentially, where a Republican could be defeated, women turned out in their droves to oppose further curbs on the right to choose. Which brings us up to date in 2024. Biden was always set to lose to Trump even before the shooting. He presided over the biggest decline in US living standards since the Great Depression. He was politically incapable of galvanising the coalitions that had previously opposed Trump precisely because he agreed too much with him. On the economy, women’s rights, racism, trade union rights and war, Biden offered nothing different to Trump. The question now is whether Harris can mobilise the same forces, or at least enough of them to successfully stop Trump. The short answer is yes, she can. But it will not be easy. Political movements cannot just be conjured out of the air. And Harris may suffer by association with the deeply unpopular Biden. The more she can reasonably distance herself from her boss the better. Opinion polls offer some encouragement, with Harris narrowly ahead since Biden announced he was stepping aside. But it is very tight, and certainly not enough to overcome the bias of the electoral college. The stakes are enormously high and the consequences could be profound.

When San Francisco recycled DH Jorge Soler at the trade deadline last week, general manager Farhan Zaidi made it clear that pitching was the Giants’ best path forward. “We feel we have the best rotation in baseball,” Zaidi told reporters after the deadline passed with few adjustments. A staff of perennial Cy Young candidates has made a strong early case that Zaidi has the right approach for always-pitcher-friendly Oracle Park as the Giants look for their first postseason appearance since a wondrous 107-win 2021 season. “We expect to be there,” Zaidi said.

Ray made his first appearance in 14 months, since undergoing after Tommy John surgery in May, 2023. Pitching has always been top of mind. Ray and Snell were acquired during the Giants’ spending spree last winter, when they committed $271 million to four free agents — center fielder Jung-hoo Lee, third baseman Matt Chapman, Soler and left-hander Snell. Ray and his $23 million salary came over from Seattle in a January trade for Mitch Haniger and Anthony DeSclafani. The deadline calculation enabled them to save the remaining $30 million on Soler’s three-year deal. Lee, who signed a six-year, $113 million contact, suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in mid-May, but the Giants have compensated offensively because of the strong play of Heliot Ramos, a former No. 1 draft pick who has blossomed at age 24 and was one of two Giants (Webb was the other) to make the NL All-Star team.

All rights reserved Touted prospect Marco Luciano, who received a $2.6 million signing bonus in 2018, is expected to take many of Soler’s at-bats as both designated hitter and as an occasional infielder, and the Giants also added outfielder Mark Canha at the deadline. Soler had 12 homers, a precipitous drop from the 36 he hit with Miami last season, so any loss may be negligible. The Giants were last in the majors in stolen bases and 24th in home runs despite 15 from Chapman and Ramos, numbers that give extra weight to their dependence on a pitching staff that may finally be healthy. “It’s been a long road to get our rotation to the place that it’s in now,” Zaidi said. “When you have starting pitching like that, it can get you on a roll. For us, to keep that group together … was a really high priority. That was really our central philosophy going into the deadline. We have a rotation that can carry this team down the stretch and get us on a roll.” Snell, won the NL Cy Young award with San Diego last season after winning it with Tampa Bay in 2018, has made only 11 starts this season because of adductor and groin injuries but has been been virtually unhittable in five starts since returning July 9.

He has given up eight hits and two runs while striking out 41 in 33 innings in that stretch, and Marquee Sports Network player development analyst Lance Brozdowski has noticed a change in Snell’s approach. Snell is throwing his four-seam fastball to right-handed hitters more to the inside part of the plate, which has reduced hard contact. He also is throwing more curveballs and fewer changeups to righties. “If anybody has the stuff to throw a no-hitter, it's Blake Snell,” said Giants manager Bob Melvin, who managed Snell with the Padres the last two seasons. With Snell and Ray in place, the Giants traded starter Alex Cobb to Cleveland at the deadline and placed Jordan Hicks in the bullpen in deference to the strong showings by rookies Kyle Harrison and Hayden Birdsong. Harrison is 6-4 with a 3.69 ERA in 18 starts and Birdsong is 3-0 with a 2.97 ERA in six major league starts after opening the season at from Double A Richmond and making a quick stop at Triple-A Sacramento. “The job Hayden’s done, for us to really believe in the roll this group of five starters can get on,” Zaidi said, “you have to take a little bit of a chance and a leap of faith that they’re going to pitch and they’re going to be healthy. If something happens, we’ll have to figure out another plan.” Pleasant surprise Hayden Birdsong confers with San Francisco pitching coach Bryan Price. (AP ...

Biden also endorsed Harris the day he withdrew from the race and she is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.The sudden change in Walz's schedule comes as Harris is reportedly in the final stages of vetting candidates in her search for a running mate.CNN senior reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere wrote on X, formerly Twitter, about Walz's change in travel plans: \"A little more veepstakes NEWS: from Tim Walz's spokesman: 'The governor's schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to New Hampshire this weekend.'\"Harris is expected to meet with her vetting team today for a series of in-depth presentations on each of the finalists. These briefings, lasting between 60 to 90 minutes each, are designed to provide Harris with comprehensive information on the candidates' backgrounds, qualifications, and potential impact on the ticket.The list of finalists reportedly includes Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, alongside Walz.The presentations may result in a narrowing of the field, with Harris expected to conduct final interviews, possibly in-person on Sunday, according to CNN.Newsweek has contacted the Harris campaign and Walz's press office via email on Saturday for comment.Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, whose law firm is conducting the vetting process, was seen arriving at the Naval Observatory on Saturday morning, underscoring the high-stakes nature of these deliberations.Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach with a 24-year career in the Army National Guard, brings a unique blend of experiences to the table. As a congressman, he represented a deep-red district in Minnesota, demonstrating an ability to appeal to voters across the political spectrum. His background in education, military service, and agriculture could potentially resonate with voters in key battleground states, particularly in the Midwest.In a recent op-ed for Newsweek, former Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, made a case for Walz as Harris' running mate. Ryan emphasized the importance of selecting a candidate who can connect with working-class voters, particularly in the Rust Belt. He highlighted Walz's understanding of issues critical to Midwestern voters, such as job creation, health care access, and education.The timing of Walz's schedule change is particularly noteworthy, mirroring a similar move by Shapiro who recently canceled a fundraising trip to the Hamptons in New York. These parallel developments have intensified the buzz around both governors as potential VP picks.Harris' top consideration in selecting a running mate is reportedly electability. The choice will not only impact the campaign's strategy, but also signal the Democratic Party's priorities and vision for the future.With Harris expected to announce her running mate before a planned campaign rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the political world is on high alert for any further schedule changes or announcements from the potential VP candidates.","summary":"The Minnesota governor canceled his trip to New Hampshire as Vice President Kamala Harris continues to vet running mates.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tim-walz-cancels-new-hampshire-trip-kamala-harris-running-mate-1934241","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442398/tim-walz-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:25:47","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.301},{"id":253322904,"title":"'It reeks': Law enforcement balks at Trump's 'Secretary of Retribution' plan","text":"The self-styled “secretary of retribution” for Donald Trump, who created a “Deep State target list” a prominent congressman describes as a “vigilante death warrant for hundreds of Americans,” received an audience earlier this month with the very people he’s sought to attract: law enforcement officers. Ivan Raiklin, a retired Army lieutenant colonel with designs on conducting “live-streamed swatting raids” against the more than 350 politicians, federal employees, journalists and others on the list, detailed his plans to about two dozen police officials gathered earlier this month for a sheriffs’ association conference in Fort Worth, Texas.RELATED ARTICLE: Trump’s ‘secretary of retribution’ has a ‘target list’ of 350 people he wants arrested Raiklin’s 20-minute presentation to the Texas law enforcement officials took place in a private meeting room on July 22 in a restaurant in Fort Worth, according to a video reviewed by Raw Story. During his presentation, Raiklin laid out a legally dubious plan in which he suggested the law enforcement officials could investigate various high-ranking Democrats by reviewing their private communications on the social media platform X, and then correlating the geo-located data to their local counties. In previous interviews on right-wing podcasts, Raiklin has suggested that the communications, were they to be disclosed, would provide digital evidence of crimes that would then justify law enforcement investigations and “swatting raids” — the latter term apparently referring to arrests. Raw Story has confirmed that at least two county sheriffs were among the law enforcement personnel attending the event, which one sheriff said was hosted by an organization called Texans for Constitutional Sheriffs. “We are pleading with you at the county level,” Raiklin told the group, adding that he plans to “use capabilities like some people have in this room to sift through all of their digital assets.” With Trump now facing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, Raiklin predicted that the next six weeks in American politics would get “spicy,” and he presented a conspiratorial narrative about supposed ruthless “Deep State” agents willing to go to any lengths to maintain their hold on power. RELATED ARTICLE: Trump ‘secretary of retribution’ won't discuss his ‘target list’ at RNC “They may have already assassinated Joe Biden, for all we know,” Raiklin said during his talk, which took place one day after President Joe Biden announced his decision to drop out of the presidential race. (Contrary to speculation by right-wing conspiracy theorists, Biden is alive.) “They are willing to go to any length to retain their power, and we have to go to the mat to make sure that we get our constitutional order back in place,” Raiklin continued. “And it requires everybody in this room and your colleagues at the county level — local action, national impact — to reset and body-check this lawlessness.” The law enforcement personnel in the audience participated in Raiklin’s classroom-style presentation by engaging in a call-and-response session. For example, Raiklin asked the sheriff officials to name a business mogul who had recently moved his company headquarters from California to Texas. “Elon Musk,” one man responded. Raiklin also called on them to name the local Texas counties where they worked. “We want to see all forms of communication between Twitter employees and their emails, and their internal Slack channels, and their Twitter direct messages inside the Twitter platform with the geo-tagged, geo-located metadata applied to everyone on the Deep State target list,” Raiklin said. “And then decide where a criminal interaction took place by jurisdiction. Anything that has Texas on it in county….” Raiklin paused, and then called on one of the audience members. “What county?” he asked a stocky man with piercing blue eyes. That man, Sheriff Edward A. Miller, volunteered to Raiklin that he leads the sheriff’s office in Shackelford, a county with a population of 3,105 that is roughly 125 miles west of Fort Worth and not near any interstate highways. With this tangible piece of information, Raiklin continued his hypothetical, asking the law enforcement officials to imagine that Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) — a prominent, liberal congressman who previously expressed concern about Raiklin to Raw Story — was “driving through Shackelford County.” RELATED ARTICLE: Texas news station removes press release praising Trump's ‘secretary of retribution’ Then, perhaps recognizing the remote likelihood of the hypothetical, Raiklin abruptly asked for another volunteer. An unidentified man volunteered the name of McLennan County, located on Interstate 35 between Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth region. Its county seat is the city of Waco. Then, Raiklin moved on to a more plausible place where Raskin might travel. “Who is near a major airport?” he asked. “Anyone?” A woman attending Raiklin’s presentation volunteered the names of Tarrant and Dallas, the two counties across which Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport stretches. Miller, the sheriff of Shackelford County, Texas, told Raw Story by phone that Raiklin’s presentation was put on by Texans for Constitutional Sheriffs. Sheriff Parnell McNamara of McLennan County told Raw Story that someone he didn't know invited him to the restaurant for a steak dinner while he was eating lunch at the Fort Worth Convention Center, where the Sheriff's Association of Texas Annual Training Conference and Expo was held from July 20 to July 23. McNamara said he ate the steak, but didn't stay for the presentation. He told Raw Story he doesn't know Raiklin and hasn't communicated with him before or since. After reviewing social media posts showing Raiklin mingling in the exhibition hall at the conference, Skylor Hearn, executive director of the Sheriffs' Association of Texas, confirmed that they show Raiklin wearing an \"exhibitor\" badge issued by the association. Some of the posts depicting Raiklin at the sheriffs' conference show him seated in front of large placards for two different organizations — one that provides legal support to defendants charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and the other promoting the hand-counting of election ballots. One post includes a photograph showing Raiklin speaking with Morris County, Texas, Sheriff Jack Martin. The caption indicates that Martin had been “informed to be prepared” to receive a tranche of private messages from X “and let his district attorney know it’s coming for Deep State Target List development.” Martin did not return multiple messages from Raw Story seeking comment on Raiklin’s pitch. Nor did the sheriffs’ offices in Tarrant and Dallas counties, which were both referenced by one of the audience members during Raiklin’s presentation. “We get a wide variety of vendors,” Hearn told Raw Story. “If someone is willing to stop and listen to them, they can talk about their widgets or their worldview.” McNamara, the sheriff in McLennan County, said he was similarly enticed when he received the invitation to Raiklin's presentation at the restaurant. \"Different vendors are wanting you to come and wanting to buy you dinner, and I thought that's what this was about,\" he said. The sheriffs' conference included official trainings that allow participants to earn credits through the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, but Hearn said Raiklin’s presentation to the sheriffs at the restaurant “was definitely not part of our programming.” Raiklin, who attended the sheriffs conference only three days after appearing at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee as a credentialed guest, did not respond to requests for comment on this story. When Raw Story approached Raiklin last month at the Republican National Convention, Raiklin refused to answer various questions, including those about his \"target list\" and plan to work with largely rural, conservative county sheriffs to deputize some 75,000 military veterans to arrest people on his list. The video of Raiklin's presentation shows a man who appears to be Kirk Launius, founder and director of Texans for Constitutional Sheriffs, assisting Raiklin by selecting a slide for his audio-visual presentation. Launius' LinkedIn profile describes him as a Dallas-based \"global internet entrepreneur, mobile business coach, social media strategist and philanthropist\" who was previously employed as a Dallas police officer. Launius ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Dallas County in 2012 and 2016. Launius could not be reached for comment for this story. ‘America will respond in kind’ Since the beginning of the year, Raiklin has zealously promoted his plan to enlist sheriffs to detain federal employees and others who have run afoul of Trump and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser. On podcasts and social media, Raiklin often presents a bill of particulars against individuals on his “target list” based on a dubious legal framework and dubious claims, such as suggesting without evidence that the unidentified person responsible for setting pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee on Jan. 6, 2021, was “a subordinate-surrogate of the Capitol Police Board,” which oversees the Capitol Police. Raiklin’s claims carry an undercurrent of violence: He accuses perceived Trump enemies of treason, and his social media followers sometimes make the logical leap that people on Raiklin’s “target list” should face the punishment of death. Raiklin has forged a close relationship with Flynn, who was his former boss at the Defense Intelligence Agency, a federal entity where Raiklin worked during the past decade. Following an unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate from Virginia in 2018, Raiklin became an avid Trump supporter, and worked in tandem with Flynn to overturn the 2020 election. Over the course of this year, Raiklin has appeared at events to promote a laudatory documentary film about Flynn. Prior to each screening, Raiklin typically presents a museum-style “evidence wall” arguing that many of the individuals on his “Deep State target list” conspired in a plot to persecute Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But the U.S. Department of Justice dropped its case against Flynn in May 2020, and later that year, then-President Trump issued Flynn a pardon. Raiklin’s rhetoric over the past two months has escalated to the point where he has directly called for violence. In one X post, Raiklin mocked former national security adviser Alexander Vindman, suggesting that he would “speak to him in person” and asking for his “preferred punishment for committing treason.” Raiklin supporters on X responded by suggesting variations on hanging or execution by firing squad. Since the attempt on Trump’s life at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, Raiklin has claimed without evidence that members of the so-called “Deep State” are involved in a plot to assassinate the former president and current 2024 Republican nominee for president. In an X post on July 22, Raiklin decreed that “all leading contenders” to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee — Vice President Kamala Harris ostensibly included — “are to be treated as the ones behind ordering the assassination of President Trump.” He further warned that “America will respond in kind unless they turn themselves in.” Lira Gallagher, a spokesperson for the FBI Washington Field Office, declined to comment on whether Raiklin is on the agency’s radar. During his presentation to the Texas sheriffs, Raiklin singled out Raskin, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, for scrutiny. Raskin has previously described Raiklin’s list as a “vigilante death warrant for hundreds of Americans, and a clear and present danger to the survival of American democracy and freedom.” Raskin called on House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to repudiate threats of political violence. Since then, Raiklin has appeared to taunt Raskin by posting a photo of himself clasping hands with Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) at the Republican National Convention. Higgins has falsely claimed that a “ghost bus… filled with FBI informants dressed as Trump supporters” descended on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\" “What do you think we discussed, @RepRaskin?” Raiklin wrote. “Maybe @SpeakerJohnson can tell you.” Then, on the same day he spoke to the Texas sheriffs, Raiklin accused Raskin of being “involved in the assassination attempt” against Trump, while acknowledging that he has no evidence to back his claim. Miller, the sheriff of Shackelford County, said he came away confused about what Raiklin was asking him to do. “I don’t know where you would come up with a crime if they’re 30,000 feet in the air,” Miller told Raw Story. “It seems like that would be more likely to be investigated as a federal conspiracy.” Miller said he expected Raiklin’s talk to provide sheriffs with insight on how they can follow the Constitution, but that wasn’t what they heard. “My opinion is that the presentation that should have been given is, ‘This is the United States Constitution. We believe that the sheriff and the county should follow the Constitution as it relates to the inalienable rights of the citizens,’” Miller said. “That wasn’t the presentation that was given. It was a presentation on politics.” When Raiklin asked whom in the audience might be “near a major airport,” he zeroed in on the biggest political target of all — Harris — the candidate who is all but certain to go up against Donald Trump in the presidential election. An unidentified woman in the audience volunteered that Tarrant and Dallas counties in Texas encompass Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. “Imagine they flew through there as they’re waiting,” Raiklin said. “They communicate.” He went on to specifically name Harris, while suggesting that the law enforcement officers could investigate her “comms team” based on private emails that they might have exchanged while waiting for a connecting flight. Raiklin’s motivations — and a pitch to law enforcement During his presentation in Fort Worth, Raiklin suggested his motivation for attempting to exact retribution on federal government employees was being placed under surveillance by the Department of Homeland Security following Jan. 6, 2021, when he was spotted on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. In the runup to Jan. 6, Raiklin had promoted a plan called “Operation Pence Card,” which called for then-Vice President Mike Pence to set aside electoral votes in states narrowly won by Biden, which would have effectively flipped the election in Trump’s favor. “And in the case of my situation — top Secret clearance, reserve lieutenant colonel — cleared TSA pre-check,” Raiklin said, apparently referring to a pat down. “But when I go to travel — not anymore — for 21 months, they subjected me to that Fourth Amendment gang rape, as I reported that procedure, okay? Is that cool?” To establish his qualifications, Raiklin told the group assembled for his presentation that he finished his military career teaching “intelligence analysis at the nation’s premier intelligence analytic program in the U.S. intel community at the Defense Intelligence Agency. “I’m not the smartest guy in the room, but I may know what I’m talking about when it comes to conducting structured analytic techniques, link analysis, timeline, chronology — all taking that capability and applying it to something isn’t right in America,” he added. Raiklin’s plan depends on cooperation from a series of powerful actors, as he explained to the law enforcement officers present for his presentation. He told them he wants to see three Republican congressmen who chair House committees — Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, James Comer of Kentucky, and Barry Loudermilk of Georgia — or Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton subpoena X owner Elon Musk for the private direct messages of the 350-some individuals on his “Deep State target list.” A spokesperson for Loudermilk did not respond to a request for comment on the record, and emails to Jordan, Comer and Paxton similarly went unreturned. Prior to speaking with sheriffs in Fort Worth last week, Raiklin had attempted to cultivate relationships with sheriffs through the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, which espouses the controversial belief that sheriffs are the highest law in the land and are not legally required to uphold state and federal laws they deem to be unconstitutional.","summary":"The self-styled “secretary of retribution” for Donald Trump, who created a “Deep State target list” a prominent congressman describes as a “vigilante death warrant for hundreds of Americans,” received an audience earlier this month with the very people he’s sought to attract: law enforcement officers.\n\nIvan Raiklin, a retired Army lieutenant colonel with designs on conducting “live-streamed swatting raids” against the more than 350 politicians, federal employees, journalists and others on the list, detailed his plans to about two dozen police officials gathered earlier this month for a sheriffs’ association conference in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Trump’s ‘secretary of retribution’ has a ‘target list’ of 350 people he wants arrested\n\nRaiklin’s 20-minute presentation to the Texas law enforcement officials took place in a private meeting room on July 22 in a restaurant in Fort Worth, according to a video reviewed by Raw Story.\n\nDuring his presentation, Raiklin laid out a legally dubious plan in which ","url":"https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/ivan-raiklin-2668883959/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/trumps-secretary-of-retribution-has-a-target-list-of-350-people-he-wants-arrested.png?id=52667491&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C60%2C0%2C60","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:23:09","author":"Jordan Green,Raw Story","authors":["Jordan Green","Raw Story"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":253321674,"title":"Kentucky Republicans ridicule Beshear’s efforts to land spot on national Democratic ticket","text":"Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s efforts to land the No. 2 spot on the national Democratic presidential ticket drew ridicule from prominent Republicans during the Bluegrass State’s premiere political event on Saturday. Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer lampooned the governor for trying to “reinvent his image from a wimpy choir boy to a liberal attack dog.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell fired his own zingers at Beshear during the political speeches at the annual Fancy Farm picnic in western Kentucky. Beshear, who proved to be an effective counterpuncher in prior years at the picnic, wasn’t on hand to defend himself. Instead, he was among a half-dozen Democrats being interviewed this weekend by Vice President Kamala Harris as she closes in on choosing a running mate. Her interview list also includes Govs. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, as well as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people were granted anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. The suspense over whether Beshear will be asked to join the ticket has dominated headlines in Kentucky. On Saturday, Republicans got in their word as they dominated the stage at the picnic grounds. “The leader of the (Kentucky) Democratic Party, the governor, I hear is spending the weekend with Vice President Harris. I’d a lot rather be with you guys,” McConnell told the picnic crowd, which by tradition was divided between boisterous supporters for Republicans and Democrats. McConnell said Democrats had chosen an even worse presidential nominee than Biden. “At least Biden poses as a moderate,” the senator said. “Vice President Harris doesn’t try to be anything but a San Francisco liberal.” At a GOP breakfast on Saturday, McConnell said: “Who would have thought that most of the drama in the last month would have been on the Democratic side, but it has been.” After President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign last month, Democrats quickly coalesced around Harris. Poking fun at Beshear’s praise of Harris, McConnell said it was “no surprise for a guy used to having jobs served up to him on a silver platter.” Beshear, the son of former two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, has won three tough elections in ruby red Kentucky — once for attorney general and twice for governor. The McConnell-Beshear rivalry dates back to the 1990s when McConnell defeated Steve Beshear in a Senate race. McConnell promoted Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by name twice during his picnic speech, saying his return to the White House would “bring our economy roaring back.” McConnell endorsed Trump in March, a remarkable turnaround from the onetime critic who blamed the then-president for “disgraceful” acts in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Comer, chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee, was even more biting with jabs at Beshear on Saturday. Noting that Beshear was applying for a new job, Comer said: “He wants to be vice president so bad that when Kamala Harris asked him what his pronouns were, Andy replied ‘pretty and please.’” Democrats chalked it up as another round of futile attacks on the popular governor. “They don’t work because families know Andy and they know he is genuine, compassionate and he shows up over and over again to deliver for Kentuckians,” Jonathan Levin, a spokesman for the Kentucky Democratic Party, said in a statement. One of the few Democrats on the Fancy Farm stage defended the governor. Erin Marshall, who is challenging Comer in the November election, said she wanted to continue Beshear’s work. “It is time to bring back more jobs to the district, support our farmers, revitalize our small towns and protect a woman’s right to make her own health care choices,” she said. Political speaking is as much a tradition as the barbecue at the Fancy Farm picnic, and it’s become a right of passage for candidates seeking statewide office. As usual, the crowd of Republicans and Democrats tried to outdo the other with chants putting down the opposition. With no statewide office on the ballot this year, the biggest contest is over a proposal constitutional amendment. If the ballot measure is ratified by voters, the state’s GOP-dominated legislature could then decide whether to steer public funds to private or charter school education. Beshear is a leading opponent of the proposal, having said that “public dollars should only go to public schools, period.” Bruce Schreiner, The Associated Press","summary":"Kentucky Gov.

Just two years ago Buffett called the stock one of the four giants of his conglomerate's business alongside Berkshire insurance, utility and BNSF railroad businesses that it owns outright. That gave investors the impression that Buffett might hold onto Apple indefinitely like he has with the Coca-Cola and American Express shares he bought decades ago. READ MORE: Man allegedly hit with metal pole during suspected arson attack However, he has trimmed the Apple stake over the past year and has recently also sold off some of his stock in Bank of America and Chinese EV maker BYD while doing very little buying. As a result, Buffett is now sitting on nearly US$277 billion ($424 billion) in cash, up from what was already a record $294 billion just three months earlier. \"This could could alarm the markets especially given the news from last week\" with weak tech earnings, a disappointing jobs report and uncertainty about the future of interest rates, Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said. READ MORE: Disqualification drama hands Kaylee bronze﻿ Buffett has consistently lavished praise on Apple CEO Tim Cook, who attended Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha in May, and talked about the way consumers are feverishly devoted to their iPhones and don't like to switch. He did trim more than 10 per cent of Berkshire's Apple stake in the first three months of this year when he sold off more than 116 million shares, but the sale disclosed on Saturday was a much bigger move. Berkshire didn't give an exact count of its Apple shares in Saturday's report, but it estimated the investment was worth $129.2 billion at the end of the second quarter even though shares soared over the summer as high as $363.9. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake was worth $207.9 billion. READ MORE: Donald Trump says he'll skip debate with Kamala Harris in September The death of the iPod: The evolution of the device that changed musicView Gallery Shanahan estimates that Berkshire still holds about 400 million Apple shares. Still, while CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she looks at the Apple sale more as responsible portfolio management because the tech giant had become such a large portion of Berkshire's holdings, it does look like Buffett may be preparing for a downturn. \"This is a company girding itself for a weaker economic climate,\" Seifert said. Berkshire reported a small drop in its bottom-line earnings because a drop in the paper value of its investments. The company said it earned $46.6 billion, or $32,435 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That's down from $51.1 billion, or $38,000 per A share, a year ago. Buffett has long cautioned investors that it's better to look at Berkshire's operating earnings when judging its performance because those figures exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely from quarter to quarter. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings grew more than 15 per cent to $17.8 billion, or $12,395 per Class A share, from $15.4 billion, or $10,638 per Class A share, a year ago. Geico led the improvement of Berkshire's businesses while many of its other companies that are more sensitive to the economy reported lackluster results. The results easily topped the $10,028 earnings per share that four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted. Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.

But Trump did. And now the GOP is dealing with the fallout. In Chicago, Trump told attendees of a National Association of Black Journalists convention that Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, was \"Indian all the way\" until “she became a Black person” in recent years. (Harris’ mother is Indian and originally from India, her father is Black and originally from Jamaica.) So Raw Story took Trump’s claim to 10 Senate Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). ‘What?’ “Is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story asked Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) about Harris, who served in the U.S. Senate from 2017 to 2021. “What?” Tuberville exclaimed. “That came up for debate yesterday by the head of your party,” Raw Story explained. ALSO READ:'That's a lie': The 10 quotes Trump said to Black journalists that led to outbursts “I don’t get in those debates,” Tuberville said. “Is she an American — that's what I don’t know. Is Trump an American? If they’re both Americans, naturalized citizens, hey, they get an opportunity to run for president.” “Are you convinced that she is?” “A citizen?” Tuberville asked. “Yeah, yeah.” “Some people are saying Trump's comments yesterday are a throwback to birtherism under Obama.” “I don't get in that debate. Come on,” Tuberville said. “We need to talk about policies.” “Curious — is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story then asked Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) after he voted in the Capitol on Thursday. “Yes, we know what her ancestry is. She's half Indian, half Jamaican,” Johnson replied. “Do you need to educate the former president on that?” Raw Story asked of Trump. “Or do you think he knows that?” “He's just pointing out that she's kind of claimed different heritages at different times in her political career. That's true, isn't it? He's pointing out the truth,” Johnson said. “You can question whether that was the smart thing to point out, but he's just pointing out what the truth is.” Trump made GOP leaders — present and next gen — squirm “Senator McConnell, is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story asked the Senate minority leader and he and his security detail made their way to the Senate floor. “It seems to be up for debate in your party.” McConnell — who’s announced he’s stepping down as the Republican Senate leader after the November elections — smiled and, per the leader’s usual, said nothing as he walked onto the Senate floor. The next generation of Republican leaders weren’t so stoic. “Is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story asked McConnell’s former right hand man, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who’s vying to replace him. “I can assume we're all a combination of different genetic gene pools, so I don't know,” Cornyn told Raw Story. “I think we're all sort of a mixture.” McConnell’s current number two appeared annoyed by the question. “As far as I know,” Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) — who’s also running to replace McConnell — told Raw Story. “I'm focused on the issues.” The third Senate Republican running to replace McConnell came with a proverbial doctor’s note. “Is Kamala Harris Black?” Raw Story asked as an elevator took Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) up to the Senate floor for a vote. “I didn't hear the comments,” Scott told Raw Story. “He said ‘she turned Black recently,’” Raw Story noted. “I’m always talking about issues,” Scott said. Another reporter interjected: “Do comments like that make you feel uncomfortable in any way?” “I didn't see the comment,” Scott replied. “Do you avoid TV and the paper just to not have to talk about Trump?” Raw Story pressed. “Actually, I don’t watch enough TV,” Scott said as he laughed. “Actually at the time I was giving a speech on the Senate floor.” “Yeah?” “I really was,” Scott said. “Saved by the bell.” GOP war on Democrats’ identities But Democrats fear this bell has only begun to ring as Harris and Trump — and their revved up bases — now sprint toward the election. “I assume so. She says so,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told Raw Story while walking to his office after voting. “I think she's Jamaican-American, right? And Indian.” “What’d you make of that exchange yesterday?” Raw Story pressed. “Here's what I think. My issue is not how she describes herself or her heritage — that’s totally up to her — my issue is what she says she’s going to do as president,\" Hawley said. “It's with her policies, which I think are insane.” “Some people say it’s Trump stoking Charlottesville — ‘they will replace us’?” Raw Story said, referencing the racist Unite the Right demonstrations of 2017 that left one woman dead. “Well, you will never convince me that Donald Trump is racist,” Hawley — who infamously revved protestors up by raising his clenched fist on Jan. 6, 2021 — said. “I don't think he's racist at all.” Hawley continued: “I thought he was needling her a little bit and that racial identity politics are just inherently malleable. And, frankly, absurd. I mean, yes, she's an Indian-American. She's a Jamaican-American. Most Americans are multiple — something-American. And, you know, they've got ‘White Dudes for Kamala’ and ‘Asian Pacific Islanders for Kamala.’ I mean, the whole thing is just, most people look at this, like, ‘this is ridiculous.’” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) — who views the entire exchange as “careless politics” — let out a squeak of laughter when asked, “Is Kamala Harris Black?” ALSO READ:Texas sheriffs engage conspiracy theorist who created Trump enemies 'target list' “Well, she's a woman of color,” Cramer replied. “And she said — and she's a — from what I know and what I read — she's a Black. Part Black. She's part Indian. And both are wonderful.” Cramer continued by offering that “when identity politics play a role — or racial identity — plays a role in hiring practices or nominating, you can hardly complain about it if that's the credential that got you the job. In her case, I think what … President Trump's intent was, she's the one that wasn't Black in her own mind —- not in anybody else's — and then when it's convenient, she becomes Black. That's his point.” Cramer added: “I've seen interviews of some other people of color that were really good, because what I think happens is … I think, it's already baked in to those people. To other people who don't want color to be the reason that people look at them as successful, they're offended by her,” Cramer said. “But again, it's not that he's necessarily wrong. As entertaining as it is, there's no need to do it.” As for Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), she, too, said she wasn’t that familiar with Trump’s take on Harris’ race. “I didn't really see it. Obviously, it's been in the news,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) told Raw Story. “I think sticking to the policies is the better strategy here. And so I'll leave it at that.” Outside the Senate chambers Thursday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) trashed Harris’ record as vice president and highlighted her connection with Biden. “She and Joe Biden have spent four years undermining our friends and allies and showing weakness and appeasement to our enemies, which has led to endless wars and chaos abroad,” Cruz said. “Is she Black?” Raw Story asked Cruz of Harris. Cruz didn’t reply as he walked away onto the Senate floor to vote.","summary":"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans weren’t ready for former President Donald Trump to wade into the realm of Vice President Kamala Harris’ race and ethnicity while speaking Wednesday to a room of Black journalists.\n\n\nBut Trump did.

Wray has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!’ Trump hired Wray to head the FBI in 2017. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., veered off-topic to ask about Bide’s decline. ‘When did you notice his decline?’ Gaetz said. ‘In my interactions, in my role, all my interactions with the current president have been completely professional,’ Wray replied. ‘Right, but I mean the cognitive decline,’ the lawmaker pressed. ‘Again, I don’t meet with him very often, but what you’re describing is not something that I’ve observed during my interactions with him,’ Wray explained. Wray described his interactions with Biden as ‘uneventful and unremarkable.’ ‘It never occurred to you that this guy wasn’t up to it in all these briefings you did?’ Gaetz pushed again. ‘As I said, my briefings with the president have all been completely fine,’ Wray insisted. ‘Were they between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.?’ Gaetz wanted to know. ‘We hear those are his good hours.’ ‘Times that I have briefed, I’ve included outside those hours,’ the FBI director observed. Biden stepped down from the 2024 race on Sunday after steep pressure from Democrats who had woken up to concerns about his advanced age and cognitive decline after the debate with Trump. Trump’s would-be assassin Thomas Crooks searched online ‘how far’ Lee Harvey Oswald was from John F. Kennedy when he shot him, the FBI director also revealed in stunning testimony to Congress. FBI Director Christopher Wray also told lawmakers the 20-year-old gunman flew a drone 200 yards from the stage just two hours before he opened fire in Butler, Pennsylvania, and had three explosives in his car. The bombshell revelations from the bureau’s chief give more insight into Crooks’ preparation before he shot the former president, including his online research on the sniper that took out JFK in 1963. Wray said Crooks had been ‘interested in public figures’ and ‘somewhere around July 6 or so he became very focused on former President Trump and his rally.’ The director said an analysis of Crooks’ laptop revealed he had searched on Google on July 6 ‘how far away was Oswald from Kennedy.’ It was the same day he registered to attend the Butler rally. Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed former President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Crooks was flying a drone above the rally site two hours before the shooting and just 200 yards away from the stage, Wray has also revealed. Wray made the bombshell revelation to Congress on Wednesday during a grilling by lawmakers on the investigation into the assassination attempt on the former president and the massive security failures. Crooks shot Trump in the ear just 400 feet away from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter of the event. Wray revealed that investigators found Crooks had a drone that he used to survey the scene hours before the event started, which was recovered from his car parked nearby. He flew the drone around 4 p.m. over the area of the rally close to ‘200 yards’ from the stage to survey the scene. Trump took the stage around 6:03 p.m., over two hours later. The FBI has also recovered three ‘explosive devices’ in possession of Crooks. They were ‘relatively crude devices’ but had the ability ‘to be detonated remotely,’ Wray said. The FBI director also revealed the weapon used had a ‘collapsible stock,’ which he said ‘could explain why it might’ve been less easy for people to observe.’ Wray could not say whether Crooks carried the gun up to the roof with him before he fired the shots or had stashed it there prior. He said the gunman did not use a ladder to get onto the roof but rather some sort of ‘vertical piping.’ He said Crooks and his family owned a combined 14 guns and Crooks had visited a shooting range one day before the rally. Crooks used an AR-style weapon that had been purchased legally by his father and sold to him in October 2023. Wray said eight bullet cartridges had been recovered from the roof where Crooks fired off his shots toward the former president. And he wouldn’t rule out that Crooks did not have any accomplices to the crime, saying it’s still being looked at by law enforcement. As Wray faced questions about why the president was allowed on stage despite the ‘threat’ being identified 20 minutes before the shots were fired, Wray said, ‘we don’t know the answer to that.’ He said that no one in law enforcement saw Crooks with lying down in a shooting position with a gun in hand until ‘moments before’ he fired, but had seen him on the roof ‘minutes before.’ But he insisted his investigation was not focused on the security breach and the Secret Service failures. ‘Our investigation is focused on the shooter and all things related to his attack.’ Wray was peppered with veiled references to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) measures that some Republicans have taken to blaming the security breach on. Wray insisted the physical fitness standards for getting in to the FBI ‘actually exceed’ what they’ve been in years past and insisted his agency does not factor in DEI when making hiring decisions. His hearing comes days after the former Director of Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle was forced to resign after evading answering rounds of questioning by punting to the FBI in another congressional hearing earlier this week. Wray promised his agency would leave ‘no stone unturned’ and emphasized that he wanted to provide all the information he had at this point of the ongoing investigation. ‘The shooter may be deceased but the FBI’s investigation is very much ongoing.’ He also made a reference to the warnings he has been giving Congress for years now about the threats of domestic terrorism. The shooting is ‘another example, particularly heinous and very public one of what I have been talking about.’ Wray again warned about ‘passion and heated rhetoric turning into actual violence.’ ‘We’ve seen it against public officials of all sorts, we’ve seen it against law enforcements the number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty is alarming.’ ‘It’s almost every five days that a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty, that is an example of the kinds of ways passion and heated rhetoric can bubble over into violence.’ The Judiciary Committee hearing focused on both the shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally and the ‘ongoing politicization’ of the FBI. Questioning on a separate foiled Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump was also a subject of contention. A bombshell report last week revealed the U.S. received intelligence of an Iranian assassination plot in the weeks before Trump was shot at the Pennsylvania rally. Meanwhile, House Republicans are expected to set up a bipartisan task force to investigate the shooting in a vote this week. The FBI and Secret Service revealed to lawmakers last week they spotted shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before he fired a shot. Twenty minutes passed between the time Secret Service agents spotted Crooks with a gun on the rooftop and he fired shots at the president. In a staggering moment, Cheatle admitted on Monday her agents on the ground were warned between two and five times that there was a ‘suspicious person’ reported before Trump took the stage. While Trump walked around with little more than a bloody ear, Crooks killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, and critically injured two other rally goers sitting close to where the former president was speaking last weekend before he was neutralized. The security chief had faced mounting questions over why an agent was not stationed on the roof from where gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the former president, and why Trump was allowed to take the stage even when a threat was detected. She had also been ridiculed for suggesting her agency did not have a presence on the roof because it was ‘sloped.’ The 20-year-old shooter Crooks, was able to get within 160 yards of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. The building on which he stood was outside the security perimeter, despite clearly being within rifle shooting range. And that was despite the FBI learning of a threat on Trump’s life from Iran leading to a bump in security for the former president in the days before the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Cheatle said she believed she was the ‘best person’ to lead the Secret Service at this time, but later acquiesced to the bipartisan demands for her resignation. On the day of the rally, Trump walked out onto the stage at 6:02 p.m. Then at around 6:12 p.m. Crooks’ first shots rang out. Cheatle could not tell lawmakers how the shooter had gotten onto the roof. At the time of the shooting, law enforcement agents were inside the building, 147 yards away from where Trump stood, but not on top of it. ‘That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there’s a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn’t want to put somebody up on a sloped roof,’ she told ABC News in an interview Tuesday. ‘And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside.’ What transpired instead was a security nightmare: Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to scale the building and secure his own position, while law enforcement struggled to locate him even amid pressing warnings from members of the Trump crowd. But there wasn’t sufficient time to act on the tips, she explained. ‘The shooter was actually identified as a potential person of suspicion,’ Cheatle said. ‘Unfortunately, with the rapid succession of how things unfolded, by the time that individual was eventually located, they were on the rooftop and were able to fire off at the former president.’ She was referencing claims by witnesses that they alerted law enforcement about the threat, but agents weren’t able to eliminate the threat in time. Officials have pointed to the initial responding officer, who lifted himself up on the roof only to lower himself back when the gunman turned his weapon at him. Cheatle has taken blame for the fateful security breach, but has denied calls to step down. ‘The buck stops with me,’ she said. ‘It was unacceptable,’ she told ABC. ‘And it’s something that shouldn’t happen again.’ ‘While we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret Service agents who did their jobs under immense pressure, this tragedy was preventable. The Secret Service has a zero fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally,’ Comer is also expected to say, as he will again call for Cheatle’s resignation. Also coming into question on the call was the possible motive for Crooks to commit such an atrocity. Officials did not confirm an operating motive and said that his rationale remains a mystery. Authorities said that they have yet to find any ideological material that could shine light on why Crooks decided to shoot the former president. But, they did reveal that Crooks operated several accounts on encrypted platforms that they are still working to gain access to.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump demanded FBI Director Christopher Wray be fired for refusing to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Asks FBI Director Wray to Step Down After Saying He Did Not Notice Biden&#8217;s Decline Before Withdrawal first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-asks-fbi-director-wray-to-step-down-after-saying-he-did-not-notice-bidens-decline-before-withdrawal/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/24/22/87730881-13669507-image-a-5_1721856807622.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:14:37","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":253321972,"title":"Harris campaign staffs up in battleground states, ‘Sun Belt’","text":"WILMINGTON, Del. >> Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign is staffing up in battleground states over the next two weeks including in the ‘Sun Belt’ that increasingly looked out of reach for President Joe Biden, citing momentum for her White House bid as grassroots engagement and fundraising soar. “Our grassroots engagement is proving that Kamala Harris is strong in both the Sunbelt and the Blue Wall — with multiple pathways to 270,” wrote Dan Kanninen, the campaign’s battleground states director in a memo today. The Sunbelt refers to states including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, and the Blue Wall includes Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President Joe Biden won all six of those states in 2020 by thin margins, but just weeks ago, his campaign said the Sun Belt and North Carolina looked increasingly out of reach. Harris’ takeover of Biden’s campaign has injected new energy, money and enthusiasm into the race, which is translating into a shift in polls that show her pulling even with Trump or ahead in some battleground states. Since Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris on July 21, 200,000 volunteers have joined the Harris campaign, while over 350,000 supporters attended their first phone bank, rally or other campaign event — an over 350% increase in event attendees, Kanninen said. Her campaign announced on Friday it raised $310 million in July, fueled by small-dollar donations. In the next two weeks, the campaign will add 150 more staff in the “Blue Wall,” and will more than double its staff in Arizona and North Carolina, Kanninen said. Harris campaign’s operations on the ground are more extensive than Republican nominee former President Donald Trump, he said. “In Nevada, Team Harris has 13 offices, while Trump has just one,” Kanninen wrote. “In Pennsylvania, we have 36 coordinated offices while Trump has just 3. In Georgia, we have 24 offices while the Trump team didn’t open their first until June.” The Trump campaign did not immediately confirm the accuracy of those numbers, and did not respond to a request for comment. This week Trump’s campaign was set to launch a $10 million advertising blitz in six battleground states. A super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz after it said it will spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticizing Harris. Some political experts have questioned Trump’s lack of campaign infrastructure in recent days. “Those of us who are interested in voting are like, ‘Why don’t you need a ground game?’” political historian Heather Cox Richardson said in a Facebook livestream. “It really takes feet on the ground, knuckles on doors, meetings with people, everything to get money circulating … He is not trying to get enough votes.” Harris held a marginal one-percentage-point lead over Republican Donald Trump in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, closing the gap that opened in the final weeks of President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. The three-day poll showed Harris supported by 43% of registered voters, with former President Trump supported by 42%, within the poll’s 3.5 percentage point margin of error.","summary":"WILMINGTON, Del. >> Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s presidential campaign is staffing up in battleground states over the next two weeks including in the &#8216;Sun Belt&#8217; that increasingly looked out of reach for President Joe Biden, citing momentum for her White House bid as grassroots engagement and fundraising soar.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/03/breaking-news/harris-campaign-staffs-up-in-battleground-states-sun-belt/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_2024-08-03T162415Z_1341370258_RC2859AGESBM_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-HARRIS-CAMPAIGN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:13:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":253321518,"title":"KCON LA 2024 Brings Kdrama Stars; Plus, KCON Germany And MAMA Awards","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Kim Soo-hyun and Park Min-young hold fan meetings at KCON LA 2024 CJ ENM KCON, the world’s largest K-culture festival, once again took Los Angeles by storm last weekend.

Sunday’s M Countdown—the main concert held every night during KCON—was also broadcast live on The CW Network, marking the first-ever national primetime broadcast of a K-pop concert.

Shin. “So KCON has been evolving to suit their diversifying tastes, like by including artists from various genres and generations, K-drama stars and music groups with no Korean members.” Forbes'The Acolyte' Actor Lee Jung-Jae Talks Star Wars And His Role ModelBy Regina Kim That strategy has clearly paid off. In the days leading up to KCON LA 2024, KCON USA’s Instagram account as well as various Facebook K-culture groups and other online communities were flooded with comments from fans saying they were planning to attend KCON just to see actors Kim Soo-hyun, Park Min-young and/or Rowoon. Actor Rowoon hosts Friday's M Countdown at KCON LA 2024 CJ ENM As the stars of two of the most popular K-dramas this year—Queen of Tears and Marry My Husband—Kim Soo-hyun and Park Min-young held special fan meetings to talk about their respective K-dramas and to reflect on their acting performances. Both fan meetings drew some of the largest crowds at the convention—in fact, Kim’s fan meeting was reportedly the most-attended session in KCON LA’s 12-year history. (As the journalist who emceed his fan meeting, I have to admit that I’d never before seen such a noisy and enthusiastic audience as I did at his fan meeting, except perhaps at a stadium-size K-pop concert. I’ve been to events where crowds will go wild over Hollywood A-listers, but they all felt like meditation classes compared to the ear-shattering cries, screams and shrieks I heard at Kim Soo-hyun’s fan meeting.) Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun's special fan meeting CJ ENM I had the privilege of hosting Park Min-young’s fan meeting as well, and while the audience there was fortunately calmer and, um, less thirsty, its respect and admiration for Park and her work was no less palpable. Many attendees also seemed impressed by Park’s ability to converse entirely in English as she spoke at length about her hit K-drama Marry My Husband and her illustrious acting career. Actress Park Min-young poses with the crowd at her special fan meeting at KCON LA 2024 CJ ENM Kim Soo-hyun, who clearly looked stunned by the wildly enthusiastic response, delighted the crowd with his sense of humor and deep appreciation for his adoring fans as he waved and smiled at them throughout his fan meeting. Kim Soo-hyun poses with the audience at his special fan meeting at KCON LA 2024 CJ ENM According to a press release from Studio Dragon—the K-drama production powerhouse that secured Park Min-young, Kim Soo-hyun and Rowoon for KCON LA 2024—the participation of Park and Kim “was part of KCON's mission to offer experiences encompassing not only K-pop but also K-food, K-beauty and other aspects of Korean culture. By connecting K-drama stars with K-pop fans, KCON aimed to further expand the reach of K-content globally.” So what can K-culture fans expect for next year’s KCON LA? While planning for next year’s event is still a long ways off, it seems CJ ENM is hoping to continue broadening the scope of KCON. “We’ve expanded and evolved the event based on what fandoms want, and I think it’ll be the same next year,” Shin says. “Our company CJ organizes KCON, and CJ Group has a diverse portfolio of cultural offerings, including food products, films, K-dramas, music, fashion—they’re all part of K-culture, and we’re going to continue offering what our target audience and consumers want within K-culture. We’re planning to introduce not just K-pop idols but other kinds of artists as well, so that fans can enjoy a wider range [of artists].” Inside the LA Convention Center at KCON LA 2024 CJ ENM In the meantime, K-culture fans can look forward to KCON Germany, which will take place at Messe Frankfurt on September 28th - 29th, 2024. This is the first time that KCON will be held in Germany, the world’s fourth-largest recorded music market. The 2024 MAMA Awards—one of the world’s leading K-pop awards shows—will be held in Los Angeles for the first time this November, with the three-day ceremony kicking off in L.A. on November 21st before continuing on in Osaka, Japan on November 22nd and 23rd. “Hollywood is the birthplace of pop culture, so in addition to KCON, we’ve always been wanting to hold an awards ceremony in L.A.,” says Shin. “As for why the awards ceremony will be simultaneously hosted in L.A. and Japan—the largest music market in the world is the U.S., followed by Japan. And since there’s a huge K-pop fandom in Japan and the market is big there, we chose Japan.” ForbesBest New Music By ATEEZ, Jimin, NewJeans, CHUU, Afgan, Hyukoh And MoreBy Regina Kim Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

As the new Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris has since announced her intention to stick to the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News — previously announced in May between Trump and Biden before he dropped out — even if Trump doesn't show up. In the late hours of Friday, Aug. 2, the Republican candidate, 78, announced on his Truth Social platform that he \"agreed\" with Fox News to debate Harris, 59, on Sept. 4. In the post, he claimed his ABC News debate was \"terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant.\" Fox News had previously invited Trump and Harris to debate on Sept. 17. Trump cited a \"a conflict of interest\" while announcing his decision to not participate in the ABC News debate, writing that he's \"in litigation against ABC Network\" and George Stephanopoulos. As previously reported, Trump filed a lawsuit against the political commentator, claiming that Stephanopoulos defamed him during an interview when he used the word \"rape\" when mentioning Trump being found liable for sexually abusing and defaming former Elle advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a civil trial last year. While Trump is now citing the litigation as a reason for his debate move to Fox News, he initially filed his suit against ABC News and Stephanopoulos in March — weeks before he and Biden agreed to the debate. Trump wrote on his social media platform that the he's since shifted his focus on the Fox News debate, which he said would be held in Pennsylvania at a \"site in an area to be determined,\" with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum as moderators. \"...And the Rules will be similar to the Rules of my Debate with Sleepy Joe, who has been treated horribly by his Party,\" Trump claimed. \"BUT WITH A FULL ARENA AUDIENCE!\" On Saturday, Aug, 3, Harris responded to a screenshot of Trump's post with a message on X (formerly Twitter): “It’s interesting how ‘anytime, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe place.' I’ll be there on September 10th, like he agreed to. I hope to see him there,\" Harris wrote, referring to the previously agreed upon ABC News debate. In her response, Harris appeared to quote a message Trump shared with his supporters at a rally in Wisconsin in April, when he called on Biden to debate him \"any time, any place\" and \"any way you want.\" Trump then claimed on Truth Social after Harris' post that she \"doesn’t even want to debate me\" during his proposed debate time after he backed out of the ABC News debate. He also claimed that she was \"afraid to do it.\" Meanwhile, Harris Campaign Communications Director Michael Tyler told ABC News in a statement that Trump is \"running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out.\" \"He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10,\" Tyler told the outlet. \"The Vice President will be there one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience. We’re happy to discuss further debates after the one both campaigns have already agreed to. Mr. Anytime, Anywhere, Anyplace should have no problem with that unless he’s too scared to show up on the 10th.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. In a Fox News interview earlier this week, per PBS, Trump claimed he could \"make a case\" for not participating in a debate against the vice president, and said he'd \"probably end up debating\" Harris. In May, both Biden and Trump agreed upon two debates — the one that already took place on CNN in June and the upcoming ABC News debate in September. The agreement came after the Biden campaign announced, per NPR, that the current president would not participate in terms laid out by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has facilitated presidential debates since 1988. The Republican National Committee also shared in April 2022 that it was quitting the Commission on Presidential Debates, per the outlet.","summary":"“It’s interesting how ‘anytime, any place’ becomes ‘one specific time, one specific safe place,’ ” Harris said about Trump","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-agrees-to-fox-debate-in-september-kamala-harris-stands-by-abc-news-debate-plans-8689968","image":"https://people.com/thmb/rymYa3oAOmo1GZHpxse7JG2yqP0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(739x258:741x260)/Kamala-Harris-trump-072124-1-d3abe68cf06c45818b279683834b3222.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:11:06","author":"Brenton Blanchet","authors":["Brenton Blanchet"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":253321184,"title":"João Félix’s Future At Atlético Madrid Takes Surprising Turn","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin João Félix returned to action for Atlético Madrid in a preseason friendly against Getafe. Getty Images Amid ongoing speculation surrounding his future, João Félix made a surprising return to action in the colors of Atlético Madrid at the Coliseum Alfonso Pérez on Saturday night. The Portuguese international started and played the first half of the friendly game against Getafe, scoring in an impressive display. Félix returned to training earlier this week, having played a minor role in Portugal’s European Championship campaign which ended as he missed a penalty in the shoot-out against France in the quarter-final. The ex-FC Barcelona loanee started training alone but soon rejoined the group and has been training as usual alongside his teammates. Despite reports that he was only talking to a small number of players, namely Portuguese speakers Reinildo Mandala and Samuel Lino, he was pictured later in the week alongside other colleagues. Wearing the number 21 jersey, with his number seven having been taken by club legend Antoine Griezmann, Félix started against Getafe and was one of the better performers as he helped Atlético to a 2-0 lead at half-time, when he was withdrawn, before eventually ending 3-1. Félix got himself onto the scoresheet as he countered rapidly, receiving a pass from fellow goalscorer Ángel Correa and then putting a shot past goalkeeper David Soria with great composure. He also rocked the woodwork with another effort which hit the crossbar.

As soon as Félix emerged for the warm-up before the game kicked off, he was whistled and booed by some Atlético supporters, mainly from the away section of supporters. Chants were also sung in his direction, with hundreds singing “this Portuguese, what a son of a ***** he is”. At the end of the game, Félix held back while his teammates walked towards the visiting fans to applaud them. The forward stayed close to the touchline and the halfway line, before later leaving the stadium in a private car rather than the team bus. The forward’s future remains uncertain, but if he is to remain at Atlético Madrid, he has work to do to rebuild a very broken relationship with his own supporters. Aston Villa’s interest in João Félix Atlético Madrid has shown little sign of wanting to keep their club-record signing this summer, with his return seen as an inconvenience by many who were concerned about the relationship of the 24 year old in the locker room and with coach Diego Simeone. With less than a month until the transfer window slams shut, there has been scant interest in his services. Premier League club Aston Villa has been linked, while a possible return to Benfica in Portugal has also been suggested, but neither club has been able to reach an agreement with Atlético Madrid. At this stage, Atlético has accepted that they will not recoup the €126 million ($137.55 million) that they spent to sign him in 2019. A deal could see him depart for a fee closer to €60 million ($65.5 million), but has yet to be agreed with any party. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

However, the Olympic interpretation included drag queens, a transgender model, and a nude performer representing Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and revelry.Newsweek contacted the Holy See's Press Office via email on Saturday for further comment.The Vatican's response comes more than a week after the event, raising questions about the timing of the statement.While the Holy See did not provide a specific reason for the delay, some speculate it may be related to a recent phone call between Pope Francis and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on August 1. The Vatican confirmed the call took place but declined to comment on its contents.The statement emphasized the importance of respecting religious beliefs in global events like the Olympics.\"In a prestigious event where the whole world comes together around common values, there should not be allusions ridiculing the religious convictions of many people,\" the Vatican said. It also addressed the balance between freedom of expression and respect for others, stating, \"Freedom of expression, which is obviously not called into question, finds its limit in respect for others.\"The Vatican's intervention adds a new dimension to a debate that has already drawn sharp criticism from conservative Christian groups and political figures. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, described the performance as a \"mockery\" that was \"insulting to Christian people around the world.\" Senator Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican, called it \"disgraceful,\" while Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado labeled it \"disgusting.\"Former president Donald Trump added to the controversy during an interview with Laura Ingraham on FOX News this week by condemning the event, \"I thought that the opening ceremony was a disgrace, actually,\" said Trump. \"I thought it was a disgrace.\"However, the controversy has also sparked a broader discussion about artistic interpretation and cultural representation. Thomas Jolly, the show's artistic director, told the Associated Press that the intention was not to be subversive or offensive, but rather to \"send a message of love, a message of inclusion and not at all to divide.\"Some religious leaders have offered alternative interpretations of the scene. Atlanta Pastor Cassie Noland Rapko suggested on Facebook that the tableau represented the Feast of Dionysus, not the Last Supper, noting the Olympics' Greek origins and France's cultural emphasis on festivity and the performing arts.In response to the growing controversy, the Paris 2024 organizing committee issued an apology on July 28, stating there was never an intention to disrespect any religious group. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also released a statement welcoming this clarification and reiterating that any offense caused was unintentional.","summary":"Vatican expresses disappointment over Paris Olympics opening ceremony scene, joining critics who saw it as mocking Christianity.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/vatican-holy-see-respond-last-summer-opening-paris-olympic-games-1934237","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2440078/2024-paris-olympics.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 22:08:39","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":253321402,"title":"Here's why the remaining Trump cases may never go to trial","text":"Over the course of the past year, the relationships between law, politics and justice in our contemporary democratic republic have been torn open. We’ve all witnessed firsthand how each of the criminal indictments of former President Donald Trump have struggled to be adjudicated in their respective jurisdictions. In effect, these criminal cases have all demonstrated just how arbitrary and capricious the rule of law can be when subject to the decisions of unprincipled and unscrupulous jurists of the highest courts in the land. Or, more pointedly: When legal conflicts are resolved by corrupt political hacks trying to pass themselves off as neutral umpires calling balls and strikes as they interpret constitutional law, we’re in for some serious civic trouble. ALSO READ: We asked 10 Republican senators: ‘Is Kamala Harris Black?’ Things got weird fast. More than a year removed from the last of Trump’s four criminal indictments, only one of these has gone to trial. One might argue that in the interim, Trump’s criminal justice and substantive crimes have been hijacked from the American people by the Supreme Court, which this year granted Trump significant presidential immunity rights. You be the judge of whether the high court’s ruling came down for the primary purpose of making Trump’s alleged criminal wrongdoing disappear. In fact, it is now quite likely that Trump’s three pending criminal cases and straightforward violations of the criminal law will never go to trial. Say even one or more of these remaining cases eventually finds their way to trial. And say that Trump is found guilty of felonies. That may very well not be the final resolution of these matters as we have learned from Trump’s Manhattan hush money case. This is because an anti-democratic alliance of Boss Trump, the GOP and the MAGA majority of the Supreme Court has worked to ensure that justice for Trump is delayed indefinitely, no matter the evidence against him and no matter what a jury of his peers determines. Anyone who believes no president is above the law should recoil: The Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of presidential immunity — and against the Constitution in order to protect the insurrectionary and treasonous behavior of Trump — is to date the most radical expression of weaponizing the law this nation has seen in decades. Or beyond. Where do Trump’s cases stand? At this point in time, only the first of these criminal indictments has gone the distance and was decided by a jury of Trump’s peers — or so we thought. After a New York jury this past spring issued guilty verdicts on each of Trump’s 34 falsification of business records counts — each stemming from his interfering in the 2016 presidential election by paying hush money to a porn star with whom he allegedly had an affair — I more than suggested that “Justice delayed is not always justice denied.” Boy was I wrong. At the end of the 2023-24 Supreme Court term, the MAGA majority of justices had ruled to the surprise of virtually every knowledgeable person on Earth that Trump enjoyed presidential immunity from criminal prosecution whether he committed his offenses during, after or even before his presidency. ALSO READ:'That's a lie': The 10 quotes Trump said to Black journalists that led to outbursts Who knew? Certainly not the authors of the Declaration of Independence or the fathers of the U.S. Constitution – the only “originalists” if there ever were any. As a result of this “unconstitutional” decision, Trump’s scheduled sentencing for July 11 was delayed until September 18 — after the earliest of early voting ballots will have already been cast in the 2024 presidential election. In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, Trump’s “lawyers are urging the judge in the New York hush money case to overturn his conviction and dismiss the case.” In addition to other legal arguments, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has responded that the immunity ruling has “no bearing on this prosecution” because the lawsuit was about conduct and events that occurred before Trump became president. Even if Trump’s lawyers are correct about this new law after the crime, the case should still be immune from the decision. Just as a person cannot face criminal punishment except for an act that was criminalized by law before the act was performed – the principle known as “no crime without a law” — a person should not be exonerated or exempt from criminal punishment because of a “new law after the crime.” Judge Juan Merchan has told the parties that he will issue his decision by Sept. 6. I am confident that he will rule against Trump and that sentencing should be on schedule for Sept. 18. However, I am also confident that Trump’s legal team will appeal that decision. And, even if that appeal does not delay sentencing, Trump's attorneys will file additional appeals to overturn the sentence — prison time remains a possibility, even if it’s unlikely — as well as to toss the case out for a second time. Meanwhile, in the election interference case in the District of Columbia, Judge Tanya Chutkan will soon be reclaiming jurisdiction to assess whether the charges brought by the special counsel Jack Smith fall within or outside of the new guidelines of presidential immunity. Of course, if Chutkan rules in favor of the prosecution, Trump will appeal that decision as well. Based on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ separate opinion in the immunity ruling and her concerns about the legality of the special counsel’s appointment, Judge Aileen Cannon on July 15 dismissed the “slam dunk” classified documents case in Florida. Smith has appealed this ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and has not yet asked the 11th Circuit to expedite this case. Thus, in all likelihood, a hearing before Cannon will not occur before sometime in the middle of October. Some time afterwards she will undoubtedly rule in favor of Trump. Then, the special counsel will appeal her decision. ALSO READ:Texas sheriffs engage conspiracy theorist who created Trump enemies 'target list' And so it goes: “Procedural justice” at work delaying and stymying “substantive justice.” None of these appeals will ultimately be resolved for months if not years after the November election. The same can also be assumed should Trump file an appeal to toss out the Fulton County Georgia RICO case — this time for prosecutorial immunity rather than as he has previously done for the violation of his First Amendment rights. So we now find ourselves in a situation where long before justice delayed is no longer justice denied, the American voters will decide. As former U.S. prosecutor for the Southern District of Alabama and distinguished professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, Joyce Vance, has written: “Trump now faces prosecutors both in the courtroom and in the court of public opinion, where voters will decide whether to send a felon” — or, instead, a prosecutor in presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris — to the White House. In a nation that has seen the value of the rule of law diminished by the MAGA Supreme Court, the choice seems rather clear.
