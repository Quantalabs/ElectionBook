{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":4802,"news":[{"id":255890734,"title":"A.G. Sulzberger is unfit to run The New York Times as latest op-ed spreads misinformation","text":"‘Caution: Those with sensitive stomachs or respect for the truth should stop here.” That’s the warning label The Washington Post should have slapped on a recent essay. Unfortunately, it didn’t and let the writer gas on as if his fabulist claims were grounded in reality. The op-ed was doubly dispiriting because, although it appeared in The Washington Post, it was written by the publisher of The New York Times. Both outlets likely thought the joint imprimatur would increase the audience and impact. Instead, the resulting flop magnifies their effort to spread misinformation. Both outlets apparently still think Americans are foolish enough to trust Big Media to tell them the truth. Author A.G. Sulzberger’s effort to inflate what was little more than another vicious attack on Donald Trump into a rallying cry for press independence is noteworthy for all the wrong reasons. His farrago of leftist partisanship, self-aggrandizement and fearmongering comes disguised as an appeal for freedom of the press. The transparent motive gives readers yet another reason to search elsewhere for facts and fairness. Of course, nobody can argue with such truths as “The flow of trustworthy news and information is critical to a free, secure and prosperous nation.” Or the claim that “defense of the free press has been a point of rare bipartisan consensus throughout the nation’s history.” The author wraps his argument in red, white and blue by quoting President Ronald Reagan as saying, “There is no more essential ingredient than a free, strong, and independent press to our continued success in what the Founding Fathers called our ‘noble experiment’ in self-government.” Bias papered over Citing Reagan is an obvious tease to draw in conservatives and Republicans. It’s also a fig leaf to cover the Big Lie about the Times built-in bias. It hasn’t endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. Up and down the ballot, year in year out, no matter the office and the candidates, it would endorse a dead raccoon if it was running on the Democrat line. The more recent and greater sin is that the paper’s radical narratives are no longer limited to opinion pages. Nearly every article on every topic reflects a scolding, far-left view, whether it be on race, Israel, markets, the weather, books, films, theater or even sports. The hyperpartisanship has reached new depths in the Trump era, with the Times a chief player in fomenting the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. And don’t forget that Sulzberger fired his opinion editor for publishing an op-ed from GOP Sen. Tom Cotton urging Trump to use the military to quell the 2020 urban riots. The fifth male in his family to hold the title of publisher — no outsiders need apply — Sulzberger uses his essay to charge that Trump “and his allies have declared their intention to increase their attacks on a press he has long derided as ‘the enemy of the people.’ ” He even blames Trump for anti-press crackdowns in Brazil and India and adds that the former president’s use of the term “fake news” caused global harm, writing “around 70 countries on six continents have enacted ‘fake news’ laws.” The implication is that the president shouldn’t enjoy freedom of speech if it involves criticism of certain media. Yet the author still has the nerve to claim that “I have no interest in wading into politics” and insists he will not let the Times “cast aside neutrality” in its election coverage. Oh, please, does he even read his paper? Or maybe he, like so many other New Yorkers, has given up hoping for a semblance of even-handedness. Among the lines that deserve a warning label all their own are this one: “At The Times, we are committed to following the facts and presenting a full, fair and accurate picture of November’s election and the candidates and issues shaping it.” This from the publisher of a paper which each day promotes three or four loaded stories against Trump and sees only “joy” and “hope” in his Democratic opponent. So Kamala Harris is not only assured of the paper’s backing, she also won’t be pushed on her policy flip-flops. Crying shame And she shouldn’t waste time concocting elaborate evasions about how she wants to take the country in a different direction than the Biden-Harris administration. Whatever she says — or even if she keeps ducking interviews — will be good enough for the Times. The paper is so rife with Trump hate that a book critic declared the Constitution is one of the “biggest threats” to the country. That’s because . . . Trump won the Electoral College in 2016. Ultimately, Sulzberger’s screed is not the high-minded appeal to our better angels he thinks it is. Rather, it’s a reflection of how out little he understands America. The nation is politically divided, yet the Times embodies the arrogance of the urban, elite left as it looks with contempt on those who see the world differently. Its bias is so ingrained that it raises no objection to Dems using the courts to try to bankrupt, imprison and keep Trump off the ballot. If Republicans tried that, the sky would fall. After the 2016 election, the former publisher, Sulzberger’s father, wrote a note to readers apologizing for not better understanding Trump’s appeal. That blindness was explained in part by the fact that some members of the newsroom were preparing to celebrate Hillary Clinton’s victory. While it’s understandable that election night ended in tears for many Democrats, tears in the newsroom of the nation’s largest newspaper are out of bounds. Or should have been. But eight years later, the paper has moved even deeper into the partisan swamp. It supports Big Tech censorship of conservative voices, meaning it believes in freedom of speech only for speech it agrees with. And just as it tried to bury the facts about Joe Biden’s corruption with his family influence peddling scheme, it hid his mental decline. Last June 26, the paper carried water for the White House with a story headlined, “How Misleading Videos Are Trailing Biden as He Battles Age Doubts.” The very next day brought the debate debacle, where it became clear how unfit Biden actually was. In the aftermath, when polls showed Trump building a massive lead, the Times suddenly switched horses and called for the president to quit the race. When he did, and when Harris was anointed by party bosses in a backroom, Tammany Hall coup, the paper didn’t object to Dems ignoring the will of 14 million primary voters. Keeping Trump out of the White House was and is all that matters. Ultimately, the Times is, like every media outlet — and all Americans — free to say and write pretty much anything it wants. But it would have more credibility if it admitted it has a political agenda and gave up the pretense of fairness. Until then, good luck to Sulzberger in his quest for an Oscar for impersonating a publisher devoted to free, fair and honest speech.","summary":"‘Caution: Those with sensitive stomachs or respect for the truth should stop here.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/07/opinion/a-g-sulzberger-is-unfit-to-run-the-new-york-times-as-latest-op-ed-spreads-misinformation/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GNY.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 00:47:38","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":255890828,"title":"Harris visits spice shop known for hating and slamming Republicans, calls for end of 'divisiveness'","text":"Kamala Harris made a campaign stop on Saturday at a spice shop known to openly discriminate against Republicans while calling for an end to political \"divison.\"The spice shop, Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, welcomed the Democrat nominee to browse the store and meet some supporters.While facing a gaggle of reporters, Harris claimed, \"It's time to turn the page on the divisiveness.

Liz Cheney. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Dick Cheney said in a statement Friday. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement that Harris was “proud to have the support of Vice President Cheney, and deeply respects his courage to put country over party.” On Saturday, former President Donald Trump called Dick Cheney an “irrelevant RINO” – or Republican in Name Only. “He’s the King of Endless, Nonsensical Wars, wasting Lives and Trillions of Dollars, just like Comrade Kamala Harris,” he wrote on Truth Social. “I am the Peace President, and only I will stop World War III!” Dick Cheney, a longtime conservative Republican, was vice president under former President George W. Bush and was one of the most influential officials behind the invasion of Iraq and the CIA’s interrogation tactics after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Liz Cheney first revealed her father’s plans Friday at the Texas Tribune Festival, after saying two days ago that she is backing the Democratic nominee. “I don’t believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates’ names, particularly in swing states,” Liz Cheney said Wednesday at Duke University. “As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.” In a statement Wednesday, O’Malley Dillon said Harris was “proud to have earned Congresswoman Cheney’s vote.” Liz Cheney was one of only two Republicans to serve on the House Jan. 6 committee investigating the Capitol assault and Trump’s role in it. The former president has repeatedly blasted Cheney for it, suggesting she and the others on the committee should be jailed. He continued the same line of attacks on Saturday, saying Liz Cheney “and her Unselects deleted and destroyed all evidence and information – IT’S GONE.” “Much of it proved that Nancy Pelosi was responsible for J6 – DIDN’T PROVIDE SECURITY. Cheney and the others should be prosecuted for what they did, but Comrade Kamala is even worse!” he added. The Cheneys aren’t the only Republicans to back Harris. Several Republicans spoke at the Democratic National Convention urging their fellow Republicans to back Harris for the sake of democracy, including former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. contributed to this report.","summary":"Former Vice President Dick Cheney plans to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris, just like his daughter, former Republican Rep.

Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig and Sir Elton John are among the stars to head up the 255-strong collection of movies from around the world. Here are seven LFF films to look out for – with some hotly tipped for the coming awards season. Blitz London-born director Steve McQueen opens the festival for the third time, with the world premiere of his World War Two drama Blitz. The movie re-creates a war-torn London, bombarded by nightly air raids, as battle rages all around. Saoirse Ronan stars as Rita, an East End mother who makes the heartbreaking decision to send her young son George, played by newcomer Elliott Heffernan, to safety in the countryside. But, George has other ideas, and is determined to return home despite the many dangers ahead. The ensemble cast includes Kathy Burke, Benjamin Clementine, Harris Dickinson and Stephen Graham, with a score by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer. Maria Angelina Jolie makes a return to the big screen after several years away, starring in the biopic about famed opera singer Maria Callas, one of the greatest sopranos of all time. While the majority of the vocals we hear in the movie are from original recordings of Callas in her prime, the depictions of singing at the end of her life are mostly Jolie’s own voice. The Oscar-winning actress, who spent seven months training for the role, has called it the most demanding of her career. Directed by Pablo Larrain, it depicts Callas’s final days in Paris when she was addicted to anti-anxiety drugs, looking back to the peak of her career when she wowed audiences around the world. Larrain has said he hopes it will encourage people to listen to more opera. Queer Bond star Daniel Craig plays a drug-addicted American living in 1950s Mexico, in the historical drama Queer. Based on the 1985 semi-autobiographical novel by Beat Generation author William Burroughs, the film delves into the nightlife of Mexico City, in an immersive flood of colour, and doesn’t shy away from full-on sex scenes. With some reviewers praising it as Craig’s best performance to date, it also stars Jason Schwartzman, Lesley Manville and newcomer Drew Starkey. Nightbitch A comedy horror starring the ever-adaptable Amy Adams as a stay-at-home mother who slowly thinks she may be turning into a dog. Based on the 2021 novel by Rachel Yoder, it’s pitched as a modern feminist fable, examining a society in which women are told they can “have it all”. The movie is directed by Marielle Heller, who in 2020 was one of the female filmmakers many felt were snubbed by the Oscars and Golden Globes when she failed to get a nomination for her movie A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood. Heller will no doubt be hoping this film – as offbeat as it is – is a different story. The Apprentice One of the most polarizing political figures of the 21st century, this film unpacks the young Donald Trump, examining his life before politics, and his career in real estate in New York in the 1970s and 1980s. Directed by Iranian-Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi, it stars Sebastian Stan stars as Trump, with Succession actor Jeremy Strong (aka Kendall Roy) playing attorney Roy Cohn. Possibly the most controversial film of the year, it’s been beset with legal issues, not least of which include a cease-and-desist letter from Mr Trump’s legal team. With a US election due in November, this one will at least be topical when it finally makes it to cinemas. Twiggy This is the first fully approved documentary to tell British model Twiggy’s life story. Directed by actor-turned-director Sadie Frost it tells the story of the fashion icon – whose real name is Lesley Lawson – going back to her working-class childhood in northwest London, through to her international stardom as a celebrity model, and her career as an actor, singer, fashion designer, writer and TV presenter. Other noteworthy documentaries screening at LFF include Elton John: Never Too Late, about the singer’s final US live shows, and Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, which looks back at the late actor’s rise to fame as the superhero and his life following a horse-riding accident that left him paralysed from the neck down. Piece By Piece A movie about the life of musician Pharrell Williams will close the festival – but told entirely using Lego. Directed by Morgan Neville, and produced by Williams himself, it depicts the Happy singer’s early life in Virginia, through to his rise to fame as he tops the charts. Williams recorded five new songs for the soundtrack, and many think it’s a likely contender for best animated feature and best original song come awards season. LFF takes place from Wednesday 9 October to Sunday 20 October.","summary":"As film festival season gathers pace, the 68th BFI London Film Festival (LFF) has announced its full 2024 programme, featuring a whopping 39 world premieres.

Kirsty Gallacher has revealed she fell for her partner Darren Clayton after they bonded over being single parents (pictured with her two sons Oscar and Jude) The Smooth Radio host confessed that the pair met through their two mutual friends - Gabby and Kenny Logan, married sports broadcasters She told the publication: 'We're very happy, we both had similar stories — we are single parents and love playing golf. 'He looks after me and tells me to have time off as I can be a workaholic.' 'I'm usually running around like mad with the children at their sport, but my boyfriend encourages me to take a day off as I work on Saturdays doing my radio show', she added. The duo met in Edinburgh last year for a fundraising event in memory of rugby player Doddie Weir - who passed away in 2022 from Motor Neurone Disease. Kirsty revealed that her two sons 'love him' and the pair had been together for nearly a year, with Darren also a father to a daughter from a previous relationship. The pair have enjoyed many romantic getaways to Devon, where Darren's parents live. Kirsty's father was the captain of the European Ryder Cup team in the 1990s.

The couple met in 1999 shortly after Paul had won his first cap for England and Kirsty was made the new face of Sky Sports News. They married in 2010 in a £50,000 ceremony in Spain but their relationship started to wobble the following year after Paul's retirement from rugby due to injury. He went into a depression and did not know what to do with himself, a situation worsened by the fact he had failed to come to terms with his father's death in 2004. Kirsty then called an end to their four-year marriage in 2014. She then endured a number of high-profile relationships with Danny Cipriani, Laurence Fox and Jack Whitehall.

Trump vowed to vastly reshape the federal bureaucracy on Saturday in a wide-ranging, often unfocused speech at a rally in Wisconsin. He pledged to ultimately eliminate the Department of Education, redirect the efforts of the Justice Department and fire civil servants charged with carrying out Biden administration policies that he disagreed with. And he told his supporters that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading vaccine skeptic who recently endorsed him, would be “very much involved” in a panel on “chronic health problems and childhood diseases.” Mr. Kennedy rose to prominence as a vaccine skeptic who promoted a disproved link between vaccines and autism. At one point Mr. Trump got in a dig at Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he has frequently accused without evidence of covering up signs that Mr. Biden was not fit to be president, by saying that he would support modifying the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to make it an impeachable offense for a vice president to cover up the incapacity of the president. It was a long-shot proposal at best, which would entail a difficult process that he does not control.","summary":"In Wisconsin, former President Donald J.

Nikki Haley dodged when asked whether she thinks former President Donald Trump is a good candidate, instead acknowledging only that she thinks he is “the Republican nominee.” After Haley said of her 2024 candidacy in a CBS “Face the Nation” interview set to air Sunday, “I ran because I thought I could do a better job,” moderator Margaret Brennan responded, “You don’t think he’s a good candidate?” “I think he is the Republican nominee,” Haley said in a clip released ahead of the full interview. “And I think putting him against Kamala Harris, who is the Democrat nominee — for me, it’s not a question.” “Now, do I agree with his style? Do I agree with his approach? Do I agree with his communications? No,” she continued. Haley, who ran for the Republican nomination against Trump before dropping out and quickly endorsing him, said that while she does not agree with Trump’s style, approach or communications, she supports the former president because of policy agreements. The former ambassador to the United Nations is also willing to offer advice, she told CBS. Haley said that she is on “standby” to campaign for Trump — and that he’s aware of that willingness on her part. But she said she has not been asked to help with debate prep or campaigning. “And that’s his choice — whatever he decides to do with his campaign, he can do that,” Haley said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” last month that he’d like to see Haley and other GOP leaders hit the trail, saying, “Me and Nikki need to go to Georgia.” “We’re giving advice on TV to President Trump. He’s got a lot of critics,” Graham said. “He’s got a lot of advisers, but to Nikki Haley and [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis and [Virginia Gov. Glenn] Youngkin and all these great people we have, let’s get together and actually campaign for the guy.” Haley’s support — and willingness to stump for Trump — is a far cry from the dynamic the two shared during the primary, which saw Trump mocking Haley’s birth name and Haley calling him “diminished” and “unhinged.” Speaking at Clemson University after losing the South Carolina primary to Trump, Haley called him a “disaster” for the GOP, adding that she was not afraid to express her disapproval publicly and did not need to “kiss the ring.” “Well, I’m not afraid to say the hard truths out loud,” Haley said at the time, prior to her endorsement of Trump. “I feel no need to kiss the ring. And I have no fear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him.” Haley has gradually changed tune since then, speaking at the Republican National Convention in July and offering her “strong endorsement” of him. But that hasn’t stopped Haley from critiquing Trump’s campaign performance, saying to Fox News in August that it needed to “focus” and stay away from personal attacks on Harris. Discussing the options before voters this November, Haley appeared to adopt a resigned tone in her comments to Brennan. “These are the candidates we have been given,” Haley said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov.

Although Trump didn’t mention any journalists or media outlets by name, his remarks came two days after New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger had a scathing op-ed run in the Washington Post, warning “Trump stands out for his aggressive and sustained efforts to undermine the free press.” Sulzberger also insisted Americans should be ready for Trump’s anti-media “play book” if he wins in November. “When you’re a politician…, and you happen to be a Republican or somewhat conservative, they write just the opposite of what the facts are, and if you are driving a cab, if you’re an accountant, if you are a lawyer, if you are something other than that, you don’t know the details,” said Trump, who arrived at the airport in his Boeing 757 nicknamed “Trump Force One.” “When we know the facts, and the story gets written the exact opposite of what it is, you start to lose faith in the press.” Trump promised, if re-elected, to sign an executive order “banning any federal employee from colluding to limit speech” and to “fire any federal bureaucrat who engaged in domestic censorship under the Harris regime.” Trump’s appearance was his fourth to Wisconsin during the campaign, but marked his first trip to the deep red, largely rural part of the key battleground state. He also ripped Harris – who he’ll face Tuesday’s high-stakes presidential debate — for loose border policies that created a national migrant crisis, which has led to spiking crime rates and drained taxpayers’ pockets nationwide. Like Trump, Harris has been a frequent visitor to Wisconsin this year, a state where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by less than a percentage point. Polls of Wisconsin voters conducted since Biden withdrew his re-election bid in July show Harris and Trump in a stalemate. Democrats consider Wisconsin a must-win “blue wall” state. Biden, who was in Wisconsin Thursday, won the state in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes, while Trump carried it by nearly 23,000 votes in 2016.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump vowed Saturday to bring back free-speech in America “because it’s being taken away,” after he wowed 15,000 supporters by arriving to a Wisconsin rally in his private jet.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/07/us-news/trump-vows-to-bring-back-free-speech-calls-fake-news-a-threat-to-this-country/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89207062.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YGX4W9rR-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-07 23:37:01","author":"Amy Sikma,Rich Calder","authors":["Amy Sikma","Rich Calder"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":255889860,"title":"George W. Bush not endorsing in 2024 presidential election","text":"When asked by NBC News whether he or his wife, Laura Bush, would endorse a candidate or say how they would vote, Bush’s office flatly stated “no.” “President Bush retired from presidential politics years ago,” the office added. The comments from Bush’s office come one day after former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served under Bush in that capacity from 2001 to 2009, said in a statement that he will vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in November. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump. He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again. … That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,” he said. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Following that announcement, former President Donald Trump blasted Cheney as an “irrelevant RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” in a post on Truth Social. This is not the first time Bush has withheld an endorsement in a presidential race. In 2016, Bush did not vote for either Trump or Hillary Clinton, while in 2020, he wrote in former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for president. However, he endorsed John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.","summary":"Former President George W. Bush is not endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, according to his office.

The couple was still bringing the cringey moments of PDA, too. Guilfoyle was all in as she pulled Don Jr. in for a romantic on-stage kiss, but his mind was clearly on something else as he looked over her shoulder, eyes wide open. Their awkward interaction didn’t exactly scream love’s young dream. Still, Guilfoyle and Don Jr. gushed about their amazing romance in an interview with “Extra” in December 2020. They dodged questions about wedding plans but insisted they were in it for the long run. “Committed in our hearts forever for life, which is very sweet,” Guilfoyle said. “We’ve been a little focused,” Don Jr. explained. Meanwhile, they explained their often crazed and impassioned speeches. “We’re both very fired up, we’re high energy,” Guilfoyle shared. “I’m a proud American. I love this country, and I wanted to put it all out there.” Well, she certainly didn’t disappoint with her high-decibel, ranting, and raving speech at the Republican National Convention in August 2020. “By the way, this is who I had to be with in quarantine for four months,” Don Jr. interjected as Guilfoyle laughed maniacally. “We like the passion, and she brings the heat.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; Manny Carabel/Getty Images The couple that stumps together stays together.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Awkward Public Displays of Affection Between Kimberly Guilfoyle and Don Trump Jr. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/awkward-public-displays-of-affection-between-kimberly-guilfoyle-and-don-trump-jr/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Cringey-Moments-Of-PDA-Between-Kimberly-Guilfoyle.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 23:23:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.436},{"id":255889528,"title":"‘Ignore Him’","text":"Mark McKinnon, a former George W.

The next day, it was announced the New York Chinese consul general was no longer in his position, coinciding with a request from Gov. Kathy Hochul to the State Department to expel him. Analysts say the case serves as a warning to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its agents hiding within the U.S. government. In its indictment, the Department of Justice (DOJ), says Sun violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and is charged with 10 counts, including visa fraud, money laundering, and accepting benefits to engage in activities that benefit China and the CCP. Her businessman husband, Christopher Hu, 40, was also charged with multiple crimes, including money laundering. The charges against Sun also include “changing high-level New York State officers’ messaging regarding issues of importance to the PRC and the CCP; obtaining official New York State proclamations for PRC government representatives without proper authorization,” and “arranging meetings for visiting delegations from the PRC government with New York State government officials” among others. The DOJ said Sun received “substantial economic and other benefits” from the CCP for these activities. PRC is the acronym for China’s official name: the People’s Republic of China. Sun, 41, also known as Wen Sun, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Nanjing, China, and moved to the United States with her parents at the age of 5. Wang said that the United States started the crackdown on CCP agents in the United States through FARA under former President Donald Trump, and then, “President Biden systematized it, since then the Western world has formed a unified containment of the CCP’s overseas spying operations.” U.S.-based current affairs commentator Tang Jingyuan told The Epoch Times that Sun’s case is somewhat special because, in the past, most of the CCP spies arrested by the FBI were overseas Chinese community leaders or those posing as democracy activists. “They were mainly engaged in transnational repression or collecting intelligence on Chinese dissidents in the United States, mostly in the field of human rights,” he said. Sun’s case is different, Tang said, “mainly because she holds a high position in the U.S. government system, which affects many policies in New York State and even involves U.S. diplomatic relations.” Tony Hu, a former U.S. Department of Defense official, told The Epoch Times that any U.S. civil servant must understand that, whether in the federal, state, or local government, “as long as you are a civil servant, you cannot use the convenience of your job to help foreign government. This will definitely be punished by U.S. law.” “Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a regular scheduled rotation in August,” Miller said. Huang had served as the consul general in New York since November 2018. According to the CCP’s “Regulations on the Tenure, Seniority and Vacations of Permanent Personnel in Embassies and Consulates Abroad,” the general term of a consul general is three years, so Huang’s term should end in November this year. Taiwanese retired Maj. Gen. Yu Tsung-chi, an adviser to the Formosa Republican Association, said the United States chose to accept the expiration of Huang’s term instead of demanding expulsion “to avoid enraging China to take the same expulsion measures to retaliate.” “Then it would become a mutual revenge between democratic and totalitarian countries, which will blur the focus of the case. Therefore, the United States obviously wants to downplay such a serious intelligence infiltration incident in a low-key manner,” Tsung-chi told The Epoch Times Wang said that the CCP has deployed secret agents all over the United States. Wang said that based on his knowledge and his connections in the CCP’s top political and military circles, for the CCP’s overseas agents “the Chinese consulate’s role is less significant [in the CCP’s espionage activities], and Beijing is directly controlling the overseas agents through the United Front Work Department from behind the scenes. Therefore, despite that the FBI has put a lot of effort, sometimes it is difficult to find evidence.” The United Front Work Department is the Chinese regime’s spy and propaganda agency that also controls the regime’s transnational repression campaigns against overseas dissidents. “The center of the CCP’s spy network is in Beijing. They mostly have exclusive contacts and will not let others know. The Chinese consulate itself also knows that they are actually under [the U.S. government’s] surveillance,” Wang said. “The Chinese consulate also does deals with some American entrepreneurs, but the Chinese consulate is too conspicuous. The consulate will attend some activities of overseas Chinese groups, but they are not the ones who make the real arrangements.”","summary":"Civil servants 'are supposed to help their country, state, and city—not foreign countries,' says a former Department of Defense official.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/china/spy-case-in-new-york-should-serve-as-warning-to-ccp-agents-in-us-government-experts-5719930","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/04/id5717828-Linda-Sun-AP24247751452472-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 23:19:42","author":"Alex Wu","authors":["Alex Wu"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.166},{"id":255889548,"title":"Former Vice President Dick Cheney says he will vote for Kamala Harris","text":"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a lifelong Republican, will vote for Kamala Harris for president, he announced Friday. Liz Cheney, who herself endorsed Harris on Wednesday, first announced her father’s endorsement when asked by Mark Leibovich of The Atlantic magazine during an onstage interview at The Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. “Wow,” Leibovich replied as the audience cheered. Like his daughter, Dick Cheney has been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, notably during Liz Cheney’s ill-fated reelection campaign in 2022. Dick Cheney put out a statement Friday confirming his endorsement, which read almost entirely as opposition to Trump rather than support of Harris. “He can never be trusted with power again,” the statement said. “As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.” Trump responded on his Truth Social platform by calling the former vice president “an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter.” The acronym stands for “Republican in name only.” Asked for comment, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said, “Who is Liz Cheney?” The campaign confirmed Cheung was being sarcastic by also pointing to a comment Liz Cheney posted online four years ago in which she called Harris a “radical liberal.” Jen O’Malley Dillon, Harris’ campaign chair, released a statement saying, “The Vice President is proud to have the support of Vice President Cheney, and deeply respects his courage to put country over party.” Dick Cheney, 83, has made few if any public appearances over the past year or more. He has dealt with heart issues since his 40s and underwent a heart transplant in 2012. Dick Cheney’s statement Friday was similar to a 2022 campaign ad for Liz Cheney as she sought a fourth term as Wyoming’s lone congressperson. In it, he called Trump a “coward” for trying to “steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.” The ad did little good for his daughter in a deep-red state that once held the Cheney family dear but is now thoroughly in Trump’s corner. By a more than 2-to-1 margin, Liz Cheney lost her Republican primary to Trump-endorsed attorney Harriet Hageman. Dick Cheney has been friends with Democrats over the years but never supported one for president. Both Cheneys backed Trump in 2016, but after Liz Cheney criticized Trump foreign policy decisions and Trump criticized the “endless wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq launched when Dick Cheney was vice president, their support waned. If either Cheney supported Trump in 2020, they were mum about it. Meanwhile, their home state of Wyoming that year delivered Trump his widest margin of victory. By 2021, Liz Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump and her investigation into him for the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot made them irredeemable to Trump — and soon most of the GOP. There were exceptions. One was Cheney ally Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a Republican Trump critic who earlier this year endorsed Biden and spoke in support of Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August. Several other top Republicans have come out in support of Harris while some, including Sen. Mitt Romney and former Vice President Mike Pence, say they won’t be voting for Trump. Of them only Romney, who is not seeking reelection, is still in office. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Around 2,000 anti-racism activists gathered in George Square to counter-protest against a ‘Pro-UK rally’ backed by Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. A few hundred far-right activists gathered but were vastly outnumbered, with a huge police presence keeping the groups separate. One activist felt the far-right presence was ‘surprisingly weak’, insisting ‘we need to be more organised’ on social media. The group included one man who waved a flag reading ‘asylum frauds go home’ and another man wearing a Donald Trump 2016 baseball bat. A little girl in a buggy waving two Union flags was wheeled past, with her mother telling crowds: ‘Don’t take pictures of the wean.’ Running battles were briefly sparked when police kettled a group of teenage Celtic ultras dressed in black tracksuits and fishing hats, and ushered them away from the rally. Far-right activists rushed to confront them, singing ‘Rule Britannia’ and spooking police horses. A skirmish occurred on the fringes of the protest, with people chanting ‘racist scum’. The counter-protest, organised by Stand Up to Racism Scotland, included book stalls and a massive set of speakers playing Bikini Kill and Blondie. Home-made placards read ‘we are all human, no room for hate’, ‘no room for racism’ and ‘diversity is desirable’. Suzie Boyd, 68, a retired nurse from Glasgow’s West End, teaches English to refugees and asylum seekers, including from Sudan, Eritrea, Syria, Palestine and Somalia. She said some of her students were too scared to leave the house and felt trapped inside despite the sunshine. Ms Boyd said: ‘Some of my pupils are too frightened to come out of the house today, not just to go into town – they feel they will be targeted. ‘We should be able to come into our own city. Refugees are grateful to us for helping them and taking them in. ‘I write letters for them and help them get warm shoes. They sometimes come over here wearing sandals.’ A chant of ‘cheerio’ told far-right protesters to ‘go home’ and several Palestinian flags were waved. Chants included ‘show me what community looks like’ and ‘fascists go home’. One banner read ‘Jews against Islamophobia’ and a speaker offered solidarity to both Palestinians and Jews. Stop the War Coalition organiser Angela McCormick said: ‘We are here today so the far-right don’t divide us. ‘There’s nowhere else we could be today. It’s about unity and diversity, against racism and fascism. We need to celebrate diversity. ‘Rishi Sunak and the Tories ran an election campaign on ‘stop the boats’. ‘Hopefully the grassroots movement shows the Labour government not to concede to these racist agendas. ‘They need to see the majority of people are against war and against racism – war creates refugees.’ Two men were arrested, including one on suspicion of a hate crime. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ‘A proportionate policing plan was in place for a planned protest in George Square, Glasgow. ‘A 40-year-old man was arrested for a hate crime and a 20-year-old man was arrested for carrying an offensive weapon. Inquiries remain ongoing. ‘Officers contained a small group of people to engage with them, maintain public safety and minimise disruption. ‘Containment is an approved tactic used by highly trained officers where a breach of the peace is taking place or is reasonably thought to be imminent.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThousands of people turned out in Glasgow to oppose a rally backed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Massive turnout at Glasgow&#8217;s counter-protest against Tommy Robinson&#8217;s pro-UK rally first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/massive-turnout-at-glasgows-counter-protest-against-tommy-robinsons-pro-uk-rally/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/07/20/89396323-0-image-a-19_1725735731979.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 23:14:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":255889336,"title":"Blind Strictly star Chris McCausland explains what his dance training entails and reveals why he doesn't want to 'inspire' the visually impaired","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Sep 7th 2024 1AM 16°C 4AM 15°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Nicole Kidman reveals her 'heart is broken' as her beloved mother Janelle died just hours before she was awarded Best Actress for her role in Babygirl at the Venice Film Festival: Australian star has emotional tribute read to stunned audience First British couple sign up to die in double suicide pod: Former RAF engineer, 86, and his nurse wife, 80, to pass away in each other's arms in Switzerland after her dementia diagnosis Is Kate's return to public life on the horizon?

Email tips@dailymail.com By Rebecca Lawrence For Mailonline Published:00:04 BST, 8 September 2024 |Updated:00:10 BST, 8 September 2024 e-mail View comments Blind Strictly star Chris McCausland has revealed how he's learning to dance despite not being able to see. The comedian, 47, started losing his sight 20 years ago, between the ages of 16 and 21, due to retinitis pigmentosa which, according to the NHS, sees sufferers lose their sight as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. His signing is a first for the dance competition which previously featured deaf EastEnders actress Rose Ayling-Ellis who won the glitterball trophy alongside Giovanni Pearce in 2021. Speaking to MailOnline about how he was going to dance without being able to see, he confessed: 'I have no idea! They asked what they could do because I’ve never seen the show for obvious reasons. I can’t even go back and watch it to see what it involves, how intricate the dances are. 'All we can do is figure it out as we’re going along because I need to be in it and doing it to see what works and what doesn’t.' Blind Strictly star Chris McCausland has revealed how he's learning to dance despite not being able to see The comedian, 47, started losing his sight 20 years ago, between the ages of 16 and 21, due to retinitis pigmentosa which, according to the NHS , sees sufferers lose their sight as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate Chris continued: 'Everyone’s been really flexible, really supportive, and me and my partner are just figuring out ways for them to teach me and for me to learn. 'It’s a learning curve and hopefully the mistakes we make along the way will allow us to have a bit of a laugh, make some funny VTs and show the mistakes, because there will be a lot of mistakes along the way, I imagine.' Despite being the first blind star to appear on the show, he insisted he's not setting out to 'inspire' anyone. He explained: 'For me it’s not inspiring. I don’t think blind people need inspiring as much as they need representing. 'So it’s more for everybody else watching it who maybe isn’t exposed to somebody who’s blind in their life, who has got these really antiquated ideas. 'I’ve got in a taxi before and someone’s gone \"oh wow, you did the stairs on your own\". People think you can’t do anything if you’re blind. 'So it’s more just showing that more is capable than people imagine. The only problem with that is if I’m s**t, it doesn’t help anybody!' Chris went on to add: 'There will be things that I probably can’t do or I get wrong along the way and you need to roll with it and be able to laugh at the failures. 'Hopefully I won’t be the only one making mistakes but this is the problem, when we’re doing the group dance, I can’t see the mistakes everyone else is making!' His signing is a first for the dance competition which previously featured deaf EastEnders actress Rose Ayling-Ellis who won the glitterball trophy alongside Giovanni Pearce in 2021 WHAT IS RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA? Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare, genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina - the light sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing at night and a loss of side (peripheral) vision. RP is an inherited disorder that results from harmful changes in any one of more than 50 genes. These genes carry the instructions for making proteins that are needed in cells within the retina, called photoreceptors. Symptoms include trouble seeing at night and decreased peripheral vision. Source: National Eye Institute Advertisement Speaking about his visual impairment previously while taking part in Channel 4 series Scared of the Dark, Chris explained: 'I'm blind but I don't see black. 'I still see light and space, I still have an awareness of the space around me, not in terms of objects and things, but in terms of the room and whether there might be something in front of me. 'It just gives you that awareness that you're taking that away from me. I'm a slave to my iPhone like everybody else. So on paper you go, 'Well, I should nail this,' but in one area I should be more practically adjusted. 'It'll be quite interesting to see how quickly everybody else gets to that point. I'm quite looking forward to being the most able bodied person for a while. It doesn't happen often.' In recent months, the dancing competition has been hit by a wave of scandals, with Giovanni Pernice being probed after his celebrity partner Amanda Abbington accused him of abusive behaviour, while Graziano Di Prima was sacked over reports he verbally and physically abused Zara McDermott during rehearsals.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Rebecca Lawrence For Mailonline Published:00:03 BST, 8 September 2024 |Updated:00:07 BST, 8 September 2024 e-mail View comments Strictly's Sam Quek has weighed in on the show's bullying scandal, insisting there are 'two sides to the truth'. The Olympian, 35, is one of the 14 new contestants taking part this year after the BBC show was shrouded in controversy. Notably, Giovanni Pernice is being probed after his celebrity partner Amanda Abbington accused him of abusive behaviour, while Graziano Di Prima was sacked over reports he verbally and physically abused Zara McDermott during rehearsals. Asked whether it made her wary of signing up for the programme, Sam told MailOnline: 'It’s 20 years of Strictly. It didn’t cross my mind at all. 'I think, no disrespect, everyone has a different experience and I don’t know what their experience was - there’s two sides to the truth.' Strictly 's Sam Quek has weighed in on the show's bullying scandal, insisting there are 'two sides to the truth' Actress Sarah Hadland was in agreeance, saying: 'I think you can’t really comment on something that you weren’t there for. And I mean, this is our experience She continued: 'For me, I’m here for every reason I just said. It shouldn’t take the shine off Strictly. It’s a fantastic programme. Everyone loves it for the energy, Saturday night, it brings people together. It’s just a positive show. 'Sometimes in life there is always a negative experience, and yes let’s deal with that, but that doesn’t take away the positives.' Actress Sarah Hadland was in agreeance, saying: 'I think you can’t really comment on something that you weren’t there for. And I mean, this is our experience. 'It’s essentially a new job, and a whole new set of people. So it’s impossible to comment on that.' She went on to share the support the cast had received as she was asked about the involvement with chaperones. New measures have been drafted into Strictly's duty of care protocols, including a member of the production team being present during training room rehearsals at all times, and increased support for both celebrity contestants and the professional dancers. A Celebrity Welfare Producer and a Professional Dancer Welfare Producer will both be appointed to fulfil these added duties, and further training will also be delivered for the production team and crew. Asked if she noticed the chaperone, Sarah explained: 'We haven’t started that yet. 'But we’ve been introduced to so many people that are there for support. And it feels like a lot of things have been put into place. So I certainly feel like we’re doing it in a environment in terms of being well looked after.' Singer Shayne Ward also weighed in on the scandal, saying: 'For me I was away performing so I don’t really know what has gone on. 'For me personally I've experienced nothing more than honestly, a group of lovely warm people, great company. I judge it as I meet it and everyone is so lovely. 'There's a massive duty of care there.' Singer Shayne Ward also weighed in on the scandal, saying: 'For me I was away performing so I don’t really know what has gone on' The investigation into Amanda's claims she was bullied by her former Strictly partner Giovanni has cost the BBC more than £250,000 so far, The Mail on Sunday previously revealed. Corporation bosses are said to be increasingly frustrated over the amount of money spent on the probe, which includes hiring two former Metropolitan Police officers to interview celebrities, dancers and staff from past and present shows as they look into Amanda's allegations – which Giovanni strenuously denies. Sources at the BBC also cite large sums spent on external lawyers and human resources experts on top of the investigations conducted by their own staff. As well as the six-figure sum, the Corporation also faces a potential payout for compensation. Amanda, 52, has hinted that she would be seeking such a payout while Giovanni, 33, is also said to be considering suing the BBC for an alleged lack of duty of care. An insider said: 'An enormous amount of money and time has been spent on this, making sure that the right calls are taken at all times. 'But that has meant getting outsiders in to look at evidence and there is a huge cost on that. 'It has gone on for months now, and there are various lawyers involved, it is a financial headache and the costs are going to keep going up until the inquiry is finished. Even then it is likely there will be payouts. It's a nightmare.' While the flagship Saturday night show is made by BBC Studios – the broadcaster's commercial arm – the investigation has crossed over to the main Corporation, which is funded by the licence fee. In recent months, the dancing competition has been hit by a wave of scandals , with Giovanni Pernice being probed after his partner Amanda Abbington accused him of abusive behaviour Graziano Di Prima was sacked over reports he verbally and physically abused Zara McDermott during rehearsals The scandal unfolded in January when it was revealed that Amanda had asked BBC bosses for rehearsal footage after claiming she suffered PTSD as a result of appearing on Strictly. She later claimed Giovanni had bruised her foot during training. In April, the BBC launched an investigation. Last month, the actress showed Corporation bosses a video of a sexual nature which she said Mr Pernice had sent her via WhatsApp. This year's Strictly is said to have one of the lowest salary bills since it launched in 2004. BBC insiders have suggested that producers want to recoup some of the money they have had to spend on the inquiry. The Strictly Come Dancing 2024 launch show will air on Saturday 14th September at 19:20 on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.

I always believed there would be some sort of miracle.' Breaking down, Nancy apologised, with host Richard Madeley then ending the interview. Speaking about their contact while Sven battled his illness, Nancy said he would always sound 'relaxed' and 'laughing', and he would try and reassure her concerns. She said: 'It was hard, but he sounded so relaxed and we were laughing and he would just say 'I feel okay'. 'It was quite difficult to even be talking but I tried to be fearless and see how he was. I wanted to get together for another dinner.' Nancy also admitted she still loved Sven and that he was 'a kind person' saying: 'I find it difficult being here talking about Sven knowing that he is not here with us anymore.

I didn't want to regret the decision I made (to leave her husband). 'He admitted himself that he was very stupid and he told me immediately the flings meant nothing to him.' It comes after she hastily amended her tribute to her ex earlier this week after accidentally referring him to her 'husband' in a heartfelt post after his death. The pair previously had a ten year relationship and were thought to have never married, but Nancy referred to him as her husband as she reflected on their years together in the heartfelt post. Nancy took to her Instagram to share a slew of previously unseen photos of the pair of them together and in the caption she called Sven her 'ex-husband' and reflected on the ups and downs of the relationship, but insisted that 'love never truly fades'. However, she's since backtracked on her words and changed the post to refer to Sven as her 'ex-partner' instead. The glamorous Italian - who left her husband Giancarlo Massa for the coach - was a constant by his side and pictured with him at several tournaments. One loved-up snap saw her sitting in Sven's lap laughing, as he wrapped his arms around her waist, while another saw the pair gazing adoringly into each other's eyes. It comes after she hastily amended her tribute to her ex earlier this week after accidentally referring him to her 'husband' in a heartfelt post after his death Nancy also told how she was able to move past Sven's infidelities with Ulrika Jonsson and Faria Alam after he branded them 'stupid mistakes' Nancy initially wrote: 'It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of my ex-husband, Sven. Though our relationship had its ups and downs, I choose to remember the good times we shared and the moments that brought joy to our lives. 'I will always hold onto those cherished memories and extend my deepest condolences to his family, as well as his beloved children, Lina and Johan. 'When you love someone, that love never truly fades. Rest in peace, Sven. You will be missed.' She later changed the first line to: 'It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of my ex-partner Sven.' Despite the media storm around his infidelities, Nancy chose to stay with Sven and when he led England to the World Cup in Germany in 2006, flamboyant Nancy, dressed in designer outfits, organised parties for the WAGS in their base at Baden Baden. Speaking on a Amazon Prime documentary about his life, Sven spoke candidly about his affairs, but insisted that 'sex is one of the good things in life for all of us', he wasn't married and didn't break any hearts However, the couple eventually went their separate ways in August 2007 after a decade together. Read More BREAKING NEWS David Beckham shares heartbreaking tribute to Sven-Goran Eriksson and reveals his final words to him Writing about their relationship in her book My Beautiful Game, Nancy gushed: 'I'm proud to have talked about the beautiful love story that linked me to Sven, it's one of the two great love stories of my life.' Speaking on a Amazon Prime documentary about his life, Sven spoke candidly about his affairs, but insisted that 'sex is one of the good things in life for all of us', he wasn't married and didn't break any hearts. Talking about when his fling with Ulrika emerged, he said: 'Sex is one of the good things in life for all of us. She was not married. I was not married. 'Probably I was stupid but I think I didn't do anything criminal. I didn't really disturb anyone.' He explained how Nancy had wanted to leave him, but changed her mind, saying: 'She loved it. The tension. She was a lady from the upper classes in Rome. She liked to go out with important people. 'In the beginning I didn't react very much. But you don't change people at a certain age. It was not peace in my house always.' Nancy also appeared on the documentary, and admitted she loved Sven, saying: 'The first impression that I had about Sven, people in power always have extra, extra sex appeal. I felt in love. 'It wasn't something that I was looking for. I was married and I left my husband to start my journey with Sven. 'We were Sven and Nancy since the first date. I was the first lady of English football and there was never going to be another one after me.' Faria Alam had an affair with Sven and FA chief executive Mark Palios. She was forced to resign but gave a series of kiss and tell interviews. Speaking to the documentary she said: 'The Noughties were just that, they were naughty. 'You could do so many things. I'll be honest, I was a beautiful girl and I attracted a lot of attention. 'He said, 'Tell your story, go and tell them everything. Make some money, why not?'.' Reports at the time suggested she may have made £300,000 from deals with newspapers. Describing their relationship she said: 'He didn't have the mindset of a super-rich man. He talked to me about poetry, he talked to me about art. 'He was saying how he did yoga and things like that. 'And I just fell in love with him, I guess. And that lit the fuse for all this to explode'. But she was angry at being painted as a 'gold digger' when the story broke, adding: 'I'm the person that's the bad person, and I was the scapegoat for them to be relieved of any responsibility'. Sven revealed in January that he had 'best case a year' to live following his pancreatic cancer diagnosis. After his announcement, Nancy called the news 'devastating', saying she 'knew he was ill' but had no idea of the extent of his condition. The Italian also shared her devastation at Sven's diagnosis when she made an appearance on Loose Women at the start of the year and admitted she had no idea that Sven had 'at best a year to live' Sven became the first foreign manager of the England national team in 2001, taking charge of 67 matches until 2006. He led the talented squad to quarter-finals of the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, and at the 2004 European Championships. Eriksson managed a 'golden generation' of players with England, including David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. He also managed Swedish, Portuguese and Italian clubs, winning major trophies in the 1980s and 1990s before taking on the England job.

Even when, even when it was one of those weapons that shot Donald Trump just six weeks or so back. Even then, no outcry from Republicans about changing it.” And then repeated the untrue claim that 2024 Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) dismissed school shootings as “just a fact of life, a sad fact of life that these school shootings keep happening.” Lemire said, “There is no widespread movement here to ban these weapons of war, these AR-15 -style rifles. Even when, even when it was one of those weapons that shot Donald Trump just six weeks or so back. Even then, no outcry from Republicans about changing it. In fact, we hear from JD Vance yesterday, saying that it’s just a fact of life, a sad fact of life that these school shootings keep happening.” Later, in the segment, co-host Mika Brzezinski played video of Vance, which showed that the “fact of life” Vance was referring to is the fact that psychotic individuals know schools are soft targets and Vance advocated for better security at schools as “What is going to solve this problem” when Vance stated, “What is going to solve this problem, and I really do believe this, is, look, I don’t like this, I don’t like to admit this, I don’t like that this is a fact of life, but if you’re a psycho, and you want to make headlines, you realize that our schools are soft targets, and we have got to bolster security at our schools, so that a person who walks through the front door — we’ve got to bolster security so that if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children, they’re not able to.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett","summary":"On Friday&#8217;s broadcast of MSNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Morning Joe,&#8221; MSNBC host and POLITICO White House Bureau Chief Jonathan Lemire denounced Republicans for not banning &#8220;AR-15 -style rifles.

Gretchen Wilson appeared alongside Trump during his rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin. Before she performed, she spoke about her humble upbringing in Illinois and her family, which supported Democrats. “Back in the day my family were all Kennedy Democrats. But that’s when the Democrats were on the side of the people,” she said. “Once I started paying attention to what was really going on, I realized the Democratic Party left us.” She then urged Americans to vote for Trump-Vance in November in order to safeguard freedom. As Breitbart News reported, the Democratic party under Kamala Harris is quickly becoming the party of corporate power. Nearly 90 corporate CEOs and other leaders signed a letter Friday endorsing Kamala for president. Their endorsements exemplify a profound shift in the Democratic party, which once championed working class Americans and the downtrodden, but now embodies unbridled corporate interests. Wisconsin is once again a crucial swing state in the presidential election, with polls showing Trump and Kamala Harris in a virtual tie. Gretchen Wilson is perhaps best-known for her Grammy-winning single “Redneck Woman,” which was released in 2004.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump received an impassioned endorsement from Grammy Award-winning country music star Gretchen Wilson during a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday, with the singer excoriating the Democratic party for abandoning the American people.\n\n\nThe post Country Music Star Gretchen Wilson Endorses Trump: &#8216;My Family Were All Kennedy Democrats.

Nikki Haley dodged when asked whether she thinks former President Donald Trump is a good candidate, instead acknowledging only that she thinks he is \"the Republican nominee.” After Haley said of her 2024 candidacy in a CBS \"Face the Nation\" interview set to air Sunday, “I ran because I thought I could do a better job,” moderator Margaret Brennan responded, “You don’t think he’s a good candidate?” “I think he is the Republican nominee,” Haley said in a clip released ahead of the full interview. “And I think putting him against Kamala Harris, who is the Democrat nominee — for me, it’s not a question.\" \"Now, do I agree with his style? Do I agree with his approach? Do I agree with his communications? No,” she continued. Haley, who ran for the Republican nomination against Trump before dropping out and quickly endorsing him, said that while she does not agree with Trump’s style, approach or communications, she supports the former president because of policy agreements. The former ambassador to the United Nations is also willing to offer advice, she told CBS. Haley said that she is on “standby” to campaign for Trump — and that he's aware of that willingness on her part. But she said she has not been asked to help with debate prep or campaigning. “And that’s his choice — whatever he decides to do with his campaign, he can do that,” Haley said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" last month that he'd like to see Haley and other GOP leaders hit the trail, saying, “Me and Nikki need to go to Georgia.” “We’re giving advice on TV to President Trump. He’s got a lot of critics,” Graham said. “He’s got a lot of advisers, but to Nikki Haley and [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis and [Virginia Gov. Glenn] Youngkin and all these great people we have, let’s get together and actually campaign for the guy.” Haley's support — and willingness to stump for Trump — is a far cry from the dynamic the two shared during the primary, which saw Trump mocking Haley’s birth name and Haley calling him \"diminished\" and \"unhinged.\" Speaking at Clemson University after losing the South Carolina primary to Trump, Haley called him a “disaster” for the GOP, adding that she was not afraid to express her disapproval publicly and did not need to “kiss the ring.” “Well, I’m not afraid to say the hard truths out loud,” Haley said at the time, prior to her endorsement of Trump. “I feel no need to kiss the ring. And I have no fear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him.” Haley has gradually changed tune since then, speaking at the Republican National Convention in July and offering her “strong endorsement” of him. But that hasn't stopped Haley from critiquing Trump's campaign performance, saying to Fox News in August that it needed to \"focus\" and stay away from personal attacks on Harris. Discussing the options before voters this November, Haley appeared to adopt a resigned tone in her comments to Brennan. “These are the candidates we have been given,” Haley said.","summary":"Former South Carolina Gov.

Sherlock actress Amanda, 50, has made a series of accusations about her pro Giovanni Pernice's teaching methods and has described his behaviour as 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. He strongly denies all of the claims. The report has been completed and is ready to be published within days. A friend of Amanda told The Sun: 'She's deeply disappointed with the BBC. She thinks it feels like such a boys' club. 'As well as the probe taking so long, it feels like they are protecting Giovanni to save themselves and ignoring not only her experience but that of other women who've bravely come forward. Amanda Abbington is 'deeply disappointed' with BBC bosses over fears their 'protecting' Giovanni Pernice amid bullying probe Sherlock actress Amanda, 50, has made a series of accusations about her pro Giovanni Pernice's teaching methods and has described his behaviour as 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. He strongly denies all of the claims 'Amanda feels tired, upset and very angry with the way it's all been handled. 'She is worried there will be a predictable whitewash and others will, once again, suffer from aggression and abuse.' MailOnline has contacted Amanda and the BBC for comment. It comes after it was revealed Amanda has found BBC bosses line of questioning 'highly offensive' amid the show's ongoing misconduct probe. Read More Amanda Abbington 'is questioned for a second time' by the BBC over her claims Giovanni Pernice made crude remarks amid Strictly misconduct probe The actress has been quizzed for a second time about an illicit video shared with her by the dancer as well as a 'lewd remark' he made about another celebrity contestant when the video was sent. Giovanni is also reported to have made a crude comment about a member of Amanda's own family, only for her to 'effectively be asked' by BBC bosses whether the dancer meant the remark as light-hearted banter. A source told The Sun: '[Amanda] found this line of questioning highly offensive.' In regards to the alleged video they told the publication: 'The BBC can't ignore the fact the video was sent. There seems to be a trail of evidence'. 'Even if it is established the footage was shared with innocent intentions, the BBC are concerned this could constitute a breach of conduct according to the contract handed to the pro dancers.' A BBC spokesman said: 'As we have said before, we will not be commenting on individuals or engaging in speculation'. Amanda shares daughter Grace and son Joe with ex partner Martin Freeman, 52, who she was for 16 years from 2000–2016. The actress has been quizzed for a second time about an illicit video shared with her by the dancer as well as a 'lewd remark' he made about another celeb (Amanda pictured in rehearsals) In one interview, Amanda compared the dance show to 'the trenches' telling Channel 4 News that BBC producers had been left 'horrified' by clips that also allegedly exhibited 'humiliating behaviour of a sexual nature' An investigation was launched after several celebrities including Amanda Abbington and Zara McDermott (pictured) sparked abuse and bullying scandals on the family show It comes after Martin reached out to her to support after the scandal and been someone to lean on amid the turbulent time, as well as her fiancé Jonathan Goodwin, reports The Sun. It is expected that the probe into Giovanni will soon be completed by the BBC after several weeks of investigations. It comes after it was reported that Amanda recently handed over more texts with fresh revelations over Giovanni 's behaviour on Strictly. It has been claimed the dramatic intervention has thrown the BBC investigation into professional Giovanni's behaviour into chaos and has 'changed the course of the probe'. The Sun reports that Amanda has come forward with new bombshell messages just as the probe was about to conclude which reportedly show that Giovanni did 'step over the line of what is acceptable'. Amanda was reportedly questioned by BBC bosses for a second time about 'crude comments' she claimed were made by Giovanni. She is said to have been quizzed via video call last week as she sat down with two ex-Met detectives to discuss her allegations about the professional dancer, 33. They reportedly discussed claims of sexual comments during rehearsals, as well as 'new evidence'. Giovanni has denied all allegations made against him. MailOnline contacted representatives for Amanda, Giovanni, and The BBC for comment. Amanda has made a series of accusations about Giovanni's teaching methods and has described his behaviour as 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. He strongly denies all of the claims. In one interview, Amanda compared the dance show to 'the trenches' telling Channel 4 News that BBC producers had been left 'horrified' by clips that also allegedly exhibited 'humiliating behaviour of a sexual nature'. In another, where she spoke to Christine Lampard on Lorraine , she said: 'It was inappropriate, it was mean, it was nasty, it was bullying and I put up with it for five, six weeks. Amanda shares her children with ex partner Martin Freeman (pictured 2015) and he has reportedly reached out to support the actress amid the scandal 'It started very early on and when it started to happen I would shut down because I recognised those red flags. 'And so I would shut down and it would be difficult to get in, and that would be a self-fulfilling prophecy.' Talking about her schedule on the show, she said: 'I was going into the rehearsal room every day. I've been in rehearsal rooms for 32 years. 'I know what rehearsal rooms are supposed to be like. 'I don't care what background you're from – whether it's dancing, acting, singing – you have a duty of care to bring into that rehearsal room compassion, understanding, sensitivity and kindness. 'And that wasn't extended to me (at Strictly). And so I just said I don't think this is right.'

Asked at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas whether she was “done” when a new administration takes over in January, or might continue in her job or take on a new administration role, Yellen said: “Probably done, but … we’ll see.” The comments are the closest that Yellen, 78, has come to announcing her future plans as the presidential race between US Vice-President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump heats up. Yellen has been the first woman to serve as Treasury Secretary, Federal Reserve Chair and director of the White House National Economic Council. Yellen told the event in Austin that she still has a lot of work to do at Treasury in coming months, including another likely meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, her Beijing counterpart, to try to manage an often tense relationship. The two met in April in Beijing, where Yellen warned China to rein in excess industrial capacity ahead of Biden’s decision to impose steep tariff increases on Chinese-made electric vehicles, batteries, solar products and semiconductors. Yellen said she would welcome a visit to the US but also may return to China herself, adding: “My guess is that we will have, one way or another, a visit.” The Treasury’s top economic diplomat, Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh, will lead a delegation to Beijing “very soon” to discuss economic issues. Shambaugh leads a US-China economic working group that has made addressing China’s excess factory production a top issue Yellen said the US-China relationship “needs to be prioritised and nurtured” by the next US administration, with discussions at the highest levels and among agency staffs. “We have enough differences and without a chance to discuss them and put them in context, it’s certainly possible for tensions to rise,” Yellen said. “So this is something that really requires ongoing attention. I hope that it would get it.” Yellen also said the US economy has largely reached a “soft landing” with lower inflation after US August jobs data on Friday showed a slight decline in the unemployment rate despite slower hiring. “When you see pace of job creation diminishing over time, what I love to see is that it stabilises roughly where it is now, and we have to be careful to make sure that it’s not going to weaken further,” Yellen said. She said consumer spending remains “quite solid” and while there is “less frenzy” in hiring, there are not meaningful lay-offs “I’m attentive to downside risks now on the employment side, but I what I think we’re seeing, we will continue to see, is a good, solid economy,” Yellen said.","summary":"The US Treasury secretary says the US-China relationship ‘needs to be prioritised and nurtured’ by the next administration.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3277637/janet-yellen-probably-done-when-biden-ends-term-may-meet-chinese-counterpart-soon","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/08/4c83cc95-f41c-45e7-9581-210343231bd6_87ba8d18.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:50:52","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.221},{"id":255888050,"title":"Kamala Harris is adopting Trump’s policies and Democrats are embracing conservative values, such as “edgy” football.","text":"Over at The Nation, the outlet’s designated sports editor Dave Zirin addressed the move made by the Democrats and the Harris-Walz campaign to embrace the Minnesota governor’s former position as an assistant football coach. His supposed leadership and the metaphors of the sport have become fixtures somewhat in the campaign. And Zirin sees trouble with this decision. In the so-called taking over of football from conservatives Zirin sees dire consequences – because appealing to those fans of the most popular sport in the nation is a poor decision??? He says that the sport carries some “dark” aspects, such as the threat of concussions, but also toxic testosterone-fueled components that will drive away a core of Democratic Party youths. The Democratic Party is presenting football as a symbol of the kind of teamwork needed to take down Donald Trump, argues @EdgeofSports. The embrace of football is rattling conservatives, but it may cost Democrats young progressive voters.https://t.co/2WSs0snLln— The Nation (@thenation) August 26, 2024 The hypermasculinity and violence of football…could repel young voters. This could repel the young, left-wing voters more interested in policy changes than who wins the football wars. Young people care about racism, the economy, climate change, Palestine, and a host of other issues given short shrift at the convention. Football not only won’t be enough to satisfy them. Its embrace may send a signal that the big tent isn’t big enough for them. What adds to the mirthful wishcasting is something else Zirin touts, and that is the manner the Democrats have allegedly appropriated the sport of football as their own. This is supposedly something that completely unravels Republicans, in his fevered mind. “How confused, how utterly rattled, these conservatives must be at the moment. Democrats are claiming football for themselves; presenting the sport as not only patriotic but as a potent symbol of the kind of teamwork needed to take down Donald Trump.” This is nothing more than desperate wishcasting, of course, but it points to something else taking place in the minds of the Democratic Party. They somehow operate as if they suddenly begin to embrace some aspect of the culture that means that the conservatives no longer have access to it? So if Democrats now declare football as a symbol of…I dunno, something, for their party…conservatives can no longer claim to enjoy the game themselves? This is ridiculous on its face, of course, but it cuts to the level of desperation for their party. Just as Kamala has adopted a number of policy items that have long been on Trump’s docket – no taxes on tips, building the border wall, etc. – the Dems are trying to claim various cultural touchstones that have been regarded as conservative in the past. Some opined that at the Democratic Convention, they took over country music. Quite the surprise, considering just one year ago that genre was considered toxic and dangerous. Also at the convention, patriotism was highlighted as a novel item embraced by the Dems, with chants of “USA” heard and then celebrated as the party tried to claim the “love of country” mantle from the right. It’s especially galling considering they routinely call expressions of pride for the nation “jingoism” and divisive and antagonistic. Now they go the other way; instead of inviting all under the Stars & Stripes, it is said they displayed the “Democratic brand of patriotism.” The selection of Tim Walz has brought a number of changes to Democrat approaches, and this is due to the conflict he delivers. Walz is an avid hunter, something that brings challenges to the anti-gun party. It has been fun to watch them tightrope to targeting “bad guns” as a result. The Walz arrival brought another supposedly claimed component, one even more ridiculous. The campaign produced a piece of merchandise playing off of the Walz hunting preference, a branded baseball hat in a camouflage pattern. By itself, it is not all that remarkable, as just about any brand in America with a tangential connection to the outdoors might produce this kind of headgear. But Rolling Stone, in a dose of over-insistence, saw the stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, Ella Emhoff (who appears as outdoorsy as a teacup poodle), wearing one such hat at the convention and turned rhapsodic. Ella Emhoff is about to be all of us this fall in that coveted Harris/Walz camo hat pic.twitter.com/xWK1lOtv7I— Nate Morris 🥥🌴 (@_natemorris) August 20, 2024 That is quite the political party makeover, in a matter of a few weeks, for the sake of pushing a San Francisco Democrat who was raised in Canada into the White House. It is quite the list of items that were scorned by this party not so long ago; country music, hunting gear, patriotism, border hawks, and now football. That sure looks like something the Democrats normally demonize – cultural appropriation. The result, however, delivers the opposite of what is intended. Like Kamala’s sudden new position on several political issues, the embracing of these cultural items appears like a shallow, calculated maneuver rather than a genuine acceptance of these touchstones. It conveys the Southern aphorism: “All hat, and no cattle.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOver at The Nation, the outlet’s designated sports editor Dave Zirin addressed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris is adopting Trump&#8217;s policies and Democrats are embracing conservative values, such as &#8220;edgy&#8221; football. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-is-adopting-trumps-policies-and-democrats-are-embracing-conservative-values-such-as-edgy-football/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Is-Stealing-Trump039s-Agenda-and-Dems.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:49:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":255888642,"title":"Bill Maher Slams Bradley Whitford for Calling Out RFK Jr.’s Wife: ‘Resist the Siren Call of Being an A–hole’ | Video","text":"Bill Maher still considers himself a liberal, but he’s begging them not to skeez him out — particularly when it comes to an attack one prominent liberal made against Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s actress wife, Cheryl Hines. In his latest extended New Rule from Friday’s “Real Time,” Maher began, “New Rule: If you want to win my vote, don’t give me the ick.” “You know what ‘the ick’ is, right?” the comedian continued. “It’s a term mostly used in the dating world to describe that moment when one of the people, usually the man, does something so icky that the woman cannot forgive it or forget it.” He laid out examples, including: Sending a dick pic Being mean to the waitress Paying for dinner with a coupon Having his mother call you when you dump him Asking for sex in a baby voice “Once you give her the ick, it’s a wrap,” Maher continued — then he explained how this translates to the 2024 presidential campaign. “Donald Trump has pioneered the concept of ‘the ick’ to frontiers no one ever thought possible. And that is saying a lot, considering that we once had to learn that John Edwards was going down on his five-month pregnant mistress, because who doesn’t love to see a politician kiss a baby?” Maher laid out, to laughs from the crowd. Maher then laid out a smattering of Trump’s dump truck full of icky moments, including: The sexualized way he talks about his daughter How he talks about his penis Doing a faux “disabled voice” “Humping the flag” Getting in a shoving match in a graveyard The host went on to mock the way Trump dances, describing it as “jerking off two guys at once.” “What I’m saying is, don’t underestimate the ick. It’s what’s going to decide this election, and it’s the best thing Democrats have going for them,” Maher stated. But Maher doesn’t have faith in what he calls “the far left” not to screw this up for Democratic candidates, adding that all of what he’d laid out was a cue for them to say, “Hold my beer.” Maher turned his attention to former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s endorsement of Trump — and wife Cheryl Hines’ continued support of her husband. “Now look, I like Bobby and always will,” Maher said. “And there are things he has been right about that no one else would touch. But yes, I also think he’s weird.” Maher noted that her “Curb Your Enthusiasm” costar Larry David had once described Hines as “The best person I’ve ever met. The one person in Hollywood who doesn’t have a single enemy.” “Well, now she does,” Maher added. “Because she didn’t throw her husband under the bus when her husband made a decision about something which she’s made plain she disagrees with. But that didn’t satisfy the obnoxious posers on the aforementioned far left.” The host pointed to social media criticism, noting that thousands had “tweet-screamed” anger at Hines with sentiments such as: “How do you live with yourself?” “Do better.” “I can’t even enjoy the episodes of ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ with you in them anymore.” “It’s no wonder Larry divorced you.” Maher had some particularly subtle yet dripping scorn for that last remark, adding in a deadpan, “Yeah, that’s a character on TV, but OK.” The host finally came to the ultimate example of his frustrations that he wanted to go after: actor Bradley Whitford, best known for his iconic role as Josh on “The West Wing.” Maher read Whitford’s own irate tweet at Hines, which read, “Hey @CherylHines, way to stay silent while your lunatic husband throws his support behind the adjudicated rapist who brags about stripping women of their fundamental rights. Gutsy. Great example for the kids. Profile in courage. “Yeah, well, you know what I think is not gutsy?” Maher began his response. “Mansplaining to a woman, but of course not to her face, how she should sacrifice her marriage — all so you could read something on Twitter that met with your approval.” The “Real Time” host explained that this is what he’s complaining about when he complains about liberals. “You want to know why I have a bug up my ass about the left more than I used to? It’s s–t like this,” Maher said. “There’s an ugliness they never used to have. The liberals I grew up respecting, none of them are like this. Going after the wife — even the mafia doesn’t do that.” Maher added that he sees a lot of people now who he describes as “liberals in theory.” “In theory, they hate bullying — ‘terrible.’ In practice, their attitude is, it’s not bullying when I stick your head in the toilet. In theory, liberals are compassionate. In practice, this guy can’t even understand one of the most basic dilemmas common to all humans: that when you’re married, sometimes you have to swallow some s–t.” The famed pothead then compared marriage to… “a bong.” “For it to work, you have to take a few hits,” Maher said. He admitted that he’s never been married, but said that he understands that in a marriage, “you’re not going to love everything your spouse says and does. But I promise you, no couples counselor has ever said, ‘Have you tried screaming at each other?’” Maher pointed to former President Barack Obama speaking at this year’s Democratic National Convention, asking those listening to not assume the worst of others just because they don’t agree with you on every issue. Obama critiqued the idea that the only way to “win” was to “scold and shame and out-yell the other side.” “Bradley, did you go to the bathroom or something when that came on?” Maher asked. “Because it’s almost like he was talking to you directly, like by name. Don’t scold, don’t shame, don’t out-yell.” The host noted that former President Bill Clinton delivered a similar message as part of his speech at the DNC, where he urged Democrats to “meet people where they are” and “not to demean them.” While Maher had a lot of problems with liberals, he doesn’t think the group he’s talking about includes Democratic politicians. “The actual politicians of the Democratic Party are generally a pretty sane crop of people,” Maher said, adding, “The worst of them are leagues better than the worst Republicans. The Democratic politicians are not the ones calling to defund the police and other goofy stuff.” “But the kind of people who are, the kind of people who are always howling on social media — yeah, that’s who gives a lot of people the ick when they hear ‘liberal,’” Maher said, bringing his New Rule full circle. Maher does agree with this: “Trump is awful.” “He’s not Hitler. But he is possibly the worst person since Hitler,” Maher half-quipped, before turning to joke that they’d love to have Trump on the show. Maher posited that Trump “drives people insane,” including Whitford. “I used to know Bradley a little bit. He wasn’t this guy. And while he may relish writing Cheryl Hines off, I’m not writing him off,” Maher said. Instead, Maher said that’s not the right way to approach something like this, and that he would instead try to follow Obama’s advice to extend grace to our fellow citizens. “We have to resist the siren call of being an a–hole. You don’t like Trump? Then don’t be like him,” Maher concluded.

Now the filmmaker has publicly turned on the GOP vice presidential candidate, saying he is “surprised and disappointed” by the “rhetoric that I’m reading and hearing.” At the Toronto Film Festival to promote his latest movie Eden, Ron Howard faced questions about JD Vance from multiple news outlets, some of which clearly had an ax to grind against Vance. “Well, we didn’t talk a lot of politics when we were making the movie because I was interested in his upbringing and that survival tale. That’s what we mostly focused on,” Howard replied to Deadline, which in its question to Howard described Vance as “polarizing” and “volatile.” “However, based on the conversations that we had during that time, I just have to say I’m very surprised and disappointed by much of the rhetoric that I’m reading and hearing. People do change, and I assume that’s the case.” Howard offered a similar response to Variety when asked about Vance. “I have been surprised and concerned by a lot of the rhetoric coming out of that campaign,” the filmmaker said. “There’s no version of me voting for Donald Trump to be President again, whoever the Vice President was. But given the experience that I had then 5, 6 years ago. Yeah, I’d say that I’ve been surprised.” Howard urged Americans to “get out and vote, for whomever. But be thoughtful. Listen to what the candidates are saying today, that’s what’s really relevant it’s who they are today. And make a decision, an informed one.” Hillbilly Elegy star Glenn Close has also turned on JD Vance, after she earned an Oscar nomination for playing his mamaw. As Breitbart News reported, the actress trashed Vance on Instagram over a cat comment he made years ago. In two recent Instagram posts, she defended women who own feline companions. “Eve would have left a bleeding mouse head in the bed of anyone who criticized any kind of lady with a CAT!” Close wrote.","summary":"Ron Howard made JD Vance's bestselling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\" into a major Hollywood movie four years ago.

The former president, however, has at least one more request after flip-flopping over the event’s rules and regulations. In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump shared that “no boxes or artificial lifts” will be allowed during the debate, equating the use of the height-enhancing items to “cheating.” “No boxes or artificial lifts will be allowed to stand on during my upcoming debate with Comrade Kamala Harris,” he wrote on Saturday. “We had this out previously with former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg when he was in a debate, and he was not allowed a ‘lift.’ It would be a form of cheating.” He added, “And the Democrats cheat enough. ‘You are who you are,’ it was determined!” In 2016, during his debates with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump—who is reported to be somewhere around 6’ to 6’3 tall—seemed to loom over Clinton’s reported 5’7 stature. Particularly during their second debate, the former president’s habit of lurking in the background while Clinton spoke was parodied on SNL—with Alec Baldwin playing Trump and Kate McKinnon as Clinton. Harris, who is reportedly 5’4 tall, also had her own requests for the big day. Upon agreeing to the rules of the debate, her campaign told ABC in a letter that she would be “disadvantaged” by the network’s plan to mute candidates’ microphones when it is not their turn to speak. “Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President,” the written statement read. “We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones.” A source told CNN that ABC may turn on the mics at some point during the debate so the audience can hear some of the candidates’ reactions.","summary":"Art created by Daily Beast, with Win McNamee and Spencer Platt/Getty Images GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is gearing up to face off against Vice President Kamala Harris at their a highly anticipated Sept. 10 debate on ABC News.

Nobody checked them.\"A video of the former president's remarks were posted to X, formerly Twitter, by @KamalaHQ. The video currently has over 260,000 views.Newsweek has contacted Trump's campaign via email on Saturday for comment.On July 15, the Republican National Committee published and formally adopted new immigration policy priorities during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.The document stated, \"Republicans offer an aggressive plan to stop the open-border policies that have opened the floodgates to a tidal wave of illegal aliens, deadly drugs, and migrant crime.\"Key policy points in the platform included: \"Seal the border, and stop the migrant invasion\" \"Carry out the largest deportation operation in American history\" \"Stop the migrant crime epidemic, demolish the foreign drug cartels, crush gang violence, and lock up violent offenders\" The platform promises to \"restore every border policy of the Trump administration\" and finish the border wall Trump began during his previous term. It also calls for strengthening U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), ramping up penalties for illegal entry and visa overstays, and reinstating Trump's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.The 2024 platform uses more direct language compared to the 2016/2020 version, omitting conciliatory statements about immigrants' contributions to the country.This hardline stance is further reinforced by Trump's pick for vice president, Ohio Senator JD Vance who has backed calls for mass deportation of illegal immigrants, despite unclear implementation plans.At the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin, Vance echoed Trump's rhetoric, stating, \"We have to deport people, we have to deport people who broke our laws who came in here and I think we start with the violent criminals.\"Vance's campaign has been even more explicit, with a fundraising message declaring, \"We need to deport every single person who invaded our country illegally.\" This aligns with Trump's claim that between 15 and 20 million people could be deported under his plans, though official estimates put the number of undocumented migrants in the U.S. at around 11 million.In his convention speech, Vance linked immigration to housing issues, stating, \"Then the Democrats flooded this country with millions of illegal aliens. So citizens had to compete with people who shouldn't even be here for precious housing.\" However, data from the Migration Policy Institute shows that only about 28 percent of illegal immigrants own homes, compared to roughly 65 percent of American citizens.Vance's hardline stance is juxtaposed with his personal life. His wife, Usha, is the daughter of Indian immigrants, whom he praised for \"enriching\" the country. This has led to some criticism from extremist figures within Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, questioning the authenticity of his immigration views.However, some Republican lawmakers have expressed doubts about the practicality of mass deportations. Representative Tony Gonzales, a Texas Republican who represents the largest stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border in Congress, previously told Newsweek, \"You're not going to round up 10 million people and deport them. It's simple—you do not have the infrastructure to do that.\"The debate over immigration policy has intensified as both major parties seek to present contrasting visions ahead of the 2024 election. While Trump and the Republican National Committee advocate for a hardline approach, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to revive President Joe Biden's failed bipartisan border security bill.Recent data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse shows over 620,000 immigration court deportation cases were filed in fiscal year 2023, with around 236,000 resulting in removals. This surpasses the 187,000 removals that occurred during the peak of Trump's administration in 2019.Gonzales warned that completely shutting down the border would impact industries across the country, stating, \"There's not one industry that is not tied to the U.S.-Mexico border.\"With an estimated 11.3 million immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, addressing the immigration crisis will require balancing security concerns with humanitarian considerations and practical realities.","summary":"\"[They] should have never been allowed to come into our country.

Mike Waltz: Gold Star Families Want to Hear Biden Admin Acknowledge They 'Did Some Things Wrong'","text":"During an interview on Breitbart News Saturday, Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL) spoke about how the Gold Star families who lost their loved ones during the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, want to hear the administration acknowledge that they “did some things wrong.” Waltz spoke about how in the aftermath of former President Donald Trump Arlington National Cemetery, honoring the 13 fallen American service members who were killed during the Biden administration’s botched withdrawal, the media and Vice President Kamala Harris have attacked Trump and claimed that there was an altercation between Trump campaign officials and a cemetery official. The Florida Congressman added that Harris has “not made a single phone call” or “visit” with the families, and now she was “weighing in.” “He was there at the request of the families. Oh, by the way, the families invited her and Biden too, and they still didn’t show up. And, oh, by the way, as a veteran, I’ve visited my Green Berets that I lost down there where those tombstones are for the last twenty years. We always take photos. We always post them online. I want America to see the sacrifices that were made for them. It was a beautiful moment, there was no altercation. This is a made-up hoax, and it’s really disgusting because those families had a special moment with a former President of the United States who has bothered to show up and hear their grievances,” Waltz explained. Host Matthew Boyle explained that “the hardest thing to hear” from the Gold Star families was how Harris does not have “empathy enough” to pick up the phone and make a call to them. “Here’s the thing that I think scars them so deeply,” Waltz explained. “All they want to hear is, ‘We know we did some things wrong. We should have done them better. We’re learning our lesson so this doesn’t happen to future soldiers.’ But, every time Biden and now her, say, ‘No, no, no. This was an outstanding success,’ it’s another stab in the heart for these families, because you’ve got a major political party led by these two that are saying, ‘No, this is the right way to do it. This is the way we would do it again in the future.’ “The best way to honor their loss is to say, ‘We learned our lessons, and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure this never happens again.’ But, they’re not hearing that – well, they’re hearing nothing. But, that’s what they want to hear, is that, ‘We’ve learned our lessons. This is not going to happen to future kids and future Marines.’ But, yet they don’t even have the – just the gall to weigh in now, has just been another – just another punch, just another beat down for these poor families,” Waltz added. The Gold Star families of the fallen service members have issued statements explaining that they had given the approval for photos and videos to be taken at Arlington National Cemetery, and have criticized Harris for issuing a statement labeling Trump’s visit to the cemetery as a “political stunt.” Waltz continued to note that during the upcoming presidential debate between Trump and Harris, the vice president may point out that the Biden administration executed Trump’s Doha Agreement of withdrawing from Afghanistan. “She may go there to say, ‘No, no. What Biden did was actually execute your deal, Donald Trump. This was your – you’re responsible for this, for that Doha Agreement.’ Number one, President Trump’s advisers came to him and said, ‘The Taliban haven’t lived up to six out of seven conditions of the deal. They haven’t lived up to their end.’ And, what did President Trump do? He left 2500 special operators, the NATO still had their troops there, we still had our contractors there, and we still had Bagram Airbase. Right? So, yeah, President Trump entered a deal. The Taliban didn’t live up to it. And, as far as he was concerned when he left office in 2020, that the deal was off. Number two, Biden had no problem tearing up all kinds of Trump policies, like Keystone XL Pipeline, despite the billions and the ten thousand jobs that were involved there. The Paris Climate Accord, all of the policies relating to the border, over 60 executive orders that he tore up and replaced. I mean, we could keep going down the line. The Iran Deal, that they got back into, that they tried to get back into. So, he can tear up all these Trump policies, but he was stuck with that one?” Waltz added.","summary":"During an interview on Breitbart News Saturday, Rep.

Though not much is known about his political ambitions, a close friend of the former First Boy of the White House has dropped shocking bombs about his inclinations. The 18-year-old, now an NYU student at the Stern School of Business this week, has peers with unique stand on him. A student suggested that Barron may have to change his political leanings and learnings to be famous among the college ladies. \"He's going to NYU so if he is at all interested in girls, he's going to become kind of liberal I'll tell you that,\" the student told Daily Mail. Another student shared, \"I feel really bad for him, he did not choose this life\" and that she is \"excited and intrigued\" to get a glimpse of the Secret Service personnel on campus. Another batchmate of Barron shared, \"His dad is his dad and he is his own person so I'm not going to judge. Of course, who wouldn't want to be friends with a Trump?\" when asked if they would befriend Barron. While other students differed in their opinion and said, \"It speaks to the privilege that a lot of the NYU kids have. I'm only here because of financial aid. Previously, the Republican frontrunner for the upcoming presidential elections claimed that his son \"was accepted to a lot of colleges. He's a very smart guy, and he'll be going to Stern, the business school, which is a great school at N.Y.U.\" He added that Barron wanted to follow him and enroll at Pennsylvania University's Wharton School, but ultimately opted for NYU. \"It's a very high-quality place. He liked it. He liked the school. We liked NYU. I've known NYU for a long time, but it's one of the highest-rated...I went to Wharton, and that was certainly one that we were considering. We didn't do that,\" the businessman-turned-politician continued as he spoke to the Daily Mail exclusively. \"We went for Stern. He's a very high-aptitude child, but he's no longer a child. He's just passed into something beyond child-dom. He's he's doing great,\" the proud father added. According to Newsweek, Barron chose college depending on the protests erupting across the country against the Biden administration's stance on war in the Middle East. \"Six months ago, you look at a college and you sort of want a certain college. And then you see all of these colleges are rioting, and maybe you want to go to a different kind of college. Because there's plenty of colleges that we also like that are different and they don't riot,\" Trump told Fox & Friends in June.","summary":"The 18-year-old who is now an NYU student at the Stern School of Business this week, has peers with unique stand on him.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/very-smart-barron-trump-will-become-a-liberal-soon-reveals-school-friend","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/714525/uploads/55c5b150-6c44-11ef-b360-b367d596ac10_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:15:12","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.069},{"id":255887386,"title":"Harry and Meghan’s PR Team Was Once Easily ‘Duped’ Into Believing They Were Talking to Greta Thunberg","text":"In an unexpected turn of events, Prince Harry found himself at the center of a scandal after being duped by Russian pranksters Vladimir Krasnov and Aleksey Stolyarov, popularly known as \"Vovan\" and \"Lexus.\" The duo, notorious for their elaborate hoaxes on high-profile figures, managed to convince Harry that he was speaking with the renowned teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. The incident not only embarrassed the Duke of Sussex but also raised serious questions about the effectiveness of his and Meghan Markle’s security and PR team. The pranksters reportedly initiated contact with Harry by sending an email under a fake name, posing as Thunberg’s 'director.' As per The Guardian, this email made its way through the Sussexes’ PR channels, eventually landing in Prince Harry’s personal inbox. Stolyarov later revealed, “His staff must have forwarded him the email. Probably the emails were transferred through many people before he got it. We were shocked when he emailed us. No one ever checked us out to see who we really were.” Shockingly, the prince responded, and a phone call was set up, during which Harry believed he was talking to Greta and her father. As per CNN, during the call, which took place in 2020, Harry said, “Sometimes the right decision isn’t always the easy one. And this decision certainly wasn’t the easy one, but it was the right decision for our family, the right decision to be able to protect my son. And I think there’s a hell of a lot of people around the world that can identify and respect us for putting our family first. But, yeah, it’s a tricky one, but we will start a new life.” He even took a swipe at the then-U.S. President and said, “I think the mere fact that Donald Trump is pushing the coal industry is so big in America, he has blood on his hands. Trump will want to meet you to make him look better but he won’t want to have a discussion about climate change with you because you will outsmart him.” With Buckingham Palace’s rigorous screening protocols no longer in place, Harry and Markle were left vulnerable to such situations. The late Queen's former press secretary, Dickie Arbiter, warned, “As long as Harry and Meghan are over there, they’re out of the protection of the system. For all its faults, the system does, and is there, to protect. If you’re out of the system you’re open to anything and everything.” The ease with which the pranksters accessed Harry’s personal communication channels highlights the potential risks they face. The Russian hackers, who have previously targeted other celebrities and political figures, have denied any connection to Russian intelligence services. They said, “We can responsibly declare, and we have always stated this, that we are not a project of special services, we ourselves are self-sufficient people, we have our own beliefs, our ideas and thoughts.”","summary":"It not only embarrassed the Duke of Sussex but also raised serious questions about the effectiveness of his and Meghan Markle’s security and PR team.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/harry-and-meghans-pr-team-was-once-easily-duped-into-believing-they-were-talking-to-greta-thunberg","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/714164/uploads/d9eb5d70-6acf-11ef-a343-bf59e4d8bbc0_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.108},{"id":255887020,"title":"Trump tries to manage expectations for Tuesday’s debate by predicting media will say he was humiliated","text":"Donald Trump wants his supporters to know that even if he loses his upcoming debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he really won. During a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin on Saturday, Trump prepped his base, telling them that even if he does well in his debate with Harris, he'll still be blasted by the media. \"If I destroy her in the debate, they'll say Trump suffered a humiliating debate tonight,\" he told a crowd of MAGA faithful on Saturday. While it's no secret that Trump – who for years has called members of the press enemies of the US and encouraged his crowd to boo them at his rallies — is regularly fact checked by reporters, few people leapt to Joe Biden's defense after his disastrous performance earlier this year. Biden's poor debate performance — and the resulting pressure from the public, press, and other Democratic lawmakers — led to him ultimately dropping out of the presidential race in July. Despite that, Trump is insisting that he'll be treated unfairly by the media after his upcoming debate. But that may just be expectation setting by the former president. In addition to trashing the broader media, Trump has already specifically attacked the network hosting the debate, ABC News, calling it the \"worst network in terms of fairness.\" Some Republicans are privately afraid that Trump will blow his debate performance, according to a recent report from Politico. “I think — I pray — he can be disciplined,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Republican strategist, told the outlet. But she also admitted that her prayers may not be answered. “If Trump feels like he’s backed into a corner and feels like it’s three on one, that could be a problem,” she said. Trump's own words suggest her fears may be well founded. Podcaster Lex Friedman, who tends to be friendly to right-wing guests, recently spoke with Trump and encouraged him to share a \"positive vision of the future\" rather than criticizing his opponent. Senator Lindsey Graham expressed a similar position in a New York Times op-ed. “Every day that the candidates trade insults is a good day for [Harris] because it’s one less day that she has to defend the failures of the Biden-Harris administration,” he said. Trump disagreed. “Yeah, I think you have to criticize though,” he told the podcaster. “I think they’re nasty.” Trump and Harris will face off on ABC on September 10 in Philadelphia at 9pm EST.","summary":"Former president has already complained that ABC, the networking hosting the debate, is the ‘worst network in terms of fairness’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-debate-media-win-b2608899.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/07/22/2024-09-07T201016Z_429320563_RC2WV9ANGA62_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-WISCONSIN.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/AHvwupmp-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-07 22:05:56","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":255890352,"title":"Harris Targets Trump on Abortion in Latest Campaign Ad","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign released a TV advertisement on Saturday reminding voters that former President Donald J.

It then shows him saying this year that for “years, they were trying to get Roe v.

In light of the same, Star Wars actor, Mark Hamill, called out the Republican leader over his 'childish behavior.' He argued that it demonstrates \"disrespect and contempt.\" According to Huff Post, Hamill gave Trump a new moniker in response. “When they go low, we should respond in kind,” he suggested on X. “From now on, don’t call him ‘Don’. Call him ‘Done.’” He added, \"'La' Is that so difficult? Deliberately mispronouncing her name is both childish and his way of conveying disrespect and contempt.\" Netizens chimed in agreement with the Return of the Jedi actor's remarks, labeling Trump as a 'bully'. \"I like DonOld. But yes, purposely saying her name wrong lets them feel like they are in control of her,\" a person penned. \"You're completely right. There's only one way to deal with a bully. And it's certainly not by being the *better* person...it's by giving them all of their same 'medicine' right back. 'Done' is done,\" an X user quipped. \"Done-old Trump. Just like it sounds,\" another mocked. According to The New York Times, Trump once tried to justify his pronunciation after backlash. “Some people think I mispronounce it on purpose...but actually, I’ve heard it said about seven different ways,” he said. \"They were explaining to me, 'You can't say \"ka-MALA\" — you can say \"COMMA-la,\"' Trump remarked, adding, \"'Don't worry about it — I couldn't care less if I mispronounce it. I couldn't care less,'\" at a rally. In 2017, Harris sat down for an interview with CNN's David Axelrod for The Axe Files podcast, where she educated the audience on how to pronounce her name right. \"There are many ways. If you were asking my grandmother, she'd say, 'KUH-muh-lah.' I usually help people pronounce it by saying, 'Well, just think of a comma and add a 'la' at the end.'\" Meanwhile, according to University of Michigan psychology professor, Myles Durkee, Trump's mispronunciation of her name is an attempt to 'other' her. \"When you intentionally mispronounce someone's name who's less traditional in the American context, it's almost a dog whistle to othering that person, trying to suggest they're less American, that they're less worthy of you saying their name correctly in the first place,\" Durkee argued. At a recent political event, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff also brought up the same and stated to the audience that he had a remedy if Trump continued to struggle with pronouncing her name. \"Here's the good news: After November, you can call her 'Madam President,'\" Emhoff quipped.","summary":"Trump has repeatedly mispronounced VP Kamla Harris&#39; first name.

President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race after a fumbled debate performance that had voters questioning his mental acuity. Now Trump is facing similar questions and is trying to provide explanations for his frequent mentions of Hannibal Lecter, garbled words, incomplete thoughts, conflating the names of prominent figures, and his penchant for rambling. But the explanations caused one Trump biographer to believe the GOP nominee knows full well that he is losing his mental footing. Timothy O’Brien, author of TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald, told The Guardian that he believes the former president, who once dubbed himself a “very stable genius,” fully understands that he is saying more ludicrous things than ever and is trying to make up for it. “The reason he’s now offering these convoluted explanations of his speech patterns in his public appearances is because he’s hyper-aware that people have noted that he’s making even less sense than he used to,” O’Brien said. “What we’re seeing now is a reflection of someone who’s very troubled and very desperate.” On Saturday afternoon, Trump also tried to explain his frequent, and apparently random, references to the “late great Hannibal Lecter,” a fictional cannibalistic serial killer from books and movies including Silence of the Lambs. As it turns out, he was making a statement about migrants, claiming the killer was “representative of people that are coming into our country.” This type of explanation from Trump is not isolated. Last week, the former president addressed his tendency to venture off topic. He bragged to a Johnstown, Pennsylvania crowd about the “weave,” or what he calls his tendency to wander in and out — often nonsensically — of multiple conversational threads before circling back to his original point. “When I do the weave...I’ll talk about nine different things and they all come back brilliantly together,” Trump told the crowd before criticizing the “fake” media as having accused him of “rambling.” He further defended himself: “Friends of mine that are English professors, they say: ‘It’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen,’” Trump said, referring to the “weave.” Another biographer, Jennifer Mercieca who wrote Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump, offered another reason behind his explained rambling: “He’s very good at putting a marketing spin on anything that might be perceived as a negative. She told The Guardian: “He’s had a lot of criticism lately for rambling, for being low energy during his rallies, for failing to read the teleprompter properly, mispronouncing words and so his response is to spin it. He says, ‘I have experts, these friends of mine, unnamed others, who are very impressed with my ability to weave.’” While Trump claims the “weave” is strategic, many rally-goers could be confused by his rhetoric as he tends to leapfrog from topic to topic without any obvious connection. Take a Wisconsin rally last month, when Trump jumped from bacon to wind turbines in a single minute. “You take a look at bacon and some of these products and some people don’t eat bacon any more. We are going to get the energy prices down. When we get energy down, you know, this was caused by their horrible energy – wind. They want wind all over the place. But when it doesn’t blow we have a little problem,” he told the La Crosse, Wisconsin crowd. In another infamous moment that raised eyebrows, Trump’s July rant about electric boats shifted gears to a potential shark attack. He ended the tangent with a series of unusual questions: “Do I get electrocuted if the boat is sinking? Water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking. Do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted, or do I jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted?” The incident prompted thriller novelist Stephen King to equate Trump’s speech with “listening to your senile uncle at the dinner table after he has that third drink.” On top of the mental leaps, Trump also frequently mixes up elected officials. He has confused former president Barack Obama and Biden, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and California governor Jerry Brown, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and his former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. He also accidentally called Elon Musk “Leon” at Saturday’s Wisconsin rally. He often tries to chalk up these mistakes to him “joking” or being “sarcastic.” After mixing up the two women, Trump tried to write off the gaffe as a purposeful move: “When I interpose – I’m not a Nikki fan and I’m not a Pelosi fan. When I purposely interpose names, they say ‘He didn’t know Pelosi from Nikki.’….They have something in common: they both stink.” In the face of his recent slip-ups, Trump has pointed to his cognitive tests. In one memory evaluation, which he took when he was in office, he touted his ability to recall the phrase: “person, woman, man, camera, TV.” He claimed that the test was usually considered quite difficult for others — but not for him: “If you get it in order you get extra points. [The doctor] said nobody gets it in order, it’s actually not that easy, but for me, it was easy.” More recently, after struggling to pronounce the word “climate” at a rally, the former president defended himself by saying that he had recently “aced” a cognitive test.","summary":"‘What we’re seeing now is a reflection of someone who’s very troubled and very desperate,’ says Timothy O’Brien, author of TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-cognitive-decline-biographer-b2608901.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/07/21/SEI220581609.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/AHvwupmp-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:49:26","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":255886362,"title":"Video of Kamala Harris Embracing Crying Woman Takes Off Online","text":"A video of Vice President Kamala Harris embracing a crying woman on Saturday in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state amid this year's presidential election, has taken off online.Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, will go toe-to-toe with former President Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, on Tuesday night on the ABC News debate stage for the first time.

WATCH Kamala Harris steps out of debate prep in Pittsburgh to inspire the next generation, chat with voters, thank a teacher, and be a normal, wholesome person,\" Hamelburg wrote on X as she shared the video.Newsweek has reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaign via email for comment.In a campaign press release, the Harris campaign gave additional details surrounding the moment.\"During a visit to Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Vice President Harris took a break from preparing for Tuesday's debate to meet young people, teachers, families, and community members. In a personal exchange, she reminded a voter that she is in this fight with and for all of them. She also thanked a teacher, met a young consumer protection lawyer, and inspired a middle school student to be a leader,\" the Harris campaign said.The moment comes as Harris is on day two of a five-day working session in Pittsburgh, getting ready for Tuesday's presidential debate against Trump.Harris arrived at the Omni William Penn Hotel early Thursday afternoon as The New York Times reported on Saturday that Harris is \"holed up\" for five days in a hotel room in the city in preparation for the debate. While Harris' debate prep is \"highly choreographed,\" as the Times put it, Trump's campaign is not even calling it \"debate prep\" but rather \"policy time\" in which the former president has held a few sessions so far.Pennsylvania remains a key battleground state in this year's election with both candidates targeting the state, with Harris and Biden attending a Labor Day parade last week in Pittsburgh. It was the first time the two have shared a speaking slot on the political stage since Biden ended his reelection campaign in July, making Harris the candidate.Their visit followed an appearance by Trump in the state late last month when he visited Johnstown, just 75 miles from where he was shot during a campaign rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. One person was killed and two others injured, while Trump was struck in the ear.Battleground states will play a key role in determining the result of this year's election due to the Electoral College, which awards each state a certain number of electoral votes based on population. A presidential candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes for victory, and winning the national popular vote does not guarantee success.According to FiveThirtyEight's polling average, as of Saturday afternoon the vice president is 0.7 points ahead of Trump in the state, with 46.2 percent to his 45.5 percent.Although Harris is leading in the polling averages, recent polls in Pennsylvania have also shown the pair tied, including the latest surveys conducted by Wick and Emerson College between August 25 and 29 where the two tied at 48 percent.Meanwhile, other polls have shown Trump in the lead, including a Trafalgar Group poll from August 30, which put the former president 2 points ahead of Harris among likely voters with 47 to 45 percent. A SoCal Strategies poll from August 23 put the former president 1 point ahead with 48 percent to Harris' 47 percent while a Fabrizio Ward poll from August 21 also put the Republican 1 point ahead in a head-to-head matchup.","summary":"In the video, the vice president can be seen embracing the woman and reassuring her that \"we are all in this together.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/video-kamala-harris-embracing-crying-woman-takes-off-online-1950376","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2466486/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:48:02","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.269},{"id":255887410,"title":"Trump Threatens to Let Conspiracy Theorist Senator ‘Run’ Education in Wisconsin","text":"Donald Trump held a rally on Saturday in Wisconsin, one of the key battleground states that may help determine the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. He visited the town of Mosinee as he worked to shore up his base, which includes working-class and rural dwellers. With 59 days to the election, on Saturday he proposed killing the federal Department of Education. “I’m dying to get back to do this: We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education and send education back to Wisconsin and back to the states,” Trump said to cheers. “We’ll send it back to the states so that Ron Johnson can run it.” Wisconsin Republican Sen. Johnson has been perpetrating several conspiracy theories, most recently positing without evidence that the federal government might have been involved in the assassination attempt of Trump in July. “When you don’t know the federal government involvement in the JFK assassination, when you really don’t know what happened with Nixon … that might’ve been the second coup,” Johnson told the Federalist Radio Hour podcast on Thursday, via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “The first coup is you take out Kennedy, the second coup you take out Nixon, and then you take out Trump.” He also incredulously blamed large schools for the shooting. Back in 2022, Johnson also promoted misinformation regarding Covid, claiming that mouthwash and other unproven treatments could kill the coronavirus. At his rally on Saturday, Trump also fixated on some of his typical personal bugaboos, including crowd size (he’s been particularly obsessed with rally attendance since Vice President Kamala Harris has been drawing high, enthusiastic audiences at the 2024 rallies she’s held since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race). “This is a big crowd,” he said shortly before the two-hour rally began, noting that “nobody’s ever had crowds like this“ and he mentioned the crowd size several times during his speech, which included several mispronunciations (he referred to Elon Musk as “Leon” and said “president of the United Spates,” among other foibles). He also revisited his rhetoric on migrants and egregiously claimed women in blue states are executing babies. He also once again addressed he and his VP running mate J.D. Vance being called “weird,” which he also focused on earlier in the week during a town hall with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. On Saturday, he said the “fake news” called him and his VP nominee “weird,” but Trump accused Harris’ VP running mate Tim Walz as being the “weird” one because he signed into Minnesota law that schools require access to menstrual products in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12. “He is really weird, this guy,” he said of Walz. “Can you imagine, I’m weird?” Trump has been losing some of his support in several demographic groups since Harris took over the top spot on the Democratic ticket, formally accepting the party’s nomination in August. Harris is leading Trump among Hispanic voters by 13 percentage points, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted in August, and she has increased her support among Black Americans. However, her support among white voters without a college degree has remained about the same, while that demographic supports Trump by 25 points, per the same poll. Meanwhile, Harris has raked in record-breaking donations, while Trump has been banking on billionaires to try to put him back in the White House. Trump and Harris will face-off on Tuesday in Philadelphia for their first debate before the election, which will air on ABC News.","summary":"GOP presidential nominee hit rural town of Mosinee in battleground state on Saturday","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-ron-johnson-end-federal-department-of-education-1235097401/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DonaldTrump-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:47:52","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":255886340,"title":"Beloved pop star looks unrecognisable in a cropped red wig as she films her new music video at The Louvre - can YOU guess who it is?","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Sep 7th 2024 10PM 17°C 1AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Nicole Kidman reveals her 'heart is broken' as her beloved mother Janelle died just hours before she was awarded Best Actress for her role in Babygirl at the Venice Film Festival: Australian star has emotional tribute read to stunned audience Revealed: The real reason Prince Harry may be on a 'golden ticket' diplomatic visa in the U.S. and why getting a green card could be a financial 'dagger to the heart' for the Royal Family Is Kate's return to public life on the horizon?

Lady Gaga, 38, was spotted in a cropped red wig on a balcony in the famous French museum on Friday night and Saturday morning. The Poker Face songstress put in a long shift for her project and was filming scenes from 10pm until around 2.30am. The star was seen inside the gallery and out on the terrace, with views out over the glass pyramids and the Olympic balloon. In the photos Lady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, was seen craning her neck over the balcony edge and looking around, lit up by spotlights in the dark.

Read More Lady Gaga ditches her usual eccentric look and sports very modest black dress in Venice The news of her new music video comes as she announced the release of her new track due in October and teased her new album. Lady Gaga has been hinting at new music and a new album for a while and recently released a duet with Bruno Mars called Die With a Smile. The singer and actress and the Silk Sonic performer, also 38, shared their surprise collaboration last month after announcing it earlier that week. Lady Gaga's musical news comes hot off the back of her starring role in the latest Joker film. In celebration of the release of the film, also starring Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga stunned on the red carpet at the Italian film festival. The singer, who stars as Harley Quinn in the upcoming thriller, wore a dramatic black gown and headdress as she joined her co-star and his sister Rain at the screening. Lady Gaga and her fiancé - the couple was first romantically linked around New Year's Eve 2019 and later went Instagram official in early 2020 Before she appeared in Paris the singer who stars as Harley Quinn in the upcoming thriller, wore a dramatic black gown and headdress at the Venice Film Festival premiere of the new Joker film Lady Gaga has made a triumphant return to music with the release of her new duet with Bruno Mars, Die With a Smile She looked stunning in the plunging dress which featured a velvet corset-style top which then flowed into a dramatic puffy skirt. The look was completed with an intricate lace headdress, huge diamond earrings and a bold red lip - while she wore her bright blonde tresses in a neat bun. The singer and actress gazed adoringly at Michael as she flashed her enormous 8 carat engagement ring on the star-studded red carpet. Michael, a tech entrepreneur, looked smart in a black suit, crisp white shirt and bow tie. Folie à Deux will see Joaquin, 49, reprise his role as Arthur Fleck AKA Joker and he arrived to the premiere with his glamorous sister Rain. She looked great in a brown velvet gown and donned stylish shades as she posed with her brother. It is the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019's Academy Award-winning Joker, which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. Set for release on October 4, the second instalment finds Arthur Fleck institutionalised at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. 'While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him,' a press release shared. Lady Gaga has been supported by her fiancé Michael in the lead up to the thriller's premiere. The couple was first romantically linked around New Year's Eve 2019 and later went Instagram official in early 2020.

Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, jousted with Trump during three high-stakes debates that year. She recently told The New York Times that Harris should use her background as a prosecutor to make a case against Trump. “She just should not be baited. She should bait him,” Clinton told the newspaper. Clinton argued that during a key moment in the final 2016 presidential debate, her needling of Trump on foreign affairs – where she called him a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin – threw him off balance. “He can be rattled,” Clinton told the Times. “He doesn’t know how to respond to substantive, direct attacks.” “And I think that from her prosecutorial background, I think that’s what she will be equipped to do,” Clinton added. You don&apos;t need to be a Democrat to agree that Hillary Clinton was right about Putin’s puppet #TBTpic.twitter.com/XUGCmTdTyo — Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) July 21, 2023 Clinton, who in 2016 won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Trump after coming up short in pivotal battlegrounds like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, said the debate would be a prime opportunity for Harris to offer a contrast with the former president as they appeal to wavering voters. “There still is enough potential movement in key states where people can be persuaded that they don’t want to sign on for another four years of him,” Clinton said. Trump in both 2016 and 2020 relentlessly sought to control the tone of his debates with Clinton and current US President Joe Biden, respectively. In the first televised debate of the 2020 election, Trump frequently spoke over Biden, so much so that Biden told Trump to “shut up” after several interruptions. Biden’s one-time 2024 re-election bid was eventually derailed in large part by a poor debate performance against Trump in June.

Speaking to The Sunday Times, the Closer actor, 51, revealed his metamorphosis for the historical drama was his 'most extreme transformation yet', while also reflecting on some of the lower moments of his career. Starring alongside Alicia Vikander, who plays Henry VIII's sixth wife Katherine Parr, Jude transforms into a miserable incarnation of the king who could barely walk at the time, weighed 28st and needed nine men to lift him on his horse. Lifting the lid on how he managed to gain weight for the role, he said: 'It was a process. 'Like Charlie Chaplin or Father Christmas, Henry has a familiar silhouette, so if you get that shape, the brain fills in a lot of the gaps. So I grew a beard. I had bodysuits, clothes, weights on my legs and bits in my shoes to perfect his gait. Jude Law has revealed he gorged on 'late night ice-cream' as part of his 'extreme' transformation into a bloated Henry VIII The Closer actor revealed his metamorphosis for the historical drama was his 'most extreme transformation yet' (pictured with co-star Alicia Vikander) 'I only had about four months to prep, so couldn't balloon up to full weight, but I did eat loads — late-night pasta and ice cream — so I had a bigger face. He added bluntly that sometimes he would think of him as a 'paraplegic gorilla' as if he had a lot of power but couldn't move, in a way that made him 'weirdly helpless'. The acting icon believes Firebrand is in fact about 'surviving domestic abuse' and describes his character as 'a gangster — a former golden boy who's rotting'. The London-born star, originally from Lewisham, has been Hollywood's darling between the 1990s and early 200s after his legendary performances in films as The Talented Mr Ripley, Closer, Cold Mountain, Road To Perdition and AI. In 2004 he became Alfie Cartwright for the remake of romcom Alfie, for which Jude was paid £6 million - yet he admitted he was 'probably paid too much'. Not too long after it, he became the topic of a Chris Rock joke at the Oscars, comparing him with Tom Cruise. 'Why is he in every movie I've seen in the last four years?,' the comedian joked, but Jude revealed he found it 'upsetting'. 'The attention cools off if your movies are not making a ton of money. Starring alongside Alicia Vikander , who plays Henry VIII's sixth wife Katherine Parr, Jude transforms into a miserable incarnation of the king who could barely walk at the time 'I only had about four months to prep, so couldn't balloon up to full weight, but I did eat loads — late-night pasta and ice cream — so I had a bigger face,' he revealed The London-born star, originally from Lewisham, has been Hollywood's darling between the 1990s and early 200s after his legendary performances in films as The Talented Mr Ripley (pictured with Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow), Closer, Cold Mountain, Road To Perdition 'There is a definite tier system as to who is offered what first, and if the work is not coming in as freely you have to consider what you want to do.' Jude's most recent project, historical crime film The Order, just premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August and will be available to watch on Prime Video. Jude's performance as Terry Husk, a washed-up FBI agent who goes up against real-life white supremacist group The Order, received a seven-minute standing ovation at the Festival.

Jude Law and Nicholas Hoult battle wildfire smoke to film tense scenes for their new crime film The Order in Canada He said of his character: 'There was a sort of lived-in -quality to him that I enjoyed. 'There was a lot of discussion about facial hair, but every agent I interviewed had a moustache, so it was just a given that I had to grow one.' Also starring are Alison Oliver, Tye Sheridan, Jurnee Smollett, and Nicholas Hoult. Nicholas plays The Order leader Bob Mathews, an American neo-Nazi who led the white supremacist group in 1983. Nicholas revealed that the film's director -Justin Kurzel gave each actor a 'manifesto' for their character, including tasks for them to complete. 'I just found out on the boat here – one of Jude's tasks was to follow me for a day!' he said. 'He was -trailing me for a day when I landed in Calgary.' The Order is based on the 1989 biography The Silent Brotherhood by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt. It was written by Zach Baylin and distributed by Prime Video (though Amazon MGM Studios). Though a Prime Video film, Vertical acquired partial rights to the film, and will release it on December 6, 2024, in a limited theatrical release. At The Order's Venice Film Festival press conference, Jude spoke about the importance of the film at a time when far-right ideologies are rising again. In 2004 he became Alfie Cartwright for the remake of romcom Alfie, for which Jude was paid £6 million - yet he admitted he was ' probably paid too much' (pictured at the afterparty of Alfie's London premiere with ex Sienna Miller in 2004) 'There is a definite tier system as to who is offered what first, and if the work is not coming in as freely you have to consider what you want to do,' he told bluntly about the film industry Jude's most recent project, historical crime film The Order, just premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August and will be available to watch on Prime Video. (cast pictured L-R: Matias Garrido, Nicholas Hoult, Jurnee Smollett, director Justin Kurzel, Jude, Tye Sheridan, and Philip Lewitski) 'Sadly, the relevance speaks for itself,' he said. 'It felt like a piece of work that needed to be made now. It’s always interesting finding a piece from the past that has some relevant relationship to the present day.” Director Justin agreed with Law, adding that the film’s parallels with today’s world were what made it so interesting to make. 'It’s always an extraordinary thing when you find a piece of writing or event from the past that has some sort of perspective that can have a conversation with today’s politics. That’s a rare gem. So, we felt that there was a lot that was being said about today.'

(AP) — With just days to go before his first — and likely only — debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump leaned into his familiar grievances about everything from his indictments and efforts to keep him off the ballot as he campaigned in one of the most deeply Republican swaths of battleground Wisconsin. “The Harris-Biden DOJ is trying to throw me in jail — they want me in jail — for the crime of exposing their corruption,” Trump claimed at an outdoor rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, where he spoke behind a wall of bullet-proof glass following his July assassination attempt. There’s no evidence that either Biden or Harris have had any influence over decisions by the Justice Department or local jurisdictions to indict Trump. The former president was speaking a day after appearing in court for an appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, returning attention to his many indictments and criminal conviction. After his appearance, he delivered a lengthy statement to news cameras in which he brought up a string of past allegations of other acts of sexual misconduct — at times in graphic language — potentially reminding voters of incidents that were little-known or forgotten. Hours later, a Manhattan judge announced that the sentencing in his hush money case had been postponed until after the November election, granting him a hard-won reprieve. The sentencing had previously been scheduled for Sept. 18, about seven weeks before Election Day. At the rally, Trump again criticized Harris in dark and ominous language, claiming that if the woman he calls “Comrade Kamala Harris gets four more years, we will be living in a full-blown Banana Republic ruled by anarchy.” He also railed against the Biden administration’s border policies, calling the Democrats’ approach “suicidal.” Both Harris and Trump have been frequent visitors to Wisconsin this year, a state where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by less than a percentage point. Several polls of Wisconsin voters conducted after President Joe Biden withdrew showed Harris and Trump in a close race. The crowd in Mosinee was greeted by a big screen video of Trump urging attendees to check their voter registration and make a plan for voting. “If we swamp them, they can’t cheat,” Trump said, continuing to raise unfounded concerns about voter fraud, which is extremely rare. Democrats consider Wisconsin to be one of the must-win “blue wall” states. Biden, who was in Wisconsin on Thursday, won the state in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes. Trump carried it by a slightly larger margin, nearly 23,000 votes, in 2016. As Trump was campaigning, Harris took a short break from debate prep on Saturday to stop at Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, where she bought a number of seasoning mixes. One customer saw the Democratic nominee and began openly weeping as Harris hugged her and said, “We’re going to be fine. We’re all in this together.” Harris said she was honored to have endorsements from two major Republicans: former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman. “People are exhausted, about the division and the attempts to kind of divide us as Americans,” she said, adding that her main message at the debate would be that the country wants to be united. “It’s time to turn the page on the divisiveness,” she said. “It’s time to bring our country together, to chart a new way forward.” Trump held his rally in the central Wisconsin city of Mosinee, with a population of about 4,500 people. It is within Wisconsin’s mostly rural 7th Congressional District, a reliably Republican area in a purple state. Trump carried the county where Mosinee is located by 18 percentage points in both 2016 and 2020. Among those in the crowd was Dale Osuldsen, who was celebrating his 68th birthday Saturday at his first ever Trump rally. He hopes a second Trump administration will take on “cancel culture” and bring the country back to its “foundational past. “We’ve had past administrations say they want to fundamentally change America,” Osulden said. “Fundamentally changing America is a bad thing.” Democrats have relied on massive turnout in the state’s two largest cities, Milwaukee and Madison, to counter Republican strength in rural areas like Mosinee and the Milwaukee suburbs. Trump must win the votes in places like Mosinee to have any chance of cutting into the Democrats’ advantage in urban areas. Republicans held their national convention in Milwaukee in July and Trump has made four previous stops to the state, most recently just last week in the western Wisconsin city of La Crosse. Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, last month filled the same Milwaukee arena where Republicans held their national convention for a rally that coincided with the Democratic National Convention just 90 miles away in Chicago. Walz returned Monday to Milwaukee, where he spoke at a Labor Day rally organized by unions. ___ Bauer reported from Madison.

Smikle told Newsweek on Saturday that the Cheney family's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris gives Republicans and independents \"permission\" to vote for the Democratic presidential nominee.This week, Harris scored the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney. Both devout conservatives, Dick and Liz Cheney have been critical of former President Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, especially after his supporters laid siege to the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. In their separate endorsements, Dick and Liz Cheney called Trump a \"threat\" and a \"danger,\" respectively.In an email to Newsweek on Saturday afternoon, Smikle, an MSNBC political analyst and part-time lecturer of international and public affairs at Columbia University, said, \"The Cheney endorsements help provide that permission structure for Republicans and independents who may have stayed home to come out and vote for her.\"Smikle said that campaigns are additive, meaning that they try to gain voters rather than \"reduce support by doubling down on polarizing ideology. Harris is moving to the middle to capture more voters.\"\"Her campaign realized that they need to appear cohesive, focused, and forward-thinking with inspirational and aspirational messages about opportunities in a Democratic administration,\" Smikle added.When reached for comment by Newsweek on Saturday afternoon, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said via email, \"Who's Basil A. Smikle?\"On Wednesday, Liz Cheney said in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, \"Because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.\"\"In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Dick Cheney said in a statement on Friday. \"He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.\"Newsweek reached out to Liz Cheney for comment and the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation where Dick Cheney is a trustee for comment from him via email on Saturday afternoon.On January 6, 2021, Trump's violent mob of supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's 2020 election victory following repeated claims from Trump that the election was stolen from him via widespread voter fraud. There is no evidence to support such claims.The former president faces four felonies for his alleged actions to subvert the 2020 election and over 1,488 people have been charged for their alleged actions on January 6. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and claims the case is politically motivated.Liz Cheney, who served Wyoming's at-large district from 2017 to 2023 and was third in GOP House leadership, was at the Capitol when the insurrection occurred and served as one of only two Republicans on the House select committee tasked with investigating the events surrounding that day.Trump attacked the Cheney family following their endorsement of Harris in a social media post on his platform Truth Social.\"Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO [Republican in name only], along with his daughter, who lost by the largest margin in the History of Congressional Races!\" the former president wrote on Friday.Liz Cheney lost her GOP primary in Wyoming to Trump-backed candidate Harriet Hageman in 2022. The loss marked the second-worst defeat for a House incumbent in 60 years and was not \"the largest margin in the History of Congressional Races\" as Trump claimed.Trump continued in his Truth Social post: \"He's the King of Endless, Nonsensical Wars, wasting Lives and Trillions of Dollars, just like Comrade Kamala Harris. I am the Peace President, and only I will stop World War III!\"Dick Cheney was vilified by Democrats in the past over the George W. Bush administration's handling of the post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Trump wrote on Friday that Liz Cheney's actions \"with the Unselect Committee of Political Losers is unthinkable,\" and accused the bipartisan panel of lawmakers of deleting evidence related to the investigation, despite there being no evidence of such claims and members of the committee pushing back on his claims.Smikle told Newsweek on Saturday that Trump's campaign strategy \"has been to double down on rather antiquated, if not belligerent, views toward women and resurrected racial and gendered critiques of black women in particular in positions of power.\"He added: \"Those actions, even among Republicans that may be inclined to vote for him, don't traditionally entice exponentially more voters to run to the polls or speak with intensity about their support. He'll certainly have his base, but growth is another story.\"","summary":"Dick and Liz Cheney's endorsement of Harris helped her with Republican and independent voters, Dr. Basil A.

Hossein Salami, chief commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), made the remarks on Saturday during a meeting in the capital Tehran between Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and commanders of the Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters, an Iranian firm controlled by the IRGC. He was detailing a maritime battle between Iran and Israel that occurred sometime after the reimposition of US sanctions on Tehran in 2018, though he did not specify the exact dates of the battle or related events, Xinhua news agency reported. According to Salami, Israel hit 14 Iranian ships to disrupt Iran’s oil exports. “Initially, we did not realise who or which country was targeting the ships, but we eventually found out that it was Israel that had done it in a secretive and vague manner.” “North of the Indian Ocean and in different places, we hit 12 Israeli ships. After hitting the fifth vessel, they raised their hands in surrender and said they would cease the war between the ships,” he said. “When we struck (captured) the fifth Israeli ship, they raised their hands (in surrender) and agreed to cease the naval confrontation,” Salami said during a visit to the Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters. “They targeted 14 of our ships to prevent our oil from being exported. We didn’t know who was behind it at first because it was done so covertly, but we eventually figured it out: the Zionist regime. We targeted 12 of their ships, and when we had the fifth, they raised their hands (in surrender) and declared the naval confrontation over.” He further said, “The British seized our ship in Gibraltar, and we seized the Stena Impero ship in exchange, prompting their surrender. They seized two of our ships in Greece, we took two of theirs, and they eventually surrendered.” General Salami reflected on the past six years, marked by sanctions, the Covid-19 pandemic, and political isolation attempts. “Our enemy placed us at the crossroads of sanctions, the Covid-19 pandemic, (former US President Donald) Trump (who was no less harmful than Covid-19), the threat of military operations, and pressure for political isolation,” Salami said, recounting challenges such as the assassination of Lietenant General Qassem Soleimani and the impact of economic sanctions. “They tried to politically isolate us. We needed to create deterrence against these threats in multiple directions. First, we needed to secure the shipping lanes. When the Americans attempted to seize one of our ships, our forces prevented it, and the Americans were left humiliated. Following this, the enforcement of sanctions began to deteriorate,” he added. Additionally, he praised the IRGC’s success in countering extremist threats abroad and safeguarding Iranian oil tankers, noting that American threats failed to materialise after the IRGC simulated an operation to capture a US tanker. “We succeeded in closing off all the paths the enemy had opened against us, and today the safest shipping routes are those used by Iranian ships. The Americans threatened to seize two of our oil tankers as they headed to Venezuela. I went out with General Tangsiri and simulated an operation to capture an American tanker, which we announced over the radio. When the Americans saw this, our tankers arrived safely,” he said. –IANS int/khz","summary":"Tehran, Sep 8 (IANS) A top Iranian military commander has said his country had, some time ago, hit 12 Israeli vessels north of the Indian Ocean and elsewhere in response to Israel&#8217;s attacks on 14 Iranian ships, according to state media.

There’s a stage and replica TV lighting and an adviser in full Lee Strasberg method-acting mode, not just playing Donald Trump but inhabiting him, wearing a boxy suit and a long tie. The former president’s preparations are more improv. They are pointedly called not “debate prep” but “policy time,” meant to refresh him on his record. Nobody is playing Harris; sometimes his aides sit at a long table opposite him and bat questions back and forth, or other times he pulls up a chair closer to them. Trump has held just a handful of sessions so far, interrupting one at his Las Vegas hotel so he and his advisers could go up to his suite to watch Harris’ convention speech. While the two camps’ preparations for the big night in Philadelphia could not be more different, both sides view the debate the same way, according to interviews with nearly two dozen people close to the candidates, many of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss the private preparations. The Harris and Trump teams see it as a crucial moment to define Harris for millions of swing voters who know what they think about Trump but are still curious about her. Bringing out Trump’s most self-destructive instincts is a priority for Harris, as is coming across as coolheaded and presidential. “She should not be baited, she should bait him,” Hillary Clinton, the last woman to debate Trump, said in an interview Thursday. “When I said he was a Russian puppet, he just sputtered onstage. I think that’s an example of how you get out a fact about him that really unnerves him.” In Trump’s debate prep sessions, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has embraced the role of posing tough questions to Trump, including on uncomfortable subjects like his criminal convictions, according to a person with knowledge of the gatherings. Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic member of Congress from Hawaii who memorably attacked Harris in a 2019 presidential primary debate, has also been helping Trump prepare. Trump’s advisers are acutely aware of the risk that he could appear overly aggressive, as he did in his first, disastrous debate with Joe Biden in 2020, when the COVID-infected Trump sweated profusely and incessantly interrupted his rival. Trump advisers worry that he will not be able to stop himself from showing his deep contempt for Harris or from seeming to lecture a female opponent. While he respected Clinton as “smart” and a hard worker, Trump believes that Harris is unintelligent, advisers and allies say. In private, he uses misogynistic language to describe her and gossips about her past romantic relationships, including with Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco. The former president’s allies and advisers have urged him to be “happy Trump” in the debate rather than “mean, bully Trump,” as one close ally put it, while pressing a policy-based case against Harris. There are risks to that approach as well: One ally warned that if Trump tried to stay on his best behavior, he could overcorrect and come across as “low energy.” The Trump team also expects him to face tough questions about abortion, a topic on which he has been all over the map in recent weeks, appearing uncertain about how to position himself. The Trump camp has a straightforward goal for the debate: to force Harris both to own her partnership with the unpopular Biden and to take responsibility for the parts of his presidency that voters are unhappiest about. Trump has focused in particular on the high cost of living; chaos around the world, especially in Ukraine and the Middle East; public safety; and immigration. “You can’t ‘turn the page’ when you’re singularly responsible for the current economic and border nightmare our country is living through,” Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, said when asked about the campaign’s debate strategy. Trump’s aides hope he can create his own version of Ronald Reagan’s famous moment in his 1980 debate against President Jimmy Carter, when Reagan asked television viewers whether they felt better off now than before Carter took office. Harris has also telegraphed how she plans to go after Trump. Unlike Biden, she has not focused squarely on portraying the former president as a fundamental threat to American democracy. She has tried to minimize him as a stale old act who is repeating his same tired playbook. And she has painted him as a rich guy who cares only about helping other rich guys — a populist line of attack that resonates with voters in focus groups. Harris has also ditched Clinton’s unsuccessful strategy of denouncing Trump as a racist and a misogynist. The vice president’s aides believe it’s a waste of time to tell voters what a terrible person Trump is, given how hard it is to find a voter who does not already have a fixed view of his character — good or bad. Instead, Harris is trying to connect with the thin slice of undecided voters who feel sour about the economy and worried about the future, and who want to hear what each candidate will do to improve their lives. Harris and those advising her understand that the debate will be a race to define herself and her political brand before Trump can. And despite all the noise in liberal circles that Trump is torpedoing his campaign with his undisciplined behavior, Harris and the people ensconced in the hotel with her are not underestimating him. One challenge for Harris is that Trump, who clashed onstage with Biden in June, has more recent debate experience than the vice president has. She must try to shake off the rust while anticipating what it will be like to stand feet away from someone she has never met but who has attacked her policies, her political past and even her racial identity. Harris is preparing for attacks on her race and her political and personal relationships. Harris’ sessions, at the Omni William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, have been led by Karen Dunn, a Democratic lawyer who also helped Clinton prepare for debates. Dunn’s co-pilot is Rohini Kosoglu, Harris’ former domestic policy adviser and Senate chief of staff. A few others with whom Harris feels comfortable, and who can be trusted to deliver tough feedback, have joined the sessions, people briefed on the process said. They include Sean Clegg, a political consultant who was a lead strategist on Harris’ 2020 campaign. Clegg’s talent, people who work with him say, is that he knows Harris well enough that he can encourage her to speak in a way that is accessible; if he hears something that sounds too dense, he will flag it for her. Philippe Reines, a former aide to Clinton, is reprising his 2016 role as Trump. The Trump team held a three-hour debate prep session Tuesday at his private club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Additional sessions are planned for Sunday and Monday. When Gaetz was asked about the preparations, he stayed on message. “President Trump doesn’t do debate prep,” he texted on Friday. “He regularly assembles advisors to talk about how he will secure the border, lower prices and stop the global chaos caused by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. Just another day at Mar-a-Lago!” In fact, Trump has done more work preparing for the 2024 debates than he ever did in 2016 and 2020. He has been briefed on Harris’ past debate performances and her verbal tics. He remembers well her viral moment in 2020 when she debated Vice President Mike Pence and cut off his attempted interruption by saying, “I’m speaking.” Referring to that exchange, Trump has privately told associates, “I’m not going to let her do to me what she did to Mike.” He was happy to let his advisers negotiate the muting of microphones when the candidates are not talking. (Harris’ team had been pushing for microphones to be unmuted, hoping that Trump would talk obnoxiously over her and give her an opening for a snappy riposte.) The two candidates will debate without a live audience, from behind lecterns. In private, Trump has toyed repeatedly with dropping out of the debate, which is being hosted by ABC News, one of his least favorite networks. (No other debates are scheduled yet.) He has ranted about what he claims is its unfairness toward him and has proposed debates on other networks. He has particular hatred for ABC’s star anchor George Stephanopoulos, whom he nicknamed “Slopadopoulos.” Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against Stephanopoulos this year over an interview related to one of the former president’s court cases, and in discussions about the debate, Trump’s advisers told ABC he would not consent to one moderated by Stephanopoulos. Trump has also complained about another ABC News reporter, Rachel Scott, who asked him pointed questions at a recent conference of Black journalists, during which he questioned Harris’ racial identity. (The debate hosts ended up being ABC News’ David Muir and Linsey Davis.) Ultimately, Trump concluded that the downsides of skipping the debate — especially the appearance of weakness — outweighed his concerns about attending. He has told associates that he has a good relationship with Muir and is comfortable with his selection as one of the debate hosts. ——— This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is holed up for five days in a Pittsburgh hotel, doing highly choreographed debate practice sessions before Tuesday night&#8217;s clash.

August 26 marked three years since the Abbey Gate suicide bombing attack outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, which killed 13 U.S. service members, injured 18 others, and killed about 170 Afghans. During a speech in Detroit marking the day, Trump placed the blame for the “humiliation in Afghanistan” on both Harris and Mr. Biden. In a response first shared with CBS News, Harris’ campaign is using Trump’s announcement, and abrupt cancellation, five years ago of a meeting at Camp David with Taliban leaders, to highlight the role his deal with the Taliban played in the withdrawal. The campaign argues that Trump’s deal created a “virtually impossible” deadline and left “the Biden-Harris administration with zero plans for an orderly withdrawal — only a dangerous, costly mess.” “Trump shamelessly attacks the vice president because he hopes he can trick the country into forgetting that his own actions put troops in harm’s way,” Harris campaign national security spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein told CBS News. “Trump wanted to bring the Taliban to Camp David just days before September 11th—think about that. He cut a bad deal with the very same people who violently took over Afghanistan and led to the collapse of the Afghan government.” On Sept. 7, 2019, Trump tweeted that a meeting with the Taliban was canceled after a U.S. soldier was killed in an attack by the terrorist group. Months later, in February 2020, Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban to pave the way for a significant drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan by the end of that year, in exchange for guarantees from the Taliban that the country would not be used for terrorist activities. However, Taliban attacks on Afghan forces continued. Trump’s former national security adviser H.R. McMaster called the deal a “surrender agreement with the Taliban” during a podcast interview. CBS News has reached out to the Trump campaign for a response to the Harris campaign’s criticism. The attack at the Kabul airport happened during the effort by Mr. Biden to evacuate American soldiers and Afghans out of Afghanistan, part of a longtime goal shared by him and Trump to officially end the long-running war. House Republicans are currently investigating the Biden administration’s withdrawal. Mr. Biden panned Trump’s Taliban deal, but followed through with it, extending the withdrawal deadline by a couple of months to have troops out by Sept. 11, 2021, to avoid further military escalation in the country. “It is perhaps not what I would have negotiated myself but it was an agreement made by the United States government, and that means something,” Mr. Biden said in April 2021. A plurality of respondents in an August 2021 CBS News poll believed the removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan went “very badly,” and the moment began a steady decline of Mr. Biden’s approval rating. In recent weeks, Trump has leaned into more criticism of Mr. Biden and Harris over the attack and the withdrawal. In late August, Trump was invited to the Arlington National Cemetery by family members of some service members for a wreath-laying ceremony. The visit was overshadowed by an altercation between a cemetery employee and Trump’s campaign over the presence of a campaign photographer, which the families granted permission for access but the cemetery’s federal law prohibits. During a speech at the National Guard Association conference in Detroit later that day, Trump called on the resignations of Biden administration officials involved in the withdrawal. “It’s not even believable how stupid these people were, to allow this to happen to our country. And we became a laughing stock all over the world, and we buried 13 soldiers,” he added. In a statement that day, Harris reaffirmed her support for Mr. Biden’s decision to end the war and wrote that the 13 deceased service members “represent the best of America, putting our beloved nation and their fellow Americans above themselves and deploying into danger to keep their fellow citizens safe.” Before becoming vice president, Harris had supported a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and an end to the war. In April 2021, she said she was the last person Mr. Biden consulted with before the president decided to withdraw all remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan. As the chaotic withdrawal unfolded in August 2021, Harris emphasized the focus on evacuating American citizens and Afghans working with the U.S. “There’s no question there will be and should be a robust analysis of what has happened,” she said during a trip to Singapore in 2021. contributed to this report.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; campaign is rehashing former President Donald Trump&#8217;s 2020 deal with the Taliban, as the Republican nominee has repeatedly criticized her for the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan during President Biden&#8217;s first year in office.  August 26 marked three years since the Abbey Gate suicide bombing attack outside the Hamid &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Harris campaign hits Trump on 2020 Taliban deal in response to his criticism of Afghanistan withdrawal appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/harris-campaign-hits-trump-on-2020-taliban-deal-in-response-to-his-criticism-of-afghanistan-withdrawal/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/07/5d6eef36-20c4-4aa1-8490-8f2ece67f713/thumbnail/1200x630/7cacdc7e986d44c166043ef9325f4f21/trump-kamala-getty.jpg?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-07 21:25:37","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":255886062,"title":"Tight race for control of Congress could be decided by just a handful of campaigns","text":"The race for control of Congress is as close as ever, with barely two dozen House seats and a handful in the Senate likely to determine the majority this November and whether a single party sweeps to power with the White House. Lawmakers are returning to Washington for a three-week legislative sprint, away from the campaign trail where races have become “trench warfare” and a seat-by-seat slog. Many of the highest-profile races are being waged in Montana, New York, California and beyond, far from the presidential battleground states contested by Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. “Buckle up,” said Jack Pandol, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Upended by the summer shake-up that replaced President Joe Biden with Harris atop the Democratic ticket, the down-ballot campaigns enter this fall stretch at a virtual toss-up, a high-wire uncertainty where every single seat won or lost could make the difference in party control. What's changed is not so much the fundamentals of the individual races, but which side has the energy and enthusiasm to make sure their voters actually show up and cast their ballots, strategists said. Money, volunteers and voter enthusiasm are flowing to the Democratic campaigns since Harris replaced Biden. That's challenging Republicans who entered the election cycle favored for gains and buoyed by Trump’s comeback bid, despite the criminal charges hanging over his potential return to the White House. Trump and Republicans are working feverishly to regain the momentum they enjoyed from the GOP convention in Milwaukee and from the Supreme Court decision giving former presidents broad immunity from prosecution, including for some acts related to his effort to overturn the 2020 election and for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Trump’s campaign staff held a private conference call Friday with House Republicans, assuring them that the movement is shifting to Trump as they game out strategies ahead, according to another Republican who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed conversation. “There’s a lot of handwringing going on and a lot of anxiousness about where this election is headed,” said Montana Sen. Steve Daines, a Trump ally who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm. Speaking at the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas, Daines played up GOP Senate candidates as warriors and predicted that enthusiasm from rural voters who will “crawl over broken glass” to vote for Trump will help Republicans such as Sam Brown, who is challenging Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev. Still, the fundraising gap Republicans now find themselves facing with Democrats is a problem, say GOP strategists on both ends of the Capitol, leaving them without money to keep pace with advertising and on-the-ground organizing. “We have a lot of work to do,” Daines said. Long gone are the days of supermajorities in the House and Senate, replaced by a new era of razor-thin margins that leave little margin for errors in political campaigns, or actual governing. Democrats are almost certain to see their narrow majority slip to at least a 50-50 split with Republicans with the retirement of independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. His departure is making way for Republican Gov. Jim Justice to handily win that seat. Trump is wildly popular in Montana, where Senate Republicans see their best chance to go on offense as they challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. But Tester is also a popular figure in the Big Sky state, where a whopping $238 million-plus is being spent on ads. Senate Republicans had the advantage this this cycle, with few incumbents to protect, allowing them to challenge Democrats with handpicked, often wealthy recruits in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. Democrats have only more recently gone on offense in long-shot races against Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida. But incumbents often bring longevity and name recognition to the race, making them tough to topple, as is the case in Pennsylvania, where Democrat Sen. Bob Casey is being challenged by Republican Dave McCormick, and in Ohio, where Sen. Sherrod Brown is running a playful cookie-eating television ad as he faces Republican Bernie Moreno. For the open seat in Democratic-heavy Maryland, the state’s popular former Republican governor, Larry Hogan, who was courted to run by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, is in a tough matchup against county executive Angela Alsobrooks. She would make history as one of the few Black women elected to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has predicted Democrats will keep their majority. In a Senate split, majority control goes to the party in the White House because the vice president can cast deciding votes. “Democrats have never been in a stronger position to defend our Senate majority,\" said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has crisscrossed the country this summer in some 20 states as what he calls an “ambassador of hope” in his party's quest to save its razor-thin majority. The Republicans are trying to protect 18 Republicans in Democratic-heavy congressional districts where Biden had won, particularly in coastal New York and California, and going on offense to challenge Democrats elsewhere. But House Democrats, whose campaign chairwoman, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state was among those who spoke privately to Biden about the potential down-ballot drag as he weighed his decision to exit the race, are benefiting from the Harris momentum. Democrats are working to protect their own most embattled House lawmakers, a handful of pragmatic legislators including Marcy Kaptur in Ohio, Matt Cartwright in Pennsylvania and a trio of younger lawmakers who lead the centrist Blue Dog coalition — Mary Peltola of Alaska, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state and Jared Golden of Maine. Each faces a notable Republican: Nick Begich, from an Alaskan political family; Washington's Trump-endorsed Joe Kent; and former NASCAR driver Austin Theriault in Maine. Republicans have gone to great lengths to diversify their own ranks of what just a few years ago, remained a party of mostly white men, and few women. The 2018 election, for example, left about a about a dozen Republican women and no Black Republicans in the House. GOP Rep. Richard Hudson, chairman of the NRCC, said House Republicans are “right where we expected to be,” acknowledging it’s a “trench warfare” fight. Because many of the House races are being contested so far from the presidential battlegrounds, candidates are being forced to stand up their own operations along with the congressional committees to turn out the vote. House Democrats are seeing an organic flow of volunteers mobilized, having knocked on more than 377,000 doors and made more than 845,000 phone calls in August, greater than in the previous three months combined, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said. House Republicans have propped up dozens of “Battle Stations” for voter outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, particularly areas without Trump’s campaign infrastructure, and also report crowds of enthusiastic voters at events as Johnson traveled the country in the contested regions. Fundraising remains imbalanced as Democrats are outpacing Republicans with Harris atop the ticket, and Republicans are sounding alarms to their own donors to get off the sidelines. “We are on track to flip the Senate,\" said Jason Thielman, executive director of the NRSC. But he said the Democrats' “massive cash advantage is a real problem. The biggest thing preventing Senate Republicans from having a great night in November is the cash crunch.” Both the DSCC and DSCC posted record online fundraising in the days after Harris' campaign announcement and her team sent $25 million to down-ballot races, including $10 million each this past week to the House and Senate committees. DCCC Spokesperson Viet Shelton said grassroots enthusiasm to elect a Democratic House majority is \"at an all-time high.” He said voters want to elect “get-stuff-done incumbents” not a “rag-tag group\" of Republican candidates aligned with Trump.
