Employees in key services like law enforcement would have continued working but would only have been paid once government functions were back up.\n\nMany parks, monuments and national sites would have closed at a time when millions of visitors are expected.\n\n Musk: unelected, but influential\n\nLawmakers avoided all that holiday-season pain by funding the government until March 14 in a package that includes $110 billion in disaster aid and financial relief for farmers.\n\nBut stripped from the original funding bill were pharmaceutical reforms, congressional pay raises and tightened restrictions on US investments in China — the removal of which some Democrats tied directly to Musk, the CEO of Tesla.\n\n“Musk’s ties to China and Tesla’s significant investments in the country raise significant questions as to why he urged House Republican leadership walking away” from the original bipartisan deal, Representative Rosa DeLauro said in a letter to congressional leadership.\n\nThe influence of Musk, the world’s richest man, over the Republicans — and his apparent sway with Trump — has become a focus for Democratic attack, with questions raised over how an unelected citizen can wield so much power.\n\nThere is growing anger even among Republicans over Musk’s interference after he trashed the original funding agreement in a blizzard of posts — many of them wildly inaccurate — on his social media platform X.\n\n“Last time I checked, Elon Musk doesn’t have a vote in Congress,” Georgia House Republican Rich McCormick told CNN.\n\n“Now, he has influence, and he’ll put pressure on us to do whatever he thinks the right thing is for him. But I have 760,000 people that voted for me to do the right thing for them.”\n\nTrump had been clear that he was willing to see a shutdown if he did not get his way, and the passage of funding legislation without his priorities included demonstrated that even his great influence over Republicans in Congress has limits.\n\nBut Johnson put a positive sheen on events, telling reporters after the House passed the funding package that January, when Trump returns to office, would mark a “sea change” in Washington.\n\n“President Trump will return to DC and to the White House, and we will have Republican control of the Senate and the House,” Johnson told reporters. “Things are going to be very different around here.”","url":"https://www.channelstv.com/2024/12/21/biden-signs-funding-bill-to-avert-government-shutdown/","image":"//www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-22 01:00:23","author":"Donatus Anichukwueze","authors":["Donatus Anichukwueze"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.673},{"id":275194674,"title":"Trump taps The Apprentice producer for UK envoy job","text":"Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with The Apprentice, is being tapped by the US president-elect to be a special envoy to the United Kingdom. \"With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,\" Trump announced on Saturday.

Russia! Russia!” hoax and other drummed-up scandals. \n\nTheir distorted coverage played a major role in the 2020 election. \n\nThey weren’t fairly and accurately holding Trump accountable — they were using all their power and tools to swing the election to Biden. \n\nThey had a major assist from the FBI and the Big Tech companies, who worked together to keep the public in the dark about Hunter Biden reaping millions by selling connections to his father to foreign businesses and governments. \n\nRecall that 51 former intelligence officers signed the infamous letter saying the damning evidence on Hunter’s laptop had the earmarks of Russian disinformation. \n\nMost of them knew better because the FBI already had authenticated the laptop’s hard drive’s contents, but they, too, were willing to sell their credibility to help defeat Trump. \n\nAnd with Trump set to enter the Oval Office again, the war against him is already raging. \n\nFresh off a campaign where they supported the flimsy criminal cases brought by Biden’s Department of Justice and state prosecutors in New York and Georgia, and where they did all they could to push Kamala Harris into the Oval Office, the media coverage of Trump’s second term is shaping up to be as nasty and negative as the first. \n\nDon under microscope \n\nEverything he says and does is viewed through the claim that his motives are selfish or even diabolical.\n\nThey preen endlessly about what they claim is his plan for revenge and retribution, describe him as vindictive and warn that he plans an assault on the First Amendment. \n\nA constant thread is the claim to have insights into his mind, as if the media are trained psychiatrists making a diagnosis. \n\nAlthough public resistance to Trump is not nearly as feverish as it was before his first term and the Dems’ slurs that he is the new Hitler have disappeared, there is no sign that the media intends to cover him more fairly. \n\nIn fact, the fear-mongering tone employed against Trump remains remarkable compared towith the soft-glove, see-no-evil coverage of Biden. \n\nThe world is in flames, the nation is angrily divided, the failing president and the daffy vice president are in hiding–and yet Trump is the problem. \n\nThe distortion reflects prejudice and ignorance. \n\nThe far-left orientation of most journalists and their outlets echoes the radical indoctrination dished out in elite colleges. \n\nEditors used to provide a counterweight by having a knowledge of history and by insisting on standards of fairness, but those standards were abandoned soon after Trump entered the 2016 race. \n\nThe media landscape now is dominated by leftist advocacy while opposing views, whether conservative or centrist, are considered heresy. \n\nOne effect is the lack of interest in Biden’s mental decline and in learning who is filling the vacuum in the Oval Office. \n\nAnother effect is the requirement to hate Trump and his supporters. \n\nSo here we go again because many people infected with both traits masquerade as journalists.","summary":"There are media bombshells and then there is The Wall Street Journal report that Joe Biden is so mentally diminished that aides have isolated him to hide his decline from the public and even key members of his administration.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/12/21/opinion/michael-goodwin-white-house-aides-were-hiding-bidens-mental-decline-but-we-all-saw-it-in-plain-sight/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/jbh1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-22 00:54:46","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":275192446,"title":"Capehart on Funding Bill: Why Should Biden Get Involved In A Republican-on-Republican Food Fight Melee?","text":"Back to Videos\n\n Capehart on Funding Bill: Why Should Biden Get Involved In A Republican-on-Republican Food Fight Melee?\n\n | \n\n Posted By Ian Schwartz\n On Date December 21, 2024\n \n\nPBS NEWSHOUR: New York Times columnist David Brooks and Washington Post associate editor Jonathan Capehart join Geoff Bennett to discuss the week in politics, including yet another chaotic, down-to-the-wire funding battle in Congress, how President-elect Trump will govern during his second term and the political influence of Elon Musk.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT, PBS NEWSHOUR: Jonathan, where was President Biden in all of this?

And he says he wants to embark upon this mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. That's going to take coordinating with Congress to a certain degree.\n\nDAVID BROOKS, NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, again, it's reality.\n\nFirst on Elon Musk, Donald Trump's been against the debt ceiling for a long time. He didn't need Elon Musk to tell him that. As for Elon Musk, this bromance is going to end in tears. We're all \u0014 I give it 30 days, maybe 60 days, something like that. We're all going to be crying as they part ways and they start taking shots at each other.\n\nI don't expect Elon Musk to be around for very long, but presidents get to advisers. And if Elon Musk can do some good, then maybe he can do some good. I mean, one of the things that even Democrats are saying is that they missed the chance when they were in office to reform government. If you're trying to improve the Medicare, if you're trying to improve the delivery of veteran services, there are government rules and regulations that impinge and block you from actually improving the way government works.\n\nAnd sensible Democrats know that and they should have done something about it. If Elon Musk, some billionaire, walks in and can reform some of the rules that are impinging the way the government works, all to it. I don't expect that to happen, but what I expect is that Donald Trump has some right instincts about immigration, about reforming government, but he does not know anything about the reality of governance.\n\nAnd so my posture right now is let's let him try. He's got some instincts that are terrible and some instincts that are not terrible. And let's let him try. But change in government is just phenomenally hard. And you have to really know what you're doing. And neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk really knows how the game is played.\n\nBrainberriesWant To Get Rid Of Your Tattoo?

ensuring that federal government funding will continue through mid-March, the New York Times reported.The 85-to-11 vote came shortly after the midnight deadline, preventing a potential government shutdown that would have disrupted services and services just before the holidays.The bill, which was also approved earlier in the House, provides USD 100 billion in disaster relief for communities still recovering from storms, while delaying major budget decisions until 2025, when the incoming Republican-controlled Congress will take office.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, described the measure as a compromise that avoided a crisis but still included key provisions for American families. \"Though this bill does not include everything Democrats fought for, there are major victories in this bill for American families,\" Schumer said.He pointed to the inclusion of \"emergency aid for communities battered by natural disasters\" and the prevention of \"draconian cuts\" to government programs as notable achievements. The legislation also extends farm programs for one year and includes USD 10 billion in direct aid for farmers.The bill's passage brought an end to several days of turmoil over the looming shutdown, which had become a focal point of partisan disagreement. President Biden signed the bill into law soon after it passed in the Senate, ensuring that the government would remain funded despite the past week's chaotic political battles.Earlier in the week, tensions had risen when House Republicans initially included a provision to suspend the federal debt limit in the proposed funding bill. However, this provision was ultimately removed after pushback from Republican lawmakers, leading to a major defeat on the House floor, reported the New York Times.Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who had been in communication with President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk about the negotiations, confirmed that both men were aware of the direction the discussions were taking. \"He knew exactly what we were doing and why,\" Johnson said of Trump. \"This is a good outcome for the country.\"The bill, while providing short-term funding, did not address the contentious issue of the federal debt ceiling, which has been a point of contention among Republicans.With the debt ceiling issue unresolved, Republicans have signalled their intention to address it in early 2025 through a separate legislative package, along with other budgetary concerns. \"House Republicans agree to raise the debt limit by USD 1.5 trillion in the first reconciliation package, with an agreement that we will cut USD 2.5 trillion in net mandatory spending in the reconciliation process,\" Republican leadership stated in a proposal, as per the New York Times.Despite the last-minute compromises, the passage of the bill highlighted ongoing divisions within the Republican Party, as well as between the two chambers of Congress. While the Senate passed the measure with relative ease, the House had faced significant opposition from both sides of the aisle. Democrats, despite dissatisfaction with the final version, supported the bill to avoid a shutdown and potential economic turmoil.\"House Democrats have successfully stopped extreme MAGA Republicans from shutting down the government, crashing the economy and hurting working-class Americans all across the land,\" said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader.\"House Democrats have successfully stopped the billionaire boys' club, which wanted a USD 4 trillion blank check by suspending the debt ceiling.\" (ANI) \n\n US Congress approves spending extension, avoiding shutdownUS Congress approves spending extension, avoiding shutdownANI 22nd December 2024, 09:55 GMT+11Washington [US], December 22 (ANI): The US Senate passed a spending measure early on Saturday, ensuring that federal government funding will continue through mid-March, the New York Times reported.The 85-to-11 vote came shortly after the midnight deadline, preventing a potential government shutdown that would have disrupted services and services just before the holidays.The bill, which was also approved earlier in the House, provides USD 100 billion in disaster relief for communities still recovering from storms, while delaying major budget decisions until 2025, when the incoming Republican-controlled Congress will take office.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, described the measure as a compromise that avoided a crisis but still included key provisions for American families. \"Though this bill does not include everything Democrats fought for, there are major victories in this bill for American families,\" Schumer said.He pointed to the inclusion of \"emergency aid for communities battered by natural disasters\" and the prevention of \"draconian cuts\" to government programs as notable achievements.

The Kennedys And The Women They Destroyed by Maureen Callahan (Mudlark £25, 400pp)\n\nThe Kennedy family motto was a macho one – ‘move forward, stop feeling sorry for yourself, life is for the living.’ And the men did so, screwing around at will, trampling over the women in their lives with a breathtaking carelessness and selfishness, dismissing them, in the word used by US journalist Maureen Callahan in this hard-hitting and disturbing book, as ‘afterthoughts’.\n\nShe starts from a heartfelt premise. ‘Kennedy men have been lionised for nearly a century, but the women they’ve broken, tormented, raped, murdered or left for dead have never really been part of their legacy. They must be. They are an important piece of American history hiding in plain sight.’\n\nAll the familiar names are there, their inside stories more fascinating than ever – widowed Jackie, poor Marilyn Monroe, for all their beauty and glamour both doubly misused, by one powerful, promiscuous brother after another, their devotion rewarded with betrayal. Mary Jo Kopechne was left to drown by a third brother thinking only of protecting his reputation. Wives like Joan and Ethel, married to Ted and Robert respectively, were forced not only to look the other way but to lie to protect their men from scrutiny.\n\nBut there are also some of the many little-known girls who flitted up the backstairs of the White House to service the rapacious, insatiable JFK – wham bam but not thank you mam encounters that lasted no more than three minutes. He would hurry off with scarcely a word. There wasn’t even kissing.\n\nNor has the pattern of bad behaviour stopped. The latest Kennedy in the public eye – Robert F. Jnr, Donald Trump’s nominee as his health secretary – was accused of being serially unfaithful to his second wife, who later killed herself. And yet, writes Callahan, ‘Camelot, that fairy tale of Kennedy greatness and noble men still stands. It’s time to do right by the women and girls by excising it.’\n\nThe Quality Of Love: Twin Sisters At The Heart Of The Century by Ariane Bankes (Duckworth £18.99, 288pp)\n\nThe French author Albert Camus, a titan of 20th-century literature, wrote, ‘When one has had the good luck to love intensely, life is spent trying to recapture that ardour and that illumination.’ The woman who inspired such passion in him was Mamaine Paget, very much an English rose, beautiful, clever, accomplished – and, unfortunately for Camus, married to the tempestuous (and often tyrannical) writer Arthur Koestler.\n\nA life among intellectuals and bohemians was not what had been intended for Mamaine and her identical twin Celia when they came out as debutantes in the 1930s, paraded in gossip columns as prospective brides for some stuffed shirt or other.\n\nThey opted instead for men of letters, and over the next two decades were key figures in an international milieu of artists, musicians and writers, hobnobbing with the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre while flitting between lovers and friends, objects of desire, lust, devotion, frustration. George Orwell – in the throes of writing 1984 – begged Celia to marry him but she turned him down.\n\nTheir spirited lives involved much socialising but also intense discussion about the big intellectual issues of the day, notably the evils of communism – all of which they recorded in fascinating detail in hundreds of letters to each other. Celia’s daughter Ariane Bankes found them in a tin trunk in the attic after her mother’s death, and from this private, intimate archive she has fashioned an enthralling insight into the intellectual life of Europe as it struggled to recover from the Second World War.\n\nShattered by Hanif Kureishi (Hamish Hamilton £18.99, 336pp)\n\nHe was a star novelist and screenwriter; he moved easily in celebrity, film and literary circles; he lived life to the full. Until Boxing Day two years ago.\n\nSitting on a chair, he felt dizzy, then toppled over and woke up in a pool of blood, his neck grotesquely twisted. Paralysed. Altered forever. Hanif Kureishi’s old independent life was gone and a new one – that of someone helpless, barely able to move his hands, his legs, any part of his body – had began.\n\nBut, as Kureishi points out early on in this truly jaw-dropping and agonising memoir, ‘As far as I can tell, my brain is unaffected and I can think as I did before’, and so he was able to deal with his ‘absurd’ situation – can this really be happening to me? – by recording every detail of his new existence, dictated in notes to members of his family. \n\nThe result of these hospital dispatches is a harrowing, explicit, troubling – and yet often witty and wry – journey into a nightmare world of total immobility and dependence on others.\n\nHis observations are pin-sharp: ‘I am experiencing a terrible Edgar Allan Poe feeling of being entombed in my own body.’\n\nEvery intimate detail is here. Unable to perform even the most basic bodily functions unaided and with all dignity and privacy gone, he laments: ‘Before my accident, nobody ever touched me. Now I am turned, rolled, prodded and poked constantly. How did I get from being a private man to a public piece of meat?’\n\nEvery emotion is here too – rage, denial, acceptance, envy, as in ‘I envy those who can scratch their own heads, tie their own shoelaces, pick up a cup of coffee.’\n\nUltimately, a sort of positivity prevails: ‘My world has taken a zig where it should have zagged; it has been smashed, remade and altered; and there is nothing I can do about it. But I will not go under: I will make something of this.’\n\nAnd he has, magnificently so.\n\nInside Out: The Extraordinary Legacy Of April Ashley by Douglas Thompson (Ad Lib £10.99, 240pp)\n\n‘Au revoir, monsieur’ was the last thing 25-year-old George Jamieson heard as the sex-change surgeon in a Casablanca clinic put him under.\n\nHe came round hours later to a cheery ‘Bonjour, madamoiselle’. April Ashley, now a woman not just in name but in genitalia, was born, taking on the sex they had craved since childhood.\n\nThere is no holding back here on the details of that operation, the sculpting of a vagina from a penis. It’s not for the squeamish. She was in serious pain for months.\n\nBut it ended the greater pain of being born all wrong, a woman inside a man’s body. That scalpel liberated her. ‘I knew the pinnacle of happiness, a joy beyond words.’\n\nThe life-changing op was in 1960, and though April was not the very first, she was a pioneer of transsexuality.\n\nStunning to look at, tall, slim, elegant, irresistibly attractive, April became a sought-after model, with every randy stud of Sixties London queuing to bed her. She could have slept with every one of The Beatles, she told her biographer, Douglas Thompson. ‘I regret turning down Paul McCartney.’\n\nBut the life she had made for herself was never without its downsides back then, and when a Sunday newspaper outed her with a top-model-born-a-boy scoop, her fashion career came to an abrupt end and the smart world that had fallen adoringly at her feet shunned her. She soldiered on, brave, determined, an icon. She wrote her own obituary, found among her papers after her death, aged 86, three years ago: ‘My story is about winning against the odds.’\n\nKingmaker by Sonia Purnell (Virago £25, 528pp)\n\nFew individuals can have lived life to the full as much as Pamela Churchill Harriman – full of extravagance, intrigue, power play and, above all, sex, lots of it.\n\nVamp extraordinaire, with her mesmerising eyes and come-hither laugh she had the uncanny ability to make whichever powerful politician or yacht-owning tycoon she was bedding feel he was the most important man in the world. Over five decades, they confided in her, and that made her not only the so-called ‘seductress of the century’ but also a player in world events, beginning in the Second World War when – encouraged by her father-in-law Winston Churchill – she set her cap at a top American envoy and their pillow talk helped secure that crucial alliance between the UK and the US.\n\nAnd it continued long after. As the Daily Mail wrote on her death in 1997: ‘When historians look back on the 20th century, they will find traces of Pamela Harriman’s lipstick all over it.’\n\nSome wrote off this daughter of minor English aristocracy as ‘that red-headed tart’, a schemer who would jump into bed with any big hitter she could exploit, and indeed her list of lovers ran into hundreds, making her truly a grande horizontale. But Sonia Purnell, drawing on newly discovered papers, private letters and diaries, paints a more nuanced picture, seeing her as an important and influential figure.\n\nYes, her life story is a terrific romp, and this biography an exhilarating read, a treasure trove of top-table gossip. But it also has historical significance. As an intimate of presidents and numerous other leaders, she was more than a mere courtesan.\n\nOnly Say Good Things: Surviving Playboy by Crystal Hefner (Ebury Spotlight £22, 240pp)\n\nSix months before the 91-year-old Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner died, he pressed his wife Crystal, 60 years his junior, ‘to only say good things about me’. She recalls: ‘I looked at him, so frail and weak and small lying in this big bed, and I swallowed down every part of me that wanted to say so much more. I promised.’\n\nNow, seven years after his death, the truth comes out. It was all tacky and exploitative, with Hefner, who touted himself as the world’s greatest lover, hopeless in bed.\n\nA 21-year-old model, Crystal had not only voluntarily but enthusiastically gone into the Playboy mansion, thrilled to be one of his cuties, believing that this would be the perfect life of extravagance and indulgence, luxury, glamour, sex. ‘Playboy was something I dreamed of being part of.’\n\nThe gloss – for that was all it was – didn’t last the first coupling between Hefner and her. ‘Here I was in Hugh Hefner’s bed with him inside me, beautiful naked women surrounding me and there was nothing sexy about it. So I pretended.’\n\nSeduced by all the trappings, she moved in permanently and, at the risk of being labelled a gold-digger, stayed for years, moving up the hierarchy to become his ‘main’ girlfriend and then his third wife.\n\nBut the mansion became a prison, where her every movement was monitored. When she tried to flee, Hefner ordered security to lock her in.\n\nMuch of her story is pretty tawdry, but there is a serious aspect to it, as gradually she saw through the myth Hefner had created that he was a sexual pioneer and visionary. ‘He was shallow. Everything he valued was skin-deep, his promise of sexual liberation always a lie, a glamorous mirage that turned out to be a trap.’ Hefner, she belatedly comes to realise, was a misogynist whose empire was built on sexualising women in a way that corrupted Western culture and caused irreparable damage to women’s rights. Not least hers.","summary":"It's been a year of deliciously salacious memoirs.

Then, on Saturday, the Daily Mail reported that Biden kept the families of the 13 U.S. service members who were killed during his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan waiting for three hours for the dignified transfer ceremony, while he was taking a nap in Air Force One on the tarmac.\n\nWe’re also starting to see prominent media figures admitting they failed to address Joe Biden’s cognitive decline during his presidency. \n\nFor example, former CNN host Chris Cillizza has now publicly apologized for not taking Biden’s health issues more seriously while he was still at the network. \n\n“As a reporter, I have a confession to make,” Cillizza said. \"I should have pushed harder earlier for more information about Joe Biden's mental and physical well-being and any signs of decline.\"\n\nCillizza admitted that while at CNN, he often dismissed Republican concerns about Biden’s cognitive decline, claiming there was a lack of “evidence.” He also confessed to taking the White House at its word and avoiding the issue out of fear of being accused of “age shaming” the president.\n\n“And I would sort of brush them off because what I would say is, ‘Well, there's no obvious evidence that he's declining. Yeah, he moves a little slower, he talks a little slower, but there's no evidence that he's declining.’ And, and the White House and the people around Joe Biden were absolutely adamant that suggesting anything, asking the question about whether he was in some physical, mental or both decline was offensive.”\n\nRecommended: New Bombshell Report Details Biden's Weaponization of Government\n\n“‘How could you?’ ‘It's age-shaming!’ And I think that impacted me at some level, because while I did ask the question from time to time of, you know, not directly the White House, but aides and people around in that orbit, I didn't really push on it, if I'm being honest.”\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t an apology—it’s an attempt to shift blame and dodge accountability for failing to do his job. Chris Cillizza is essentially admitting he knew better, but is excusing his inaction by claiming the White House pressured him into silence. Now, consider this for a moment. During Trump’s first term, how often did we see so-called journalists and “reputable” networks eagerly push the narrative that Trump was mentally unfit? They trotted out so-called experts desperate for attention, ready to back up these claims. Funny how concerns about “ageism” or sensitivity conveniently disappeared when the target was a Republican president, or how at the same time they were defending Joe Biden during his presidency, they were trying to balance questions about Biden’s mental fitness by claiming, without evidence, that Trump was similarly impaired.\n\nWith Biden’s presidency ending, admissions such as Cillizza’s come risk-free. The media ignored legitimate concerns, dismissed them as partisan, and shielded Biden from scrutiny. By the time his decline was undeniable, accountability was impossible. These late apologies don’t restore trust or fix the damage of a press focused on protecting Democrats over truth, instead paving the way for a renewed double standard at Americans’ expense.\n\nCillizza’s admission isn’t an isolated case—it’s part of a calculated effort by the media to rewrite the narrative. These exposés and so-called apologies aren’t about accountability; they’re about clearing the slate. \n\nBy acknowledging Biden’s cognitive decline now, the media conveniently positions itself to aggressively scrutinize Donald Trump’s mental health over the next four years, using these admissions as a pretext to claim they’ve learned their lesson.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2024/12/21/the-media-is-scrambling-to-justify-ignoring-bidens-cognitive-struggles-n4935346","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/267/cda9de37-8e7e-4209-bc91-a0e7e0a22a47.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 23:57:26","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.703},{"id":275188176,"title":"What Marla Maples Said About Being Blamed for 'Problems' in Trump and Ivana's Marriage: \"I Know...\"","text":"Marla Maples was the second wife of Donald Trump and her relationship with the former president was under the media microscope. Initially, their affair was hush-hush until it became public and she was labeled a \"mistress\" who broke a happy family. But in a throwback interview from the '90s, she defended herself saying, \"I am not the reason\" for their marital problems. \n\nThe Washington Post reported her interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's PrimeTime Live dealing with questions about her infamous romantic rendezvous with Trump. The complicated nature of their affair caused tensions between the then-couple following which the former real-estate mogul ended things with Maples. However, regardless, she was still smitten by him. Sawyer asked, \"You still love him?\" Maples replied, \"You know, I, I can't lie about it. Oh, I do. I do love him.\" The host then asked her about the controversial statement attributed to her about having 'the best sex' with Trump. But she dodged it, including the subsequent question regarding her marriage to the billionaire, saying, \"I'm taking my life day by day. ... I mean, who knows what life is going to bring in the future?\" Did Trump ever discuss marriage with Maples? Sawyer questioned. \"No,\" she replied,\" adding, \"He's, he's a friend. You know? He's -- he has a family, and that's number one to him, I know.\" \n\nBut, throughout the early days of their relationship, she was viewed as a homewrecker. Maples, who originally met Trump in 1987, discussed the public criticism on ABC News podcast Journeys of Faith with Paula Faris. \"I never considered myself a mistress. I mean, that's the truth.\" But since he was still married to his first wife Ivana and had three children, the future was full of roadblocks. \n\nHowever, she recalled Trump reassuring her parents, \"'I'm going to marry your daughter one day.' This, of course, wasn't a piece of cake. So Maples wanted God to intervene in her affairs, expecting things to go the way it was meant to be, \"Every step of the way, I was praying, 'God, please be in this. Please be in this. I do not want to be part of breaking anything up that has a chance,'\" referring to breaking up Trump's family with Ivana. \n\nBut, the press back then, continued to publish horrifying things about Maples which Trump \"hated\" following which she had go into hiding. In the 90s interview, she said that Trump had \"a lot of sympathy for how we've been besieged by this. He's very sorry. ... He's helped me to keep my head up high, you know.\" However, she persistently refused to accept her role as a homewrecker, citing, \"They've had a long marriage and, as Donald has said himself, 'People just grow apart.\" \n\nAfter months of media's relentless pursuit and Maples' temporary exile from the public eye, she finally tied the knot with Trump in December 1993. However, unfortunately, the marriage wasn't meant to last as the former couple ended things in June 1999. They had one daughter Tiffany Trump and today, decades after their split, Maples continued to support Trump in his political endeavors.","summary":"Throughout her relationship with Donald Trump, Marla Maples was viewed as a homewrecker who broke a happy family.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/what-marla-maples-said-about-being-blamed-for-problems-in-trump-and-ivanas-marriage-i-know","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/726670/uploads/aac669e0-bf7a-11ef-b9f5-1ff37c0b8673_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 23:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Juwairiya Shariq","authors":["INQUISITR","Juwairiya Shariq"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":275186726,"title":"Lara Trump No Longer in Running to Replace Marco Rubio","text":"What's NewLara Trump, the daughter-in-law of Donald Trump, has withdrawn her name from consideration to replace Florida Senator Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate once he resigns to undergo confirmation to become the president-elect's secretary of state.Newsweek reached out by email on Saturday evening to the Trump transition team for comment.What to KnowLara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, had been touted as the potential replacement for Rubio, whom Donald Trump has tapped to serve as secretary of state in his second administration.

The bill, which was also approved earlier in the House, provides USD 100 billion in disaster relief for communities still recovering from storms, while delaying major budget decisions until 2025, when the incoming Republican-controlled Congress will take office.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, described the measure as a compromise that avoided a crisis but still included key provisions for American families. \"Though this bill does not include everything Democrats fought for, there are major victories in this bill for American families,\" Schumer said. He pointed to the inclusion of \"emergency aid for communities battered by natural disasters\" and the prevention of \"draconian cuts\" to government programs as notable achievements. The legislation also extends farm programs for one year and includes USD 10 billion in direct aid for farmers.The bill's passage brought an end to several days of turmoil over the looming shutdown, which had become a focal point of partisan disagreement. President Biden signed the bill into law soon after it passed in the Senate, ensuring that the government would remain funded despite the past week's chaotic political battles.\n\nEarlier in the week, tensions had risen when House Republicans initially included a provision to suspend the federal debt limit in the proposed funding bill. However, this provision was ultimately removed after pushback from Republican lawmakers, leading to a major defeat on the House floor, reported the New York Times.Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who had been in communication with President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk about the negotiations, confirmed that both men were aware of the direction the discussions were taking. \"He knew exactly what we were doing and why,\" Johnson said of Trump. \"This is a good outcome for the country.\"The bill, while providing short-term funding, did not address the contentious issue of the federal debt ceiling, which has been a point of contention among Republicans. With the debt ceiling issue unresolved, Republicans have signalled their intention to address it in early 2025 through a separate legislative package, along with other budgetary concerns. \"House Republicans agree to raise the debt limit by USD 1.5 trillion in the first reconciliation package, with an agreement that we will cut USD 2.5 trillion in net mandatory spending in the reconciliation process,\" Republican leadership stated in a proposal, as per the New York Times.Despite the last-minute compromises, the passage of the bill highlighted ongoing divisions within the Republican Party, as well as between the two chambers of Congress. While the Senate passed the measure with relative ease, the House had faced significant opposition from both sides of the aisle. Democrats, despite dissatisfaction with the final version, supported the bill to avoid a shutdown and potential economic turmoil. \"House Democrats have successfully stopped extreme MAGA Republicans from shutting down the government, crashing the economy and hurting working-class Americans all across the land,\" said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader. \"House Democrats have successfully stopped the billionaire boys' club, which wanted a USD 4 trillion blank check by suspending the debt ceiling.\" (ANI)","url":"https://aninews.in/news/world/us/us-congress-approves-spending-extension-avoiding-shutdown20241222040651","image":"https://d3lzcn6mbbadaf.cloudfront.net/media/details/ANI-20241221223635.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 23:38:23","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":275185470,"title":"Lara Trump Removes Herself From Consideration for Big Job","text":"Lara Trump announced Saturday that she is pulling her name out of consideration for the Senate seat being vacated by Florida’s Marco Rubio (R), who – assuming he is confirmed – will become Donald Trump’s secretary of state.\n\nShe posted her announcement to X:\n\nThe tweet continues:\n\nI could not have been more honored to serve as RNC co-chair during the most high-stakes election of our lifetime and I’m truly humbled by the unbelievable support shown to me by the people of our country, and here in the great state of Florida.

He previously served as Chairman of MGM's worldwide television group until 2022 when he departed following Amazon's acquisition of the studio.The appointment comes alongside other significant personnel announcements today on Truth Social, including Chad Mizelle as Department of Justice Chief of Staff, Aaron Reitz as head of the DOJ's Office of Legal Policy, and David Fink as Federal Railroad Administrator.What People Are SayingDonald Trump: \"With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role.\"Mark Burnett: \"I am truly honored to serve The United States of America and President Trump as his Special Envoy to the United Kingdom.\"Former Apprentice Producer Bill Pruitt: Has previously described Trump's image on the NBC series as a \"myth we created.\"What Happens NextAs Special Envoy, Burnett will work alongside but separately from Trump's nominated UK Ambassador, Warren Stephens, in a role that doesn't require Senate confirmation.","summary":"Trump names veteran producer Mark Burnett as UK envoy amid wave of appointments to his second administration.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-mark-burnett-uk-envoy-appointments-2004718","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2549781/donald-trump-mark-burnett.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 23:24:23","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.33},{"id":275187524,"title":"Rockin’ around the congressional Christmas tree","text":"\"Rockin' around the Christmas treeAt the Christmas party hop\" – Brenda Lee It’s a yuletide tradition on Capitol Hill. An annual custom of rockin’ around a congressional Christmas tree, festooned with hundreds of legislative ornaments, Advent appropriations and mistletoe modifications. A political Polar Express chugs through the halls of Congress nearly every December. It’s always the last piece of legislation huffing out of the congressional station. WHAT TO EXPECT AS REPUBLICANS TRY TO SALVAGE SPENDING PACKAGE, AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN \"All aboard!\" hollers the conductor. Get your Noel needs loaded into the baggage car of this train, or it’s going to be left behind. So, lawmakers decorated their \"Christmas tree\" in the only way they know how. That resulted a few days ago in the colossal 1,547-page interim spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. The sheer scope of the bill was breathtaking. You want a hippopotamus for Christmas? You surely would have gotten it with this plan. It wasn’t long until House Republicans pulverized the legislation. \"It's another cram down,\" fumed Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, the morning after congressional leaders released the bill. \"Here's what you get. ‘Do this or shut the government down.’ So, it's very disappointing.\" Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., didn’t gift wrap his criticism. \"It's a total dumpster fire. I think it's garbage,\" decreed Burlison. \"It's shameful that people celebrate DOGE coming, and yet we're going to vote for another billion dollars to be added to the deficit. It's ironic.\" Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., mocked his colleagues for talking out of both sides of their mouths when it came to spending. \"We keep on saying we want to take the deficit and the debt seriously. But we keep on voting to increase it. You can't have it both ways,\" he said. \"This is irresponsible.\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, lamented this was business as usual. \"I mean, the swamp is going to swamp, right?\" proffered Roy. THE HITCHHIKER’S GUIDE TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INTERIM SPENDING BILL House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the following in the fall: \"We have broken the Christmas omni. I have no intention of going back to that terrible tradition. There won’t be a Christmas omnibus,\" Johnson declared Sept. 24. \"We won’t do any ‘buses.’\" So, yours truly pressed Johnson about his promise after frustrated Republicans upbraided him during a House GOP Conference meeting. \"You said back in September there would be no more Christmas omnibuses. You were not doing anymore ‘buses,’\" I asked. \"But how is this not yet another Christmas tree at the holidays?\" \"Well, it's not a Christmas tree. It's not an omnibus,\" responded Johnson. Johnson is technically right. In appropriations parlance, it’s not a true omnibus — even though outside observers and many lawmakers themselves might colloquially refer to the massive bill as an \"omnibus.\" An omnibus is where Congress gift wraps all 12 individual spending measures into one package. A \"minibus\" is where a handful of bills are bundled together. Even so, I reminded Johnson of the opprobrium directed at this legislation. \"They called this cram down. They said it was garbage. Those are your own members calling it that,\" I noted. \"Well, they haven't even seen it yet,\" said Johnson, even though the bill materialized the night before. \"I’ve got a couple of friends who will say that about any end-of-year funding measure. This is not an omnibus, OK? This is a small CR (continuing resolution) that we've had to add things to that were out of our control.\" The legislation was stocked with a hefty price tag to cover the entire cost of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. A radioactive pay raise for lawmakers. Health care provisions. Language about concert ticket prices. Emergency aid for farmers. And $110 billion to help cover devastation from Hurricanes Helene and Milton. \"It was intended to be, and it was until recent days, a very simple, very clean CR stopgap funding measure to get us into next year when we have a unified government,\" said Johnson. \"But a couple of intervening things have occurred. We had, as we say, acts of God. We had these massive hurricanes.\" But then Elon Musk torched the bill. President-elect Trump demanded an immediate debt ceiling increase. Debt limit deals are one of the most complex and contentious issues in Congress. They require weeks if not months of painstaking negotiations. HOUSE GOP LEADERS SCRAMBLE FOR PLAN B AFTER TRUMP, MUSK LEAD CONSERVATIVE FURY AGAINST SPENDING BILL This wasn’t as simple as presenting Santa at the mall a wish list of items for Christmas morning. The bill began bleeding support just hours before the House planned a vote. But to paraphrase Charles Dickens’ opening line in \"A Christmas Carol\" about Jacob Marley, \"That bill was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever, about that.\" Democrats were flabbergasted at outside last-minute ultimatums. Especially since Johnson attended the Army-Navy football game last week with Trump. How could they not have discussed the contours of this bill? \"It was blown up by Elon Musk, who apparently has become the fourth branch of government,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., scoffed about the bill. \"So, who is our leader, (House Minority Leader) Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., supposed to negotiate with? Is it Mike Johnson? Is he the speaker of the House? Or is it Donald Trump? Or is it Elon Musk. Or is it somebody else?\" Johnson and company then prepped a svelte 116-page bill to fund the government. But bipartisan lawmakers roasted that measure faster than chestnuts by an open fire. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., mocked Republicans for insisting that they adhere to their internal \"three-day rule.\" That allows lawmakers to ponder bills for three days before a vote. Yet Republicans were now racing the new bill to the floor faster than shoppers rushing home with their treasures. \"Have you printed it? How many pages is it? What happened to the 72-hour rule?\" mocked Moskowitz. The bill plummeted to an embarrassing defeat on the House floor. It only scored 174 yeas, punctuated by an eye-popping 38 Republican nays. \"The Democrats just voted to shut down the government,\" Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, the vice president-elect, claimed. \"They've asked for a shutdown, and I think that's exactly what they're going to get.\" By Friday, there was a third bill. And despite grousing, lawmakers finally passed the legislation. There was no need to go to \"Plan Z,\" popularized in \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.\" The House approved the bill in the early evening. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., hit the Senate floor late Friday night. \"Democrats and Republicans have just reached an agreement that will allow us to pass the CR tonight before the midnight deadline,\" said Schumer. Critics of the third bill might characterize the entire process as a \"railroad.\" But it was an actual railroad that prevented the Senate from passing the bill on time. An unnamed Republican senator placed a hold on nominees to Amtrak's board. But once senators resolved that problem, the Senate finally aligned with the House to prevent the shutdown around 12:45 a.m. ET Saturday, 45 minutes after the midnight deadline. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The slenderized bill included disaster aid and emergency assistance for farmers. But when it came to appropriations, the legislation simply renewed all current funding at present levels. It was definitely not a \"Christmas tree.\" It just kept the government running through March 14. So no holiday crisis. Merry Christmas.

This move is seen as a way to tackle security challenges related to missile technology and to maintain its presence in a region known for its unpredictable political dynamics. This week, news reports say that India is reopening its embassy in Pyongyang, North Korea. The embassy was closed for over three years because of the pandemic. Now, India is sending diplomats and technical staff back to North Korea to resume regular operations. Abhishek Sharma, a research assistant at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, stated in an interview with This Week in Asia that India's decision to reopen its embassy is a strategic step driven by three important factors, as reported by SCMP. The first concern is about the spread of nuclear, ballistic, and hypersonic missile technologies to Pakistan, which directly affects India’s national security. The second concern is about Pyongyang's increasing influence in Northeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region. The third concern is the potential for successful talks between the US and North Korea, which could have worldwide effects, especially regarding the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula under the upcoming Trump administration. The researcher stated that it is logical for Delhi to maintain an active embassy in North Korea. In July 2021, India closed its embassy in Pyongyang by recalling the Ambassador and all staff. The External Affairs Ministry mentioned Covid-19 as the reason but did not officially announce the closure of the embassy. A senior research associate at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses stated that India has never cut off its diplomatic relations with North Korea, according to SCMP. Initially, there was some sympathy for the situation. However, India grew upset due to its involvement in a network that was supplying weapons to countries like Pakistan and China. A senior researcher noted that India has consistently supported the Korean people, who are unfortunately split between North and South Korea. The opening of the embassy does not imply that India's strong ties with Japan and South Korea will be impacted. India will continue to be an active participant in the Quad while also working with other nations in the region to ensure stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad is a strategic security group that includes Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. The embassy is reopening at a time when Donald Trump is set to return to the White House. During his earlier term, Trump reached out to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in an effort to strengthen relations between the two nations. Dr. Jagannath Panda, head of the Stockholm Center for South Asian and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the Institute for Security and Development Policy, shared that Trump might focus on maintaining dialogue with North Korea. He could aim to negotiate either a gradual easing of some sanctions or even the full removal of all sanctions, according to a report by SCMP. \"In this situation, many countries may reconsider their current stance on North Korea,\" Panda explained to This Week in Asia. \"India should take the opportunity to rebuild its ties with North Korea. Reopening the embassy is a well-timed and strategic decision.\" Panda stated that with South Korea facing political uncertainty, North Korea might adopt a more open and active approach to diplomacy to reshape its stance on various regional and global matters. Panda suggested that this is a good opportunity for India to reconnect with North Korea through diplomacy and address key issues in Northeast Asia. India is among the few nations that have kept relations with North Korea, even amid its nuclear threats. In 1973, India established diplomatic ties with both North Korea and South Korea, maintaining a neutral and balanced stance. In 2017, India halted economic activities with North Korea due to nuclear sanctions but continued to maintain open communication. In 2018, India’s junior foreign minister at the time, V.K. Singh, visited Pyongyang. During the visit, he emphasized the dangers of nuclear proliferation, especially highlighting India's concerns about its links to neighboring regions, according to a statement from the foreign ministry. The statement said that North Korea, officially called the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), assured India that as a friendly nation, it would not take any actions that could threaten India’s security. In recent years, North Korea has strengthened its ties with Russia, China, and Iran. Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London, told SCMP that North Korea is aiming to become a global player by sending troops to Ukraine and strengthening its partnerships with Russia. It is also expanding its involvement in the global missile and nuclear proliferation network. India is becoming a significant Indo-Pacific power with interests in Southeast Asia and the Korean Peninsula, according to Pant. This is why India is strengthening ties with South Korea, and having a presence in North Korea also holds strategic importance.

Ukrainian drones have been intercepted numerous times over Moscow and other Russian regions since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine began in February 2022. Only a small number of UAVs have succeeded in reaching the target, nevertheless.

Trump has previously praised Burnett during campaign trail appearances. \"With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,\" Trump said in his post to Truth Social. \"Mark will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges,\" the president-elect added.

Trump, Democrats decried the omission of four bills related to pediatric cancer research and treatments from the revised funding bill.","summary":"Two bills on pediatric cancer research and a football stadium site had been left out of the main spending package, but passed early Saturday as separate legislation.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/21/us/politics/spending-pediatric-cancer-stadium.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/21/multimedia/21DC-CONG-ltjc/21DC-CONG-ltjc-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 23:08:29","author":"Minho Kim","authors":["Minho Kim"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.382},{"id":275181664,"title":"‘You’re hired!’: Trump names ‘The Apprentice’ creator Mark Burnett special envoy to the UK","text":"You’re hired!\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he’s tapped “The Apprentice” creator Mark Burnett to serve as a top diplomat in the United Kingdom.\n\n“It is my great honor to appoint Mark Burnett as the Special Envoy to the United Kingdom,” Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform.\n\n“With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role.”\n\nThe London-born, British American TV producer, created NBC’s hit series “The Apprentice,” which Trump starred as its host for 10 seasons.

His decision to hand control of the outlet to Lake, who has notably pushed pro-Trump falsehoods concerning his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden, could trigger similar criticisms during his second term.This comes as Trump is set to resume office next month where he is expected to implement a slew of hardline immigration policies, including mass deportations, which are designed to crack down on illegal migration.What To KnowDuring a Saturday appearance at AmericaFest in Phoenix, Lake spoke about Trump's deportation plan.\"We're sending people back to their homeland, and we're going to be freeing up our country for the citizens of this country, but we've got to make sure that they [the media] don't spin it. You know they are going to try and spin it and they are going to try and make it look like the worst thing in the world,\" Lake said.She added: \"I see it as human beings heading back to their homeland. They will go there and make their homeland better and we will make our homeland better...We're going to have to push back when the fake news tries to take everything President Trump is going to try to do to make our country great and they are going to try and spin it in the opposite way.\"Lake, a staunch Trump supporter and 2020 election denier, has echoed his stance on tough immigration policies during her U.S. Senate race in Arizona. Lake lost to Democrat Ruben Gallego in last month's election. She also lost the 2022 race for Arizona governor to Democrat Katie Hobbs.The president-elect's mass deportation plan has come under scrutiny as some lawmakers have raised concerns about the potential wide-sweeping approach rather than a more targeted program to remove migrant criminals.What People Are SayingTwenty-six GOP governors signed a letter stating they \"stand united in support\" of Trump's plans to protect American citizens from \"disastrous open border policies.\"Among those who signed were Texas' Greg Abbott, South Carolina's Henry McMaster, and Florida's Ron DeSantis.\"When the Biden Administration refused to secure our borders and uphold the rule of law, it was Republican governors who took action,\" the letter read. \"We mobilized state resources, including law enforcement and National Guard units, to protect Americans from disastrous open border policies and prevent illegal immigration from overwhelming our country.\"In contrast, Democratic governors and mayors have promised to protect undocumented migrants in their communities, using sanctuary laws that have prevented local officials and law enforcement from assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Many of the governors and city mayors signaling they plan to stand against the plans have voiced concerns over the logistics of such an operation, which will seek to target at least 11 million undocumented migrants.Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs said during a recent press conference, \"I will not tolerate misguided policies that don't actually help with the critical work that's happening here, that you're seeing here today, that actually keeps our communities safe and secure. I will not tolerate terrorizing communities or threatening Arizonans.\"What Happens NextWith Trump resuming office next month, preparations are already underway from the incoming administration to carry out his immigration agenda.Trump is expected to sign a series of executive orders on \"Day 1\" of his presidency, focusing on mass deportations and enhanced border security—key promises of his successful campaign.Meanwhile, Lake will need to be appointed by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the federal agency overseeing VOA, before starting her position.","summary":"Trump is set to resume office next month where he is expected to implement a slew of hardline immigration policies.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kari-lake-issues-new-warning-over-trump-deportation-plan-2004710","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2549778/kari-lake.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 22:55:42","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":275184572,"title":"Ontario Liberal MPs want Justin Trudeau to step down: sources","text":"At a virtual meeting of the Ontario Liberal caucus on Saturday morning, more than 50 Liberal MPs came to a consensus that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau needs to step down as party leader, multiple sources told CBC News.\n\nCBC News is not naming the MPs so that they could speak freely about private discussions.\n\nThe prime minister is believed to be reflecting on his political future after Monday's dramatic resignation from cabinet by Chrystia Freeland. Her pointed, public departure letter prompted a fresh wave of Liberal MPs to call for the prime minister to go.\n\nAs the Saturday meeting concluded, Ontario caucus chair Michael Coteau was tasked with communicating to Trudeau and the Prime Minister's Office that he has to resign.\n\nMPs offered different perspectives about how long it was appropriate to let Trudeau reflect on his future before facing further pressure, according to sources. MPs who spoke confidentially to CBC News said one participant raised the question of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration and the potential for \"chaos\" if the prime minister stepped aside as Trump was coming into office.\n\nOne MP who spoke to CBC News said no formal mechanism exists within the Ontario caucus to force a chair to deliver such a message to Trudeau but that members trust Coteau to listen to their wishes.\n\nThe MP said nobody fixed a deadline for Coteau to communicate with Trudeau, but they hoped it would happen soon.\n\nSources said 51 MPs were on the call, a majority of the Ontario caucus's 75 members.\n\nFreeland present but silent at meeting: sources\n\nSources told CBC News that Freeland was on Saturday's call but said nothing as the future of the party's leadership was debated.\n\nHours before she was supposed to deliver the 2024 fall economic statement on Monday, Freeland posted her resignation letter on social media. She wrote that she and the prime minister had been at odds for weeks and warmed him against \"costly political gimmicks\" that would hurt the country and Canadians' confidence in the Liberals amid a potential tariff war with the United States.\n\nFreeland has not publicly announced any attempt at dislodging Trudeau, but since Monday, two Liberal MPs — Sean Casey, who represents Charlottetown, and Chandra Arya, whose Nepean riding encompasses part of Ottawa — have said they would publicly support a Freeland leadership bid.\n\n\"Chrystia Freeland's resignation marked a pivotal shift,\" Arya wrote in a letter to Trudeau that he made public on Friday, just days after he had defended the prime minister staying on during an interview on CBC's The National.\n\n\"While I was disappointed by the timing of her announcement, I must acknowledge her exceptional political acumen. Whether by design or circumstance, she has emerged as a credible and stable alternative to your leadership.\"\n\nReached for comment by CBC News about the conversation, one Ontario Liberal MP offered some defence of the prime minister. Julie Dzerowicz, who represents the Toronto riding of Davenport, said Trudeau has been listening to caucus.\n\nShe also said whoever is speaking about any kind of consensus at the meeting is breaching caucus confidentiality.\n\nScarborough Centre MP Salma Zahid said there was agreement that recent events have raised everyone's level of concern, but she would not delve into details, citing caucus confidentiality.\n\n\"People don't really know what are options and what are timelines,\" she said.\n\nOn her leader's future, Zahid would only say, \"Let's see what happens and when it happens,\" adding that she has started to look for a campaign office in anticipation of next year's election taking place sooner rather than later.","summary":"At a virtual meeting of the Ontario Liberal caucus on Saturday morning, more than 50 Liberal MPs came to a consensus that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau needs to step down as party leader, multiple sources told CBC News.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ontario-liberal-mps-want-trudeau-to-resign-1.7417337?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7414997.1734820543!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/trudeau-fundraiser-20241216.JPG?im=Resize%3D620","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 22:55:39","author":"Catherine Cullen,Racy Rafique,Raffy Boudjikanian","authors":["Catherine Cullen","Racy Rafique","Raffy Boudjikanian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":275180944,"title":"Biden signs funding bill into law, averting US government shutdown","text":"United States President Joe Biden has signed into law a bipartisan funding bill that averts a government shutdown, days after Congress was thrown into turmoil after President-elect Donald Trump rejected an initial deal.\n\nThe White House announced on Saturday that Biden had signed the legislation, which funds the government through mid-March.\n\n“This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted. But it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the government can continue to operate at full capacity,” Biden, a Democrat, said in a statement.\n\n“That’s good news for the American people, especially as families gather to celebrate this holiday season.”\n\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate, in an 85-11 vote, passed the bill to continue government funding 38 minutes after it expired at midnight (05:00 GMT) in Washington, DC, on Saturday.\n\nThe budget bill had cleared the Republican-controlled House of Representatives earlier on Friday evening with bipartisan support.\n\nSaturday’s signing caps a tumultuous week in the US Congress after Trump, who takes office in January, and his adviser, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, raised opposition to the initial bipartisan agreement.\n\nTrump had insisted the deal include an increase in the government’s borrowing limit. If not, he said, let the government shutdown “start now”.\n\nLawmakers spent several days trying to hammer out another deal, with massive halts to government services hanging in the balance during the year-end holiday season.\n\nA shutdown would have meant nonessential operations shuttering, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and as many as 1.4 million more required to work without pay.\n\nThe final version of the legislation funds the government at current levels through March 14. It also provides $100bn in disaster aid as well as $10bn in assistance to farmers.\n\nBut the deal stripped out some provisions championed by Democrats, who accused Republicans of caving in to pressure from an unelected billionaire — Musk — who has no experience in government.\n\nSome Republicans voted against the package because it did not cut spending.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the party will have more influence next year, when it will have majorities in both chambers of Congress and Trump will be in the White House.\n\n“This was a necessary step to bridge the gap, to put us into that moment where we can put our fingerprints on the final decisions on spending,” he told reporters after the House vote, adding that Trump supported the deal.\n\nJohnson added that the compromise was “a good outcome for the country”.\n\nStill, the episode raises questions about whether Johnson will be able to keep his job in the face of angry Republican colleagues.\n\nThe House is scheduled to elect the next speaker on January 3, when the new Congress convenes.\n\nRepublicans will have a narrow majority, 220-215, leaving Johnson little margin for error as he tries to win the speaker’s gavel once more.","url":"https://guyanainquirer.com/biden-signs-funding-bill-into-law-averting-us-government-shutdown/","image":"https://guyanainquirer.com/app/uploads/2024/12/2024-11-07T163929Z_2031761459_RC2F0BA6MDSD_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-1730998003-8VAaM1.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 22:53:23","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":275180914,"title":"Trump taps TV’s Apprentice producer Mark Burnett as special envoy to the UK","text":"West Palm Beach: Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with The Apprentice, is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration.\n\n“With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,” Trump announced on Saturday (US time).\n\nBurnett, who was born in London, helped produce hits such as Survivor and The Voice, but is perhaps best known for teaming up with Trump for The Apprentice, which first aired on NBC in 2004.\n\nTrump had been well-known in real estate and pop culture circles for decades.

The show presented Trump Tower to tens of millions of people as a symbol of power and success before Trump launched his first campaign from the building’s lobby.\n\n“Mark is known for creating and producing some of the biggest shows in Television History,” Trump wrote in his statement on Burnett, listing many of his biggest hits before adding, “most notably, ‘The Apprentice'” and noting that Burnett “has won 13 Emmy Awards!”\n\nSpecial envoys are usually picked by presidents for the world’s traditional hotspots, including the Middle East — where Trump has already said he’d like Steven Witkoff to fill the role. The United Kingdom, which has long enjoyed a “special relationship” with the U.S. that makes it one of Washington’s strongest global allies, is not typically a candidate for such posts.\n\nBut Trump has announced a series of special envoy positions to several top loyalists ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, including his former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell who he chose as envoy for special missions. That announcement joined previous ones including Adam Boehler as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe president-elect said Burnett “will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges.”","summary":"Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce President-elect Donald Trump to a national television audience with &#8220;The Apprentice,&#8221; is being tapped by the president-elect to the newly-created post of special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration.

The White House said President Joe Biden intends to sign it into law if they do. The legislation would extend government funding until March 14, provide $100 billion for disaster-hit states and $10 billion for farmers. It would not raise the debt ceiling -- a difficult task Trump has pushed Congress to do before he takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans would have more power to influence government spending next year, when they will have majorities in both chambers of Congress and Trump will be in the White House. \"This was a necessary step to bridge the gap, to put us into that moment where we can put our fingerprints on the final decisions on spending,\" he told reporters after the vote.

The package, which passed by a bipartisan vote of 366-34, resembled a bipartisan plan that was abandoned earlier this week after an online fusillade from Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who said it contained too many unrelated provisions, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and a crackdown on pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nRepublicans struck most of those elements from the bill -- including a provision limiting investments in China which Democrats said would have conflicted with Musk's interests. \"He clearly does not want to answer questions about how much he plans to expand his businesses in China and how many American technologies he plans to sell,\" Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro said on the House floor. Trump has tasked Musk, the world's richest person, with heading a budget-cutting task force, but Musk holds no official position in Washington. Musk wrote on his social media platform X that he was happy with the package.\n\n\"It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces,\" he posted. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the package still accomplished important goals, such as delivering disaster aid, averting a shutdown and stopping Republicans from enacting a debt-ceiling hike that would make it easier to cut taxes.\"We have successfully advanced the needs of everyday Americans, but there are still things to be worked on and we look forward to that fight in the new year,\" he told reporters.\n\nCredit: Independent News Pakistan (INP)","url":"https://www.inp.net.pk/news-detail/international/us-house-approves-bill-to-avert-midnight-shutdown-sends-to-senate","image":"https://www.inp.net.pk/images/20241221170404_ogImage_2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-21 22:27:23","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":275178914,"title":"Senate passes RFK Stadium land bill, giving the Washington Commanders a major off-the-field win","text":"The path for the NFL’s Washington Commanders to return to the nation's capital is clear after an on-again, off-again saga in Congress ended early Saturday with a postmidnight reprieve.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed a resolution to transfer the land including old RFK Stadium from the federal government to the District of Columbia. The D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act passed by voice vote at roughly 1:15 a.m. after more than a year of lobbying and support from Rep.
