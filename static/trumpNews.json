Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chairperson of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, announced on Saturday that he sent FEMA Director Deanne Criswell a letter requesting her to testify at a hearing to answer questions regarding the agency’s response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. In the letter, Comer said that the hearing would \"permit members to investigate recent reports that a FEMA official instructed relief workers to bypass hurricane-impacted homes displaying campaign signs for President Trump.\" \"In the wake of the recent major disasters that impacted Americans of all political persuasions, it is critical that FEMA adheres to its disaster relief mission,\" he wrote. FEMA OFFICIAL DIRECTED HURRICANE RELIEF WORKERS TO AVOID HOMES WITH TRUMP SIGNS AS AGENCY CONDUCTS CLEANUP The Oversight Comittee's investigation followed after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Friday that he was launching an investigation into the agency. \"The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days,\" DeSantis said. \"At my direction, the Division of Emergency Management is launching an investigation into the federal government's targeted discrimination of Floridians who support Donald Trump.\" FOLLOW THE MONEY: UNDERSTANDING FEMA'S DISASTER BUDGET IN HURRICANE MILTON AFTERMATH \"New leadership is on the way to D.C., and I'm optimistic that these partisan bureaucrats will be fired.\" The investigations were promptly launched after FEMA confirmed to Fox News Digital that an employee had instructed aid workers to not provide relief to residents who had Trump campaign signs at their homes. The Daily Wire was the first to report. FEMA OFFICIAL FIRED FOR DIRECTING HURRICANE RELIEF AWAY FROM TRUMP SUPPORTERS' HOMES \"We take our mission to help everyone before, during and after disasters seriously. This employee has been terminated, and we have referred the matter to the Office of Special Counsel,\" Criswell said. \"I will continue to do everything I can to make sure this never happens again.\" WATCH: A FEMA spokesperson told Fox News on Friday that it is \"deeply disturbed\" by the employee’s actions and that it was an \"isolated incident.\" \"FEMA helps all survivors regardless of their political preference or affiliation,\" the spokesperson said via a statement. \"The employee who issued this guidance had no authority and was given no direction to tell teams to avoid these homes and we are reaching out to the people who may have not been reached as a result of this incident,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the agency has helped more than 365,000 households impacted by both Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and provided nearly $900 million in direct assistance to survivors.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We are horrified that this took place and therefore have taken extreme actions to correct this situation and have ensured that the matter was addressed at all levels.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to FEMA for comment.","summary":"The House Oversight Committee has sent a letter to FEMA Director Deanne Criswell requesting that she testify regarding the recent report that a FEMA official instructed to &quot;avoid homes advertising Trump.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-oversight-calls-fema-director-testify-after-official-tells-workers-avoid-homes-trump-signs","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/11/931/523/414bf8c1-split1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-10 00:56:01","author":"Sarah Rumpf-Whitten","authors":["Sarah Rumpf-Whitten"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.372},{"id":263815628,"title":"Trump reveals two former senior members of his administration will not be returning for his second term","text":"President-elect Donald Trump announced that two members of his first Cabinet would not be given a role this time around.\n\nNikki Haley, former UN ambassador, and Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State, will not be offered positions in Trump’s administration as his transition to the White House is underway, he declared in a Saturday evening Truth Social post.\n\n“I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,” the former president wrote. “I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nHaley launched her own presidential bid for the 2024 cycle. She was the last GOP contender challenging Trump when she dropped out of the race in March. Despite some animosity between the pair on the campaign trail — including when Trump labeled her “bird brain” — the former South Carolina governor eventually endorsed Trump for president at the Republican National Convention.\n\nIn contrast to Haley, Pompeo has largely remained out of the spotlight since leaving his tenure in the first Trump administration.\n\nHe backed Trump at a speech at the Republican National Convention. He told the crowd that the Trump administration “put America first every single day.”\n\nTrump didn’t offer any additional insight into his decision-making, but the former president’s post came one day after his former adviser Roger Stone urged Trump against tapping Pompeo again, writing that the former president “can’t trust” his former secretary of state.\n\n“Now that Trump is back on top, it becomes far more difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff,” Stone wrote on his website on Friday.\n\n“Several neocons have positioned themselves to get highly influential roles within the second Trump administration, and this sinister fifth column has the potential to be more harmful to Trump’s America First agenda than his leftist opinion within the Democrat Party,” he continued. Only Haley and Pompeo made his list.\n\nRegarding Haley, he called her a “political chameleon who has changed with the times in ways that are incredibly self-serving.”\n\nRegarding Pompeo, Stone took issue with him for criticizing Trump’s refusal to hand over classified documents — a move that resulted in a federal criminal case against the former president — and claimed Pompeo “was creating distance and flirting with a potential presidential run of his own.”\n\nIt’s unclear if Trump had discussed his decision with Stone before making the Truth Social announcement. The Independent has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, the former president had announced just one Cabinet member. He tapped Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, to serve as chief of staff, making her the first woman with the title.","summary":"The president-elect’s administration ‘is currently in formation,’ he wrote","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-nikki-haley-mike-pompeo-cabinet-picks-administration-b2644398.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/10/00/GettyImages-978855446.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hfg9badX-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-10 00:52:08","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.134},{"id":263816052,"title":"Chinese National Arrested Again After Multiple Efforts to Enter Mar-a-Lago","text":"Florida’s Palm Beach County police on Nov. 8 arrested a Chinese national after he tried, again, to enter President-elect Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, according to court records.\n\nLi Zijie, a 39-year-old living in suburban Los Angeles on a student visa, allegedly arrived at the Trump property in an Uber on the afternoon of Nov. 7—the latest in a number of attempts he made to get into the resort in the past few weeks.\n\nHe made the trip hours after getting out of a mental hospital, where had he spent the previous week after a similar effort made in late October, according to a police affidavit.\n\nLi now faces two counts of trespassing, according to the county’s jail records. He’s being held in the Palm Beach County Main Detention Center on a $100,000 bond.\n\nLi first tried to gain entry into Mar-a-Lago on July 19, six days after the Pennsylvania rally shooting, according to court documents viewed by The Epoch Times.\n\nLi pulled up a gray Toyota and told Secret Service agents he had information implicating China in the assassination attempt and wished to give them the documents. The Palm Beach police issued a trespass warning and told him not to return.\n\nIn the following days, Li drove into the town of Palm Beach at least four times, going up to the north checkpoint but didn’t try to enter Mar-a-Lago, the court records said.\n\nOn July 30, officers observed Li driving toward the Mar-a-Lago checkpoint and placing paperwork about Trump on vehicles. He was arrested the next day for allegedly trespassing on the premises. A local court ordered him to stay 500 feet away from the resort and from Trump.\n\nHis next attempt was on Oct. 30 when he tried to enlist help from a resident who lives nearby, court documents read.\n\nThe woman had a Trump 2024 political sign on her yard. Li asked if she was a Mar-a-Lago club member and whether she could drive him inside. The woman refused, and after seeing him enter a white Toyota, called the police, who placed him into a mental hospital.\n\nHe returned to Mar-a-Lago the day of his release.\n\nIn the affidavit regarding the latest intrusion effort, Palm Beach Police said due to the “increased attempts by Li to gain entrance into Mar-a-Lago” to make contact with the president-elect, a future attempt could lead to an escalation of enforcement.\n\nThe Trump resort has faced repeated intrusion efforts, including two from Chinese nationals.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term as president, a Chinese businesswoman carried four cell phones, a computer, and an external hard drive past the security checkpoint, telling a Secret Service agent that she was there to use the pool, then later presenting herself to reception as an attendee of an already-canceled event.\n\nDuring Trump’s 2018 Thanksgiving visit to the resort, a University of Wisconsin student sneaked into the Palm Beach club by standing with a group entering Mar-a-Lago. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and apologized for the act.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted Li’s lawyer for comment.","summary":"The man has repeatedly tried to enter the Trump resort over the past few weeks.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/chinese-national-arrested-again-after-multiple-efforts-to-enter-mar-a-lago-5757235","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/09/id5757239-li-zijie-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-10 00:49:41","author":"Eva Fu","authors":["Eva Fu"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.539},{"id":263814662,"title":"Tinubu will win 2027 election – APC","text":"The ruling All Progressives Congress has warned opposition parties in the country not to get too excited over the defeat of Kamala Harris, an incumbent vice president in the United States presidential election, saying President Bola Tinubu will sweep the poll again in 2027.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was announced as the winner of the US poll on Wednesday, defeating Harris in a stunning political comeback that sent shockwaves across the world.\n\nThe 78-year-old business mogul became the 47th president and the oldest person ever to win the White House.\n\nReacting, the National Publicity Secretary of the Labour Party, Obiora Ifo, described the US election, which was monitored globally, as a true test of democracy.\n\nWhile stating the Independent National Electoral Commission has a lot to learn from the just concluded poll, Ifoh said it was interesting to see how the American voting public ignored the incumbency factor, which is still a ‘big deal’ in Africa, and specifically Nigeria’s, election system.\n\nAlso reacting, the spokesman for the New Nigeria Peoples Party, Ladipo Johnson said though the US electoral system is complex and has come a long way, wondering when Nigeria would end the era of tight-tight leaders using the power of incumbency and security apparatus to intimidate opposition could stop.\n\nBut the National Publicity Director of the APC, Bala Ibrahim warned the opposition not to get carried away with the outcome of the US election, saying the electoral processes between the two countries are different.\n\nBala, who spoke with our correspondent in an interview, stated that the incumbency factor doesn’t always work where the people speak with one voice as witnessed in the victory of former President Muhammadu Buhari over the incumbent, Goodluck Jonathan in 2015.\n\nThe APC spokesman expressed conviction that by the time Nigerians begin to harvest the reward of the economic reforms put in place by the president, they would applaud and urge him to continue.\n\nWhile stating that the party is not losing sleep over the threat, the politician warned that the affairs of the country would not be left in the hands of the opposition, many of whom were still struggling with leadership crisis.\n\nHe said, “With the way and manner this administration of APC is working assiduously, bringing in new reforms and changes that are painful initially, we will reap the gains and fruits in the long run.\n\n“We expect to start seeing the fruits of these reforms right around the time of the election. That should be around 2026 and 2027. It is at that time people will start clapping for the party and the president.\n\n“It will be almost impossible for someone to come from the outside, particularly an outsider that has failed the country before; an outsider that cannot contain its own crisis, to think of defeating the incumbent. It will be very difficult. The APC and the president are very much aware of this expectation and shenanigans of the opposition.\n\n“But it is not to say that the party and the president are sleeping. No, they are strategising ahead. So, when we get to the bridge, we will see who have the strongest stride to cross it. And I assure you, the APC will not be found nothing.

When we got there we were told to discriminate against people. \n\n‘It’s almost unbelievable to think that somebody in the federal government would think that’s okay.’\n\nThe person added that it was wrong to discriminate against Trump supporters when they were their ‘most vulnerable’. \n\nThey added: ‘I volunteered to help disaster victims, not discriminate against them. It didn’t matter if people were black, white, Hispanic, for Trump, for Harris. Everyone deserves the same amount of help.’\n\nImages also obtained by the outlet of the system used to document what homes they visited show notes being left that said: ‘Trump sign, no contact per leadership’.\n\nBut the Trump-related remarks were reportedly deleted from the group chat a few days after she posted them. \n\nNews of Washington’s order outraged Lake Placid residents, with Mayor John Holbrook telling the New York Post her discrimination ‘really sickens me.’\n\n‘There are no parties when we are recovering.’\n\nMilton had ripped through The Sunshine State in early October just two weeks after the misery brought by Hurricane Helene. \n\nOver 30 people died after the storm wrecked catastrophe on communities, with homes left ruined as it caused an estimated $50billion in damage across the state.\n\nAn employee under Washington’s supervision later filed a complaint about the guidance with the federal Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA. \n\nNow, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is demanding answers.\n\nShe wrote a letter to the agency on Friday, asking Criswell to provide answers about what she knew of Washington’s instructions, what actions FEMA had taken and when it first became aware of the guidance.\n\nAdditionally, Luna is asking the agency what actions it has taken to ensure that the homes that were skipped will receive necessary aid. \n\nShe demanded Criswell respond by November 25.\n\n‘My district was one of the most heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton, and it has been sickening to hear that more than half of my constituents were discriminated against for their political beliefs,’ Luna told The Daily Wire on Saturday.\n\nShe went on to claim that ‘big government bureaucrats despise everyday Americans because they are not politically expedient to them.\n\n‘I’ll demand answers from FEMA Administrator Criswell, and Congress must fully investigate this matter,’ Luna said. ‘The days of putting Americans and America last are over.’\n\nFlorida Gov.

While experts were still uncertain about the continuity of tech spending, Q2 (Jul to Sep) earnings belied the doubts of the naysayers.Discretionary spending may not be back across all sectors, but IT companies are seeing growth in more verticals and geographies than before. Some have predicted higher revenues for the current fiscal and others have seen a decent uptick in their net headcount. Now with Donald Trump winning the US elections and analysts predicting lower business taxes, the ongoing AI revolution is likely to take the tech spends northward for the Indian IT sector to capitalise on.Four key takeaways from the Q2 earnings point to revival of tech spends: Improvement in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector in North America; a resurgence in hiring; upward revision in revenue guidance; and growing artificial intelligence (AI) deals.Also Read: Hopes of earnings revival lift Indian tech firms’ valuationsBFSI on recovery path, North America gains groundBFSI is the largest revenue generator for the over $250-billion Indian IT industry and also the biggest technology spender. The rise in discretionary spends, especially in the financial vertical and North America, has led to growing optimism among both companies and analysts.While some experts say that the spending increase is linked to regulatory compliance, others point out that projects previously put on hold are resuming. Peter Bendor- Samuel, chief executive of the consulting and research firm Everest Group, said that the BFSI sector is witnessing a rebound following the post-Covid slump. “BFSI typically leads other industry segments, so this is an encouraging sign for the rest of the IT industry,” he said.Salil Parekh, CEO of Bengaluru- based Infosys, India’s second-largest IT services company, said during the company’s earnings call: “The financial services segment in the US is seeing increased discretionary spending, particularly in capital markets, mortgages and the cards and payments sub-segments.”Even for cross-town rival Wipro, things are looking up. Its chief executive Srini Pallia said Americas 2 (strategic market unit) recorded sequential growth of 0.8%, supported by robust demand and strong execution in the BFSI sector.For HCLTech, the BFSI vertical grew at about 4% sequentially in dollar terms, excluding the impact of its divestment of a joint venture with US-based State Street.The crisis in US based-regional banks last year was one of the triggers that resulted in enhanced discretionary deals for Indian IT firms, pointed out LTIMindtree COO Nachiket Deshpande. Also, with Europe facing a decelerating economy, the scales seem to have tipped in favour of North America.Headcount as companies buck trendIn a reversal of the declining headcount trend in the Indian IT industry after nearly seven quarters, five of India's top six IT companies- Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra and LTIMindtree- collectively hired over 17,500 employees in the September quarter.HCLTech was the only outlier: Its workforce reduced by 780 people last quarter, and largely due to the State Street divestment.Also Read: IT sector’s top firms reverse headcount fall after 7 quartersWhile the industry shed a record number of employees- more than 70,000- in FY24, the first quarter of this fiscal year saw a cumulative decline of 1,750. Companies temporarily ceased fresher hirings and reduced headcount amid business growth for four to five quarters after seeing a couple of quarters of pandemic-induced high growth tech spends.But with demand recovery in sight, especially now that the US elections are over, hiring trends are witnessing a turnaround.Upward revenue guidanceInfosys revised its FY25 revenue guidance after seeing better- than-expected Q2 earnings. It now expects revenue growth between 3.75-4.5% in constant currency for the current fiscal, which is higher than its earlier guidance of 3-4%. The company had earlier increased its guidance in the June quarter from the 1-3% range it gave at the start of the year.Riding on an uptick in discretionary demand, Cognizant crossed the $5-billion quarterly revenue mark in its third quarter. Boosted by its performance and its recent acquisition, the IT major also revised its FY24 annual revenue guidance up to 1.4% to 1.9% in constant currency (this assumes approximately 200 basis points of inorganic contribution), from its earlier guidance of -0.5 to 1%. Similarly, better-than-expected performance in the first half gave India’s third-largest software services firm, HCLTech, the confidence to increase the lower end of its revenue growth guidance for the fiscal year to 3.5-5.0% from the earlier range of 3.0- 5.0%.AI deals go northwardWith AI becoming more than just a buzzword, IT firms are registering a rapid growth in the number of AI engagements, including large deals. For instance, TCS has seen a doubling of its AI/GenAI TCV (total contract value of deals) every quarter since the past three quarters . K Krithivasan, chief executive at TCS, said, “We have not been disclosing the AI/ GenAI TCV, but it has been improving very well, almost doubling every quarter, and the pipeline also remains very strong.” As of Q2, TCS has more than 600 engagements in AI/Gen AI (including POCs [proof of concepts], POVs [proof of values], and projects which have matured to production stage). In Q1, the same metric was 270.Accenture’s Q4 Gen AI new bookings stood at $1 billion, and the figure for the full year was $3 billion. In Q3, its Generative AI new bookings were over $900 million. In Q2 and Q1, the same were $600 million and $450 million, respectively.HCLTech garnered about a third of incremental demand from data and AI verticals. Capgemini, which has a majority of its employees in India, last month disclosed that its GenAI bookings were pegged at 600 million euros as of Q3.Infosys’s Salil Parekh said during the Q2 earnings call, “Almost every large deal or significant deal has some Gen AI component related to productivity. While the whole deal is not AI, a part of the deal becomes Gen AI.”Recently, LTIMindtree’ s Deshpande told ET that it won the largest deal in the company’s history due to its AI approach, without disclosing the deal value. New dynamic post US electionsAvinash Vashistha, chairman and CEO of Tholons and former chairman of Accenture India, said the bold trifecta play of reciprocal tariffs, stricter immigration and lower business taxes, under Donald Trump’s administration will be a boon for IT firms. “While tariff impact should be minimal for IT companies, stricter immigration could squeeze talent acquisition in the US, and therefore, could see more offshoring of works to Indian GCCs and alliance IT partners.Similarly, lower taxes are a clear win, potentially boosting the $29-trillion US GDP and attracting foreign investment.Combined with the AI revolution, the projected tech spend of $1.3 trillion by 2027 is likely to go up. GCCs and IT service providers must forge strong partnerships to capitalise on this dynamic landscape and drive innovation,” Vashistha said.Pareekh Jain, chief executive of engineering insight platform EIIRTrend, said that once Donald Trump becomes US president, two things will play out as far as IT firms are concerned. “With tech leaders like Elon Musk on Trump’s side, the new president will go more after unskilled immigration and will be softer on skilled migration. Secondly, his views of lowering corporate taxes will help enter prises go for larger discretionary spends — a boon for IT firms,” he predicted.Also Read: Indian IT is seeing green shoots amid macro storm: Nasscom Chair Rajesh Nambiar","summary":"India-centric IT firms saw signs of recovery in the first half of the fiscal year, driven by growing tech spends in North America's BFSI sector, increased hiring, and improved revenue guidance. Experts foresee further tech spending bolstered by Donald Trump's US election win, which may lead to lower business taxes and favor skilled immigration, setting the stage for Indian IT firms to expand and innovate.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/fog-lifts-optimism-now-in-the-air/articleshow/115118839.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-115119969,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-144366,overlay-ettech/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-10 00:30:00","author":"Sameer Ranjan Bakshi","authors":["Sameer Ranjan Bakshi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":263814132,"title":"Women win majority of seats in New Mexico Legislature in showcase of determination and joy","text":"SANTA N.M., Nov 9 : Women have won 60 seats in the New Mexico Legislature to secure the largest female legislative majority in U.S history, stirring emotions of joy, surprise and vindication.\n\nNew Mexico voters are sending 11 additional women — Democrats and Republicans — to bump up female representation in the 112-member Legislature. Female state senators will still hold a minority of seats — 16 out of 42.\n\nWomen have made slow, steady advances in statehouse representation across the country, with one notable surge in the 2018 election cycle almost entirely among Democrats in a trend associated with the #MeToo movement and political engagement linked to the election of Donald Trump as president.\n\nIn 2018, Nevada became the first state to elect a female legislative majority, later expanding it to more than 60 per cent of seats with majorities in the state Assembly and Senate. Female legislators in New Mexico will hold a 54 per cent majority — though with many more seats.\n\nThe share of women in all state legislatures combined roughly tripled from about 11 per cent in 1980 to 33 per cent going into the November election, when women held 2,424 seats nationwide, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nIncoming female legislators in New Mexico include a crusading Republican advocate for crime victims, Republican Nicole Chavez, and Democrat Heather Berghmans, who defeated men in the general election and the primary against an incumbent senator accused of sexual harassment.\n\nChavez won her state House seat in a relatively affluent Albuquerque neighborhood. She expressed pride in contributing to the new female legislative majority — and as her district’s first Latina legislator-elect.\n\nBut Chavez also said she campaigned to ensure a diversity of political values in preserving her party’s control of the only Republican-held House district in Albuquerque, amid a growing urban-rural partisan divide.\n\n“I don’t believe in just recruiting women,” she said. “I think we should have diversity of all values.”\n\nShe has been a prominent advocate for crime victims at the Legislature since the 2015 shooting death of her eldest son Jaydon, then a high school senior and football team captain who had been accepted to the Air Force Academy. Chavez said she yearned to do that legislative work directly, campaigning this year for enhanced criminal penalties and financial incentives for businesses that train and hire people as they leave incarceration to address recidivism.\n\n“I had to wait for my kids to be older and self-sufficient” to run for the Legislature, said Chavez, the sales director at a Medicare provider who campaigned under the banner of “mother, business leader, fighter. My youngest is going to be a senior, and he drives now.”\n\nThe New Mexico milestone is a counterpoint to the defeat of Kamala Harris nationally, the second female Democratic nominee for president, although Harris won New Mexico. The Legislature convenes on January 21 for 60 days, its only scheduled session in 2025.\n\nWomen in New Mexico already dominate the other top echelons of state government — holding the governor’s office over four consecutive terms. Three seats out of five on the state Supreme Court are held by women.\n\nWomen also hold statewide elected office as secretary of state, state treasurer and state public land commissioner — the latter a position overseeing lucrative oil and natural gas lease sales in the No. 2 state for petroleum production.\n\nKelly Dittmar, director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics, said it was too soon Friday to determine overall changes in representation for women in the general election, with many vote tallies still underway. For a few months in 2024, women held a majority of legislative seats in Arizona. In 2023, women briefly occupied 50 per cent of legislative seats in Colorado.\n\nDittmar said female legislators who achieve robust representation in legislatures typically cultivate their own supportive network, and that those states also often have formal programs that recruit and encourage women who want to run for office.\n\nAmong Democrats, many female legislators in New Mexico trace their initial success at campaigning to the training and support group Emerge and its local chapter, which aren’t directly involved in campaigns. Graduates say the program braces them for the personal demands of campaigning and teaches skills from financial planning to developing effective political messaging.\n\n“It’s sort of the soup-to-nuts of campaigning,” said Democratic state Rep. Reena Szczepanski of Santa Fe, who previously served as executive director at Emerge New Mexico from 2010 to 2016 and was reelected this year to a second House term.\n\nShe attended the Emerge training in 2008 alongside a school teacher named Stephanie Garcia Richard, who joined the Legislature and later won statewide election as the first female public land commissioner.\n\nBerghmans, 36, of Albuquerque will join the New Mexico Senate as ts youngest member in January after winning 60 per cent of the vote in the general election. In the June primary, she ousted state Sen. Daniel Ivey-Soto in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment and bullying behavior that he disputed. Berghmans said people in her district appeared eager to hear from a new generation of female candidates.\n\n“I did hear a lot of people at the doors who told me to my face that they were willing to vote for me just because I was a young woman,” said Berghmans, who campaigned on solutions to surging homelessness and the housing affordability crisis. “I think that people are excited to see new ideas and new faces and that women have been the ones to step up to run.”\n\nBerghmans, who works at a progressive public policy group after an early career in e-commerce, said she is lucky to have enough family support to juggle work and campaigning for an unsalaried legislative position, while raising a newborn daughter, now 8 months old.\n\n“It has maybe made things more clear,” she said about politics and motherhood. “I really want to work on early childhood care (legislation). … It’s more tangible and just a little different.” (AP)","summary":"SANTA N.M., Nov 9 : Women have won 60 seats in the New Mexico Legislature to secure the largest female legislative majority in U.S history, stirring emotions of joy, surprise and vindication.

If the initial indications after the election are any indication of how it’s going to be, it’s going to be a very peaceful process. He had a phone call with Vladimir Zelensky and already talked about winding down the Ukraine war. He has already discussed had phone calls with multiple world leaders,” Kash Patel told Fox News in an interview.\n\nAn American attorney and former government official, Patel served as a US National Security Council official, senior advisor to the acting Director of National Intelligence, and chief of staff to the acting United States secretary of defence during the first Trump presidency. He is one of Trump’s close confidants on national security and foreign policy.\n\nHe was responding to a series of questions on the next Trump Administration.\n\n“But what you have to do is what President Trump already did. It’s no secret. Prioritise the collection of intelligence against our adversaries to make sure that we defeat the threats, which is the Iranian mullahs and the number one state sponsor of terror, and also make sure we keep in check the CCP (Communist Party of China) and our Russian adversaries from attacking our cyber infrastructure,” Patel said.\n\n“But you can’t do that if your intelligence communities are prioritised against climate change and DEI. President Trump made it clear the priorities are the border, terrorists, bringing home hostages, and ending the forever wars. I think that mandate will carry,” he said.\n\nPatel indicated that Trump after being sworn in as the President on January 20, 2025, will adopt the policy of maximum pressure on Iran.\n\n“I’ll just tell you what worked. I think it was a multitude of things. These full-on sanctions programs against the Iranian economy to suffocate the mullahs from making money. I don’t think the president’s going to fork over another seven billion dollars like Harris did to them so they can start another world war,” he said.\n\n“He’s also going to talk to adversaries about trade with Iran and have a global coalition because we can’t do it alone to take on Iran and make sure they don’t do one thing we can’t have them do is achieve a nuclear bomb, which they’re dangerously close to under the Biden-Harris administration,” he said.\n\nThese next 75 days are critical because Iran’s going to hyperspeed what they are currently working on, knowing that Trump’s coming in and knowing that his around the world are going to put Iran back in check. “I think you’re going to see that playbook again,” he added.\n\nResponding to a question, Patel said people are lining up to serve this president as their commander-in-chief because they saw the power and wasp of him on the global stage without igniting the world into another world war. “He’s not the war hawk that these people made him out to be. Proof is in the pudding. He had world peace. I think he’ll do it again fast,” he said.

According to a 2020 budget document, the Trump family took an average of 1,625 trips annually, more than 12 times as many as the Obamas, who took ‘133.3 protected trips per year’.\n\nThe report added, tellingly: ‘Much of the Trump family’s known travel [had] been to promote Trump Organisation businesses.’ A Congressional probe later accused Trump of turning his presidency into ‘the world’s greatest get-rich-quick scheme’.\n\nNow, with his second presidency, we can expect a rerun of practices that generated Trump’s web of 500 companies $2.4 billion in revenue in his first four years in the Oval Office – much of it courtesy of taxpayers.\n\nTrump’s return offers a golden opportunity to resume using his hospitality venues to ring up a fortune from taxpayers, lobbyists and foreign emissaries.\n\nAs someone who’s spent 36 years exposing Trump’s financial schemes – cheating investors, suppliers, workers, governments and filing false financial statements – I know exactly how he operates.\n\nThe big cash prize in a second Trump administration will be filling his hotels, golf resorts and other properties with an amalgam of favour-seekers and government employees, charging astronomical prices for rooms and meals – and even golf cart rentals for security men who follow him on his links.\n\nLast time round, Trump started as he meant to go on. Only minutes after being sworn in, he stopped his motorcade to the White House five blocks short. Along with wife Melania and the rest of the family, he got out of ‘The Beast’, as the presidential limousine is known, and took a turn on the asphalt.\n\nThe stopping-off point was the Trump Hotel. While media coverage of this break with tradition failed to explain the significance, every lobbyist, foreign emissary and government contractor got the message: if you’re paying court to The Donald at the White House, make sure you check in to one Pennsylvania Avenue hotel.\n\nThe Saudi royal family took the hint and rented two floors, paying the top rate instead of arranging a group booking discount.\n\nThe Al Sabah family, who rule Kuwait, moved their annual celebration of the country’s independence from the Four Seasons Hotel to Trump’s new outlet. Supplicants of every stripe, from ambassadors to public servants seeking lifetime sinecures as federal judges and the like, stayed there.\n\nSo did five people who were later granted presidential pardons for crimes against the US. One of them, private equity investor Elliott Broidy – convicted of being an unregistered foreign agent after lobbying for the deportation of a Chinese dissident – ran up a bill of more than $15,000. He presumably considered it money well spent.\n\nIt was the same story with trade groups looking to curry favour – bodies representing private prisons, payday lenders and energy companies moved their annual conferences to Trump resorts from New York to Florida.\n\nTrump campaign donors were encouraged to hold fundraisers at their hero’s properties, another canny way of funnelling cash into his personal coffers. But few clients have proved a more reliable cash cow than the Secret Service.\n\nUSA Today reported in 2017 that Trump’s trips to his Florida members’ club-cum-residence Mar-a-Lago – visits so regular it became known as ‘the southern White House’ – cost the Secret Service $3 million a time.\n\nPrices charged to government employees were so far above federal rules that special credit cards with bumper spending limits were issued. It was a similar story at other Trump Organisation properties. In February 2018 when Eric Trump visited the Trump Hotel Washington (which his father sold four years later after leaving office), he stayed free but his Secret Service detail was charged $895 each for a pair of rooms.\n\nThe scale of Trump’s utilisation of the bodyguard expense account led House Democrats, in a report last month, to argue that he ‘turned the US Secret Service into a cash machine for his personal enrichment’. Many felt such transactions violated a Constitutional prohibition on presidents receiving emoluments from certain people, governments and foreign interests.\n\nBut when citizens and interest groups tried to bring civil actions, courts ruled they lacked the authority to pursue their claims.\n\nFinding loopholes he can push fortunes through has been a Trump specialty since long before 1988, when I became one of the first to write that he might one day become president.\n\nThe $2.4 billion Trump collected at his businesses between 2017 and 2020 is only part of his haul.\n\nEven after Joe Biden became president, the federal government resisted making Trump-era records available.\n\nFor two years, the Biden White House refused my requests for records of whether Trump reimbursed the government for personal expenses, such as groceries, initially paid for by taxpayers. \n\nBiden’s administration still won’t say why it shields Trump from accountability – a strange stance for an outgoing oppositional administration.\n\nSailing close to the limits of the law has got Trump into trouble in the past. He is currently at the wrong end of four criminal lawsuits. He has repeatedly said his first act when he takes power in January will be to sack his bete noir, Special Counsel Jack Smith, whose office began winding down the day after Tuesday’s election.\n\nSmith is at the helm of Trump’s two federal criminal cases, one alleging he tried to overthrow the government when he sent a violent mob to the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and the other that he stole thousands of pages of secret documents, some of which prosecutors have shown he improperly shared.\n\nThe fate of two state-level prosecutions – for financial fraud in New York and election fraud in Georgia – is less certain. \n\nIn his New York case, in which a jury found him guilty on all 34 counts, any other defendant would be sure to get a jail sentence, especially for attacking the proceedings as rigged and making threats that forced the judge to need round-the-clock protection.\n\nBut because he is now president-elect, a planned November 26 sentencing hearing may not even take place, or – if it does – sentencing may be delayed until 2029 when he leaves office. His trial in Georgia for election fraud, where some of the 19 defendants have confessed guilt, may be postponed or dismissed.\n\nTrump could issue a self-pardon for his federal offences, but most legal scholars believe that would be invalid and seen as a test of integrity for the Supreme Court, three of whose nine members he appointed. But he has no pardon power in the state cases, only the hope that the Supreme Court will block the prosecutions.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump will seek to dismiss his civil cases for sexual harassment, slander, non-payment and other issues, or to put them on hold until he leaves office.\n\nTrump presents himself as a modern Midas. But as I detailed in my 2016 book, The Making Of Donald Trump, he’s merely a cash extractor. He borrows money to get control of enterprises, shaves multi-million-dollar fees off the top for himself, then drains businesses of cash until they collapse.\n\nHis casino company went through four bankruptcies when he was in charge, and two more after he was paid to go away. He departed with at least $83 million, while others collected just pennies on what they were owed.\n\nMoney flows through his small hands like water, which explains why he is always hunting for the next grift. The Art Of The Deal, the 1987 book that created his mogul image, is the tale of one fraud after another. His second term will add even more to his riches – but at whose expense?\n\nDavid Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, is a Professor at Rochester Institute of Technology, where he teaches law, journalism and public policy.","summary":"One night in 2017, the year Donald Trump began his first White&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-earned-millions-during-his-last-white-house-term-by-charging-the-secret-service-exorbitant-fees-to-stay-in-his-hotels/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/09/19/91889575-14063523-image-a-33_1731180385128.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-10 00:16:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":263813034,"title":"Zelensky informed by Trump aide that Crimea is lost and Ukraine needs to talk to Putin","text":"A SENIOR adviser to Donald Trump has warned Volodymyr Zelensky that he must come to the negotiating table with a “realistic vision for peace”.\n\nRepublican strategist Bryan Lanza also said that Crimea is not up for negotiation adding: “Crimea is gone.”\n\nLanza told the BBC that President Zelensky’s condition for peace, insisting on Crimea’s return, was unrealistic.

Maura Healey, who sued his previous administration nearly 100 times as attorney general.\n\n“Some realities need to be noted, and that is in 2016 we had a very different situation in the courts,” Healey told MSNBC anchor Lawrence O’Donnell. “While I’m sure there will be litigation ahead, there’s a lot of other ways people are going to act and need to act for the sake of their states and their residents.”\n\n“There’s regulatory authority and executive powers,” she said on national television the night after Trump won re-election. “There’s also legislation within our states. The key here is that every tool in the toolbox is going to be used to protect our citizens … and certainly to hold the line on democracy and the rule of law as a basic principle.”\n\nHealey’s animosity towards Trump is well documented. As attorney general, she sued his former administration 96 times, more than all but three of her counterparts from other states, the Globe reported in 2022.\n\nHealey won 77% of those cases, the analysis found. Immigration ranked second with 13 total lawsuits, trailing 58 environment-related complaints.\n\nIn January 2017, days after Trump signed an executive order barring individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S., Healey filed a lawsuit challenging the ban’s constitutionality.\n\n“The President’s executive order is a threat to our Constitution,” Healey said at the time. “Rather than protecting our national security, it stigmatizes those who would lawfully emigrate to our state.”\n\nHealey joined other attorneys general as a coalition in filing additional immigration-related lawsuits. One focused on Trump’s attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from census data, another on the separation of families at the southern border, among others.\n\nAttorney General Andrea Campbell, Healey’s successor, told reporters her office spent time working ahead of last week’s election to “identify prospective threats” that could surface during Trump’s second term in the White House.\n\n“We are an office that always strives to work in partnership and to be collaborative,” Campbell said last Wednesday, “but where someone violates the law, or the spirit of it, or violates the protections of our residents or the values we hold near and dear, we will fight for those, and we will do it, of course, in collaboration with AGs all across this country.”\n\nTrump has said deporting the 11 million people estimated to be in the country illegally will be a top goal when he regains office in January.\n\nHealey is adamant that the Massachusetts State Police won’t assist in those efforts, drawing a sharp rebuke from critics. The state’s top law enforcement has also said helping Trump’s deportation push is not part of its mission.\n\nElizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said her organization will work “tirelessly” to protect immigrants during Trump’s next term.\n\nThis election cycle left immigrants “in a state of fear,” she said in a statement.\n\n“Policies such as carrying out mass deportations, revoking humanitarian parole programs, and ending Temporary Protective Status are unjust and un-American,” Sweet wrote. “MIRA will not stand by quietly while our immigrant communities are under attack.”\n\nBoston-based Lawyers for Civil Rights provides free legal support to people of color, immigrants and low-income people. Executive Director Iván Espinoza-Madrigal described the intervention as “among the most crucial” in the road ahead.\n\nHe highlighted how his firm sued the previous administration to “secure a nationwide injunction preventing the dismantlement of the Fair Housing Act,” “protect Temporary Protected Status,” “block immigration arrests in courthouses,” and “reunite children with their parents during the family separation crisis.”\n\n“Time after time, we have filed lawsuits against the Trump Administration—as we would against any official, blue or red, who tramples on the Constitution,” Espinoza-Madrigal wrote in a statement","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to carry out mass deportations will likely be subject to litigation and other legal fights, says Gov.

Bosa did not speak to media again until his usual Wednesday session, which followed Tuesday's election, where Trump was declared the winner.

Financial markets had a sizable reaction to the U.S. elections despite some of the results still being unclear.\n\nStock Returns\nGlenview Trust, Bloomberg\n\nWhile it is now certain that Donald Trump has regained the presidency and the Republicans will control the Senate, enough votes are still being counted to make the fate of the House of Representatives unclear. Betting markets and other sources indicate that the Republicans should retain a slight majority in the House. Either outcome has historically satisfactory outcomes for stock returns.\n\nU.S. Government Control: Stock Returns (1933-2023)\nGlenview Trust, Strategas\n\nStocks have been higher two-thirds of the time post-election until the end of the year, with a median rise of 3.7%. Focusing on the worst historical return, the decline of 10.2% was after President Obama’s election, with the country mired in recession and a global financial crisis. The results thus far have been better than average, with the S&P 500 rising 3.7% since the election. Politics is not the only factor influencing stocks and is usually not the most critical factor. A detailed analysis of the history of elections and stock returns is here.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSamsung Confirms New Upgrade Choice—Millions Of Galaxy Owners Must Now Decide\n\nOne Of The Best Netflix Shows Ever Made Is Back For Season 2 Today\n\nBest Buy Slashes Samsung Galaxy S24 Price In New Sale\n\nStock Returns Between Presidential Election and Year-End (1952-2020)\nGlenview Trust, Strategas\n\nAccording to Strategas, the year after an open presidential election, with the incumbent not running, the returns from stocks have generally been positive if an economic downturn is avoided. Looking at the two negative results, the U.S. economy entered into recession in the fourth quarter of 1969 and the first quarter of 2001. The year 2000 also marked the popping of the internet stock bubble.\n\nStock Returns 1-Year After Open Presidential Elections\nGlenview Trust, Strategas\n\nWhile the evidence shows that investors should not make macro investment decisions based solely on their political beliefs, it is worth noting the likely policies that could benefit specific companies or industries. President Trump is expected to wield tariffs as a weapon, though China should be his primary target rather than a broad tariff on all countries. Investors should be mindful of China’s exposure to companies in both supply chain and end markets. The Trump administration should be more amenable to mergers and acquisitions than the Biden administration. Regulatory burdens are likely to be reduced, which has already shown up in the performance of bank stocks, which have outperformed the S&P 500 since the election. If the Republicans retain the House, a corporate tax cut becomes more likely. Goldman Sachs estimates that a corporate statutory tax rate reduction to 15% from 21% would boost corporate earnings by 4%. Higher-taxed companies, which include more domestically focused companies and small-caps, would benefit more if the corporate tax rate is reduced.\n\nBond yields have been rising since mid-September as the economy has proved more resilient than expected, and increasing optimism that the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle will allow the economy to avoid a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked after President Trump’s victory but has since settled down slightly higher than before the results. The behavior of bond yields is analogous to many assets after the election, with a knee-jerk reaction followed by some moderation or stability.\n\nU.S. Treasury Yields\nGlenview Trust, Bloomberg\n\nThe silver lining of the increase in yields is that it is due to expectations of better economic growth rather than increasing inflation. Looking at the real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yield illustrates that inflation fears are not the culprit for the rise in yields. Rising yields typically act as a headwind for stocks, but better economic growth leads to higher earnings expectations, which can offset the drag. Economic growth expectations rose, reflected in the sharp increase of real yields after Trump’s election, but have since moderated to slightly above the level prior.\n\nReal U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield\nGlenview Trust, Bloomberg\n\nThe post-election boost in confidence about economic growth translated to a spike in the outperformance of the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks versus the less sensitive defensives. The outperformance has moderated slightly but remains well above pre-election levels.\n\nSmall-cap stocks, defined as the Russell 2000, have seen sharp outperformance after the election. The Russell 2000 has risen by 6.2% since the election. Multiple factors have likely driven this small-cap re-awakening. Small-cap stocks are typically more economically sensitive and would be more significant beneficiaries of any corporate tax cut. In addition, many smaller companies are more domestically focused and have less exposure to any tariff trade war with China. Banks, which soared by 8.2% since the election, are likely to benefit from less regulation but also get a tailwind from lower tax rates and better economic growth.\n\nCyclical Versus Defensive Stocks\nGlenview Trust, Bloomberg\n\nWithin the S&P 500, 102 companies reported earnings last week, and 75% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. With the earnings season nearing completion, the pace of the third-quarter earnings reports slows drastically, with only 11 S&P 500 companies scheduled.\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Season\nGlenview Trust, FactSet, Bloomberg\n\nAmong the companies reporting this week are Home Depot (HD), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Walt Disney (DIS).\n\nAccording to FactSet, the healthcare sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. With the earnings season almost complete, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +5.3% year-over-year, above the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter, and an improvement over the previous week’s 5.1%.\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Season\nGlenview Trust, FactSet\n\nAs expected, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) on Thursday. Markets are pricing in another 25 basis points cut in December, but it is far from a sure thing. Chair Powell’s remarks added little to clarify the situation beyond noting that this was not a time for full-throated forward guidance but that monetary policy is still “restrictive,” which supports better-than-fifty percent odds of a December cut.\n\nIncoming economic data will remain crucial to the pace of future rate cuts. On Wednesday, consumer inflation (CPI) will be parsed for signs of a revival in inflation. Friday’s retail sales will give insights into the health of the U.S. consumer and, thus, the economy, but it is likely to be noisy due to the pull forward of purchases due to the port strike and hurricanes. Hurricane damage from Helene and Milton should boost building material sales in this month's report.\n\nNumber of Fed Rate Cuts Expected\nGlenview Trust, Bloomberg\n\nFinancial markets had a sizable reaction to the U.S. elections despite some of the results still being unclear. Stocks and bonds had a knee-jerk reaction to the election, generally followed by some moderation or stability. Fed Chair Powell provided little guidance for the future pace of rate cuts, so this week’s consumer inflation (CPI) and retail sales data will be closely watched.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

FTX claims that the money targeted in these suits was part of “a campaign of influence-buying” by founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, conducted as the company was struggling to meet its own cashflow needs.\n\nThe lawsuit claims, “These ‘investments’ conveyed little to no benefit to Debtors, and instead served only to prop up Bankman-Fried’s standing in the worlds of politics and traditional finance,” which he then attempted to leverage as “potential sources of equity investment in FTX to fill the hole in the balance sheet and, therefore, keep his scheme afloat.”\n\nSince the company went bankrupt, FTX executives have been convicted of crimes including fraud and money laundering.

The paper says the princess has several official trips overseas lined up with the Prince of Wales in the new year as the princess eases her way back into public life. Meanwhile, the Observer reports that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will make the case for free trade between nations during a keynote speech this week. The paper says the issue puts the government on “direct collision course” with President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to put tariffs on all imports into the US. Ports and supermarkets could be targeted by farmers who are threatening to protest over tax increases, the Sunday Telegraph reports. The paper says the chancellor’s plans to place a 20% inheritance tax on farmers’ assets worth more than £1m have received fierce backlash. The decision has fuelled fears ordinary family farms will be forced out of business, it adds. Reeves is also coming under pressure to rethink her plans to raise £25bn through higher employer national insurance contributions, the Times says, as 200 business leaders are calling on her to water down the tax rise. The paper reports that supermarkets and restaurant chains are being hit particularly hard, with Tesco facing a £1bn increase on its national insurance bill.

SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has criticised the Prime Minister’s so-called Brexit red lines, warning it is “ridiculous” to not rejoin the EU single market and customs union. His intervention comes amid warnings from business groups over the looming threats of tariff on key produce such as Scotch whisky. Mr Trump, the US president-elect who has swept back into power after defeating Kamala Harris in Tuesday’s election, has pledged to install a blanket tariff of up to 20 per cent on all imports. Mr Flynn said: “Keir Starmer’s Brexit red lines were always ridiculous. The reality of a Trump presidency must now make them redundant. “It is basic common sense that if Trump tariffs become a reality, the only economic security and protection the UK can possibly seek is through rejoining the EU single market and customs union – the largest in the world. “That is now the only path to protect our businesses and consumers in the face of deep economic uncertainty and the damage of global protectionism. “If the Labour party is stubbornly saying it won’t now drop its self-imposed red lines, then it is deliberately choosing to inflict economic self-harm on Scotland and the rest of the UK. Labour will be every bit as responsible for broken, Brexit Britain as the Tories who imposed it in the first place. “Everyone knows that Britain is broken - but neither the Labour Party or the Tories are honest enough to admit that Brexit broke it.” In last month’s UK Budget, prior to the US election result, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned “weak growth in imports and exports over the medium term partly reflect the continuing impact of Brexit, which we expect to reduce the overall trade intensity of the UK economy by 15 per cent in the long term”. The impending threat of tariffs comes with the Scotch whisky industry already reeling from the decision to increase alcohol duty on non-draught products in the UK Budget. The Scotch Whisky Association had described that move as a “hammer blow”, accusing Sir Keir of breaking his promises. Mr Trump’s victory has separately sparked fears from Scottish business groups, with industry leaders expressing “clear concerns” that follow the Republican politician’s first presidency. Speaking to The Scotsman, Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), said: “There are some clear concerns inherited from President Trump's first term, such as increased tariffs on wine and spirit products and the sector becoming collateral damage in non-industry related trade disputes once again. “On the other hand, there is the opportunity of a US-UK free trade agreement. What is certain is that the WSTA remains committed to working with officials, drinks trade associations, companies and other stakeholders on both sides of the Atlantic to advance the cause of the UK wine and spirit industry.” The concerns inherited refer to spirits and some EU wines ending up as collateral damage in tariff wars related to steel. According to HMRC, UK exports of wine and spirits to the US totalled almost £1.4 billion in 2023. Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), warned smaller companies would suffer the most from any new tariffs. He said: “Our latest research shows the US is the top market outside the EU for small firms who trade internationally, including specialist food and drink producers. Of those which trade internationally, more than half (59 per cent) export to the US and nearly a third (32 per cent) import goods. “The overall cost of international trade is already one of the main barriers facing small businesses who trade overseas or consider doing so. For that reason, any new tariffs and non-tariff barriers are likely to hit smaller exporters the hardest.\" The warning comes as MPs reflected on the US election result, prompting a debate on what Mr Trump’s second term as president will mean for Britain. Several MPs told The Scotsman it was vital to restore trust in politics to avoid the election here of a figure like Mr Trump. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem MP for Orkney and Shetland, said: “The last thing we can afford is to assume that what has happened in the US cannot happen here, whether in the UK as a whole or in Scotland specifically. Authoritarian, illiberal leaders are making progress in many corners of the world and often for the same reasons – dissatisfaction with the state of the economy and the way politics works for regular people. “If we do not shape up and reform our politics, then before too long we could end up with the same result. That means things like electoral reform, but it also means making a fairer economy, taking action to address the grievances that people like Trump exploit so effectively.” Scottish Labour’s Graeme Downie, the Dunfermline and Dollar MP, suggested it was a reminder the UK government had to convince people it was delivering for them, and also listen to the public’s concerns. He said: “First, we've got to deliver and be seen to deliver. I think that's the absolute key. We can't be bashful about who we're delivering for either - those with the least, the very people who feel disaffected. “Second, front foot positive, almost brash all the time. No apologising for doing what we said we would do. Three, don't tell people they've never had it so good because the stats say so. You can't make people feel things are better. “Four, end of the day it's money in your pocket. Is working hard worthwhile? If not forget it. Five, don't be afraid of any issue like immigration. Be forward about it, listen don't dismiss.” Scottish Tory MP John Cooper, who represents Dumfries and Galloway, suggested UK figures could learn from Mr Trump’s campaign being rooted in issues “that matter to people”. He said: “His ‘America first’ doctrine resonates with millions who worry about their jobs, healthcare, security. “That’s something of which Westminster parties should be aware. The bien pensants of the left like to label others as right or far right. But the electorate are more sophisticated - they can be ‘left’ on, say, the NHS, but ‘right’ on immigration. Parties need to shape policy based on that and we must not allow others us to tell us where we are on their political spectrum. “It’s not far right, for example, to want us to spend more on defence. That’s going to be an issue very quickly as Trump has made it clear Europe and Nato cannot ride on America's defence dime. Labour’s woolly promises to increase UK defence spending will not survive contact with a White House that will demand a clear pathway to at least 2.5 per cent of GDP, not the current ‘in due course’ fudge. “And trade wars will also be an issue. We could, outwith the EU as we are, have hoped to talk direct to the Trump team about major exports such as Scotch. But we are off to a dreadful start with Labour’s bid to back Kamala Harris in the campaign, and embarrassing student-politic quotes from the likes of the Foreign Secretary [David Lammy]. “He’s said to have had dinner with the president-elect - I assume he had an extra helping of humble pie.” On the call for closer ties with Europe, a UK government spokesperson said: \"This government will look forwards and not reopen the divisions of the past. We are working to improve our trade and investment relationship with our European friends and tear down unnecessary trade barriers, while recognising that there will be no return to the single market, customs union or freedom of movement.\"","summary":"The message issued by the SNP follows a big win for Donald Trump in the US election","url":"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/donald-trump-victory-means-starmer-must-change-his-stance-on-europe-snp-say-4859332","image":"https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjk4N2Y3YzI0LWY3ZTYtNDdmNi05ZjdlLWJmZTI5NTQ5MzQ2MTplN2ZiMDQ5Yy0xMGIyLTRmZWUtOGMzNi0xNDI3OTA4NjE5OTE=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-10 00:01:33","author":"Alexander Brown","authors":["Alexander Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.089},{"id":263812892,"title":"US and China must 'get along,' Xi tells Trump","text":"Chinese President Xi Jinping said Thursday Beijing and Washington must find a way to \"get along\" in a message to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, state media reported.\n\nTrump's crushing presidential victory ushers in a new era of uncertainty in the United States and the world, and heralds a possible shift in U.S.-China relations, frayed in recent years by tensions over everything from trade to the status of self-ruled Taiwan.\n\nIn his first message to Trump since the former president secured a second term, Xi said \"history has shown that China and the United States benefit from cooperation and suffer from confrontation,\" state broadcaster CCTV said.\n\n\"A stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship is in the common interest of both countries and is in line with the expectations of the international community,\" Xi said.\n\nHe called for Washington and Beijing to \"strengthen dialogue and communication\" and \"properly manage differences.\"\n\nThe two countries must \"find a correct way... to get along in this new era, to benefit both countries and the world,\" Xi said.\n\nChinese Vice President Han Zheng also sent a message to vice president-elect JD Vance, CCTV said.\n\nBoth Republican Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris had pledged to get tougher on Beijing.\n\nBut Trump upped the ante, vowing to slap 60 percent tariffs on all Chinese goods entering the United States.\n\nThe president-elect aims to \"restore some level of balance in the U.S.-China trade,\" Yun Sun, a Senior Fellow at the Stimson Center, told AFP.\n\n\"Given his arts of 'maximum pressure' before striking a deal, I do expect him to impose the tariff,\" she added.\n\n'Mutual respect' \n\nOn Thursday the Chinese leader said he hoped \"that both sides will uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation\".\n\nBeijing this week declared its hope that the two countries could enjoy a \"peaceful coexistence\" in the future, while remaining tight-lipped on how precisely the mercurial magnate's victory could affect ties.\n\nXi and Trump have previously met four times, and the former president has touted his \"very strong relationship\" with the Chinese leader.\n\nHe has also claimed he would be able to talk Xi out of an attack on self-ruled Taiwan with threats of 150 percent tariffs.\n\nAnalysts had said the election outcome would be a key focus of this week's gathering of top lawmakers in Beijing, aimed at ironing out a stimulus plan to boost China's struggling economy.\n\nChief among the concerns will be how Beijing responds to Trump's expected huge tariff hike, which asset managers PineBridge Investments have suggested could hit $500 billion worth of Chinese exports.\n\n\"We expect the Chinese government to respond with limited retaliation and more domestic policy support to the economy, to partially offset the negative impact,\" Tao Wang, Chief China Economist at UBS Investment Research, told AFP.

While bipartisan opposition to China remains strong and US-Philippine relations are generally stable, Marcos should anticipate a more quid pro quo approach when it comes to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, he said.\nFinding a balance “between helping advance US interests in East and Southeast Asia on one hand, and enhancing the Philippines’ own defensive posture on the other, will be critical to ensuring continued diplomatic gains,” Parada said.\n\nRegarding diplomatic styles, the defence analyst contrasted Trump’s brash, businesslike approach with Marcos’ more traditional statesmanship.\n“Trump has cultivated a reputation as a ‘say it as it is’ leader, foregoing the formality and pleasantries usually associated with statesmen,” Parada said.\n“He’s very much like [former Philippine president] Rodrigo Duterte in that regard, which might explain their relatively positive relationship during his first term in office. These have led to concerns regarding the unpredictability of US foreign policy under Trump 2.0.”\nConversely, Marcos is seen as a well-travelled leader with a generally positive international image. “If he plays his cards right, he could capitalise on Trump’s strong anti-China sentiment”, to gain concessions from the US that would increase its military footprint in the Indo-Pacific, Parada said.\n“To do this, he has to be able to communicate that, in so far as the US-Philippine alliance was concerned, Trump [and America] are the first among two equals,” he added.\n\nAnalysts agree that Marcos must employ both public and personal diplomacy. Muhammad Faizal Bin Abdul Rahman, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies’ Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore, said that Trump is likely to continue the transactional approach to foreign policy and defence relations with allies seen in his first term.\nUnder Trump’s first administration, allies were often criticised for not contributing enough to defence.\n“In some ways, the Philippines is competing for the US’ strategic attention and military support vis-a-vis Ukraine, Nato and Israel,” Rahman told This Week in Asia, adding that the Philippines “stands in good stead as it is an ally and an Indo-Pacific country that has been proactively expanding defence cooperation with other US allies”.\n“It is likely that Trump 2.0 finds it useful that the Philippines has been assertively pushing back against China,” he added.\nVina Nadjibulla, vice-president of research and strategy at the Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada, stressed the importance of building personal relations with Trump and his inner circle.\n“Trump’s more assertive views and stance on China aligns with President Marcos Jnr’s policies and positions and can be the area for more engagement between the two,” Nadjibulla told This Week in Asia.\nHowever, with a more unpredictable US foreign policy, Nadjibulla said that the Philippines should also deepen strategic partnerships “with democracies like Canada and many EU countries” as well.\n\nNo priority treatment\nPolitical analyst Edmund Tayao, president and CEO of the Political Economic Elemental Researchers and Strategists think tank, urged caution. He believes expectations should be tempered by the realities of Trump’s first term, which saw a scaling back of US involvement in global affairs.\n“It significantly scaled down US involvement practically everywhere from Southeast Asia to South Korea to the European Union. So, this is likely the same theme that will define Trump 2.0,” Tayao said.\nAs for the nature of their interaction, Tayao predicted a friendly relationship but warned “we cannot expect though that we will be given the same priority treatment”, particularly regarding issues like the West Philippine Sea – Manila’s name for the parts of the South China Sea it claims.\n“I would even hazard a guess that China and Russia are now celebrating,” he said.\nTo advance its interests in the West Philippine Sea, Manila may need to forge a truly independent foreign policy, according to Tayao – a strategy that was not fully explored during the Biden administration.\n“We should focus and invest on strengthening relations with Southeast Asia, even making concrete efforts to push for a restructured and more unified Asean.” he said.\n“We shouldn’t pursue unusually close relations with either China or the US, especially learning more now how volatile the political situation is worldwide.”","summary":"Analysts warn that Donald Trump’s transactional style will require President Marcos to demonstrate his country’s strategic importance.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3285809/marcos-faces-trump-test-can-philippines-count-continued-us-support","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/08/4fda7300-78a2-4026-8760-266af5ca24d2_e55df736.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-10 00:00:09","author":"Jeoffrey Maitem","authors":["Jeoffrey Maitem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.444},{"id":263813850,"title":"In Baku, will climate action trump a defiant prez-elect?","text":"Baku: As negotiators make their way to the Azerbaijan capital for the UN climate talks (COP29), the big question on their minds is the implication of Donald Trump's election as the 47th President of the US. The President-elect has made no secret of his disdain for the multilateral climate regime, and is expected to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, and maybe even the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. A formal notice to withdraw can be given only after January 20 when Trump takes office. It will be a year before the formal process of withdrawal is completed. The US, though lame duck, will be present and negotiating at Baku. It will have serious implications for negotiations to set a new goal for climate finance to be provided to developing countries by the rich industrialised ones. The US delegation, known for their fearsome legal expertise, will be working around the clock to ensure that whatever is agreed to on finance is something that they can be part of in the future, said Camilla Born, an independent expert who served as a senior advisor to the UK's COP26 Presidency. We won't have the flexibility that might have been there if the US were not a party, she said. The US will therefore be negotiating to ensure that there is an opportunity to return to the multilateral climate talks. 115123089The world has been in this situation before - in 2016 in Marrakesh, Morocco - when Trump was elected for his first term. Negotiators from developed and developing countries point out that even under President Joe Biden, the US has not been the most forthcoming on climate finance for developing countries.Challenge for Rest of the World“On that count, I don't think much has changed,” said Mohamed Adow, founding director of the Nairobi-based think Power Shift Africa.However, Adow said that challenge is now for rest of the world, particularly Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada. “Can they actually step forward and provide them much needed confidence that the rest of the developing countries are looking for,” he asked.This is where the talks on climate finance get complicated. The EU and its members have been leading the table on providing climate finance. But tighter budgets, particularly for lead contributors like Germany and France, are likely to mean less room to manoeuvre. Some experts and negotiators are of the view that the EU is likely to be even more rigid on its demand that developing nations, which have since 1992 become richer and their emissions risen considerably, should become contributors.","summary":"As negotiators gather in Baku for COP29, the impact of Donald Trump's election on climate finance takes center stage.

Don’t let McConnell get away with it again.”\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Scott outlined that he was running for the leadership position to “upend the status quo & make sure President Trump’s agenda gets done.”\n\nSenators Ron Johnson, Rand Paul and Bill Hagerty also announced Saturday that they would back the Florida Senator in the race.\n\nBack in February, after McConnell announced he would be stepping down at the end of the year, Donald Trump Jr also labeled Thune and Cornyn as “RINOs,” or Republicans in name only.\n\nThe president-elect’s son wrote: “Both of them also voted to send billions more to Ukraine. MAGA must do everything in our power to stop either of these two RINOs from ever becoming Senate Leader!”\n\nTrump also previously slammed Cornyn after he successfully negotiated bipartisan gun safety legislation, claiming the Texas Senator facilitated “the first step in the movement to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY.”\n\nOn Friday, the National Association for Gun Rights also issued a statement against Cornyn: “The arch traitor John Cornyn is being floated as the next Senate Majority Leader. This absolutely cannot be allowed to happen.”\n\n“All of the momentum we have gained for gun rights could hit a wall if the man who spearheaded the largest gun control bill in decades is in charge,” the group said.\n\nAlthough he faced a barrage of criticism from his own party for backing this bill, he stood by his work, telling the Texas Tribune in 2022: “This was fundamentally important to the country at a time when things are so polarized and people are so intolerant of others that have different points of view.”\n\nMissouri Senator Josh Hawley backed Cornyn, telling Fox News in a statement: “I know he will work closely and effectively with President Trump to deliver on the promise of our new majority. I’m delighted to give him my support.”\n\nHeritage Action, the sister organization of the Heritage Foundation which is responsible for Project 2025, provided scorecards for Senators ranked by how conservative they’ve voted. Senator Scott scored 92 per cent, compared to Senator Thune with 37 per cent and Senator Thune with 35 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the South Dakota Senator told CNBC on Thursday that while he understood that Trump could “exert a considerable amount of influence” on the Senate leadership race, “my preference would be, and I think it’s probably in his best interest, to stay out of that.” He continued: “These Senate secret ballot elections are probably best left to senators, and he’s got to work with all of us when it’s all said and done.”\n\nThune received the support of Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin, according to Punchbowl News.\n\nTrump has yet to publicly endorse any of the three contenders.\n\nWhile sources told Axios that Trump privately brushed off Scott’s bid as “not serious,” a Trump spokesperson refuted that claim, telling the outlet that the former president “hasn’t weighed in on the leadership race and anyone who says differently is wrong.”","summary":"‘Two of the three candidates hate Trump and what he ran on,’ the former Fox anchor claims","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tucker-carlson-senate-republicans-coup-trump-b2644385.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/01/05/c4f2f64636304e1f92e0510533716a57.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PpOvY8zi-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-09 23:56:46","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":263812210,"title":"Biden is the fall guy?

The notion was that their presence would sprinkle fairydust over Harris, who, despite being Vice President for four years, remained a little-known quantity.\n\nBut the appearance of some of America’s most popular female celebrities alongside her failed to get her elected.\n\nInstead, their support may have damaged her chances.\n\nCelebrity endorsement is a risky business. The appeal of a well-known name is often offset by those they alienate. While Harris’s famous women supporters undoubtedly added stardust to her campaign, they may well have diluted the attention from the less famous Democrat candidate, positioning her as more of a warm-up act than the main attraction.\n\nGenerally, it’s most effective when the product and endorser seem a natural fit. In Harris’s case, there was something a bit queasy about this arrangement – while, as much as I hate to say it, the pairing of Trump and Elon Musk felt more authentic.\n\nWe may succumb to celebrity endorsement when it involves a lipstick brand or a fast-food chain but even so there’s never a guarantee it will work. Many a celebrity perfume has fallen at the first hurdle – i.e. never actually being bought. And while books written by TV celebrities frequently hit the bestseller lists, their endorsement on the cover of others invariably fail to shift sales.\n\nKamala Harris’s girl squad was great entertainment but when it came to the American people choosing who was going to be in charge of their country, being told what to think by a parade of multi-millionaires totally backfired.\n\nKemi’s cabinet is packed with clones\n\nOn this side of the Atlantic, where interest in Kemi Badenoch’s new Shadow Cabinet has been marginalised by the US election, I have a question about the outfit choice of her male colleagues. Did they receive a memo decreeing navy blue suits and short back and sides for their first photo-op?\n\nIf not, why did they look indistinguishable from one another, particularly given that so few are household names? I doubt I am the only person who wouldn’t recognise Gareth Bacon or Alan Mak if I found them at my front door.\n\nMy recommendation would be for them to add a bit of individuality to their appearance. Pronto.\n\nThe battle to make Waterloo alluring\n\nThere's something ineffably depressing about railway stations nowadays. Once, large city stations were great temples of modernity, with vast glass ceilings, impressive facades and wrought iron arches spanning huge platforms. Today, all that remains of such magnificent architecture is unfortunately hidden.\n\nTravelling to Salisbury last week from London’s Waterloo, I sat sadly on a new uncomfortable bench, seemingly deliberately positioned so passengers can’t see the departure boards, while drinking a cup of the only disgusting coffee available.\n\nApparently, Waterloo was never intended to be a terminus but a stop on the South West and London line that ended in the City.\n\nMeanwhile, the grand dames of Paddington and Victoria and the important stations of Manchester and Birmingham are equally grim.\n\nIf we are to be encouraged to ditch our cars in favour of rail, something must be done to make stations more enjoyable places to linger – especially since lingering is frequently the experience.\n\nIn praise of my saint Maria\n\nMaria comes to our house for a few hours on Tuesday and Thursday. Yes, she cleans the place immaculately but she does so much more. She irons and folds, tidies cupboards and drawers, replaces missing buttons, sweeps leaves, moves furniture… I can go on. \n\nThe term ‘cleaner’ by no means explains her role or relationship with us, is far more personal and essential. But she’s not a ‘housekeeper’, who is more of a permanent overseer of the domestic arena, nor is she a ‘daily’, since she only visits twice a week and, in any case, that word is only slightly better than ‘char’ or ‘maid’.\n\nI know I’m fortunate to be able to employ somebody to do my dirty work, which is why I want an elevated word to describe Maria. This saintly character, who brings order to our lives, one of the few people guaranteed to leave our small world of the home better than she found it, deserves better.\n\nOne whiff you can never get rid of\n\nIt sounds as if playwright Polly Stenham, who has won in a legal action brought by her landlord, didn’t have a Maria in her life.\n\nHer property’s owner claimed that when her two-month tenancy ended, the sofa was stained with ink, there were scuff marks on the paintwork and a vile smell of cat urine. It’s the latter that will have really done the damage.\n\nMaria or no Maria, cat pee is one of the most insidious and invasive stinks, desperately hard to get rid of and not easy to avoid. The only thing worse are those horrible air fresheners people put in their loos.\n\nIs tea towel a little common, Nicky?\n\nI don't know whether air fresheners have ever featured on designer Nicky Haslam’s annual tea towel list of what he deems common and whose 2024 iteration includes such gems as fire pits, WhatsApp and Primrose Hill.\n\nUnwise as it may be to query Nicky, who has made a career out of pronouncing on what’s acceptable and unacceptable, I suggest using the word ‘tea towel’ is itself common. Surely it smacks of the very genteelness that’s the epitome of common. Isn’t ‘dish cloth’, eminently more chic?","summary":"Greggs must be hoping that Nigella's endorsement of its Christmas bakery range is more successful than the backing given by world-famous women for Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14063591/alexandra-shulman-notebook-girl-squad-kamala.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/09/21/91892443-0-image-m-51_1731187433370.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 23:46:23","author":"Alexandra Shulman,Editor","authors":["Alexandra Shulman","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":263812252,"title":"Long Bitter Foes, US and Russia Face Prospect of Talks After Trump Election Win","text":"In the run-up to last week’s U.S. election, former President Donald Trump pledged to quickly end the war in Ukraine. Now that he has secured a second term in office, speculation is rife as to how he intends to do so.\n\nThe conflict will have been ongoing for almost three years when Trump returns to the White House on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nFrancis Boyle, a foreign policy analyst, points to recent comments made by Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), Trump’s running mate, which suggest “potential outlines” for a negotiated solution.\n\n“I suspect Vance coordinated those comments with Trump,” Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, told The Epoch Times.\n\nHe did not provide further detail about the proposed demilitarized zone, or its precise geographical location, other than to say it should be “heavily fortified.”\n\nRussia, meanwhile, according to Vance, would receive a “guarantee of neutrality” from Kyiv, meaning that Ukraine would abandon its bid to join the NATO alliance.\n\nRussia’s foreign ministry, meanwhile, said that Moscow will continue to defend its “national interests”—regardless of who occupies the White House.\n\n“Russia will work with the new [U.S.] administration … by firmly defending its national interests and staying focused on achieving all goals set in the special military operation,” the ministry said in a Nov. 6 statement.\n\n“Our terms have not changed and are well known in Washington,” it added.\n\nIn 2022—two years after the end of Trump’s first term—Russia invaded and effectively annexed large swathes of eastern and southeastern Ukraine.\n\nSince then, the United States has remained among Ukraine’s staunchest supporters, providing Kyiv with a vast array of military hardware—and billions of dollars—to stave off the Russian invasion.\n\nAs articulated by Putin, Moscow’s terms for ending the conflict include the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from all territories claimed by Russia, along with written guarantees that Ukraine would permanently stay out of NATO.\n\nKyiv, however, has vehemently rejected these terms, and has vowed to continue fighting Russia for the recovery of all lost territories.\n\nSpeaking in Budapest on Nov. 7, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that any concessions to Russia—territorial or otherwise—were “unacceptable.”\n\n“There has been much talk about the need to yield to Putin … to make some concessions,” Zelenskyy said, according to local media. He went on to say that such an outcome is “unacceptable for Ukraine, and suicidal for all Europe.”\n\nDespite Kyiv’s adamant stance, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has voiced Moscow’s willingness to listen to “any proposals” tabled by Trump and his foreign policy team.\n\n“If there is an initiative to sit down and have a frank conversation about where we stand and how we should move forward—without any unilateral demands—we will be ready for that,” Lavrov told reporters on Nov. 7.\n\nOn the same day, Putin congratulated Trump on his electoral win and signaled his readiness to negotiate.\n\n“What has been said [by Trump] about the desire to restore relations with Russia [and] contribute to the end of the Ukrainian crisis … deserves attention,” Putin said at a high-profile forum in the Russian city of Sochi.\n\nHe cited a number of documents that he believes could form the basis for talks.\n\nThese include two Russian draft treaties from late 2021, which called—among other things—for a permanent ban on Ukrainian NATO membership.\n\nIn January 2022, NATO and Washington rejected the draft treaties, prompting Russia to launch its initial invasion of Ukraine the following month.\n\n“Obviously, they [the two draft treaties] set forth the maximalist Russian position. But they were eminently negotiable,” Boyle said.\n\n“Lavrov has always stated that the key factor is a commitment in writing that Ukraine cannot join NATO. I think that’s their bottom line—everything else can be negotiated or finessed,” he said.\n\n“Putin also recently said he was prepared to go back to the Istanbul treaty,” Boyle said, referring to a Russia–Ukraine cease-fire agreement that was almost signed in March of 2022.\n\nSome experts, however, view Trump’s pledge to end the conflict upon taking office as overly optimistic.\n\n“It’s unrealistic to expect negotiations, at least for the first several months of the Trump administration,” Stanislav Aleksandrovich Pritchin, a Russian political analyst, told The Epoch Times.\n\n“I don’t expect any progress, at least in the short term,” said Pritchin, who heads the Central Asia desk at Russia’s Institute of World Economy and International Relations.\n\nDespite Putin’s stated willingness to negotiate, Pritchin said, there are “still uncertainties about the possibility of talks, especially with Zelenskyy’s team.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Nov. 8, Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, echoed these sentiments, saying: “Nothing can resolve this issue so quickly.”\n\nNevertheless, Peskov commended Trump for “eyeing peace instead of conflict,” which, he said, the outgoing U.S. administration has been unwilling to do.\n\nBoyle was more direct, saying the current administration in Washington is composed largely of “Russophobic warmongers.”\n\n“I would think the Russians are pleased that the Democrats are out of power in the White House and Senate, and maybe the House,” he said.\n\nBoyle went on to cite Article 33 of the U.N. Charter, which, he said, “requires negotiation as a legal obligation.”\n\nWhile the Biden administration has made little secret of its disdain for Putin, Trump kept on good terms with the Russian leader during his first term in office.\n\nPritchin acknowledged that there had been “good personal relations between the two leaders.”\n\n“But we didn’t see any progress in terms of U.S.–Russia relations because the U.S. political system—and Trump’s [first] administration—was full of radical politicians who espoused hardline positions against Russia,” he said.\n\nIn this regard, Pritchin drew a distinction between Trump’s approach to Moscow and “that of the [U.S.] political and administrative system,” particularly the defense and security establishment. The latter, Pritchin said, remains “opposed to any relations—or negotiations—with Russia.”\n\nAccording to Boyle, diplomacy requires a good rapport between heads of state that “facilitates negotiations, even if they disagree with each other’s position.”\n\n“Hopefully, this time, Trump will bring more reasonable people in the area of foreign affairs,” he said. “We’ll just have to see how he fills those slots.”","summary":"Relations with Moscow—and the fate of Ukraine—take center stage as Trump gears up to return to the White House.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/long-bitter-foes-us-and-russia-face-prospect-of-talks-after-trump-election-win-5756786","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/03/15/GettyImages-1152460535-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 23:43:44","author":"Adam Morrow","authors":["Adam Morrow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":263811024,"title":"What could a second Trump presidency mean for immigration policy?","text":"What could a second Trump presidency mean for immigration policy?

Everyone deserves the same amount of help.'\n\nImages also obtained by the outlet of the system used to document what homes they visited show notes being left that said: 'Trump sign, no contact per leadership'.\n\nBut the Trump-related remarks were reportedly deleted from the group chat a few days after she posted them. \n\nNews of Washington's order outraged Lake Placid residents, with Mayor John Holbrook telling the New York Post her discrimination 'really sickens me.'\n\n'There are no parties when we are recovering.'\n\nMilton had ripped through The Sunshine State in early October just two weeks after the misery brought by Hurricane Helene. \n\nOver 30 people died after the storm wrecked catastrophe on communities, with homes left ruined as it caused an estimated $50billion in damage across the state.\n\nAn employee under Washington's supervision later filed a complaint about the guidance with the federal Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA. \n\nNow, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is demanding answers.\n\nShe wrote a letter to the agency on Friday, asking Criswell to provide answers about what she knew of Washington's instructions, what actions FEMA had taken and when it first became aware of the guidance.\n\nAdditionally, Luna is asking the agency what actions it has taken to ensure that the homes that were skipped will receive necessary aid. \n\nShe demanded Criswell respond by November 25.\n\n'My district was one of the most heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton, and it has been sickening to hear that more than half of my constituents were discriminated against for their political beliefs,' Luna told The Daily Wire on Saturday.\n\nShe went on to claim that 'big government bureaucrats despise everyday Americans because they are not politically expedient to them.\n\n'I'll demand answers from FEMA Administrator Criswell, and Congress must fully investigate this matter,' Luna said. 'The days of putting Americans and America last are over.'\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has also announced that he has ordered a state investigation into Washington's edict. \n\n'The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days,' the governor said.\n\n'At my direction, the Division of Emergency Management is launching an investigation into the federal government’s targeted discrimination of Floridians who support Donald Trump. \n\n'New leadership is on the way in DC, and I’m optimistic that these partisan bureaucrats will be fired.'\n\nTrump wound up winning Florida's 30 electoral votes, with the Associated Press calling the race just one hour after polls closed, when the president-elect was ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris by more than 11 percent with 86 percent of the votes counted.","summary":"Marn'i Washington, 38, has been fired from her position as a supervisor with the Federal Emergency Management Agency after she told subordinates to skip homes with Trump signs.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14063933/FEMA-Marni-Washington-avoid-Florida-homes-Trump-signs-fired.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/09/23/91895085-0-image-m-15_1731195095853.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 23:38:17","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":263812702,"title":"AP Race Call: Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez wins reelection to U.S. House in Washington's 3rd Congressional District","text":"WASHINGTON - Democratic Rep.

(Photo illustration by ... [+] Chesnot/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nBitcoin finished up a big week on Friday, November 8, after the digital currency reached a fresh, all-time high following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe world’s most prominent cryptocurrency climbed to as much as $77,312.18 on Friday, according to Coinbase data provided by TradingView.\n\nAt this point, the digital asset had risen more than 12% over the course of seven days and was trading at an all-new record, additional Coinbase figures show.\n\nAfter attaining this latest high, bitcoin retraced slightly, but still retained the vast majority of its recent gains for the rest of the day.\n\nWhen asked to explain the cryptocurrency’s price movements over the last week, market experts identified a short list of causal factors.\n\nTrump Victory Bullish For Crypto\n\nThe first and most salient development they pointed out as driving the digital currency’s recent fluctuations was this year’s U.S. presidential election, which resulted in a clear win for Trump, who will be serving a second term starting in January.\n\nSeveral analysts emphasized how positive this outcome could be for the crypto/blockchain industry.\n\n“Crypto enthusiasts are generally thrilled to see Trump in office, as he’s been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and blockchain technology,” Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, stated via email.\n\nBitcoin Surges To Fresh High Above $76,000 After Trump Secures Victory\n\nThe TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O also weighed in, stressing that Trump’s open support of both Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general has been highly bullish for the digital currency markets.\n\nShe stated through a direct message sent through X (formerly Twitter) that up until recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s aggressive approach toward many crypto industry participants basically put the sector at a standstill, which in turn prompted some companies in the space to move to jurisdictions with more friendly regulations.\n\n“Now that Trump is elected, faith has been restored in the crypto industry long term as comprehensive regulation, the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and the ability for individuals to remain in control of their own keys was promised by Trump,” Wendy O continued.\n\nSifling also shed some light on how the outcome of the 2024 presidential election will likely affect financial and economic policy, including the crypto regulatory framework, and how these developments will combine to impact assets like stocks and digital currencies like bitcoin.\n\n“While the current regulators have given crypto companies mixed signals, I believe people are under the impression that Trump will put forth a plan to cement America’s place in the world’s crypto ecosystem,” he stated.\n\n“People like Gary Gensler have also waged war on crypto during his term as a regulator and market participants believe he will soon be replaced with someone more favorable to the industry,” said Sifling.\n\n“This, combined with general optimism about de-regulation and less taxes, have created quite the favorable backdrop for risk-on assets like Bitcoin going forward.”\n\nBrett Munster, portfolio manager for Blockforce Capital, also offered his views on how Trump’s victory could result in a significant change in the regulatory framework of the world’s largest economy.\n\n“A Trump presidency offers a potential shift for the crypto industry, moving it from years of regulatory hostility to a much more favorable position,” he wrote via email. “Trump’s campaign took a notably pro-crypto stance, far stronger than Harris's platform, signaling potential support for digital assets at the federal level.”\n\n“Even if some of Trump’s promises were campaign rhetoric, a neutral or hands-off stance would be a substantial improvement over the prior administration’s more adversarial approach,” Munster noted.\n\nDownballot Victory A A\n\nThe portfolio manager shed further light on the situation, claiming that the nation’s government officials are becoming increasingly open to digital currencies.\n\n“Notably, it wasn’t just Trump’s win that hints at a favorable regulatory environment for crypto,” he stated. “In Ohio, Bernie Moreno’s victory over incumbent Sherrod Brown—one of the Senate’s most vocal crypto critics and former Chair of the Senate Banking Committee—represents a major win for the industry.”\n\n“Moreno is a strong proponent of crypto, and with Tim Scott, another outspoken supporter, likely to chair the Banking Committee, the Senate's influence on crypto policy may take a pro-industry turn. Scott’s public advocacy, underscored by his appearance at Bitcoin 2024, exemplifies a growing pro-crypto sentiment in Congress,” said Munster.\n\nFed Cuts Rates In November\n\nSeveral analysts also highlighted the Federal Open Market Committee’s decision to cut rates once again at the November policy meeting.\n\nFollowing this event, the FOMC announced via a statement that it was lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, reducing it between 450 and 475 bp.\n\nIndependent cryptocurrency analyst Armando Aguilar spoke to this development, stating that it was helping inject the markets with more bullish sentiment.\n\nThe fed funds rate has implications for a wide range of borrowing costs, and lowering it can make it easier for consumers and businesses to obtain credit, which can in turn help stimulate more robust economic growth.\n\nMany different risk assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies, might benefit from stronger economic conditions and the impact they have on the mindset of global investors.\n\nDisclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL.","summary":"The world’s most prominent digital currency reached as much as $77,312.18 today, according to Coinbase data provided by TradingView.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/11/09/bitcoin-wraps-up-a-big-week-after-trump-victory-spurs-fresh-high/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/664551cbcfdc0dd464a6468c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 23:32:10","author":"Charles Lloyd Bovaird II,Senior Contributor,Wendy O","authors":["Charles Lloyd Bovaird II","Senior Contributor","Wendy O"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":263809776,"title":"Im Told Youve Said Bad Things When Donald Trump Rings Kevin Rudd","text":"Weekend Paper Delivery \n + Full Digital Access \n \n Features\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Weekend Paper Delivery \n + Full Digital Access \n \n Features\n \n \n \n \n $10/ WEEK \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n $10/ WEEK \n \n ($40 min. cost) charged every 4 weeks.* \n \n \n ($40 min. cost) charged every 4 weeks.* \n *Read the fine print\n \n \n \n THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW\n \n Full Digital Access + Weekend Paper Delivery $40 charged every 4 weeks.
