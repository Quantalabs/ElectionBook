He believes she will cut jobs by banning fracking and shutting down nuclear plants.\n\nMeanwhile, the former president wishes to encourage oil and gas companies to expand fracking, creating job opportunities for Pennsylvanians.\n\n“We will make Pennsylvania an energy supplier to the entire world,” he said, before playfully proclaiming, “drill, baby drill.”\n\nHarris encouraged a fracking ban before taking office, but now says she wouldn’t impose restrictions if she becomes president.\n\nTrump said it was “very special to be here” in Pennsylvania, especially after he survived an assassination attempt just hours away.\n\nFour days ago, he bravely returned to Butler with tech giant Elon Musk to urge supporters to “vote, vote, vote.”\n\nDuring his latest rally, the ex-president paid tribute to Corey Comperatore, a father who tragically lost his life while shielding his family from gunfire at the gathering in Butler.\n\nBut he also took time to acknowledge the efforts of his team in fundraising millions for Comperatore’s grieving family. He praised loyal supporters who stood their ground courageously in the face of the shooting incident.\n\nTo end the rally, Trump vowed to end the war in Ukraine, protect free speech, and defend the Second Amendment.\n\n“Every day will be filled with opportunity and hope,” he said.\n\n“But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all.”\n\nFIGHT FOR THE BLUE\n\nPennsylvania is a crucial swing state that Trump barely lost in 2020, sacrificing 20 electoral votes to Biden.\n\nHowever, recent polling found he’s edged 2 points ahead of Harris in the state, The Hill reported.\n\nTrump is planning to spend the majority of his time in Democratic states for the next month, including Colorado, California, Illinois, and New York.\n\nHe scheduled an event in New York City’s Madison Square Garden days before polls open in early November.\n\nTrump and Harris are both hunkering down to keep campaigning while another historic storm is set to make landfall in Florida.\n\nHurricane Milton is forecast to blaze through a Florida that is still recovering from the devastating brought on by Helene.\n\nThe storms have canceled a couple of events for the candidates, forcing Harris to reschedule one Miami, Florida, event for Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nBiden is also struggling under the pressure of the wreckage, as he canceled a trip to Germany and Angola to stay in the US for support.\n\nIt comes as…\n\nJames Davis, the former communication director of the 2012 Republican National Convention, expressed in an interview with The U.S. Sun that he sees the hurricanes as a potential pivotal moment for voters.\n\nHe linked the federal government’s response to Helene to Katrina rescue efforts in 2005 and felt that officials had dropped the ball.\n\n“Given their response to this hurricane, I cannot see that they’re anywhere in play for them. It’s been really atrocious,” he said.\n\n“It drives a national narrative of ‘Where are you spending your time?’\n\n“You might live in one of those Rustbelt states but have friends or family in the southeastern United States and they’re sitting down there saying ‘Everyone has forgotten about me.'”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDONALD Trump has hosted a rally in President Joe Biden&#8217;s hometown to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump expresses joy at being here and pledges to win Pennsylvania during rally in Biden’s hometown first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/donald-trump-expresses-joy-at-being-here-and-pledges-to-win-pennsylvania-during-rally-in-bidens-hometown/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Donald-Trump-boasts-its-‘very-special-to-be-here-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 23:32:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":259119370,"title":"Fox News Pitches Trump-Harris Debate in Final Hail Mary","text":"Fox News is trying once again to lure Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for a debate—with terms neither side will likely agree to.\n\nThe network announced on Wednesday it invited both campaigns to an Oct. 24 or an Oct. 27 debate in Pennsylvania.

and Noor Alfallah’s recent outing at the Chateau Marmont reportedly wasn’t their first date. \n\nInsiders told People Wednesday that Al Pacino’s ex-girlfriend, 30, and Maher, 68, have been quietly spending time together in recent months.\n\nAlthough no one caught wind of their relationship until Saturday, the pair has reportedly gone on several dates. \n\nHowever, the source noted that things are still in the early stages between the two, who consider each other “friends” for now. \n\nThe unlikely duo raised eyebrows over the weekend after they were spotted sneaking out of the famed hotel in Los Angeles.\n\nDespite trying to stay under the radar, the rumored couple was swarmed as they exited the ritzy establishment around midnight and got into the comedian’s black sedan. \n\nMaher, who was behind the wheel, looked smart in a gray suit, while the movie producer wore all black.\n\nJust hours earlier, Alfallah was spotted leaving the Chez Mia restaurant in West Hollywood, Calif., with Pacino. \n\nThe pair, who were first romantically linked in April 2022, welcomed their first child together — a baby boy named Roman — in June 2023.\n\nHowever, after Alfallah and Maher were photographed together, the “Godfather” star, 84, confirmed he and the producer were no longer together.\n\nWhen asked if he was in a relationship, Pacino bluntly told People, “No. I have friendship.”\n\nA rep for the “Scarface” actor added, “Al and Noor are very good friends, have been for years, and are co-parents to their son, Roman.”\n\nDespite their split, the exes have remained on good terms. In fact, Alfallah posted a photo with Pacino on Tuesday.\n\nThe mother of one was seen celebrating the release of “The Apprentice” — which she executive produced — alongside Pacino and Jeremy Strong.\n\nAlfallah included a selfie of the group at dinner in her Instagram carousel, which also notably featured a clip from Maher’s show, “Real Time with Bill Maher.”\n\nIn the video, the outspoken comedian shared his thoughts on the “great” new film, which details Donald Trump’s rise in the New York City real-estate business in the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nPrior to Alfallah’s romance with Pacino and Maher, she was linked to The Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and billionaire Nicolas Berggruen.","summary":"The \"Godfather\" actor, 84, was first linked to the much-younger producer in 2022.

His support for Trump has cost him legal troubles, including a $1.7 billion lawsuit leveled by the Dominion voting machine company and a defamation suit filed by Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden.Court documents filed on September 18 in the Hunter Biden defamation suit showed that Byrne's lawyers said their client has left the country.The documents center on disputes over efforts to lock down Byrne's deposition in the case. The filing from Biden's lawyers says that they were informed last month that Byrne has fled the U.S. after he was allegedly informed of the bounty by a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent.\"Defendant currently resides and conducts business in Dubai and moved there because of threats made on his life and a bounty put on him in the sum of $25,000,000 by the Venezuelan government in July of 2024,\" the filing reads.It says that Byrne allegedly \"offered to pay all travel expenses for one plaintiff's attorney, the court reporter and videographer to travel to Dubai to personally depose him.\"Hunter Biden's lawyers, however, pointed to previous discussions held September 2 to conduct the deposition in Florida. They wrote that Byrne's lawyers told them on September 11, just over a week later, that Byrne allegedly left and \"would not be returning to the United States for the foreseeable future.\" Biden's council described the claim as \"unverified and unsupported.\"More details about Byrne's allegations have not been made public. Newsweek reached out to Michael Murphy, an attorney representing Byrne, for comment via email on Wednesday.The filings were first reported in September by journalist Seth Hettena, who wrote on X, formerly Twitter, \"Former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne has relocated to Dubai and won't be returning to the US for the foreseeable future because Byrne says a DEA agent told him that the government of Venezuela has put a $25m bounty on his head.\"Byrne resigned from his position at Overstock in 2019 after his romantic ties to convicted Russian foreign agent Maria Butina became known, as well as after he wrote a letter to investors about the \"deep state.\"Hunter Biden's lawsuit, filed in November 2023, focuses on an accusation by Byrne, who claimed that Hunter sought to have President Biden unfreeze $8 billion in funds in exchange for an $800 million bribe.

But the detail in journalist Bob Woodward’s book “War” raised eyebrows in light of a special counsel investigation during Trump’s presidency that examined potential ties between Russia and the Republican’s 2016 campaign as well as Trump’s more recent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion — statements that have hinted at a possible U.S. policy overhaul if he’s elected.\n\n“I would caution any world leader about trusting Vladimir Putin with anything,” said Emily Harding, who led the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and is now a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBoth Trump campaign and the Kremlin, which U.S. officials have said is working to influence the 2024 election in favor of Trump, denied the reporting.\n\nAsked at a press briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration would have “serious concerns” if the reported calls were true.\n\n“We’re not aware of those calls. I certainly can’t confirm any of those calls from here,” she said. “But, if it is indeed true, are we (concerned)? Do we have serious concerns? Yes.”\n\nIt’s no secret that Trump has held multiple meetings over the last year with major world leaders: hosting Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sitting down in New York last April with Polish President Andrzej Duda and meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president’s trip to the U.S. last month.\n\nThe meetings offer Trump an opportunity to differentiate his foreign policy approach from that of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to shore up connections if he reclaims the White House. During Netanyahu’s visit in July, Trump boasted of a “great relationship,” drawing a tacit contrast with the more strained dynamic between the Israeli leader and Biden.\n\nWhile those meetings were known publicly, Woodward’s book cites an unnamed aide as saying Trump and Putin had as many as seven private calls. That adds to long-running questions about their relationship and what Trump may be trying to achieve, said Robert Orttung, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nAs president, “We never really understood why he liked Putin so much and why he was trying to develop such a close relationship with someone who is clearly an adversary and against everything the United States stands for,” Orttung said.\n\nSome claims about ties between Trump and allies and Russia have proved overheated or fizzled over time, but the subject continues to draw considerable public scrutiny, including after Trump left office.\n\nThe FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller spent several years investigating whether Russia had colluded with the 2016 Trump campaign to tip the outcome of the election. Though investigators did not establish a criminal conspiracy, they did find the Trump campaign actively welcomed Russia’s help during the election and that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency.\n\nIn 2018, after meeting Putin in Helsinki, Trump memorably and publicly questioned his own intelligence agencies ‘ conclusion that Russia meddled in the election.\n\n“I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Trump said at the time. He added: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.”\n\nMore recently, Trump called Putin “pretty smart” for invading Ukraine and has praised Russia’s military record in historical conflicts, saying last month: “As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.”\n\nThe book, which also says Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic, does not describe the content of their conversations.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung denied they occurred, calling the book by the famed Watergate journalist the “work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.” Trump complained at a campaign event on Wednesday that “I had to go through years of Russia, Russia, Russia, and they knew it was fake.”\n\nA Kremlin spokesman also denied the calls happened.\n\nThe book’s details revived discussion about the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that bars private American citizens from trying to intervene in “disputes or controversies” between the United States and foreign powers without government approval.\n\nThe statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction. Former presidents from Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton have held talks with international figures after leaving the White House.\n\n“Trump could be technically liable just as I think dozens of prominent figures have been technically liable,” said Daniel Rice, a University of Arkansas law professor and constitutional law expert.\n\nAmong the possible reasons for the law’s dormancy, Rice said, is a disinclination by prosecutors to “turn violators into martyrs” or to be seen as targeting a sitting president’s political adversaries.\n\nFlynn was interviewed by the FBI about that conversation and pleaded guilty to lying to agents about it, though Trump pardoned Flynn in the final weeks of his presidency.\n\nTrump later called for former Secretary of State John Kerry to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act over his conversations with Iran after he left the Obama administration. Kerry was never charged.\n\nAssociated Press writer Will Weissert in Washington contributed.","summary":"Both Trump campaign and the Kremlin, which U.S. officials have said is working to influence the 2024 election in favor of Trump, denied the reporting.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/09/trump-putin-ties-back-in-spotlight-after-new-book/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sjm-24-Trump-Putin_207133975.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 23:03:29","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":259117798,"title":"Harris team raked in over $1 billion since Biden dropped out: report","text":"In fewer than 80 days since taking over the top of the ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris has reportedly taken in more than $1 billion across her campaign and allied committees. \n\nThe eye-popping figure dwarfs the roughly $853 million former President Donald Trump raised across his political operation thus far during 2024, based on publicly available data. It also far outpaces the fundraising tempo under President Biden. \n\nPast presidential cycles have seen candidates, including Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, leap past the $1 billion mark between totals raised across the campaigns and outside groups, but the breakneck pace at which Harris, 59, has reached the feat is unprecedented. \n\nFor context, Biden’s 2024 operation didn’t cross the $1 billion threshold until August, shortly after Harris ascended to the top of the ticket and rebranded the campaign.\n\nAt the time, the newly launched Harris campaign crowed about blowing past the $1 billion milestone at the fastest clip for a presidential campaign. \n\nHarris managed to get to the $1 billion tally even faster by herself, the New York Times first reported.

This will come down to grinding it out.”\n\nThe vice president and her allies have long held a campaign cash advantage over Team Trump, while spending more than two and half times as much, per data from AdImpact.\n\nThey’ve been sitting on such a large mountain of cash that the Harris-Walz campaign and DNC announced it was funneling over $25 million to down-ballot races last month in a bid to help Democrats. \n\nDespite the weeks of bonanza fundraising and constant blanketing of the airwaves against Trump, the 2024 presidential contest remains very tight. \n\nHarris has a 2.2 percentage point edge over Trump in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of national multicandidate polls.

It is not the result of an unforced error by a candidate behaving badly.\n\nIt is an act of God bearing down on the critical swing state of Florida. \n\nFirst and foremost, I pray that every single person impacted by Hurricane Milton emerges from this storm safely and free from property loss.\n\nI also recognize that this, tragically, is an unlikely outcome. So, I offer this analysis as a political strategist and pollster, fully aware that many things in life are more important than an election.\n\nBut is it my job to consider what may happen – and I’ve concluded that Milton may be a game-changer come November 5.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nIn the 2020 election, Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden in Florida by over 370,000 votes, which equates to barely 3 percentage points.\n\nThat’s a decent margin in the Sunshine State, but not a dominant one.\n\nTrump won in 2020, in part, by running up the Republican tally in ruby-red GOP counties like Pasco, Marion and Sarasota, near Tampa.\n\nBig turnouts in those Republican strongholds offset Democratic wins in blue regions of the state, like Miami-Dade County in Florida’s southeast.\n\nBut now, Hurricane Milton is blowing its way right into the heart of Florida – and places like Pasco and Sarasota lie directly in its path.\n\nOf all the 15 Florida counties under mandatory state evacuation orders, 14 are dominantly, if not overwhelmingly, Republican.\n\nThe total number of registered Republican voters in those 15 counties is slightly over two million, while the number of registered Democrats in those same counties is about 1.2 million.\n\nApproximately 800,000 more registered Republicans than registered Democrats in the state of Florida are being told to get out of their homes.\n\nAnd that may have an enormous impact.\n\nIn the 2020 election, there was a huge 77 percent turnout rate in Florida – meaning nearly one out of every eight eligible voters cast a ballot.\n\nWhat will it be in 2024?\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans Floridians in these Milton-impacted areas will be under duress, hopefully not in life-threatening jeopardy, but certainly disadvantaged or inconvenienced to the point that they may not vote.\n\nFor argument’s sake, consider what happens if dislocation, financial loss, physical harm or emotional stress depress Florida’s turnout rate to 40 percent.\n\nThat’s a realistic assumption. Who would bother voting if their house had been blown off its foundations or their truck has been destroyed – or worse?\n\nAt that suppressed 40 percent rate, only 320,000 Republicans in these impacted counties would show up on election day or mail-in their ballot.\n\nThat’s a projected loss of 280,000 Republican votes.\n\nRemember, Trump only won by 370,000.\n\nIn other words, this election may have just gotten much, much closer.\n\nAnd now add to this calculations the additional motivating factors that are driving Florida Democrats to the polls.\n\nThere is a measure on the ballot that would establish a right to abortion in the Florida Constitution – and another would legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nMany of my fellow Republican strategists underestimated the electoral impact of abortion measures on the ballot in the 2020 midterms – as they predicted a ‘Red Wave’ for the GOP across the country.\n\nI thought otherwise and said so on national television at the time.\n\nIndeed, the ‘Red Wave’ never materialized.\n\nThere is reason for Donald Trump’s campaign to be concerned.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis is an honorable guy, and he understands his primary duty is to protect people and property in his state.\n\nBut I’m hoping the governor’s office, amongst its many initiatives in the coming days, also thinks of how voters may be disenfranchised by this storm.\n\nPerhaps the Governor can loosen absentee voting rules, or, better yet, attach an absentee ballot — Democrat and Republican — to every aid packet that his Office of Emergency Management distributes.\n\nBy doing so, the Governor will fulfill his obligations to protect life as well as democracy.\n\nNo race should be won because Americans couldn’t vote.\n\nCraig Keshishian was a project director on President Reagan’s polling team and later, served in Reagan’s Presidential Speechwriting and Research Office","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNearly every modern US presidential election cycle has been upended by an&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Impact of Hurricane Milton on Election and Republican Strongholds: An Analysis by Expert CRAIG KESHISHIAN first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/impact-of-hurricane-milton-on-election-and-republican-strongholds-an-analysis-by-expert-craig-keshishian/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/09/23/90659533-13943353-A_motorist_drives_past_broken_utility_poles_downed_by_strong_win-a-5_1728512357832.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:57:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":259117536,"title":"These are the Pennsylvania voters who could decide the election","text":"Unexpectedly, Pennsylvania’s millennial and Gen X voters are poised to elect the next president of the United States. \n\nNo longer adolescents, millennials are adults striving for families and homeownership in a world of uncertainty.\n\nFor Gen X, 30-year mortgages locked in at 3% feel great, though the launch of MTV is now closer to the attack on Pearl Harbor than today. \n\nLife is coming fast for both generations.\n\nWith millennials leaning to the left and Gen X voting to the right, neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump likely anticipated these voters determining the outcome of the presidential election that’s deadlocked in Pennsylvania. \n\nStalemated at 48% for both Trump and Harris in the RealClearPolitics average, the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania will be won on the margins, public polling indicates.\n\nA significant number of Pennsylvanians have already decided to change their vote for president from 2020. The recent Emerson/RealClearPennsylvania poll tells the story. \n\nNearly 4%, or about 140,000, of Joe Biden voters indicate they are voting for Trump in 2024. Three percent, or about 100,000, of Trump voters have switched to Harris. Trump wins the battle of voters switching sides. \n\nHowever, with potentially 7 million Pennsylvanians voting in the presidential election, the 4% of undecided voters represents about 300,000 people who are likely to determine the next president of the United States.\n\nThe last two Pennsylvania presidential elections were decided by 80,555 votes in 2020 and 44,292 votes in 2016.\n\nIn an era in which politics is religion, the undecided voters will likely outnumber the partisans who may not vote. The undecideds will be the deciders. \n\nAmong undecideds leaning toward Harris, 40% voted for Biden in 2020 while 28% voted for Trump.\n\nThis indicates Harris has not consolidated the Democrats and disaffected Republicans who placed Biden into office.\n\nThe undecided voters leaning toward Trump tell a much different story. Notably, none of these voters cast a ballot for Biden in 2020.\n\nIn fact, 50% of them skipped over the presidential ballot entirely, being unable to bring themselves to cast one four years ago. \n\nBetween these two pools of undecided leaners, neither candidate appears to have an easier road. \n\nTrump must persuade his leaners to do something they were unable to do in the past. \n\nHarris must rebuild a coalition that has not yet been consolidated just weeks before the election. \n\nWhile the education and gender gaps prominent in national polls are reflected in Pennsylvania, they are not as pronounced.\n\nAmong all Pennsylvania voters, Trump and Harris are virtually tied with the college-educated, but Harris wins post-graduate-degree voters by a 2:1 margin while Trump wins voters without a college degree by a similar margin. Harris wins women by 9 points while Trump wins men by the same spread.\n\nThe education and gender trends don’t provide much insight into Pennsylvania’s undecided voters. Age does.\n\nAmong the undecided voters leaning toward Harris, a whopping 73% are aged 30 to 39. This is a five-alarm fire for the Harris campaign as millennials are reflexively progressive.\n\nIt explains why Harris is spending her time with millennial-oriented media like the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and generating social-media clips from late-night TV.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump’s leaners skew a generation older. Nearly 45% of his leaners are aged 40 to 49, on the tail end of the Gen X cohort. This likewise presents a daunting challenge for Trump as Gen X wants to vote Republican.\n\nIt is likely why Trump has taken to long-form interviews like Lex Fridman and Theo Von to give Gen X a direct insight into his clear thinking on key issues. \n\nMillennials seek an idealist to implement progressive stability. The likely issue for these millennial undecided leaners is that the past four years have failed to deliver.\n\nGen X seeks pragmatic leadership. While endearing to many in his coalition, Trump’s idiosyncrasies may give pause to this critical bloc of voters who simply want the government to function effectively and no longer be a focus of national attention. \n\nTo sway these crucial undecided voters, Trump must prove he can govern effectively without distraction while Harris needs to rebuild trust with voters who have considerable doubts.\n\nAs the presidential campaign heads into the final stretch, the October surprise may be that public polling indicates the election hinges on a narrow margin of undecided Pennsylvania voters who are more reflective of generational divides than political realignment.\n\nAthan Koutsiouroumbas is a managing director at Long Nyquist and Associates and a former congressional chief of staff. \n\nTwitter: @Athan_K\n\nReprinted with permission from RealClearPennsylvania.","summary":"Unexpectedly, Pennsylvania voters in two different generations are poised to elect the next president of the United States. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/us-news/these-are-the-pennsylvania-voters-who-could-decide-the-election/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-1204jd9sj-1728508808495.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728499951&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:54:59","author":"Athan Koutsiouroumbas","authors":["Athan Koutsiouroumbas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":259117458,"title":"Professor Who Suggested Shooting Men Who Won't Vote for Women Suspended","text":"A University of Kansas professor has been suspended after controversy erupted over his rhetoric suggesting that men who refuse to vote for female presidential candidates should be lined up and shot.University of Kansas spokesperson Erinn Barcomb-Peterson told The Topeka Capital-Journal in an article published on Wednesday that athletics lecturer Phillip Lowcock had been placed on administrative leave and was the subject of an investigation after a video surfaced of him making the comments during a recent lecture.\"We are aware of the video, which was recorded during a class earlier this semester,\" Barcomb-Peterson said. \"The instructor is being placed on administrative leave pending further investigation.

Simultaneously, FEMA's disaster relief fund, which is entirely separate from the program helping migrants, has continued to receive funding to the tune of nearly $244 billion, ProPublica reported. \"Disaster relief ought to go to prepare and to respond to a disaster when it strikes American territory. Our government has got to focus on our citizens, put their interests first, take care of American citizens when a disaster hits,\" Vance said. \"Unfortunately, under Kamala Harris's leadership, you've got FEMA, which is doing resettlement and relocation for illegal immigration. \"FEMA should take care of American citizens when a disaster strikes.

However, Harris’ appearance alone on Monday evening only came after Trump was also invited to an interview, apparently agreed, but then backed out at the last minute.\n\n“The campaign offered shifting explanations. First, it complained that we would fact check the interview. We fact check every story. Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020.

I simply don’t know. … I use a phrase more than I did in my whole career, un-American. It’s un-American. It’s not who in the hell we are.”\n\nThe president talked about the potential damage from Hurricane Milton and encouraged people near its path to seek shelter. Biden said the government had staged 20 million meals and 40 million liters of water in anticipation of the storm and that military units were ready with search and rescue teams to help victims of it.\n\n“We’ve got your back,” Biden said. “Kamala and I will be there for as long as it takes to rescue, recover and rebuild.”\n\nAt rallies for November’s presidential election, Trump has sought to energize his voters by criticizing how Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, have handled the response to the severe weather.\n\nAt a recent rally in Wisconsin, Trump said it was worse than the government’s response in 2005 to Hurricane Katrina, which resulted in 1,392 fatalities. By contrast, Hurricane Helene has resulted in roughly 230 deaths.\n\n“This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we’ve ever seen, ever,” Trump said. “Probably worse than Katrina, and that’s hard to beat, right?”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Wednesday blasted his predecessor for spreading&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden criticizes false information on federal storm response as Hurricane Milton approaches Florida first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/biden-criticizes-false-information-on-federal-storm-response-as-hurricane-milton-approaches-florida/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/PMFAY4AW4BDFFL2CVQUZ3H2WYI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:49:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.619},{"id":259117168,"title":"Travis Barker’s 18-Year-Old Daughter Alabama She’s Not ‘Educated’ Enough to Vote: ‘If I Don’t Want to Vote, I Don’t Have to Vote’","text":"With the 2024 presidential election just a month away, one person who will not be hitting the polls is Alabama Barker.\n\n The 18-year-old daughter of Travis Barker went live on social media recently, where she revealed that while she is now old enough to vote, she doesn’t want to. “Not voting isn’t crazy in my opinion at all, because if I don’t feel like I have the exact education for what I’m voting for, how is it right to vote something I’m not completely educated on?” she explained in the livestream, seen by Billboard. “I could educate myself, but why would I do that if I genuinely don’t care? I’m just honest.” \n\n She continued, “I don’t care to vote if I don’t know exactly what’s going on. I don’t think that’s wrong, and I completely stand on that and stand by it because, first of all, I just turned 18 and I never voted before. I’ve never voted. If I don’t want to vote, I don’t have to vote. If I don’t want to be in politics, I don’t have to be in politics.”\n\n Alabama did note, however, that she does “have an opinion on what I feel is right because of what I’ve been seeing,” before adding that “one of the [candidates] is just a mess.” She did not reveal whether she was talking about Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump or Democratic candidate and current Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n While Alabama is not voting, a number of other public figures are. Most recently, Bruce Springsteen voiced his support for Harris, joining a list of other celebrities including Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Stevie Nicks, Cardi B, Jason Isbell, John Legend, Katy Perry and many more.\n\n Meanwhile, Jason Aldean, Kid Rock, Kanye West and Sexyy Red are among the artists who are backing Trump in this year’s election.","summary":"\"I could educate myself, but why would I do that if I genuinely don't care?\" she said in a recent livestream.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/travis-barker-daughter-alabama-not-educated-enough-to-vote-1235797426/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Alabama-Barker-and-Travis-Barker-sept-2022-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:47:51","author":"Rania Aniftos","authors":["Rania Aniftos"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":259117928,"title":"A Great President, and His Opposite","text":"Recently, I was rereading Livy’s History of Rome (I am obligated, contractually, to write sentences like this), in order to better understand the story of Cincinnatus, the soldier and statesman who desired only to look after his farm. “Put on thy robe and hear the words of the people,” a delegation of messengers said as they approached him. Cincinnatus, plowing his land, was a bit startled. “Is all well?” he asked.\n\nObviously not. “The people of Rome make thee dictator, and bid thee come forthwith to the city,” the messengers said, explaining that the city was under siege by an enemy tribe, the Aequi.\n\nQuite an offer. We are all familiar with the tendency of great men to be tempted by the matchless possibilities of dictatorship. Cincinnatus put on his robes and went to Rome, where, over a 16-day period, he organized the defeat of the Aequi. But then he went home.\n\nAmerica’s first president did many great things, but as Tom Nichols notes in his new Atlantic cover story, the greatest thing George Washington ever did was return to Mount Vernon. Like Cincinnatus, he was called upon by the people to defend his nation. Like Cincinnatus, he won the affection and esteem of soldier and citizen alike. And like Cincinnatus, he could have made himself a leader for life, a despot, a king. If he’d been of different character or temperament, the American experiment—a great, noble, flawed, self-correcting, indispensable gift to humankind —would not have lasted to this day.\n\nWashington was imperfect. He was a beneficiary of the sin of chattel slavery. But as a leader of a newly born democracy, he was also an avatar of self-restraint and self-mastery. As Tom writes in his cover story, Washington’s life and leadership were a guide for his successors. Through his example, he taught presidents how to rule, and how to return power to the people when it was time to go home.\n\n“Forty-four men have succeeded Washington so far,” Tom writes. “Some became titans; others finished their terms without distinction; a few ended their service to the nation in ignominy. But each of them knew that the day would come when it would be their duty and honor to return the presidency to the people.”\n\nAll but one, of course: the ex-president trying to regain the office he lost in a free and fair election four years ago, and signaling that he will refuse to concede should he lose again.\n\nThe story of George Washington and Donald Trump is the sad tale of a country once led by a Cincinnatus but now being duped by a grifter. Yet Washington’s example is alive to us, if we choose to pay attention. Several months ago, I told Tom of my preoccupation with Washington. Tom, who writes this newsletter for us, served for many years with distinction on the faculty of the Naval War College, and he has the correct sort of reverence for the nation’s founders (which is to say, a critical sort of reverence). Tom did not initially react with fervent enthusiasm. Later—long after I had hectored him into writing this story—he explained why. “Like many Americans, I found Washington intimidating. He didn’t seem quite human. In every picture of Washington, he’s giving you this disapproving side-eye. Now I know that that was the look he was giving Gilbert Stuart, whom he didn’t like. But in any case, other presidents always seemed real to me—I grew up in Massachusetts, and we called Kennedy ‘Jack.’ Even Lincoln was real to me, but Washington just seemed unapproachable, like the obelisk built in his honor.”\n\nTom’s subsequent exploration of Washington’s record and character is what I suggest you read tonight, or as soon as possible. Even those who believe they understand Washington’s greatness will be surprised by the degree to which Donald Trump is so obviously his opposite—Trump, who seeks to be a dictator, who believes he is smarter than any general or statesman, who evinces no ability to learn, who possesses no humility, who divides Americans rather than unites them.\n\nTom writes of Washington, “Although he was a man of fierce ambition, his character was tempered by humility and bound up in his commitment to republican ideals: He led an American army only in the name of the American people and its elected representatives, and he never saw that army as his personal property. His soldiers were citizens, like him, and they were serving at his side in a common cause.”\n\nWe are a month away from an election that will decide America’s future. My suggestion, particularly for those of you who are still undecided about the path forward, is to read about the past, and understand what a great president can be.\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nEvening Read\n\nWhat Went Wrong at Blizzard Entertainment\n\nBy Jason Schreier\n\nCulture Break\n\nRead.

To disguise their objectives and more easily \"inject themselves into larger X/Twitter conversations,\" some accounts regularly shared content about subjects such as sports and cryptocurrency, the report said.It was not possible to determine the precise entity behind the pro-Russian accounts.With data restrictions imposed by X since Musk purchased the company in 2022 for $44 billion, it was also difficult to assess their exact reach.Researchers are now required to pay a hefty fee for access to its API, which allows third-party developers to gather the social platform's data.\"If researchers had data access restored, more of such activity would likely be visible,\" the ASP report said.Bots and other automated accounts, researchers say, are a cornerstone of the Kremlin's efforts to spread misinformation, in some cases supplanting state media accounts which have been restricted across several countries since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.X did not reply to AFP's request for comment. Ahead of his purchase of the platform, Musk pledged to \"defeat the spam bots or die trying.\"But bot activity remains entrenched on the platform, a report from Australia's Queensland University of Technology said last year, after an analysis of about one million posts.The platform has gutted trust and safety teams and scaled back content moderation efforts, making it what researchers call a hotbed for misinformation.\"Despite the fact that Musk has an avowed goal of ridding his platform of bots, we've found that they persist on X, even coming from networks that are likely state-affiliated,\" said Jankowicz.\"This is behavior that is fairly easy to identify, and yet this multi-billion dollar corporation has not cracked down on these accounts that violate its platform manipulation and spam policies.\"","summary":"Hundreds of apparent pro-Russian bot accounts on X are pushing US election misinformation and amplifying false narratives about Democratic contender Kamala Harris, a research group said Thursday, calling them \"sleeper agents\" for having evaded detection for years.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/sleeper-agent-bots-x-fuel-us-election-misinformation-study-says-3746171","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4553090/researchers-analyzed-accounts-that-shared-posts-favoring-republican-candidate-donald-trump-while.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:45:22","author":"Anuj Chopra","authors":["Anuj Chopra"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":259116836,"title":"Democratic NY lawmaker bashed for comparing Trump’s upcoming MSG rally to 1939 Nazi gathering: ‘Dangerous and unhinged rhetoric’","text":"A New York state Democratic lawmaker sparked outrage Wednesday when he compared Donald Trump’s upcoming campaign stop at Madison Square Garden to a Nazi rally that took place at the famous Big Apple venue 85 years ago.\n\nState Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, 58, called on MSG officials to cancel Trump’s Oct. 27 rally, claiming it could lead to “widespread violence” as he ripped into the former president and his supporters during the online diatribe.\n\n“Let’s be clear. Allowing Trump to hold an event at MSG is equivalent to the infamous Nazis rally at Madison Square Garden on February 20, 1939,” Hoylman-Sigal, a Democrat, tweeted in reference to the disgraceful Nazi assembly held during the reign of German dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\nMore than 20,000 attendees gathered to despicably cheer “Heil Hitler” while tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated outside in 1939, according to a US Holocaust Memorial Museum. \n\nHoylman-Sigal, whose senate district includes the Garden, said he confirmed Trump’s rally is scheduled for 3 p.m. — just nine days before Election Day. The campaign event was first reported by The Post.\n\n“This is a disastrous decision by Madison Square Garden that will endanger the public safety of New Yorkers and has the potential to incite widespread violence,” the Big Apple pol continued. \n\n“For the good of NYC and its residents, I demand @TheGarden keep our city safe by cancelling the Trump Rally.”\n\nTrump’s campaign blasted Hoylman-Sigal in a statement to The Post Wednesday afternoon, only referring to him as a “no-name New York State Senator” while calling the comments divisive. \n\n“This is the same type of dangerous rhetoric that led to two assassination attempts on President Trump’s life and has divided our country,” said Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt. \n\n“This no-name New York State Senator should resign in disgrace over this egregious comment. Meanwhile, President Trump will pack the house at Madison Square Garden on his nationwide tour to Make America Great Again.”\n\nThe Dem’s harsh words also stirred quick backlash among Empire State Republicans, including upstate New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who called on prominent Democrats like Gov. Kathy Hochul to denounce Hoylman-Sigal and his “dangerous and unhinged rhetoric.”\n\nStaten Island Rep. Nicole Malliotakis also bashed the progressive lawmaker. \n\n“What a terribly disgusting thing to say…and by the way it’s members of YOUR party who are running around our city with Hamas and Hezbollah flags, terrorizing Jews on college campuses,” she tweeted in reference to ongoing anti-Israel protests that have roiled Gotham.\n\nThe state GOP committee also slammed Hoylman-Sigal’s statement as a “disgrace” while also calling out Democrats to disavow it.\n\n“If you had a shred of dignity you would remove this post and immediately apologize,” the committee tweeted.\n\nWhen asked about the impending Trump rally on Wednesday, Hochul replied, “Oh great.”\n\n“I feel very confident, as I always have, in the ability of the NYPD to handle the most extraordinary circumstance,” she said, adding. “No one can stop anyone from having a rally. This is America.”\n\nHoylman-Sigal represents the 47th senate district that covers a portion of Manhattan and chairs the state senate judiciary committee. He was first elected in 2012. \n\nAdditional reporting by Vaugh Golden","summary":"The Dem’s harsh words stirred quick backlash among Empire State Republicans, including Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who called on prominent Democrats to denounce Hoylman-Sigal.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/us-news/brad-hoylman-sigal-slammed-for-comparing-trump-rally/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/91314727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qn1I0VwE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:40:48","author":"David Propper","authors":["David Propper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.463},{"id":259117852,"title":"More Americans are saying they are Republican than Democrat. Will it impact the election?","text":"Republicans may not be facing the uphill battle they anticipated in the 2024 presidential election as new polling shows more Americans are calling themselves Republicans than Democrats.\n\nFor decades, Democrats have outnumbered Republicans when it comes to voters’ party identification, giving them an edge in national general elections. But polling from NBC News, Gallup and Pew Research Center show Republicans are catching up, or tied, with Democrats for the number of Americans who identify themselves with a party.\n\n“This is the under recognized game changer for 2024. Republicans competing on a level playing field,” Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies wrote on X in May. \n\nThe poll, conducted jointly with the Democratic polling firm Hart Research Associates, showed that among registered voters, 41 percent identify as Republicans while 40 percent identify as Democrats. That is a large deviation from similar polling conducted in 2020 which showed Democrats had a six-point advantage.\n\nSimilar results have come from other polls. Gallup found that in the first nine months of 2024, the number of people who identify as Republicans is equivalent the number of people who identify as Democrats.\n\nIn 2020, that same Gallup polling found Democrats held a four-point lead over Republicans.\n\nPew Research Center released results in April that showed 48 percent of registered voters are Republican or lean to the Republican Party while 49 percent are or lean Democratic. Four years ago, Democrats had a 5-point advantage over the GOP.\n\nThe trend indicates Republicans, and former president Donald Trump, have garnered more national support over the last four years than between 2008 and 2016.\n\nSome pollsters credit the change to the growing number of Latino voters supporting Trump. Traditionally, Latino voters lean toward Democratic candidates but the Trump campaign has successfully appealed to the demographic who they hope can hand them a win.\n\nRepublican pollster Patrick Ruffini told the Wall Street Journal that the change in party identification takes some pressure off Trump.\n\n“It’s a loose indicator that you have a number of people who are disappointed in the Democratic Party’s performance,” Ruffini said.\n\nWhile the numbers are good for the GOP, it does not necessarily mean they will win the presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris is still narrowly leading in most major national polls and similar trends emerged in the 2022 midterm election when Republicans incorrectly predicted a “red wave.”\n\nWhile the polling shows interesting developments in political ideology trends, the numbers are not strong enough to serve as a safety blanket for the GOP.","summary":"More voters are registered as Democrats but recent trends show a shift in self identification","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/2024-election-republicans-democrats-id-b2626829.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/28/13/SEI223444443.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XEmT52N6-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:40:42","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":259116860,"title":"Fraud trial begins for South Bay businesswoman who got clemency from Trump","text":"Trial got underway this week in San Diego federal court for a South Bay businesswoman accused of carrying out a fraud scheme with her brother that allegedly began just weeks after she was released early from prison when former President Donald Trump commuted her sentence from a previous fraud conviction.\n\nDuring opening statements Tuesday, a defense attorney mentioned Adriana Isabel Camberos’ prior conviction but did not tell the jury that she was among the 76 people granted clemency by Trump on his last day in office in January 2021.\n\nProsecutors allege that Camberos, 53, and her brother Andres “Andy” Enrique Camberos, 45, operated a fraud scheme similar to the one that previously sent Adriana Camberos and her husband to prison.\n\nThe government alleges that the siblings conspired to “unduly enrich themselves” by purchasing wholesale groceries and other consumer goods at a steep discount on the promise that they would be marketed in Mexico, but instead turned around and sold the products in the more lucrative U.S. market, undercutting business rivals.\n\nA defense attorney for Andy Camberos, the founder and former CEO of Grasshopper Dispensary, Chula Vista’s first legal cannabis retailer, told the jury during opening statements that prosecutors weren’t wrong, but that selling Mexico-bound products in the U.S. was a “sharp business practice” and not an illegal conspiracy.\n\n“We agree they engaged in product diversion,” Dan Goldman said, telling jurors that the practice is an open secret in the world of manufacturing, distributing and selling consumer goods. He said the way the Camberos siblings went about running several distribution companies was not illegal.\n\n“You may find it distasteful or unethical,” Goldman told the jury. “But this is not a court of morality. This is a court of law.”\n\nThe defense attorney said the siblings should also be shielded from conviction because the entire time they were running the allegedly unlawful scheme, they were acting on the legal advice of several lawyers who greenlit their business practices.\n\nThe siblings face charges of wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. Prosecutors allege they paid themselves more than $12 million each and laundered the unlawful proceeds through real estate investments, a cryptocurrency account and the purchases of luxury vehicles, including a Ferrari and three Range Rovers.\n\nBoth siblings were thrust into the public spotlight in early 2021 when Trump commuted Adriana’s sentence about halfway through her 26-month federal prison term in a previous case. At the time, she went by her now ex-husband’s last name of Shayota. The White House said her clemency petition was supported by Chula Vista Mayor John McCann, who at the time was a member of the City Council. McCann said it was Andy Camberos, a former high school classmate, who asked him to support the effort to free his sister.\n\nThe commutation was a remarkable benefit for a mostly unknown federal prisoner on the same day Trump pardoned the likes of Steven Bannon, his former strategist, the rapper Lil Wayne and former San Diego-area Congressman Randy “Duke” Cunningham.\n\nAdriana Camberos went to prison in 2019 for her role in a scheme to sell counterfeit 5-Hour Energy drinks. According to documents in that case, which was prosecuted in Northern California, a company run by Camberos and her ex-husband, Joseph Shayota, was left with 350,000 bottles of Spanish-label 5-hour Energy drinks after sales of the drink in Mexico did not go as well as expected.\n\nProsecutors said Shayota led efforts to relabel the drinks with counterfeit English packaging and resell them back into the more lucrative U.S. market. When the drinks sold, Shayota and others came up with a new scheme to make use of the high-quality counterfeit labels by concocting their own beverage that they packaged and sold as 5-hour Energy. Prosecutors said they sold 3.7 million bottles of the fake drink in 2012, much of which made it into stores in Northern California.\n\nNine people charged in connection with that case pleaded guilty, while Shayota and Camberos were convicted at trial. Shayota, 72, is set to be released from prison early next year. His ex-wife served 13 months before Trump set her free.\n\nProsecutors alleged that within six weeks of regaining her freedom, Adriana Camberos and her brother began their new illegal plot using three businesses they owned. Prosecutors said the new plot was partly run through Baja Exporting, the same Otay Mesa business involved in the 5-Hour Energy drink scheme. And like the energy drink scheme, prosecutors said part of the new plot involved swapping Spanish labels for English labels so goods could be sold at higher U.S. prices.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jordan Arakawa told jurors Tuesday that the Camberos siblings “went to tremendous lengths to hide” their illegal business practices from the manufacturers they victimized. They maintained an office in Mexico City and a warehouse in Tijuana to create the ruse of a thriving operation in Mexico, Arakawa said. And she showed the jury a photo of a model standing behind a product display table in a Mexican store, which the prosecutor said was another ruse to trick a manufacturer into believing its goods were really being sold in Mexico.\n\nAn attorney for Adriana Camberos declined to address the jury on Tuesday, saying he would save his opening remarks until after the prosecution presents its case.\n\nGoldman, the attorney for Andy Camberos, told jurors that the business practices described by the government were just a part of the “hustling” and bartering that manufacturers and distributors expect while negotiating deals.\n\nAfter the siblings were indicted last year, Chula Vista demanded that Andy Camberos divest from Grasshopper Dispensary or it would lose its license. A city spokesperson confirmed Tuesday that the city approved a change of ownership request in April that removed him from the ownership group.","summary":"Prosecutors say siblings Adriana and Andy Camberos enriched themselves by selling deeply discounted products intended for Mexico in more lucrative U.S. market","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/10/09/fraud-trial-begins-for-south-bay-businesswoman-who-got-clemency-from-trump/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SUT-L-SD-Federal-courthouses-2.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:39:11","author":"Alex Riggins","authors":["Alex Riggins"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":259116614,"title":"Democrat Flips Mayor's Seat in Area Trump Won by Over 10 Points","text":"Democrat Grier Hopkins clinched the Fairbanks North Star Borough mayoral seat in a razor-thin victory, flipping the post held by Republican Bruce Ward—who reached his term limit—in a region former President Donald Trump won by over 10 points in 2020.Municipal elections in the central Alaskan borough, which encompasses the cities of Fairbanks and North Pole, took place on October 1, and borough officials have been tallying absentee ballots during the last few days. According to the borough's \"unofficial results\" posted Tuesday afternoon, of the 19,703 votes counted, Hopkins secured the victory by a margin of 154 votes.Hopkins, former Alaska state representative who served from 2018 to 2022, edged out former Alaska State Senator John Bruce Coghill Jr. for the three-year term. Hopkins received 9,434 votes, or 48.41 percent of the total, while Coghill garnered 9,280 votes, or 47.62 percent. The margin of victory was less than 1 percent between the top two candidates.A third-party hopeful, Robert Shields, won 705 votes, 3.62 percent of the vote, which was instrumental in swinging the election. Voter turnout was around 25 percent.Hopkins told Newsweek in a statement Wednesday afternoon, \"The victory was close, and very hard fought but also amicable. Both myself and John Coghill ran mostly positive campaigns about how to grow our community, create a strong economy and Improve local quality of life. The differences were between how we'd get there, and I will prioritize stronger funding of our schools. That community first approach allowed for cross over partisan voters to support me, as opposed to partisan fights and culture war issues.\"Regarding both the previous and coming presidential election, Hopkins said, \"The FNSB [Fairbanks North Star Borough] voters like candidates who support Alaskan issues, and work together to solve problems. We are pragmatic people, and the majority of us are not registered for either party.\"Newsweek reached out to Coghill and Shields for comment via email on Wednesday.The Democratic victor is the son of former Mayor Luke Hopkins, who in 2016 lost the Alaska State Senate seat to Coghill. Ward served two terms in the role, having secured just over 50 percent of the vote in 2018, when he was first elected, and 82 percent in 2021.The Alaskan borough is in the traditionally red state, which favored Trump by 10 points in 2020, as the presidential nominee secured 52.8 percent of the vote to Biden's 42.8 percent.While the state reports election data based on House districts rather than boroughs, Fairbanks North Star Borough encompasses Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and a small portion of 6, as confirmed to Newsweek by the Alaska Division of Elections.In 2020, Trump carried those six districts with a 15-point lead, receiving 57.8 percent of the vote compared to Biden's 42.2 percent. When District 6 is excluded from the borough's count, Trump led by a smaller margin of 12.8 points, with 56.4 percent to Biden's 43.6 percent, but still led by more than at the state level.The only time a Democratic presidential candidate won Alaska was in 1964, when President Lyndon B.

attack would be \"lethal\" and \"surprising\", as a separate Israeli air strike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense centre in southern Lebanon, killing five members stationed there.\n\n\"Our attack will be lethal, precise and above all surprising,\" Mr Gallant said during a speech to Israeli troops on Wednesday, local time. \n\n\"They will not understand what happened and how it happened\". \n\nIran fired dozens of missiles at Israel last week in an escalation of the conflict between the two countries, and Israel has vowed to respond to the attack.\n\nOn the same day, an Israeli air strike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense center in the town of Dardghaya in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe strike killed five members stationed there, Civil Defense spokesperson Elie Khairallah told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Lebanese Health Ministry also confirmed the news in a statement, saying Israel has \"renewed its targeting of rescue and ambulance crews tonight, disregarding international laws, norms and humanitarian conventions\".\n\nThere was no immediate statement from the Israeli military.\n\nAmong the victims was Abdullah Al-Moussawi, head of the Tyre regional civil defence centre, Mr Khairallah said. \n\nThe health ministry said teams continued to search for survivors in the rubble.\n\nBefore Wednesday's strike, six civil defence members had been killed since last October, Mr Khairallah said.\n\nAs of last Thursday, the health ministry reported that more than 100 paramedics had been killed by Israeli air strikes since last October and 225 have been wounded.\n\nJust last week, Mr Al-Moussawi spoke with the Associated Press, saying the Israeli air strikes had made his team increasingly nervous, but that they were hopeful that the international protection guaranteed to medics would extend to them as well.\n\n\"We put international protection (tag) on our vehicles along with the (national) Civil Defense flag and we wear the yellow vests,\" he said.\n\nCentres in Lebanon shelter hundreds of thousands\n\nLebanon's crisis response unit announced on Wednesday that 22 people were killed and 80 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,141 killed and 10,099 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.\n\nThe report also recorded 70 air strikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley.\n\nSome 1,000 centres — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities and other institutions — are sheltering 185,400 people displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. \n\nHalf of those displaced are housed in facilities concentrated in Beirut and Mount Lebanon.\n\nAmong these shelters, 807 have reached full capacity. \n\nOverall, the total number of displaced individuals in Lebanon stands at an estimated 1.2 million.\n\nAdditionally, about 15,000 displaced individuals have received medical treatment and medication.\n\nIsraeli soldiers raise Israeli flag in southern Lebanon\n\nVideo verified by The Associated Press shows what appears to be a group of Israeli soldiers raising an Israeli flag in a village in southern Lebanon.\n\nIn the video, which appears to have been filmed in Maroun el-Ras, three soldiers are seen hoisting a flag atop a pile of debris. A soldier off camera speaks in Hebrew and refers to the nearby Israeli village of Avivim. It was not clear when the video was recorded.\n\nIsraeli troops have been operating in Maroun el-Ras, where they have taken up positions inside a public garden on the edge of the village.\n\nThe video follows other similar acts that took place throughout Israel's ground offensive in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military had no immediate comment.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu hold first phone call in seven weeks\n\nBiden and Netanyahu have broken nearly two months of silence with a phone call as Israel expands its ground incursion into Lebanon and considers how to respond to Iran. \n\nVice-President Kamala Harris also joined the 30-minute call, according to the White House.\n\n\"It was direct, it was productive,\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who added that the leaders discussed a long list of issues on the call, including Israel's deliberations on how it will respond to Iran.\n\nMr Netanyahu's office, meantime, confirmed that the prime minister had recently spoken with former president Donald Trump.\n\nThe Biden-Netanyahu conversation comes at a moment of Mr Biden's growing frustration with the prime minister and as the growing conflict in the Middle East is adding a layer of complexity to the American election next month.","summary":"Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has warned an Israeli strike on Iran in response to its recent missile attack would be \"lethal\" and \"surprising\", as a separate Israeli air strike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense centre in southern Lebanon, killing five members stationed there. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-10/israeli-retaliation-against-iran-thousands-in-lebanon-displaced/104454018","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2bcff8d0a8981ca66f05b26ada38b7a6?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:31:02","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":259116734,"title":"Brett Favre, a Personal Injury Lawyer and a 30-Second Pitch for Trump","text":"This 30-second ad, being run by a Florida trial lawyer named Dan Newlin in support of former President Donald J.

It would be so good,” Trump said. “I’m talking about Russia, ourselves and China. We would then bring everyone else into it.”\n\nNuclear weapons are “the biggest threat we have in the world today,” Trump argued. “It’s not global warming, where the oceans are rising 1/8 of an inch in the next 500 years.”\n\nNeither Russia nor China have yet commented on Trump’s claim about a denuclearization treaty in the works during his administration.\n\nTrump’s remarks came up during a discussion of Iran’s alleged nuclear program, in which he criticized President Joe Biden for being reluctant to confront Tehran. Biden has publicly urged Israel to refrain from striking Iranian nuclear and oil facilities.\n\nThe five nuclear-armed members of the UN Security Council had struck a deal with Tehran in 2015, under which Iran would not enrich uranium beyond a certain level, and therefore be unable to build atomic weapons. Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the arrangement in 2018. Though Biden promised to reinstate the deal, his diplomats failed to get any traction on the issue over the past four years.\n\nIn 2019, Trump also pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Treaty, accusing Russia of being in breach of it. That left the New START as the last remaining arms control deal between Russia and the US. Trump initially sought to get China to join the treaty, but Beijing declined, and it looked as if New START might expire at the start of Trump’s second term.\n\nThe Biden White House extended the treaty in February 2021, but it now looks likely it will expire in 2026. Russia suspended its participation in New START in February 2023, citing the illegal and illegitimate US sanctions preventing its reciprocal enforcement, as well as US support for Ukrainian attacks on Russian strategic air bases.\n\nTrump officially lost the 2020 election to Biden, but has questioned the vote’s legitimacy ever since. He won the 2024 Republican nomination and will face the current Vice-President Kamala Harris – nominated by the Democrats after Biden withdrew from the race in July – in the November 5 election.","summary":"The US was close to a nuclear deal with Russia and China that would later be expanded, the former president has claimed \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/605494-trump-global-nuclear-deal/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.10/article/670702d12030275f4648e9bc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:26:35","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.437},{"id":259115396,"title":"Hillary Clinton Advocates for Government Regulation of Social Media","text":"Hillary Clinton called for a government crack down on social media, sparking users on X to accuse her of saying ‘the quiet part out loud.’ The former Secretary of State told CNN host Michael Smerconish Saturday that leaders could ‘lose control’ if they don’t take serious action to censor digital content – sparking outcry on the web.\n\n‘Democrats see the internet as a propaganda tool rather than a medium for the open exchange of information!!’ Tom Callahan wrote on X. ‘They are afraid of exposure, indictment and imprisonment,’ Wendy Stone added. ‘I hope we make their fears come true.’\n\nClinton called for the federal government to imitate states like California and New York to place more controls on social media. ‘We need national action and sadly our Congress has been dysfunctional when it comes to addressing these threats to our children,’ Clinton said.\n\nClinton brought up the issue in the context of controlling more of what children were experiencing on social media and getting addicted to content on major platforms. She called for the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Act, the keeps online platforms from being held liable for content posted by users on their platforms.\n\nThat legal carve out, she argued, was an ‘overly simple view’ that did not take into account the dangers of social media. ‘[I]f the platforms, whether it’s Facebook or Twitter /X or Instagram or TikTok, whatever they are, if they don’t moderate and monitor the content, we lose total control,’ she said. But Clinton’s statement caused many to question her intentions. ‘Who is “we”?’ one pro-Trump account wrote on X, inquiring who exactly Clinton wanted to have control. ‘They’re all telling us what their goal is,’ Keith Outen wrote on X. ‘Only totalitarian governments use the phrase we must ban free speech or we lose control.’\n\nClinton claimed her proposed reforms would help protect children. ‘It’s not just the social and psychological affects, it’s real harm. It’s child [expletive] and threats of violence, things that are terrible dangerous,’ she said. Clinton said that if the legal protections were removed, social platforms would spend more time and money monitoring their own content. ‘We need to have guardrails, we need regulation,’ she said.\n\nThe former failed presidential candidate spoke about her new book to warn about many of the dangers rising up in communities around the country. She conceded that many of her proposed changes would require Democrats to be empowered in the federal government, so they could turn their focus to issues that she cared about. ‘Hopefully the election will turn out the right way, the fever will be broken and we can go back to try and put our families and communities on the right track,’ she said.\n\nSince she first lost her life-long dream of becoming the first female president of the United States to former President Donald Trump in the 2016 election, Clinton has blamed the rise of ‘misinformation’ and ‘fake news’ for convincing voters not to trust her. \n\nIn September, Clinton called for more controls on online activity, specifically against Americans who were paid by foreign countries to spread online propaganda. ‘We are only at the beginning of understanding the whole iceberg here,’ she said, warning of the Russians to deploy ‘more sophisticated’ operations to influence the United States.\n\nClinton proposed during an interview on MSNBC that the United States government to prosecute Americans for sharing information and propaganda on behalf of foreign governments. ‘I also think that there are Americans engaged in this kind of propaganda and whether they should be civilly or in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence,’ she said.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Moscow also denied that Putin spoke on the phone with Trump seven times after he left office in 2021, according to a state news agency.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, claimed an exchange of equipment did happen but denied that phone calls took place, a claim made in Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward’s upcoming book, titled War.\n\n“No, that’s not true,” Peskov said, according to TASS.\n\nHe told Bloomberg that there was communication between Washington and Moscow during the outset of the coronavirus pandemic regarding equipment exchanges.\n\n“We also sent [the US] equipment at the beginning of the pandemic,” Peskov told Bloomberg. “But as for the phone calls, this is not true.”\n\nTrump denied that he sent equipment to Moscow in a statement to ABC News. \n\n“That’s false,” Trump told ABC News’s ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl. “He’s a storyteller. A bad one. And he’s lost his marbles,”\n\nThe Kremlin’s statements appear to contradict the information coming out of Trump’s camp. However, the Kremlin provided no evidence of its claim that Trump had sent Covid testing equipment to Putin. The US government and intelligence agencies have repeatedly warned of Russian efforts to spread disinformation in the West, particularly in the build-up to the US election.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from the Trump campaign. \n\nTrump’s campaign has also denied Woodward’s claims regarding the phone calls.\n\n“None of these made-up stories by Bob Woodward are true,” Cheung said in a written statement to TASS.\n\n“President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount store or used as toilet tissue,” Cheung said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nWoodward attributes his claim that Trump and Putin stayed in contact after his presidential term expired to a single, anonymous Trump aide.\n\nThe New York Times wrote an early story about the book, and described a scene in which the aide was ordered to leave a room at Mar-a-Lago so Trump could take a call with Putin.\n\nCheung attributed Woodward’s claims in the book to the journalist’s frustration over the fact that Trump is suing him over recordings related to his previous book Rage.\n\n“Woodward is an angry little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously,” Cheung said.\n\nWhile researching Rage, Woodward recorded conversations he had with Trump. Woodward later released those recordings, which Trump claims he did not give Woodward permission to do. Trump subsequently sued Woodward, who claims he was never given any restriction over how he could use the recording.\n\nThe veteran journalist’s new book does not provide explicit details about the nature of the alleged calls between Trump and Putin, but does claim that at one point Putin — fearing infection by the coronavirus — asked Trump to send him “a bunch of Abbott Point of Care Covid test machines for his personal use.”\n\nThe book also claims that Putin asked Trump to keep the exchange a secret to protect his reputation.\n\n“I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me,” Putin allegedly told Trump, according to Woodward’s reporting.\n\nTrump reportedly told the Russian leader that “I don’t care.” But Putin allegedly insisted, claiming it would look worse for Trump than it would for him should the transaction come to light.\n\nWoodward’s book is published in the US on October 15.","summary":"Russian leader allegedly told Trump to keep the equipment exchange a secret to protect the former president’s reputation","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kemlin-trump-putin-covid-equipment-denial-b2626809.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/15/19/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wXdGkZEn-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:18:17","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.69},{"id":259116440,"title":"Harris Hits $1 Billion Mark, Outpacing Trump in U.S. Campaign Funds","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has achieved a remarkable milestone in her 2024 presidential campaign.

Harris’s fundraising success comes from various sources, including her campaign committee and joint fundraising committees.\n\nThese groups also collect funds for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. The campaign has invested heavily in advertisements and established a strong presence in key battleground states.\n\nIn August alone, Harris raised $361 million, with over 3 million individual donors contributing. By early September, her cash reserves stood at $404 million.\n\nThis broad base of support indicates growing enthusiasm for Harris‘s candidacy. Donald Trump has also demonstrated fundraising prowess, but his numbers fall short of Harris’s recent achievements.\n\nTrump’s campaign and associated groups have reported raising approximately $853 million throughout 2024. In August, Trump raised $130 million, significantly less than Harris’s $361 million for the same month.\n\nFinancial Landscape of the 2024 Presidential Race\n\nTrump’s campaign ended August with $295 million in cash reserves, lower than Harris’s $404 million. Trump’s team has emphasized their grassroots support, noting that 98% of donations in August were under $200, with an average donation of $56.\n\nBoth campaigns have benefited from substantial support from superPACs and billionaire donors.

The 2024 election is on track to break previous spending records, despite a seemingly shrinking pool of persuadable voters.\n\nAs the race enters its final weeks, both campaigns are focusing their resources on key battleground states. Harris’s team is using its financial advantage for voter outreach and advertising.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s campaign relies on support from Republican superPACs to help close the gap.

And when asked whether he was endorsing Hogan, Trump replied, \"Essentially I would be endorsing him, yeah.\" But Hogan indicated that he was not interested in the former president's endorsement, saying during an interview with WTOP, \"I didn't seek it, I didn't wanna have it, and I have no interest in it.\" Hogan has never voted for Trump and has said that he will not vote for Trump in 2024.

Ohio, the justices overturned the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader who uttered antisemitic and racist comments during an organizational meeting. Ohio could only outlaw speech, the court ruled, if it threatened imminent lawlessness.\n\nTwo decades later, in 1989, the court ruled that a Texas man could not be punished for burning an American flag.\n\n“If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable,” Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in his majority opinion. \n\nEven misinformation and lies are protected from criminal prosecution by the First Amendment, the court ruled in 2012, when it invalidated a federal law making it a crime to falsely claim military honors. \n\n“Falsity alone may not suffice to bring the speech outside the First Amendment,” the justices concluded. \n\nSo don’t worry, Gov. Walz. Despite the stolen-valor accusations against you, the Supreme Court has your back.\n\nIt’s not the government’s job to shield the public from falsehoods, the court explained in that case, United States v. Alvarez. \n\n“Our constitution’s tradition stands against” the need for a “Ministry of Truth,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, giving a nod to George Orwell’s “1984.”\n\nAnd political correctness, too, must take a back seat to freedom of speech, the court ruled in 2017, when it struck down a US Trademarks Office regulation that blocked Simon Tam and his Asian-American band members from calling themselves “The Slants,” which the agency had rejected as “disparaging.”\n\nFew reading these decisions will like all of them. But that’s the point. \n\nFreedom of speech doesn’t benefit any one group: It’s an even-handed principle that keeps democracy alive. \n\nThe racist KKK member, the communist and the anti-American flag burner are protected so that all of us can be confident of the ability to express our views fearlessly.\n\nBut while the First Amendment exists to protect unpopular views, more than half of Americans, 53%, think it “goes too far,” according to a poll sponsored by the Foundation for Freedom of Individual Rights and Expression — with Democrats especially opposed.\n\nWalz and Harris, together with President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and other Democrats have all come out against free speech — particularly on social media platforms, the 21st century’s public square. \n\nWalz insists there’s no First Amendment protection for misinformation or hate speech — staggering, coming from a former social studies teacher.\n\nIn 2019, Harris called on Twitter to deplatform Trump, arguing online expression is a “privilege” and that censorship is necessary to protect democracy.\n\nIn office, she and President Biden erected a vast censorship operation that sent White House and agency employees to tell social media executives what “misinformation” and which individuals should be silenced.\n\nEven scientists who questioned the efficacy of masking and vaccines were canceled and posts about their research removed — posts which, in many cases, later proved to be correct.\n\nFacebook, YouTube and Google were pressured into doing the administration’s dirty work, an effort that continues today. \n\nTwo states and five individuals sued to stop what the federal district court called this “far-reaching and widespread censorship campaign.” \n\nBut in the case, Murthy v. Missouri, the Supreme Court refused to rule on the censorship issue due to “standing,” a legal technicality.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, disgusted at the court’s punt, warned that the Biden-Harris censorship scheme was “blatantly unconstitutional” — and that democracy cannot survive under a government that suppresses free speech.\n\nPay close attention to Alito’s admonition. \n\nThat is what’s at stake in November. \n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York.","summary":"Since the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court has consistently struck down government attempts to silence speech — even speech that’s divisive, untrue or hateful.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/opinion/free-speech-101-americans-must-re-learn-our-most-basic-right/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/BILL12212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:11:21","author":"Betsy McCaughey","authors":["Betsy McCaughey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.013},{"id":259114574,"title":"Matthew McConaughey Mentors Son Levi on Set of Teen’s New Movie","text":"Breaking News\n\n Amid false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, officials say these are the real health challenges\n North Carolina Republican pushes back on hurricane misinformation:\n Trump is a critic of China’s trade practices.

Subscribe to Forbes Asia\n\nThis story is part of Forbes’ coverage of India’s Richest 2024. See the full list here.\n\nMore than 80% of India’s 100 richest tycoons are wealthier than they were a year ago.\n\nBy Naazneen Karmali, Forbes Staff\n\nwas a record-breaking year for India’s 100 richest tycoons, whose collective wealth surpassed the trillion dollar milestone for the first time. Investor enthusiasm about the India story after Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned to power for a third term in June, albeit with a coalition, put the stock market on overdrive. The benchmark BSE Sensex rose 30% since fortunes were measured a year ago.\n\nIndia’s wealthiest are worth $1.1 trillion, more than twice as rich as a they were in 2019. They added $316 billion or nearly 40% in just the past 12 months. More than 80% of the richest Indians are wealthier with 58 of them adding $1 billion or more to their respective net worths. Half a dozen fortunes swelled by more than $10 billion each, including the top five, who as a group gained nearly $120 billion. The top 12 list members account for roughly half the group’s combined wealth.\n\nMukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, who announced a bonus issue of shares as a Diwali gift to Reliance investors but was more in the news for hosting a series of jaw-dropping celebrations for his younger son Anant’s wedding, held on to the top spot. He’s the second-biggest gainer in dollar terms this year, up $27.5 billion to $119.5 billion,\n\nThe biggest dollar gainer is infrastructure magnate Gautam Adani, who posted a strong recovery from last year’s short-selling attack and recently placed his sons and nephews in key positions. With his brother Vinod, he added $48 billion to take the family’s net worth to $116 billion, enough to retain the No.2 position.\n\nIndia’s richest woman, Savitri Jindal, matriarch of steel-to-power conglomerate O.P. Jindal Group, whose son Sajjan Jindal recently made an ambitious foray into electric vehicles with MG Motor, moved up to No. 3 for the first time. She’s one of nine women on the list, up from eight a year ago.\n\nThe new woman in the ranks is Mahima Datla, who controls privately-held vaccine producer Biological E. She’s one of four newcomers to the list, a group that includes B.Partha Saradhi Reddy, founder of Hetero Labs, a maker of generic medicines and pharma ingredients.\n\nThe two other new faces are Harish Ahuja, whose apparel maker Shahi Exports supplies to labels such as H&M and Calvin Klein; India’s booming IPO market made Surender Saluja, founder and chairman of Premier Energies, which makes solar panels and modules, a multi-billionaire after his company got listed in September.\n\nIndia is the world’s pharma factory and the fortunes of its pharma magnates are flourishing as they seek a bigger share of global markets. Dilip Shanghvi, founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, jumped three spots to No. 5 with $32.4 billion on rising demand for its skin treatments for everything from acne to psoriasis; siblings Sudhir & Samir Mehta, whose Torrent Group flagship Torrent Pharmaceuticals is eyeing acquisitions, more than doubled their wealth to $16.3 billion.\n\nAnother booming sector is real estate with strong demand for homes driving up sales. Four prominent property fortunes on the list were up more than $16 billion combined. Another notable real estate gainer was Irfan Razack and his siblings, whose Bangalore-based developer Prestige Estates Projects rode the boom in India’s tech capital and is now making a mark in Mumbai, the country’s financial hub. The family is one of five members who had previously dropped out of the ranks but rejoined after a hiatus. The other four made their fortunes in everything from operating airports to making industrial explosives.\n\nThe storied Godrej family finally concluded a division of their holdings between two factions in April and as a result they appear separately for the first time: brothers Adi & Nadir Godrej, who control the listed companies under the Godrej Industries Group, and their cousins Jamshyd Godrej and Smita Crishna Godrej, who control their privately held flagship Godrej & Boyce under the Godrej Enterprises Group.\n\nThere are six nonagenarians on the list, most of whom have already passed on the baton to the next generation. The youngest list member is Nikhil Kamath, 38 who cofounded and runs discount brokerage Zerodha with his brother Nithin, 45.\n\nThe cutoff to make the ranks jumped to $3.3 billion from $2.3 billion in 2023, helping push 11 of last year’s billionaires out of the ranks.\n\nIndia’s 100 Richest differs from the World’s Billionaires list in that it combines fortunes of family members such as the Bajaj family and the Burman family whereas they are listed individually in the international rankings that came out in April.\n\nFull Coverage of India’s Richest 2024\n\nAfter Riding Bangalore’s Tech Boom, This Indian Property Magnate Stepped Out Of His Comfort Zone To Build A $6 Billion Fortune\n\nWhat’s Driving The Son Of India’s Richest Woman To Pour Billions Into EVs?\n\nAmid India’s Infrastructure Buildout, Billionaires Duke It Out For Cement Crown\n\nSridhar Vembu Built Zoho Into A Global Cloud Services Champ.

The ranking lists family fortunes, including those shared by such siblings as Gautam and Vinod Adani and also among larger extended families such as the Bajaj and Burman families. Public fortunes were calculated based on stock prices and exchange rates as of Sept. 27. Private companies were valued based on similar companies that are publicly traded. The list can also include foreign citizens with business, residential or other ties to the country, or citizens who don’t reside in the country but have significant business or other ties to the country.

Musk has additionally shared baseless accusations that FEMA doesn’t have enough funding to get through hurricane season because it gave away too much money to undocumented migrants, and he personally wrote that “FEMA used up its budget ferrying illegals into the country instead of saving American lives,” accusing the agency of committing “treason.” He also absurdly claimed last Friday that the Federal Aviation Administration planned to “shut down” airspace over parts of North Carolina that had been hit hard by Helene, a falsehood Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had to personally explain was not true.\nAddressing the onslaught of misinformation—which has also, unsurprisingly, come from Donald Trump—FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Tuesday that it “is absolutely the worst I have ever seen,” adding, “I anticipated some of this, but not to the extent that we’re seeing.” While she did not call out Musk or Trump directly by name, the issues she has been forced to deal with are products of what the two men have been irresponsibly saying online. “It’s just really unfortunate that [people] continue to try to create this level of fear in these communities that is impeding our ability to do our job at the level that we need to do it, but we’re not going to let it deter us,” Criswell told reporters. “We are going to continue to be in these communities and support them for whatever they need.” Keith Turi, FEMA’s acting associate administrator for response and recovery, listed off numerous falsehoods that have been shared, including by Musk, like that FEMA was “confiscating supplies.” He called the misinformation “extremely damaging to the response efforts from Helene and from any disaster,” noting that it “is reducing the likelihood that survivors will come to FEMA in a trusting way to register for assistance.”\nOver the weekend, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, wrote on X: “We need to work together to rebuild and recover from a catastrophic disaster like this one - and spreading false information to sow chaos hurts real people. Politicians, billionaires and grifters who peddle lies during a time of crisis should be held accountable.”\nOn Wednesday, Joe Biden slammed what he described as “a reckless, irresponsible, relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies” about the federal response first to Hurricane Helene and now to Hurricane Milton.\nMeanwhile, it’s not just the federal government and Democrats that are fed up with the lies but Republican lawmakers as well. “Many of these observations are not even from people on the ground,” North Carolina senator Thom Tillis told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “I believe that we have to stay focused on rescue operations, recovery operations, clearing operations, and we don’t need any of these distractions on the ground. It’s at the expense of the hard-working first responders and people that are just trying to recover their lives.”","summary":"A FEMA official called the falsehoods people are sharing on social media “extremely damaging.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/elon-musk-is-literally-hampering-hurricane-relief-efforts-misinformation","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/64d40a99f787e518faf0085b/16:9/w_4192,h_2358,c_limit/1216515595","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:09:57","author":"Bess Levin","authors":["Bess Levin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.671},{"id":259115180,"title":"Trump gaining in polling to win the ‘Blue Wall’ states as Harris poll momentum slows","text":"A new poll of three crucial swing states shows the 2024 race deadlocked while Kamala Harris’s momentum grinds to a crawl.\n\nHarris trails Trump in two midwestern battlegrounds, Michigan and Wisconsin, dragged down by concerns about her ability to manage America’s role in global crises, according to a Quinnipiac poll released on Wednesday. In both states, she is behind by low single digits; 50% to 47% in Michigan, and 48% to 46% in Wisconsin.\n\nShe leads the former president in Pennsylvania, however, the state analysts have suggested she could lose by not picking its governor, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate. Quinnipiac’s survey has her ahead, 49% to 46%, in Pennsylvania.\n\nAll three states are part of the “Blue Wall” — states which, from 1992 to the Trump era, supported Democrats every cycle. Trump won all three in 2016.\n\nThe vice president’s greatest polling drag appears to be her numbers on the war in the Middle East, where voters in all three states have, by considerable margins, less confidence in her leadership abilities than Donald Trump’s. The greatest gulf is in Michigan, home to substantial Arab-American, Palestinian-American and Muslim communities; Harris trails her opponent by 10 points on the issue here, 53% to 43%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, her greatest issue strength is on abortion. Voters trust her by double-digit margins in all three states, according to Quinnipiac, over Trump on issues of reproductive health and freedom.\n\nThere’s another important factor for both candidates to consider here: signs that Harris’s ceiling could be higher than her numbers show so far. While Harris trails her Republican opponent in Michigan and Wisconsin, Democrats are leading in Wisconsin’s Senate race and tied in Michigan, meaning the vice president is underperforming her party’s senatorial nominee by one point.\n\nWith just weeks left in the race, the polling suggests it may be time for Harris to break further away from her former running mate, Joe Biden, on issues where he too was trailing former President Trump in polling. She has done that already on the economy, by announcing several plans (such as a proposal to expand small-business and first-time homebuyer tax credits) previously not part of Biden’s 2024 re-election platform.\n\nBut it also suggests that Donald Trump is in a clear position to win the 2024 election, despite trailing his opponent in fundraising every month since she took over the Democratic ticket in July, and a debate showdown largely recognized as a victory for Harris last month.\n\nAnother poll released on Wednesday had far better news for Harris, as well as Trump’s rivals within the GOP itself.\n\nIn a survey commissioned by a Democratic strategy outfit, The Bulwark reports that Donald Trump appears to be winning only a fraction of Republican voters who went for his main rival, Nikki Haley, in this year’s GOP presidential primary. Trump won the votes of 46% of those Republicans, according to the survey, while 36% backed Harris.","summary":"Vice president is weighed down by concerns about Gaza conflict, dampening Democratic enthusiasm","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-poll-swing-states-b2626810.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/06/15/TrumpHarris.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/eGIwb6iA-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:08:11","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.049},{"id":259116384,"title":"Pjesë nga librit që do “trondisë” botën: ç’mendon vërtet Joe për Bibin?","text":"Në librin e tij të ri, gazetari legjendar Bob Woodward ofron një vështrim të jashtëzakonshëm nga prapaskenat e vlerësimeve dhe ndërveprimeve të prera dhe plot shpifje të Presidentit Joe Biden me liderët botërorë që kanë formësuar presidencën e tij, nga Benjamin Netanyahu te Vladimir Putin.\n\n“Ai bir i kurvës, Bibi Netanyahu, ai është një njeri i keq.

Monday was Georgia’s registration deadline. Instead, Ross set another hearing for Thursday to consider more evidence and legal arguments. \n\nState officials and the state Republican Party argue it would be a heavy burden on counties to order them to register additional voters as they prepare for early in-person voting to begin next Tuesday. \n\nThe lawsuit was filed by the Georgia conference of the NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda and the New Georgia Project. All three groups say they had to cancel voter registration activities last week. Historically, there’s a spike in Georgia voter registrations just before the deadline, the plaintiffs said.\n\nGeorgia has 8.2 million registered voters, according to online records from Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office. But with Georgia’s presidential race having been decided by only 12,000 votes in 2020, a few thousand votes could make a difference in whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris wins the state’s 16 electoral votes. At least 10 lawsuits related to election issues have been filed in Georgia in recent weeks.\n\nThe groups say the storm kept people with driver’s licenses from registering online because of widespread power and internet outages in the eastern half of the state and kept people from registering in person because at least 37 county election offices were closed for parts of last week. The lawsuit also notes that mail pickup and delivery was suspended in 27 counties, including the cities of Augusta, Savannah, Statesboro, Dublin and Vidalia.\n\nA federal judge in Florida denied a request to reopen voter registration in that state after hearing arguments Wednesday. The plaintiffs are considering whether to appeal. The lawsuit brought by the Florida chapters of the League of Women Voters and NAACP contends that thousands of people may have missed the registration deadline because they were recovering from Helene or preparing to evacuate from Milton. \n\nA court in South Carolina extended that state’s registration deadline after Helene, and courts in Georgia and Florida did extend registration deadlines after 2016’s Hurricane Matthew. In North Carolina, which was more heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene, the registration deadline isn’t until Friday. Voters there can also register and cast a ballot simultaneously during the state’s early in-person voting period, which runs from Oct. 17 through Nov. 2.\n\nThe Georgia plaintiffs argued that the shutdown of voter registration violates their rights under the First Amendment and 14th Amendment, which guarantee equal protection and due process to all citizens. They also say the shutdown violates a provision of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act that requires states to accept voter registrations submitted or mailed up to 30 days before an election.\n\nAt least 40 advocacy groups asked Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger to extend the registration deadline in affected counties before the Georgia lawsuit was filed.","summary":"A federal judge will hear more evidence on whether to reopen voter registration in Georgia  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-voter-registration-election-hurricane-helene-8707fe9c27749f097f4e7318ab06fb1c","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/48a341b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3780+0+350/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fad%2F75%2Fb6f41c2b41190bc511498b0ab0c0%2F50b5367cef594bed8d2e75b5eadac158","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:06:00","author":"Jeff Amy","authors":["Jeff Amy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":259114676,"title":"Trump-Putin ties are back in the spotlight after new book describes calls","text":"WASHINGTON - \n\n\r\n A new book's assertion that former President Donald Trump may have had as many as seven private phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving the White House has refocused attention on their politically fraught relationship and on Trump's sustained dialogue with world leaders as he seeks a return to power.\n\n\r\n It's not surprising in and of itself that an ex-president would preserve ties with foreign counterparts. But the detail in journalist Bob Woodward's book “War” raised eyebrows in light of a special counsel investigation during Trump's presidency that examined potential ties between Russia and the Republican's 2016 campaign as well as Trump's more recent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion — statements that have hinted at a possible U.S. policy overhaul if he's elected.\n\n\r\n\r\n The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\r\n\n\r\n “I would caution any world leader about trusting Vladimir Putin with anything,” said Emily Harding, who led the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and is now a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\r\n Both the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, which U.S. officials have said is working to influence the 2024 election in favour of Trump, denied the reporting.\n\n\r\n Asked at a press briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration would have “serious concerns” if the reported calls were true.\n\n\r\n “We’re not aware of those calls. I certainly can’t confirm any of those calls from here,” she said. “But, if it is indeed true, are we (concerned)? Do we have serious concerns? Yes.”\n\n\r\n It's no secret that Trump has held multiple meetings over the last year with major world leaders: hosting Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sitting down in New York last April with Polish President Andrzej Duda and meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president's trip to the U.S. last month.\n\n\r\n The meetings offer Trump an opportunity to differentiate his foreign policy approach from that of President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to shore up connections if he reclaims the White House. During Netanyahu's visit in July, Trump boasted of a “great relationship,” drawing a tacit contrast with the more strained dynamic between the Israeli leader and Biden.\n\n\r\n While those meetings were known publicly, Woodward's book cites an unnamed aide as saying Trump and Putin had as many as seven private calls. That adds to long-running questions about their relationship and what Trump may be trying to achieve, said Robert Orttung, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University.\n\n\r\n As president, “We never really understood why he liked Putin so much and why he was trying to develop such a close relationship with someone who is clearly an adversary and against everything the United States stands for,” Orttung said.\n\n\r\n\r\n Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp\r\n\n\r\n Some claims about ties between Trump and allies and Russia have proved overheated or fizzled over time, but the subject continues to draw considerable public scrutiny, including after Trump left office.\n\n\r\n The FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller spent several years investigating whether Russia had colluded with the 2016 Trump campaign to tip the outcome of the election. Though investigators did not establish a criminal conspiracy, they did find the Trump campaign actively welcomed Russia's help during the election and that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency.\n\n\r\n In 2018, after meeting Putin in Helsinki, Trump memorably and publicly questioned his own intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia meddled in the election.\n\n\r\n “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Trump said at the time. He added: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.”\n\n\r\n More recently, Trump called Putin “pretty smart” for invading Ukraine and has praised Russia's military record in historical conflicts, saying last month: \"As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.”\n\n\r\n The book, which also says Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic, does not describe the content of their conversations.\n\n\r\n Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung denied they occurred, calling the book by the famed Watergate journalist the “work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.” Trump complained at a campaign event on Wednesday that “I had to go through years of Russia, Russia, Russia, and they knew it was fake.”\n\n\r\n A Kremlin spokesman also denied the calls happened.\n\n\r\n The book's details revived discussion about the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that bars private American citizens from trying to intervene in “disputes or controversies” between the United States and foreign powers without government approval.\n\n\r\n\r\n America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective\r\n\n\r\n The statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction. Former presidents from Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton have held talks with international figures after leaving the White House.\n\n\r\n “Trump could be technically liable just as I think dozens of prominent figures have been technically liable,” said Daniel Rice, a University of Arkansas law professor and constitutional law expert.\n\n\r\n Among the possible reasons for the law's dormancy, Rice said, is a disinclination by prosecutors to “turn violators into martyrs\" or to be seen as targeting a sitting president's political adversaries.\n\n\r\n Trump himself was briefed by then-White House counsel Don McGahn about the Logan Act following a well-publicized episode involving his first national security adviser. In a phone call during the presidential transition period in 2016, Michael Flynn urged Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. to be “even-keeled” in response to Obama administration penalties imposed for election interference and assured him that “we can have a better conversation\" after Trump became president.\n\n\r\n Flynn was interviewed by the FBI about that conversation and pleaded guilty to lying to agents about it, though Trump pardoned Flynn in the final weeks of his presidency.\n\n\r\n Trump later called for former Secretary of State John Kerry to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act over his conversations with Iran after he left the Obama administration. Kerry was never charged.\n\n\r\n\n\r\n Associated Press writer Will Weissert in Washington contributed.","summary":"A new book's assertion that former U.S. president Donald Trump may have had as many as seven private phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving the White House has refocused attention on their politically fraught relationship and on Trump's sustained dialogue with world leaders as he seeks a return to power.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-putin-ties-are-back-in-the-spotlight-after-new-book-describes-calls-1.7068535","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/10/9/donald-trump-meets-vladimir-putin-1-7068557-1728510946670.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:05:19","author":"Eric Tucker,The Associated Press","authors":["Eric Tucker","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":259113542,"title":"China, US locked in lose-lose tech battle whoever wins White House, experts say","text":"The presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris comes at a time of rising geopolitical tensions on multiple fronts. In the first of an in-depth series, Jane Cai takes a look at what lies ahead for the hi-tech rivalry between China and the US.\nWashington and Beijing’s hi-tech rivalry is expected to continue and even intensify, regardless of who wins the US presidential election, according to analysts who say the tone for further strained US-China relations has already been set.\nFormer president Donald Trump’s boast that he took “billions and billions of dollars” from China through tariffs on a wide variety of Chinese imports, including hi-tech products, suggest that higher duties could be on the way if he wins the White House.\nMeanwhile, Vice-President Kamala Harris has promised to make sure “that America – not China – wins the competition for the 21st century and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership”.\nThe approaches of the candidates may differ but the tech competition between China and the US will continue to weigh heavily on the international economic and geopolitical landscape, analysts said.\n“Breakthroughs in science and technology will be central to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century and to efforts by the US and China to dominate it,” said Sourabh Gupta, a senior policy specialist with the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington.\n“To be clear, there is no ‘new cold war’ that is about to break out as yet in US-China relations [of] the sort of overarching zero-sum rivalry that played out between Washington and Moscow during the second half of the 20th century,” Gupta said.\n“However, there is a palpable cold war-style, zero-sum equation settling into their competition to dominate the high-technology and advanced manufacturing industries of tomorrow.”\nThe US has been tightening its grip on technology transfers with China for years, denying market access to Chinese tech products and cracking down on technology-related investments in both directions.\n\nTelecoms equipment giants Huawei and ZTE were banned from the US during the Trump administration because of alleged links to the Chinese government and military.\nSales of advanced chips and chip-making equipment to China by the US and its allies have also been banned on national security grounds.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasised the importance of technological self-reliance and the development of home-grown industries of the future, including AI and quantum computing, to keep China in the global tech race.\nAnalysts expect Harris to stick with President Joe Biden’s “small yard, high fence” approach to China if she wins in November. The strategy puts strict restrictions on a few military-related technologies while maintaining normal economic exchanges in other areas.\nBut the same semiconductors that are subject to export controls because of their use in advanced artificial intelligence models, weapons and surveillance systems are also used in autonomous vehicles, 5G-connected phones, and commercial applications of AI.\nThe Biden administration has also barred hundreds of Chinese companies from importing almost all US-origin products from the US and its allies and introduced inbound and outbound investment screening if tech firms are involved.\nHarris is also expected to raise the fencing over computing-related technologies, biotech and clean tech – areas singled out by the Biden administration as a “national security imperative” for the US to hold its leadership position.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed 25 laws in just one week of September, in a largely bipartisan push to limit China’s influence by restricting access to China-linked biotech companies, China-made drones and even Chinese electric vehicle components.\nWu Hailong, president of the semi-official China Public Diplomacy Association, warned that the “anti-China bills could potentially push the Sino-US relationship into a dangerous position once again”.\nThe latest bills follow the Chips and Science Act, enacted in August 2022, that set aside US$53 billion to fund American semiconductor production and research and was hailed by the White House for “protecting national security” as well as “bringing semiconductor supply chains home”.\nAccording to Pang Zhongying, chair professor in international political economy at Sichuan University in Chengdu, “there is already a complete set of rules and regulations to curb China’s technological development”.\n“If Harris is elected, policy continuity will be the main theme, though she may show her own preference later, if she has a second term,” he said.\nIf Trump is returned to the presidency, he is likely to tilt towards a “smaller government”, reduce industry subsidies and resort to trade tariffs again as a bargaining tool, Pang said.\nTrump has recently called for up to 20 per cent tariffs on all imports and 60 per cent on Chinese goods, prompting many experts to predict that a second Trump presidency would be more confrontational towards Beijing.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, the Trump administration imposed four rounds of tariffs on about two-thirds of US imports from China, after an investigation found China’s practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation were “unreasonable or discriminatory and burdened or restricted US commerce”.\n“The silver lining [for China] may be Trump’s attitude towards American allies. After all, not all companies in other countries are willing to abandon the massive market of China,” Pang said.\nThe Biden administration has been pressing US allies – including the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan – to tighten restrictions on China’s access to semiconductor technology.\nHowever, Trump, an “America First” advocate, is dubious about alliances and has been a vocal critic of world organisations such as Nato.\nThere are also concerns in Europe that a victory for Trump in November could mean a decline in US aid to Ukraine.\n\nMei Xinyu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce, said that while their approaches may vary, both candidates intend to press ahead with technology curbs on China.\nAccording to Mei, the confrontation is likely to reach a peak during the next US president’s four-year tenure.\n“During that period, China’s focus will be on technological development. It will spare no effort to innovate and industrialise innovation results as soon as possible by taking advantage of its economic scale.”\nBeijing has pumped nearly 690 billion yuan (US$97 billion) into the chip industry since 2014, in its bid to be able to mass produce its own advanced chips, and is also pursuing a bigger say in global AI governance.\nChina has also doubled down on its efforts to persuade the many leading Chinese scientists overseas to return home and train domestic talent in the emerging hi-tech industries.\nIn June, Xi wrote to world-renowned computer scientist and AI expert Andrew Yao Chi-Chih, the only Chinese winner of the AM Turing Award, to praise his decision to leave the US two decades ago to teach at Tsinghua University.\nXi urged Yao – who heads the university’s Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences and the new College of Artificial Intelligence – to continue helping China achieve self-reliance and become an educational, scientific and technological powerhouse.\n\nAccording to Richard Suttmeier, a University of Oregon researcher looking at science and technology in the context of US-China relations, “in many ways, the current situation is one of lose-lose for both countries”.\n“China’s commitment to high levels of self-reliance in science and technology development, in spite of numerous international ties, puts it somewhat at odds with global trends,” he said.\n“US efforts to build a network of cooperation in science and technology among democracies will have some national and international benefits in the shorter run, but as a strategy that attempts to isolate China’s emergence as a science and technology superpower, is likely to run into big problems over the longer run.”\nSix of the top 10 rising institutions in artificial intelligence between 2019 and 2023 were in China, but they remained relatively decoupled from US-led global collaboration networks, according to the latest Nature Index.\nThe AI index, compiled by part of the group that owns the British journal Nature, found that China’s global connectivity is lagging behind the US – the leading AI research nation – as well as Britain and Germany.\nAccording to Michael Frank, chief executive and founder of business intelligence platform Seldon Strategies, the US-China relationship has settled into a new equilibrium that will persist for a long time.\n“Tactics may change, but the US strategy of limiting technology transfer to China, and the Chinese strategy of achieving technological self-sufficiency, are fixed,” he said.\n“Many countries are wary of being forced to choose between the US and China. Even if the competitors don’t make those demands explicitly, global companies will have to make a decision between which ecosystem to prioritise.”","summary":"The rivalry to dominate in AI, quantum computing and other technologies of the future may even intensify after November’s election.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3281480/china-us-locked-lose-lose-tech-battle-whoever-wins-white-house-experts-say","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/09/154b346f-fe6a-49b9-847e-def51c581634_2e3c6115.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 22:00:09","author":"Jane Cai","authors":["Jane Cai"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.001},{"id":259119752,"title":"Underwood, Marter differ on immigration solutions","text":"Democratic U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Naperville and Republican challenger James Marter of Oswego agree that the nation’s immigration system has significant problems — but their solutions differ vastly.\n\nUnderwood and Marter spoke about immigration and other issues in a joint, online interview with the Daily Herald ahead of the 14th Congressional District election.\n\nMarter, a software consultant and library board member, said immigration is his top issue and repeatedly called the flow of migrants into the U.S. an “invasion.”\n\nMarter complained about the migrants who have been bused to other states, including Illinois. When it was pointed out that Republican governors in Texas and Florida have been responsible for sending migrants elsewhere, Marter defended those governors’ actions and blamed the failures of the federal government to stop illegal immigration.\n\n“What would you do? You need to send them somewhere else,” said Marter, who is making his fifth bid for federal office.\n\nMarter said prospective immigrants should apply to enter the U.S. legally and stay in their home countries while awaiting decisions. The U.S. policy of releasing migrants into American communities while they await court hearings should end, he said.\n\nHe also opposes creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. U.S. immigration policy should stop prioritizing family unification, he added.\n\nAdditionally, Marter said the U.S. should end the facet of birthright citizenship that automatically grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, even if the baby’s parents aren’t citizens. He supports the facet of birthright citizenship that automatically grants citizenship to a baby if at least one parent is a citizen.\n\nMarter isn’t merely concerned about illegal immigration. He called for a cap on “all immigration.”\n\nUnderwood, who is seeking a fourth term, noted immigrants have been vital to the cultural vibrancy and economic success of the U.S. since its founding. She criticized GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump’s negative descriptions of migrants as “disgusting.”\n\nBut Underwood acknowledged the U.S. immigration system is “deeply broken.” Comprehensive reform that secures borders, protects workers and keeps families together is needed, she said.\n\nUnlike Marter, Underwood supports creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought here as children, as well as for migrant farmworkers and their families.\n\nUnderwood lashed out at the GOP governors who have sent groups of newly arrived migrants to other states, calling the efforts inhumane.\n\nShe said she would’ve backed the bipartisan border security proposal that was negotiated in the Senate with White House support but foundered earlier this year. She called Trump’s lobbying of Republican lawmakers to oppose the bill as “unacceptable” and praised President Joe Biden for taking executive action to reduce illegal crossings at the southern border.\n\nMarter responded with sarcasm, saying he “didn’t know President Trump was in Congress and he could vote on a bill.” When asked if he would’ve supported the legislation, Marter criticized the proposal as “overregulation” and “burdensome.”\n\n“We need to enforce existing immigration law,” Marter said. “We don’t need new laws here, folks.”\n\nThe 14th District includes parts of Kane, Will and five other counties.

Tom Suozzi and challenger Mike LiPetri, sparred over who is more attuned to the needs and interests of the district’s residents during a debate on Tuesday night.\n\nThe debate ran for just under one hour, with each candidate allowed 90 seconds to respond to a question submitted in advance from someone in the district, and a shorter time to rebut what his opponent said.\n\nThe two candidates argued over issues including policing, climate concerns, the illegal immigration crisis, taxing of tips, housing on Long Island, and how to preserve Nassau County’s unique character.\n\nSuozzi defeated Republican Mazi Pilip in February and became the district’s congressman through a special election to fill the void after Rep. George Santos’s expulsion from Congress in a corruption scandal.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s debate, Suozzi suggested LiPetri was more concerned with proving his loyalty to former President Donald Trump than with accomplishing things for the communities that comprise the Third District.\n\nLiPetri, a former New York state assemblyman, suggested Suozzi has catered to ideologically driven interests within his party, from “defund the police” to the pro-Hamas and anti-Israel factions.\n\nThe Republican challenger criticized Suozzi’s record, noting that this year, the congressman voted against the bipartisan End the Border Catastrophe Act and the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which LiPetri said would have prevented illegal immigrants from voting in elections.\n\n“He raised our taxes by $200 million, backstabbed the police, and betrayed the Jewish community when he wanted to be an honorary member of the Squad,” LiPetri said of Suozzi.\n\nMeanwhile, Suozzi said it was time to heal the bipartisan divide.\n\n“The bottom line is that climate change is very, very real, we see it in all these storms happening more and more often. That’s why I’ve been endorsed by every major environmental group, because I’ve supported the projects necessary to deal with climate change,” Suozzi said.\n\nIn making his case, Suozzi highlighted his previous record as a Third District representative from 2017 to 2023, before attempting to run for governor after Andrew Cuomo’s resignation.\n\n“People talk about infrastructure for decades, but we finally got it done in 2021 and 2022. And brought in millions of dollars into this region to try and address coastal resiliency,” he said.\n\nLiPetri contrasted the approach of Suozzi, which he called a “top-down” strategy relying heavily on federal intervention, with what he characterized as his own locally rooted approach to climate and environmental issues.\n\nHe called for inspections and upgrading of lead pipe infrastructure in Nassau County and the prevention of saltwater intrusions and flooding.\n\n“[Suozzi] is coming with this top-down government control,” LiPetri said. “I’m going to be working with the mayors, working with the towns, talking about the issues, what they need, organic bottom-up solutions.”\n\nLiPetri suggested Suozzi was aligned with the fiscal policies of Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, who proposes to tax unrealized capital gains, a policy that LiPetri called “crazy.”\n\nSuozzi dismissed his opponent’s characterizations, saying that during his last term in Congress, he “led the effort” to restore tax deductions.\n\nAccording to Suozzi, he helped pass state and local tax deductions in the House no fewer than three times, but they failed to clear the Senate. This was partly a result of a lack of interest on the part of Republicans, he said.\n\nSuozzi also pushed back against LiPetri’s suggestion that he was an outsider who pushed development recklessly without regard for the idiosyncratic character of Nassau County as a prosperous suburban community.\n\n“We need to keep 99 percent of Long Island the same way it is now—single-family homes, parks, beaches, open spaces—but we need to focus on developing our downtown areas around our train stations,” he said.\n\nLiPetri introduced legislation to criminalize “water-dousing” attacks on police officers, while Suozzi voted in favor of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which makes it easier to prosecute police officers for alleged misconduct. LePetri said the act “betrayed police officers” and made it much harder for them to do their jobs with the threat of civil litigation hanging over them.\n\n“It allows police officers to be personally sued for conduct in the line of duty. As your congressman, I want to make sure we’re doubling down on criminals,” LiPetri said.\n\nLiPetri added that he favored the death penalty for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.\n\nSuozzi repeatedly highlighted the endorsement he had received from the Nassau County police organizations.\n\n“It’s not because of a deal, it’s because I’ve always stood with law enforcement,” he said.\n\nOn the related issue of illegal immigration and border policy, Suozzi said that while in Congress previously, he had opposed allowing asylum applications outside ports of entry. Thanks to an executive order on this issue, the number of applications went down, he said.\n\nSuozzi said he had worked on the immigration issue directly with conservative Rep. Morgan Luttrell (R-Texas), a fact he suggested illustrated his bipartisan instincts.\n\nLiPetri pointed out that Suozzi voted against the SAVE Act, which Rep. Luttrell supported.\n\nIf elected, LiPetri promised he would help establish a fully funded biometric entry system at the border, reinstate a “stay-in-Mexico” policy for asylum seekers, and end the policy of “catch and release,” which he said Suozzi had helped codify.\n\nLiPetri also vowed to support mass deportations to ease the burden on social services and reduce the number of criminals on American streets.","summary":"The incumbent Democrat and his Republican challenger matched wits and tempers in a lively debate addressing issues of concern to Nassau County and the nation.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/new-yorks-3rd-congressional-district-candidates-clash-over-crime-migration-taxes-in-debate-5738249","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/09/id5738498-Tom-Suozzi-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 21:56:12","author":"Michael Washburn","authors":["Michael Washburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.086},{"id":259114578,"title":"Day in Photos: Dissolved Parliament, Shrinking Economy, and Peaceful Revolution Remembrance","text":"Supporters of Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump wait for the start of a campaign rally at Riverfront Sports in Scranton, Pa., on Oct. 9, 2024.

But the detail in journalist Bob Woodward’s book “War” raised eyebrows in light of a special counsel investigation during Trump’s presidency that examined potential ties between Russia and the Republican’s 2016 campaign as well as Trump’s more recent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion — statements that have hinted at a possible U.S. policy overhaul if he’s elected.\n\n“I would caution any world leader about trusting Vladimir Putin with anything,” said Emily Harding, who led the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and is now a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBoth Trump campaign and the Kremlin, which U.S. officials have said is working to influence the 2024 election in favor of Trump, denied the reporting.\n\nAsked at a press briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration would have “serious concerns” if the reported calls were true.\n\n“We’re not aware of those calls.

During Netanyahu’s visit in July, Trump boasted of a “great relationship,” drawing a tacit contrast with the more strained dynamic between the Israeli leader and Biden.\n\nWhile those meetings were known publicly, Woodward’s book cites an unnamed aide as saying Trump and Putin had as many as seven private calls.

But the detail in journalist Bob Woodward’s book “War” raised eyebrows in light of a special counsel investigation during Trump’s presidency that examined potential ties between Russia and the Republican’s 2016 campaign as well as Trump’s more recent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion — statements that have hinted at a possible U.S. policy overhaul if he’s elected.\n\n“I would caution any world leader about trusting Vladimir Putin with anything,” said Emily Harding, who led the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and is now a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBoth Trump campaign and the Kremlin, which U.S. officials have said is working to influence the 2024 election in favor of Trump, denied the reporting.\n\nAsked at a press briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration would have “serious concerns” if the reported calls were true.\n\n“We’re not aware of those calls. I certainly can’t confirm any of those calls from here,” she said. “But, if it is indeed true, are we (concerned)? Do we have serious concerns? Yes.”\n\nIt’s no secret that Trump has held multiple meetings over the last year with major world leaders: hosting Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sitting down in New York last April with Polish President Andrzej Duda and meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president’s trip to the U.S. last month.\n\nThe meetings offer Trump an opportunity to differentiate his foreign policy approach from that of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to shore up connections if he reclaims the White House. During Netanyahu’s visit in July, Trump boasted of a “great relationship,” drawing a tacit contrast with the more strained dynamic between the Israeli leader and Biden.\n\nWhile those meetings were known publicly, Woodward’s book cites an unnamed aide as saying Trump and Putin had as many as seven private calls. That adds to long-running questions about their relationship and what Trump may be trying to achieve, said Robert Orttung, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nAs president, “We never really understood why he liked Putin so much and why he was trying to develop such a close relationship with someone who is clearly an adversary and against everything the United States stands for,” Orttung said.\n\nSome claims about ties between Trump and allies and Russia have proved overheated or fizzled over time, but the subject continues to draw considerable public scrutiny, including after Trump left office.\n\nThe FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller spent several years investigating whether Russia had colluded with the 2016 Trump campaign to tip the outcome of the election. Though investigators did not establish a criminal conspiracy, they did find the Trump campaign actively welcomed Russia’s help during the election and that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency.\n\nIn 2018, after meeting Putin in Helsinki, Trump memorably and publicly questioned his own intelligence agencies ’ conclusion that Russia meddled in the election.\n\n“I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Trump said at the time. He added: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.”\n\nMore recently, Trump called Putin “pretty smart” for invading Ukraine and has praised Russia’s military record in historical conflicts, saying last month: “As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That’s what they do. They fight. And it’s not pleasant.”\n\nThe book, which also says Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic, does not describe the content of their conversations.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung denied they occurred, calling the book by the famed Watergate journalist the “work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.” Trump complained at a campaign event on Wednesday that “I had to go through years of Russia, Russia, Russia, and they knew it was fake.”\n\nA Kremlin spokesman also denied the calls happened.\n\nThe statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction. Former presidents from Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton have held talks with international figures after leaving the White House.\n\n“Trump could be technically liable just as I think dozens of prominent figures have been technically liable,” said Daniel Rice, a University of Arkansas law professor and constitutional law expert.\n\nAmong the possible reasons for the law’s dormancy, Rice said, is a disinclination by prosecutors to “turn violators into martyrs” or to be seen as targeting a sitting president’s political adversaries.\n\nTrump himself was briefed by then-White House counsel Don McGahn about the Logan Act following a well-publicized episode involving his first national security adviser.

The five-point margin is the closest the two candidates have been since Harris announced her presidential bid in July.At that time, a poll from July 21 to 23 showed Harris leading by six points with 44 percent support. However, throughout August and September, Harris saw larger gains. A September 1-2 poll showed her with 59 percent support to Trump's 30 percent, a 29-point lead, while a September 15-17 poll had her leading by 28 points.The October survey shows the narrowest gap yet, suggesting a shift in momentum toward Trump as both candidates intensify their campaigns. Hispanics are a crucial voting bloc in 2024, with about 36.2 million eligible to vote, making them the second-largest group of eligible voters, after white voters. Of these, 17.5 million are expected to vote, including significant populations in swing states like Arizona, Nevada and Florida.The survey also underscored the top issues driving decisions among Hispanic voters. The economy and immigration emerged as the most important concerns. According to the poll, 78 percent of Hispanic respondents considered jobs and the economy \"very important\" when deciding their vote, while 57 percent emphasized immigration​.Historically, Latinos have leaned Democratic, but recent shifts in voting patterns have raised concerns for the party. A UnidosUS poll shows that while Harris still leads Trump among Latino voters, her 59 percent support is slightly lower than the 61 percent Joe Biden secured in 2020.Among Hispanics, younger voters are especially important for this election, according to recent research. According to UnidosUS, 38 percent of the Hispanic electorate will be new since the 2016 Trump-Hillary Clinton race, with 1 in 5 casting a vote in a presidential election for the first time.Throughout the campaign, Trump and Harris have taken new approaches to connect with Hispanic voters, moving away from traditional Spanish-language outlets like Univision and Telemundo. Harris has focused on engaging with local media, while Trump has targeted young Hispanic men, earning endorsements from Puerto Rican reggaeton stars like Anuel and Nicky Jam.With 27 days until the election, neither Trump nor Harris has yet participated in a Spanish-only media event. Harris is scheduled to appear on Univision later this week, with Trump following next week after his initial appearance was delayed by weather.The latest Economist/YouGov poll shows Harris leading. Among registered voters, she holds a narrow edge with 47 percent support compared to Trump's 44 percent. The gap widens slightly among likely voters, with Harris at 49 percent and Trump at 45 percent.","summary":"The former president is gaining support among Hispanic voters, narrowing the gap in the latest Economist/YouGov poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-surges-close-gap-against-harris-key-voting-group-poll-1966720","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2491606/donald-trump-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-09 21:52:51","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":259114404,"title":"Biden Forced To Remind Everyone He Doesn’t Control The Weather","text":"For politicians who still ground their rhetoric, more or less, in the real world, there’s an argument to be made for they-go-low-we-go-high-ing your way out of acknowledging most of the far-right’s most vile, racist, extreme and dangerous conspiracy theories, including those propagated by Donald Trump himself.\n\nBut President Biden found himself in a tricky spot this week: choosing between ignoring the wildly false claims being spread about his administration’s response to two (one impending) catastrophic natural disasters or letting Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene continue saying incredibly stupid and untrue stuff to their audiences unchecked, right before the onslaught of one of the largest storms to ever make landfall in Florida, which is forcing millions to evacuate.\n\nDuring a briefing with Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday on the trajectory of Hurricane Milton, Biden announced that his administration was making an “unprecedented number of assets” available to prepare for Milton’s landfall, as well as dealing with the aftermath of the Category 4 storm and Hurricane Helene. But he also, he said, had to address the “onslaught of lies” that Trump has been spreading, baselessly claiming that people’s homes and/or property are being confiscated after evacuating to escape Helene and that people impacted by the storm are only receiving $750 in assistance. He’s also claimed that federal disaster relief funds meant for hurricane victims were being distributed to undocumented immigrants. Biden debunked that as well.\n\n“But now I want to be clear about something. Over the last few weeks, there’s been a reckless, irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies that are disturbing people,” Biden said. “It’s undermining confidence in the incredible rescue and recovery work that has already been taken and will continue to be taken. It’s harmful to those who need help the most. There is simply no place for this to happen.”\n\nBut he saved his most biting remarks for Greene, who has been spreading the lie that the federal government (??) geo-engineered (??) Hurricane Helene in order to seize control of lithium deposits (??) in a certain area of North Carolina, called Chimney Rock.\n\n“Now the claims are getting even more bizarre. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, is now saying the federal government is literally controlling the weather. We’re controlling the weather,” Biden said. “It’s beyond ridiculous. It’s got to stop. Moments like this, there are no red or blue states.”\n\nPlenty of Republicans have even tried to do the course correcting themselves, to get out ahead of their party’s presidential candidate and his friend’s unhinged claims that read like something pulled out of a YouTube video comments section. Even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis went out of his way on Wednesday to encourage people to be more discerning about what they read on the internet, at least with regards to the government’s response to the storms. Per Politico:\n\n“We live in an era where if you put out crap online you can get a lot of people to share it and you can monetize that. That’s just the way it is,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Wednesday in response to a question from POLITICO about misinformation. “But if you are hearing something that’s just outrageous — just know in the state of Florida none of that stuff would ever fly.”\n\n“Be careful about the nonsense that gets circulated and just know that the more titillating it is, the more likely it is that somebody is making money off it and they don’t really give a damn about the well-being and safety of the people that are actually in the eye of the storm,” added DeSantis.\n\nAnd Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-NC), whose district was ravaged by Helene last week, went as far as to put out a statement addressed to his constituents encouraging them to not believe everything they read on Facebook or Twitter, as he specifically debunked myths that have been spread by Trump and Greene: “While it is true, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to Hurricane Helene has had its shortfalls, I’m here to dispel the outrageous rumors that have been circulated online:”\n\n“1.
