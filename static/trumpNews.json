We urge other International Federations to follow IBA’s example, as we are uniquely positioned to address this issue and advocate for our athletes’ rights.”\n\nThe announcement comes amid growing controversy in Nigerian boxing, where interim Nigeria Boxing Federation president Azania Omo-Agege has called for a National Assembly probe into the federation’s affiliation with World Boxing, citing concerns over transgender policies.\n\n“Let them come and explain to Nigerians how they will take the Nigeria Boxing Federation to a boxing association that supports transgender athletes which is against our constitution without properly consulting with board members and stakeholders,” Omo-Agege said. \n\nThe IBA revealed it would file complaints with attorneys general in Switzerland, France, and the USA regarding the IOC’s decision to allow “ineligible athletes” to compete in Paris.\n\nKremlev encouraged affected boxers to pursue legal action against IOC President Thomas Bach and his team, offering free legal support.\n\n“This is a clear violation of human rights, an outrage towards the female boxers, and simply a crime that should be punished accordingly. In my personal opinion, Thomas Bach should take full responsibility for this,” Kremlev added.\n\nThe IBA also announced stricter gender eligibility verification measures for the upcoming Women’s World Boxing Championships in Niš, emphasising their commitment to “providing a fair and equitable sporting environment.”\n\nMeanwhile, Omo-Agege has called for former NBF president Kenneth Minimah to explain the federation’s World Boxing affiliation before lawmakers, revealing that proper consultation with stakeholders was not conducted.","summary":"The International Boxing Association has announced plans to take legal action against the International Olympic Committee over transgender participation at Paris 2024, citing former US President Donald Trump’s recent executive order banning transgender athletes from women’s sports.

The pair discussed yesterday’s announcement, from the US President, that he intends to impose whopping 25 per cent tariffs on America’s steel and aluminium imports – a move that would hit the Australian economy.\n\nWhen Mr Trump imposed similar tariffs during his first presidency, Australia was one of several trading partners that secured an exemption. Mr Albanese hopes he can repeat that feat, though this time it might be harder.\n\nAfter this morning’s phone call, he said an exemption was “under consideration”. About an hour later, however, Mr Trump signed executive orders imposing the tariffs in the Oval Office, and stressed that they would operate “without exemptions”.\n\nThe President has also further clarified his intentions regarding the Gaza Strip, both in the short term and the long term.\n\nIn said short term, he threatened that “all hell will break out” if Hamas fails to keep releasing its Israeli hostages, as previously promised.\n\nIn the longer term, Mr Trump has said in unambiguous terms that Gaza’s current Palestinian residents – all twoish million of them – should have no right to return once the rebuilding of Gaza is done.\n\nI do mean unambiguous. Here is the exchange.\n\n“Would the Palestinians have the right to return?” Fox News host Bret Baier asked during an interview with Mr Trump.\n\n“No, they wouldn’t,” said the President.\n\nHis idea, here, is that the Palestinians be ejected into neighbouring Arab countries, probably Jordan and Egypt. Critics say this would constitute ethnic cleansing.\n\n“We’ll build beautiful communities for the 1.9 million people,” Mr Trump said in his new remarks, to Baier.\n\n“Could be five, six, could be two. But we’ll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is. In the meantime, I would own this.\n\n“Think of it as a real estate development.”\n\nWithin the United States itself, legal tensions continue, particularly regarding Mr Trump’s efforts to halt reams of federal spending. A judge has now accused the Trump administration of ignoring his order that it temporarily unfreeze certain funds.\n\nThis question, of whether Mr Trump will openly defy the courts, has been lurking in the background throughout his first three weeks in power.\n\nRead on for the latest updates.","summary":"While skating between questions about his new tariffs, Donald Trump found time to issue an ominous new threat.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/us-politics-live-donald-trumps-shock-answer-on-gaza-as-judge-accuses-him-of-ignoring-order/live-coverage/32c35592d9fa9f5c94747af5ae05e53c?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b3d6d8fd2f81335fa2917dbbc9b598e5","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 01:04:58","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.337},{"id":289142850,"title":"Meghan seen sipping a beer at second day of Invictus Games as she poses next to grinning Harry","text":"MEGHAN Markle looked in high spirits as she enjoyed a beer beside a beaming Prince Harry.\n\nThe happy couple put on another loved-up display as they watched the second day of the Invictus Games in Vancouver, Canada. \n\nThe Sussexes were also spotted joking around as they appeared on a “moose cam” on Sunday night.\n\nThe pair were shown larking about on the big screen at a wheelchair basketball game.\n\nMeghan, 43, clapped as Harry, 40, made moose horns with his hands on his head.\n\nThe couple were having fun as they waved to the crowd and Harry gave a military-style salute.\n\nEarlier Harry quipped as he received a pair of budgie smugglers from competitors: \"So inappropriate, I love it.\"\n\nMeghan filmed him as he was handed the speedos at his games for injured and sick veterans and service members.\n\nTeam Australia have made it a tradition to hand Harry a pair at each Invictus Games.\n\nIn a video posted to Meghan’s Instagram, a child could be heard calling out: \"Put them on your head.\"\n\nHarry chuckled as he replied: \"Put them on my head?\"\n\nThere was also a heartwarming moment at the games on Sunday when Team UK wheelchair basketball competitor James Cairns proposed to his girlfriend on the court.\n\nThe Army veteran from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, asked partner of four years Hannah Wild to marry him.\n\nJames, 35, celebrated with his teammates and the couple’s two-year-old son when she said “yes”.\n\nThe competition moved on from Vancouver to the ski resort of Whistler on Monday.\n\nHarry and Meghan were expected to meet with members of the Squamish Nation, one of Canada’s First Nation Indian Band.\n\nLater they were due to have lunch with patrons and watch the skeleton competition finals.\n\nThis follows the couple's recent PDA at the opening ceremony on Saturday evening. \n\nMeghan and Harry embraced for a kiss in the stands, and a lip reading expert revealed the Duke gave his wife a cheeky five word instruction. \n\nIt appeared the Sussexes couldn't keep their hands of each other and the Duchess often rested her head on the Duke's shoulder.\n\nShe was also spotted waving blue pom-poms as a show of support and grinned from ear-to-ear while taking photographs.\n\nThe couple even looked emotional at time as the seventh edition of the games began.\n\nHarry left his wife for short while to deliver an inspiring speech on stage at the BC Place 54,000 seater arena.\n\nIn his moving address, Harry told the crowd: \"Over the past decade I've lost count of the times we've heard you tell us that the Invictus Games saved you.\n\n\"Respectfully, I disagree.

You saved yourself.\"\n\nBefore the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made their appearance, Meghan had been sharing adorable behind the scenes footage of the pair on her Instagram stories.\n\nIn one clip the couple enjoyed a ride on a golf buggy and waved to athletes.\n\nThe Duke also performed a playful dance while participants waited lined up for pictures.\n\nA body language expert said their PDA was a \"two-finger salute\" to Donald Trump.\n\nThe US President ruled out deporting Prince Harry over his visa legal battle in a scathing attack.\n\nHe branded Meghan \"terrible\" and said the Duke \"had enough problems\" dealing with her\n\nThe couple also shared a passionate moment on stage after arriving in Canada for the Games. \n\nThe mum-of-two even gave an impromptu speech praising her family- focused hubby. \n\nBut one royal expert cast doubt over the former Suits actress' sincerity, comparing her address to an \"Oscar ceremony\".\n\nThe incredible event, which spans nine days, will see Invictus athletes compete at sitting volleyball, wheelchair basketball, and rugby, swimming, indoor rowing as well as some newly introduced sports.\n\nThese include Alpine and Nordic skiing, snowboarding, biathlon, skeleton and wheelchair curling. \n\nMeghan's attendance is understood to underscore her support for her husband and the mission of Invictus, a cause that is deeply personal to them both.\n\nHer focus at the games will be on uplifting her husband, the competitors and sharing their stories.\n\nThe couple famously appeared in public together for the first time at the Toronto Invictus Games in 2017, pictured hand-in-hand at a wheelchair tennis event.\n\nIn 2023, Meghan and Harry cheered on athletes among the crowds at the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf, Germany.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were sitting side-by-side clapping and also reacting to the game tensely as they watched the wheelchair basketball with Australia supporters.\n\nWhile Meghan is understood to have several projects on the horizon, her family remains her top priority and she is determined to continue to stand together with Harry to support the causes they care about.\n\nThe couple visited Colombia for a four-day tour last August, with the trip focusing on tackling cyber-bullying and online digital violence as well as promoting women's leadership.\n\nThey also embarked on a three-day visit to Nigeria earlier in 2024 at the invitation of the West African nation's chief of defence staff.\n\nBritish veterans and serving personnel who were injured during service departed for Canada earlier this week for the games.\n\nThe 62 competitors - all veterans and serving personnel who sustained life-changing injuries and illnesses while serving in the UK Armed Forces - left the country from Birmingham Airport on Thursday.\n\nThe games aim to \"inspire recovery, support rehabilitation and generate a wider understanding and respect for those who have served their country\", the Royal British Legion said.\n\nThe games have previously been held in London in 2014, in Orlando in 2016, Toronto in 2017, Sydney in 2018, The Hague in 2022 and Dusseldorf in 2023.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/royals/14316014/meghan-sipping-beer-at-invictus-games-grinning-harry/","image":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/meghan-duchess-sussex-attends-whistler-970937294.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 01:03:04","author":"Alex Diaz,Summer Raemason","authors":["Alex Diaz","Summer Raemason"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.127},{"id":289141174,"title":"Trump says no right of return for Palestinians in Gaza under his plan","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Palestinians in Gaza would not have a right to return under his plan for US “ownership” of the war-torn territory, contradicting other officials in his administration who have sought to argue Trump was only calling for the temporary relocation of its population.\n\nLess than a week after he floated his plan for the US to take control of Gaza and turn it in “the Riviera of the Middle East,” Trump, in an interview with FOX News’ Bret Baier that was set to air on Monday, said “No, they wouldn’t” when asked if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory. It comes as he has ramped up pressure on Arab states, especially US allies Jordan and Egypt, to take in Palestinians from Gaza, who claim the territory as part of a future homeland.\n\n“We’ll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is,” Trump said. “In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent.”\n\nArab nations have sharply criticised the Trump proposal, and Trump’s latest words were released a day before he is set to host Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday. In addition to concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.\n\nAfter Trump’s initial comments last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio respectfully insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza “temporarily” and for an “interim” period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordinance and reconstruction.\n\nTrump last week didn’t rule out deploying US troops to help secure the territory but at the same time insisted no US funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of Gaza, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/trump-says-no-right-of-return-for-palestinians-in-gaza-under-his-plan/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25040800330330.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 01:00:00","author":"Borneo Bulletin Ap Video","authors":["Borneo Bulletin Ap Video"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":289141108,"title":"Grocery stores help shoppers buy local but expert says U.S. boycott likely won’t last","text":"At Lakeview Market in Kelowna, B.C., many labels are being changed to help answer questions staff are fielding these days.\n\n“A lot of customers have been asking where we get our products,” said Barb Hill, the store’s co-owner. “We decided to put some Canadian stickers, Canadian flag stickers on our local products, Canadian-sourced products.”\n\nThe family owned store has prided itself on buying local for decades but it thought the stickers would help shoppers navigate their choices in trying to buy Canadian-made goods.\n\n“I hope it comes out positive,” Hill said. “I hope as Canadians we come closer, support more Canadian.”\n\nThe shift in shopping habits comes in response to the looming risk of U.S. tariffs that, if implemented in early March, could be as high as 25 per cent on many Canadian goods entering the United States.\n\nThe current patriotic support is being driven in large part by emotions, according to Dr. Sylvain Charlebois, director of Agri-Food Analytics Lab, which conducts research on food distribution at Dalhousie University.\n\n“I think a lot of people just feel insulted and feel quite angered by what has happened,” Charlebois said.\n\nHe pointed to what unfolded in Mexico a few years back as a comparison to what is now happening in Canada.\n\n“In Mexico, they went through what we’re going through right now because of the wall,” Charlebois said. “Donald Trump asked Mexicans to pay for the wall and that was their 51st state moment, if you will. Now we are going through our own 51st state moment.”\n\nGrocery stores across the country are jumping on board the patriotic purchasing push by helping customers identify Canadian-made products.

But these events don’t last because the economics of food are pretty powerful,” Charlebois said. “People end up looking for the best buys, the best deals, and often, really, some of these products are not Canadian.”\n\nWhether the shopping shift is long term or not, many agreed that it still serves an important purpose.\n\n“I think it is fantastic,” Hill said. “I think we should all be aware where our groceries come from.”","summary":"Canadians are shifting their shopping habits in response to the threat of tariffs on exports to the U.S. One expert, however, says the change likely won't last long.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11009771/grocery-stores-help-shoppers-buy-local-boycott-wont-last-expert/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/canada-sticker-photo.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:59:52","author":"Klaudia van Emmerik","authors":["Klaudia van Emmerik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":289141164,"title":"Labor unions sue to block DOGE access to sensitive information at U.S. agencies","text":"A coalition of labor unions filed a lawsuit Monday asking a federal court to stop Elon Musk’s team from accessing private data at the Education Department, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nThe suit, led by the American Federation of Teachers, alleges the Trump administration violated federal privacy laws when it gave Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency access to systems with personal information on tens of millions of Americans without their consent. It was filed in federal court in Maryland.\n\nIt’s the latest in a flurry of legal challenges to Musk’s growing influence over federal agencies he has promised to slash or dismantle. A federal judge in New York blocked Musk’s team from a Treasury Department system on Saturday after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued over privacy concerns.\n\nAlso Monday, DOGE cut about $900 million in Education Department contracts after concluding they were a waste of taxpayer money, a department spokesperson said. The cuts spanned 90 contracts at the Institute of Education Sciences, a research branch of the federal agency. The department did not immediately release additional details.\n\nThe cuts will not affect core operations at IES, including the NAEP exam, known as the nation’s report card, and the College Scorecard, which provides data about the cost and outcomes of U.S. universities, the department said.\n\nThe AFT suit warns of safety risks to personal data that has been shared with Musk’s team, including an Education Department system housing information on more than 40 million Americans with federal student loans. The database includes Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, home addresses and more.\n\n“The Department is effectively one of America’s biggest banks — if there was a breach of this magnitude in the private sector, it would rightly be a national scandal,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of handing over sensitive data for reasons beyond its intended use, allegedly violating the Privacy Act. Instead of carrying out the functions of the federal student loan program, the lawsuit says DOGE has been accessing loan data “for purposes of destroying” the Education Department.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has vowed to close the Education Department and turn over its authority to states and schools. Musk on his social media site X said Friday that the department “doesn’t exist,” responding to Democrats in Congress who attempted to visit the agency's headquarters but were turned away by security.\n\nThe suit asks a federal court to stop Musk’s team from accessing that data along with Treasury systems and an OPM database with sensitive information on all 2.3 million federal employees. It also seeks the destruction of any records that were already disclosed.\n\n“Steamrolling into sensitive government record systems has led to a massive data breach that threatens to upend how these critical systems are maintained and compromises the safety and security of personal identifying information for Americans all across the country,” according to the suit.\n\nOne of the nation's largest teachers unions, the AFT says it represents 1.8 million workers in education, health care and government. Also joining the suit are six people with sensitive information stored in federal systems, including military veterans who received federal student loans and other federal benefit payments.\n\nThe suit also is backed by the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.\n\nOn Friday, a separate lawsuit on behalf of the University of California Student Association asked a federal judge in Washington to halt Musk's access to Education Department systems. The plaintiffs in that case filed for an emergency restraining order on Monday seeking to block DOGE from sensitive data.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It is unclear when O'Toole will rule on the request by the unions.\n\nThe buyout effort is part of a far-reaching plan by Trump and his allies to reduce the size and rein in the actions of the federal bureaucracy.

Current spending laws expire on March 14 and there is no guarantee that salaries would be funded beyond that point.\n\nAt a court hearing, US Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton called the buyout plan a \"humane off-ramp\" for those frustrated by Trump's decision to reduce the size of the workforce and end the ability of many of them to work from home.\n\nBut a lawyer for the unions said the plan had been carried out in a \"slap dash\" fashion with little regard to how it might disrupt operations at agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\"They failed to consider the continued functioning of government,\" lawyer Elena Goldstein said.\n\nTrump has tasked Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with overseeing the purge of federal employees through his \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" which is not an actual government agency.\n\nMusk's actions have sown panic among federal workers and prompted public protests. His actions also have led to a flood of calls to US lawmakers by voters worried about the access that Musk's team has been given to sensitive information in government computer systems.\n\nOn Saturday, a judge temporarily blocked Musk's entity from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments at the Treasury Department.\n\nMusk aides have taken up senior positions at key government agencies while the billionaire has pushed for the dismantling of others, including USAID, the US humanitarian and development aid agency.\n\nAnother Trump lieutenant, White House budget director Russell Vought, has ordered the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, an independent federal agency created after the 2008 global financial crisis, to cease its activities.\n\nThe unions and Democratic attorneys general have brought lawsuits challenging Trump's rapid remaking of government and won some initial victories. A union has filed a lawsuit seeking to block Vought's actions, one of several legal challenges that Trump's administration now faces.\n\nOn Monday a judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's sharp cuts to federal grant funding for universities, medical centres and other research institutions.\n\nAn effort to hollow out the US Agency for International Development is partially on hold after a judge's ruling.\n\nTrump's effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans, grants and other financial assistance has also been paused in a separate case. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Monday ruled that the administration must restore all domestic funding while he considers the case.","summary":"US President Donald Trump's radical overhauls of government bodies and spending have met with blocks and resistance in several courts.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/trump-government-shake-ups-meet-court-blocks-c-17681084","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17681084/a926cf36417ad45f06ff63818be6ed6273dae731-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:50:49","author":"Nate Raymond and Tim Reid,Us District Judge","authors":["Nate Raymond and Tim Reid","Us District Judge"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":289139864,"title":"Trump issues Gaza ceasefire ultimatum to Hamas as he warns ‘all hell is going to break out’ if hostages not returned","text":"Donald Trump says the Gaza ceasefire should be cancelled if all remaining Israeli hostages are not returned by noon on Saturday – as he warned Hamas that “all hell is going to break out”.\n\nThe US president’s intervention came hours after Hamas has said it will delay the release of more hostages and accused Israel of violating their ceasefire deal.\n\nWhile signing a series of new executive orders, Mr Trump said he feared many Israeli hostages scheduled for release are already dead.\n\nReferring to his Saturday deadline for the release of hostages, Mr Trump said: “If they’re not here, all hell is going to break out.”\n\nHe acknowledged that a decision to end the ceasefire was up to Israel, adding: “I’m speaking for myself.

Saturday at 12 o’clock, and after that, I would say, all hell is going to break out.”\n\nPressed on what “all hell” might entail in Gaza, Trump said, “You’ll find out, and they’ll find out — Hamas will find out what I mean.”\n\nTrump expressed skepticism that many hostages remain alive to release, telling reporters, “I think a lot of the hostages are dead.”\n\nTrump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was involved in negotiating the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which was secured in the waning days of President Joe Biden’s administration. But since taking office, Trump has suggested he wasn’t sure the ceasefire would hold. His plan to permanently displace Palestinians from Gaza and for the United States to “own” the Strip has injected yet more uncertainty into the process.\n\nHe said explicitly in an interview this weekend that Palestinians would not have a right to return to Gaza under his plan to take US ownership of the strip and rebuild it.\n\n“No, they wouldn’t,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News when asked whether the Palestinians would have a right to return. “Because they will have much better housing. Much better – in other words, I’m talking about building a permanent place for them.”\n\nTrump’s assertion that Palestinians wouldn’t be entitled to return to Gaza is certain to deepen international opposition to the proposal, which drew outcry when he first announced it last week at a news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nAfterward, some Trump aides sought to soften or clarify aspects of the plan. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Trump was proposing only a temporary relocation of Palestinians while Gaza was being rebuilt.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was traveling in Latin America when Trump revealed his idea, suggested the resettlements from Gaza would be only on an interim basis.\n\n“What he very generously has offered is the ability of the United States to go in and help with debris removal, help with munitions removal, help with reconstruction — the rebuilding of homes and businesses and things of this nature, so that then people can move back in,” Rubio said last week.\n\nYet Trump himself, in comments afterward, did anything but retreat. He told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that he viewed the war-torn region as a “big real estate site.”\n\n“I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people — the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza — to go back yet another time, and we don’t want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it and we’ll slowly – very slowly, we’re in no rush – develop it. We’re going to bring stability to the Middle East soon,” Trump told reporters as he traveled to the Super Bowl.\n\nHe added during his interview on Fox — taped on Saturday but aired Monday morning — that it would take years before anyone could consider living in Gaza given the destruction of the war.\n\n“If they have to return now it, will be years before you could ever – it’s not habitable. It will be years before it could happen,” he said. “I’m talking about starting to build and I think I could make a deal with Jordan. I think I could make a deal with Egypt. We give them billions and billions of dollars a year.”\n\nTrump is set to meet Tuesday with King Abdullah of Jordan, who along with his counterparts in Egypt and other Arab nations has flatly rejected Trump’s plan.\n\nTrump told Fox his plan was to “own” Gaza.\n\n“We’ll build safe communities a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is and in the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land,” he said.\n\nWhen Trump unveiled his plan last week, it caught several top administration officials by surprise. While the president had been discussing an initiative to take control of Gaza and rebuild it for several days, he hadn’t signaled his intention to make the plans public.\n\nAfterward, some of his aides suggested the president was hoping to spur action by regional nations, which in his view hadn’t offered their own ideas on what to do with Gaza.\n\n“Come to the table with your plan if you don’t like his plan,” Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that the White House has received “all kinds of outreach” since Trump’s comments earlier this week.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

LIEB\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A renewed and expanded effort from chemical giant Bayer to shield itself from lawsuits that claim its popular weedkiller Roundup causes cancer brought dozens of protesters to the Iowa Capitol building Monday begging lawmakers to reject it.\n\nSimilar efforts failed during 2024 legislative sessions in Iowa, Missouri and Idaho. But this year, Bayer and a coalition of agricultural groups are doubling down. A broader media campaign is highlighting the importance of glyphosate-based Roundup for American agriculture. And they are getting help from a group that ran a Super Bowl ad in Missouri asserting the legislation is necessary to combat Chinese influence over the U.S. food supply.\n\nOpponents, including those who rallied Monday in Des Moines, say the bills would limit the rights of people to hold companies accountable if their products cause harm. Speakers took turns telling stories of family members throughout the state who have been diagnosed with cancers and shouted out to lawmakers that Iowa’s people are more important than corporate profits.\n\n“I feel like we need accountability here in Iowa,” said Nick Schutt, a part-time farmer whose mother, father, aunt and two siblings have all had cancer diagnoses. “At the end of the day, multinational chemical companies like Bayer should be held accountable.”\n\nBayer disputes the claims that Roundup causes cancer, but the company has been hit with about 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. It contends those legal costs are “not sustainable” and is looking for relief from lawmakers concerned about the possibility that Roundup could be pulled from the U.S. market.\n\nFor crops including corn, soybeans and cotton, Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller’s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more crops while conserving the soil by tilling it less.\n\n“It is the most important product in global agriculture,” Liza Lockwood, Bayer’s medical affairs lead in its crop science division, said during a recent Missouri Senate committee hearing.\n\nSome farmers have echoed that assertion. If lawsuits force Roundup off the U.S. market, they contend that Chinese-made products may be the only alternative.\n\n“Losing access to this one safe and effective tool will set off a domino effect that will threaten family farmers and our state’s economy,” Kevin Ross, a farmer from southwest Iowa, said to Iowa lawmakers. Ross detailed how, for 50 years, the American-made product has increased soil quality, decreased water runoff and helped struggling farmers turn a profit.\n\nAn expanded field for legislation\n\nLast year, Bayer focused its lobbying efforts on Missouri, Iowa and Idaho — home, respectively, to its North America crop science division, a Roundup manufacturing facility and the phosphate mines from which its key ingredient is derived. Though bills passed at least one chamber in Iowa and Missouri, they ultimately failed in all three states.\n\nThis year, legislation providing legal protection against failure-to-warn claims already has passed the North Dakota House without any opposition. Similar bills have cleared initial committees in Iowa, Mississippi and Missouri and are pending in legislative committees in Florida, Oklahoma and Tennessee. A bill failed to get out of a Wyoming committee by a deadline.\n\nBayer officials said Monday that legislative efforts also are in the works in Georgia, Idaho and the U.S. Congress. A promotional campaign from the Modern Ag Alliance, a coalition that Bayer supports, has targeted an even wider array of states.\n\nNew to the cause this year is the Protecting America Initiative, an organization concerned about China’s influence on the U.S. economy and tied to Richard Grenell, President Donald Trump’s envoy for special missions and former acting director of national intelligence. The group ran a television ad Sunday in central Missouri during the Super Bowl urging support for the legislation. It said it has invested six figures to run the 30-second spot more broadly across Missouri and Iowa.\n\nIt also parked a truck containing a portable billboard outside the Iowa Capitol on Monday, encouraging support of the bill to stop Chinese-made chemicals from “infiltrating American farms.”\n\nConcerns about cancer and pesticides\n\nAds supporting legislation that could limit Bayer’s legal liability have emphasized the importance of its weed-control products to agriculture.\n\n“Farming’s hard,” one Facebook advertisement says. “But it’s a little easier with glyphosate.”\n\nThat ad offended Kim Hagemann, a suburban Des Moines resident who showed up to a crowded subcommittee meeting to share her opposition with lawmakers.\n\n“Bayer is right, farming’s hard, but dealing with cancer is even harder,” said Hagemann, a member of one of the groups that organized Monday’s protest.\n\nThough some studies associate Roundup’s key ingredient glyphosate with cancer, the EPA has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Yet the numerous lawsuits against Bayer allege glyphosate does cause a cancer called non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nOne of the many attorneys involved in the lawsuits against Bayer is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services.

LIEB\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A renewed and expanded effort from chemical giant Bayer to shield itself from lawsuits that claim its popular weedkiller Roundup causes cancer brought dozens of protesters to the Iowa Capitol building Monday begging lawmakers to reject it.\n\nSimilar efforts failed during 2024 legislative sessions in Iowa, Missouri and Idaho. But this year, Bayer and a coalition of agricultural groups are doubling down. A broader media campaign is highlighting the importance of glyphosate-based Roundup for American agriculture. And they are getting help from a group that ran a Super Bowl ad in Missouri asserting the legislation is necessary to combat Chinese influence over the U.S. food supply.\n\nOpponents, including those who rallied Monday in Des Moines, say the bills would limit the rights of people to hold companies accountable if their products cause harm. Speakers took turns telling stories of family members throughout the state who have been diagnosed with cancers and shouted out to lawmakers that Iowa’s people are more important than corporate profits.\n\n“I feel like we need accountability here in Iowa,” said Nick Schutt, a part-time farmer whose mother, father, aunt and two siblings have all had cancer diagnoses. “At the end of the day, multinational chemical companies like Bayer should be held accountable.”\n\nBayer disputes the claims that Roundup causes cancer, but the company has been hit with about 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. It contends those legal costs are “not sustainable” and is looking for relief from lawmakers concerned about the possibility that Roundup could be pulled from the U.S. market.\n\nFor crops including corn, soybeans and cotton, Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller’s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more crops while conserving the soil by tilling it less.\n\n“It is the most important product in global agriculture,” Liza Lockwood, Bayer’s medical affairs lead in its crop science division, said during a recent Missouri Senate committee hearing.\n\nSome farmers have echoed that assertion. If lawsuits force Roundup off the U.S. market, they contend that Chinese-made products may be the only alternative.\n\n“Losing access to this one safe and effective tool will set off a domino effect that will threaten family farmers and our state’s economy,” Kevin Ross, a farmer from southwest Iowa, said to Iowa lawmakers. Ross detailed how, for 50 years, the American-made product has increased soil quality, decreased water runoff and helped struggling farmers turn a profit.\n\nAn expanded field for legislation\n\nLast year, Bayer focused its lobbying efforts on Missouri, Iowa and Idaho — home, respectively, to its North America crop science division, a Roundup manufacturing facility and the phosphate mines from which its key ingredient is derived. Though bills passed at least one chamber in Iowa and Missouri, they ultimately failed in all three states.\n\nThis year, legislation providing legal protection against failure-to-warn claims already has passed the North Dakota House without any opposition. Similar bills have cleared initial committees in Iowa, Mississippi and Missouri and are pending in legislative committees in Florida, Oklahoma and Tennessee. A bill failed to get out of a Wyoming committee by a deadline.\n\nBayer officials said Monday that legislative efforts also are in the works in Georgia, Idaho and the U.S. Congress. A promotional campaign from the Modern Ag Alliance, a coalition that Bayer supports, has targeted an even wider array of states.\n\nNew to the cause this year is the Protecting America Initiative, an organization concerned about China’s influence on the U.S. economy and tied to Richard Grenell, President Donald Trump’s envoy for special missions and former acting director of national intelligence. The group ran a television ad Sunday in central Missouri during the Super Bowl urging support for the legislation. It said it has invested six figures to run the 30-second spot more broadly across Missouri and Iowa.\n\nIt also parked a truck containing a portable billboard outside the Iowa Capitol on Monday, encouraging support of the bill to stop Chinese-made chemicals from “infiltrating American farms.”\n\nConcerns about cancer and pesticides\n\nAds supporting legislation that could limit Bayer’s legal liability have emphasized the importance of its weed-control products to agriculture.\n\n“Farming’s hard,” one Facebook advertisement says. “But it’s a little easier with glyphosate.”\n\nThat ad offended Kim Hagemann, a suburban Des Moines resident who showed up to a crowded subcommittee meeting to share her opposition with lawmakers.\n\n“Bayer is right, farming’s hard, but dealing with cancer is even harder,” said Hagemann, a member of one of the groups that organized Monday’s protest.\n\nThough some studies associate Roundup’s key ingredient glyphosate with cancer, the EPA has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Yet the numerous lawsuits against Bayer allege glyphosate does cause a cancer called non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nOne of the many attorneys involved in the lawsuits against Bayer is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services. Though the health agency oversees the Food and Drug Administration, it does not control the EPA and its labeling requirements.\n\nThe legislation supported by Bayer would provide a defense against failure-to-warn claims not only for Roundup but for other pesticide products that follow EPA labeling guidelines.\n\nRichard Deming, a cancer physician in Des Moines, said it often takes decades to determine a cause-and-effect connection between cancer and long-term exposure to low levels of chemicals. He said public policy should focus on mitigating that risk, not providing “immunity from responsibility.”\n\n“I don’t think that ag chemicals causes as much cancer as cigarette smoking,” Deming told the AP after speaking to lawmakers.

Meghan joined Harry on stage at the end of his speech before he joked: \"Now she's going to sing!\"\n\nWelcoming Harry on stage, Canadian singer Michael said: \"I know how difficult something like this is, so I wanted to make sure I did this right. Without the incredible effort of this young man, none of this would have happened, so please welcvome my friend, Prince Harry.\"\n\nAnd, as the mercury plunged to -9C, the Duke of Sussex addressed the excited crowd in the town north of Vancouver, known for its skiing and snowboarding pistes. \n\nThe Games began this week with a star-studded opening ceremony on Saturday, held in the city's 40,000-capacity BC Place Stadium. At the event, Harry gave an impassioned speech where he called for competitors to overcome a \"moment of difficulty and division in many parts of the world\". His words were viewed by many as a veiled dig at Donald Trump as the president made scathing remarks about Harry's wife just hours before Invictus kicked off.\n\nAddressing the 40,000-strong audience, the Duke said: \"At this moment, when there is no shortage of crises, no absence of uncertainty, no lack of weak moral character in the world, the values you embody, the way you carry yourselves – not only at the Invictus Games, but each and every day – your courage, your resilience, your humanity, illuminate a path forward for us all.\"\n\nOn the same day, Trump dismissed the suggestion of deporting the Harry from the States following his revelations about his history with drugs in his autobiography, savagely claiming that Harry already has \"enough problems with his wife\".\n\nThe president's blistering comments didn't seem to phase the couple however, as they looked seriously loved up while watching the likes of Nelly Furtardo, Katy Perry Coldplay's Chris Martin perform on stage. Meghan, dressed in a £2,400 ivory double breasted Sentaler trench coat, was seen tenderly stroking her husband's neck while they sat and watched the event in the stands. Another moment saw the couple pack on the PDA as they shared a passionate smooch.\n\nReacting to the tactile signs of affection from the Duchess, body language expert Judi James told The Mirror: \"Clutching his arm and leaning here head against his shoulder in a romantic, date-night pose or reaching her hand out to caress his neck in a gesture of more maternal-looking pride as he is mentioned from the stage.\" And she continued: \"She's directing attention onto Harry and showing support and an almost fan-like sense of appreciation.\"\n\nJust hours before the glittering opening ceremony, Meghan made an impromptu speech at a private Invictus Games event where she gushed about her husband and made a sweet nod to their children, Archie and Lilibet. Speaking to a crowd of veterans and their families, said: \"I was not planning on speaking tonight, and we just arrived, I don't know, a couple of hours ago, and I touched Canadian soil and I went, oh, it feels like home.\"\n\nThen turning to Harry, she said: \"We are just thrilled to be here, and I would be remiss if I didn't take the opportunity to introduce someone who means a lot to me. And I know he means quite a lot to all of you. You will see him throughout this week. You will see him at the Games. You will see him probably curling with you, cheering you on.\"\n\nThe Duchess then gave rare insight into parenthood with her husband, as she said: \"What you won't have seen is all of the moments that have happened in the lead-up to these Games, all of the moments where, as you know, with families, the big rush in the morning - getting ready for school, packing the lunch boxes, making breakfast. My husband's in all of that with us, and then he'll be on his phone, and Archie will say: 'Papa, why are you on your phone?' And he's like: 'That's Invictus. I'm getting ready for Invictus.''\n\nHarry has shown his cheeky and sometimes goofy side at the sports tournament, often leaving his wife in fits of laughter with his stunts. One such moment saw him 'dad dancing' with Canada's Invictus Games team, and another saw him do an impression of a Canadian moose at a basketball event. The Duke even posed modelling a pair of 'budgie smuggler' swimming trunks, presented to him by the Australia team. Meghan has been sharing behind-the-scenes moments on her newly re-launched Instagram page.\n\nThe Games will run for nine days, featuring more than 500 competitors from 23 nations. Athletes will compete in core sports including indoor rowing, sitting volleyball, swimming, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball. The Games will also include winter sports for the first time.\n\nThe prince founded the Invictus Games in London in 2014, with this year marking the seventh edition of the competition for wounded military veterans. During his emotional speech at the ceremony, Harry told the crowd of 40,000: \"We gather here in Vancouver in a spirit of unity. Beyond any differences, here at the Invictus Games we are grounded in mutual respect, competing fiercely, but believing in one another.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Over the past decade I've lost count of the times we've heard you tell us that the Invictus Games saved you. Respectfully, I disagree. Invictus didn't save you. You saved yourself.\"","summary":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are together on the third day of the Invictus Games in Vancouver, Canada - yhe couple's loved-up display comes after a difficult few months for the Sussexes","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/breaking-prince-harrys-playful-joke-34652581","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34653445.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS359267135JPG.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:41:11","author":"Ellie Fry,Patrick Hill","authors":["Ellie Fry","Patrick Hill"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.177},{"id":289141894,"title":"Donald Trump Mocks Taylor Swift After She Receives Booing at the Super Bowl","text":"President Donald Trump reignited his feud with Taylor Swift following the Super Bowl by poking fun at her after the crowd booed her.\n\nSwift looked confused as loud boos rocked the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana when her face was shown on the giant screen.\n\nAlthough the singer handled the boos gracefully, Trump didn’t hesitate to remind her of it on social media.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAt the Super Bowl, Swift endured a shocking moment after she was greeted with boos from fans when her face appeared on the jumbotron.\n\nSwift’s initial reaction to the boos was confusion.

VERY LOUD!!!!”\n\nAnother fan echoed similar sentiments, writing, “They booed him too.

They wrote, “He wants everything to be about him.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTrump’s latest attempt to ridicule Swift adds to their heated history. The US President has never shied away from expressing his dislike of the 35-year-old singer.\n\nIn September 2024, he wrote via Truth Social, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” The post earned him severe backlash from Swifties, who defended their queen in their multitudes.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential elections drew closer, Swift endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, unsurprisingly earning her more hate from Trump.\n\nThe then-Republican presidential candidate called into “Fox & Friends” and said he preferred Kelce’s teammate Patrick Mahomes’ wife, Brittany Mahomes, to Swift.\n\nTrump said, “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better if you want to know the truth.” He also claimed that Brittany was a “big Trump fan.”\n\nDespite Trump’s best efforts to rile Swift up, she has hardly ever responded to him, reminding everyone of just how graceful she is.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSwift won’t be paying any mind to whatever Trump says. Instead, she will do her best to console and motivate her boyfriend, Kelce.\n\nThe Chiefs suffered a heavy defeat at the Eagles’ hands after a rather woeful display that saw them losing 34-0 at one point.\n\nFootage from Entertainment Tonight showed Kelce walking through the stadium’s hallways in his retro 1970s-inspired pregame outfit and heading to Swift’s suite.\n\nQuestions about the tight end’s NFL future still abound and will grow in volume after the Chiefs loss.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump reignited his feud with Taylor Swift following the Super&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump Mocks Taylor Swift After She Receives Booing at the Super Bowl first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/entertainment/donald-trump-mocks-taylor-swift-after-she-receives-booing-at-the-super-bowl/","image":"https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/0x0/2024/05/30184929/President-Donald-Trump.jpg?","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:38:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":289142790,"title":"What the papers say – February 11","text":"Concerns over Donald Trump’s impending steel tariffs and looming global trade wars lead several of Tuesday’s front pages.\n\nThe i paper reports the British Government is in the dark about the US president’s impending steel tariffs amid fears the added cost could crush the troubled sector.\n\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times leads on US traders paying higher prices for copper, steel and aluminium than their European counterparts as they rush to buy the metals ahead of the latest round of Mr Trump’s import taxes.\n\nAnd The Times says Britain is not expected to join the European Union in announcing retaliatory action over steel import taxes.\n\nBack on British soil, The Guardian leads on MPs’ plans to scrap requirements for high court judges to rule on assisted dying cases, announcing plans for expert panels to scrutinise decisions instead.\n\nIn royal news, the Daily Mail leads on a “worldwide exclusive” alleging the Duke of York is assisting a multi-billion-pound Middle East Venture with a former ambassador to Russia.

The ruling from US District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week. Laplante, who was nominated by Republican President George W. Bush, said he wasn't persuaded by the Trump administration's defense of the executive order. He said he would issue a longer preliminary injunction later explaining his reasoning. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Trump's order violates the Constitution and \"attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional values.\" It was brought on behalf of immigrant rights groups with members who are pregnant and whose children could be affected by the order. Trump's Republican administration asserts that children of noncitizens are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States and therefore are not entitled to citizenship. The administration is appealing the Seattle-based judge's block on Trump's executive order. At least nine lawsuits have been filed to challenge the birthright citizenship order. In the case filed by four states in Seattle, US District Judge John C Coughenour said last week Trump administration was attempting to ignore the Constitution. \"The rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or something ignored, whether that be for political or personal gain,\" said Coughenour, who was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. \"In this courtroom and under my watch the rule of law is a bright beacon, which I intend to follow.\" A federal judge in Maryland also blocked Trump's order in another case brought by immigrants' rights groups and pregnant women whose soon-to-be-born children could be affected. The Trump administration has not yet filed an appeal of the preliminary injunction issued by US District Judge Deborah Boardman, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden. A federal judge in Boston also heard arguments last week in a suit filed by a group of 18 states. US District Judge Leo Sorokin, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, did not immediately rule. Laplante, the judge in New Hampshire, praised both sides for the way they made their cases. \"I'm not persuaded by the defendants' arguments on this motion,\" he said. \"I have to say: I'm not offended by them, either, as a lawyer or a jurist. I think the rule of law is best served, best maintained and preserved when excellent practitioners present their arguments to the court with all the experience, expertise and knowledge they can muster.\" At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed. In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the US Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive US citizenship upon being born on US soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the US during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes. The US is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship - the principle of jus soli, or \"right of the soil\" - is applied. Most are in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/third-judge-blocks-trumps-order-ending-birthright-citizenship-for-kids-of-people-in-us-illegally/articleshow/118130538.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-118130540/118130540.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:24:51","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.028},{"id":289138598,"title":"Texas urges Trump administration to locate remains of WWII, Korean War veteran","text":"Feb. 10 (UPI) -- Exactly 73 years after World War II and Korean War Veteran Lt.

But the discrimination and hostile work environment I experienced happens at every level, in every industry.\"\n\n In an email to PEOPLE on Feb . 10, a spokesperson for Meta declined to comment due to the ongoing litigation.\n\n According to the complaint, Stonelake — who began working at Meta (then Facebook) in 2009 — alleged that she began witnessing and experiencing \"rampant and unmanaged discrimination\" and harassment almost immediately.\n\n Then in 2011, she claimed her manager sexually assaulted her during a business trip and allegedly told her on a separate occasion that she would not get promoted \"unless she had sex with him,\" according to the complaint. She went on to claim that she eventually reported his alleged harassment, but that \"no action was taken.\"\n\n Speaking with British newspaper The Times, Stonelake said that at the start of her career, she was willing to chalk these incidents up to the \"mistakes and errors of those individuals.\"\n\n But, according to the complaint, as Stonelake rose through the ranks at the company, she faced “persistent discrimination\" and accused the company of repeatedly dismissing her concerns.\n\n For instance, in 2020, the complaint stated that Stonelake \"questioned her boss's 'Blue Lives Matter' profile picture following George Floyd's murder due to the negative impact she feared it would have on their large and diverse team.\" In response, she claimed her boss \"met her with immediate hostility and retaliation and blocked her from an earned promotion.\"\n\n Then in 2022, while she was heading Meta’s Horizon virtual reality platform expansion, Stonelake allegedly identified product stability and safety issues that put children “at risk of immediate exposure to hate speech, sexual harassment, and bullying,” according to the suit. But when she backed a female colleague's request to put a pause on the rollout, she was allegedly ordered by Meta’s Horizon Leadership Team to “silence\" her colleague.\n\n Stonelake further alleged that when she refused, she was excluded from weekly leadership meetings.\n\n Additionally, in January 2023, the complaint stated that Stonelake was told she would be denied a promotion because documenting her achievements “would expose failures by male leaders whose support she needed.”\n\n The growing pressures of meeting Meta’s goals coupled with feelings of marginalization prompted Stionelake to seek emergency medical leave the following month “due to feelings of depression and the sudden, strong desire to end her life.”\n\n Stonelake was later notified in September 2023 that she would be laid off and her last day at the company took place the following February.\n\n \"Kelly Stonelake’s experience is not an anomaly—it is an example of how Meta treats women who stand up for integrity and compliance,” attorney Cindy Heidelberg, of the firm Breskin Johnson & Townsend PLLC, who is representing Stonelake, added in a statement to PEOPLE. “Meta’s pattern of retaliation against women who expose problems is not just unethical—it’s illegal. This case seeks to bring accountability and protect other women from facing the same retaliation.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n The lawsuit was filed in the wake of comments Zuckerberg made during a podcast interview with Joe Rogan in January. As reported by Fortune, Zuckerberg said that companies are lacking “masculine energy” and instead have embraced “feminine energy” too much. \n\n “It’s one thing to say we want to be welcoming and make a good environment for everyone, and it’s another to basically say masculinity is bad,” Zuckerberg said at the time. “We swung culturally to that part of the spectrum—masculinity is toxic, we have to get rid of it.”\n\n On Zuckerberg's recent comments, Stonelake, told the outlet: \"If you have a rampant problem of women not feeling safe doing their jobs at all and your solution is to call for more masculinity, it’s irresponsible, it’s reckless, and it will hurt people.”\n\n Meta has also scaled back its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) amid a \"shifting legal and policy landscape,” BBC News reported. Additionally, the social media conglomerate revised its community standards to specifically allow its users to characterize gay and transgender identities as \"mental illness.\"\n\n In the weeks before President Donald Trump took office, the company also announced it would away from its third-party fact-checking program, which Zuckerberg — who was present at Trump's inauguration — called a move to \"get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms.\"\n\n If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text \"STRENGTH\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to 988lifeline.org.","summary":"\"The discrimination and hostile work environment I experienced happens at every level, in every industry,” Kelly Stonelake said in a statement","url":"https://people.com/ex-meta-employee-alleges-toxic-pattern-silencing-woman-lawsuit-8789039","image":"https://people.com/thmb/81Y_G_3NC4N99VqaFAqtRsUzBOk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(748x424:750x426)/kelly-stonelake-suing-meta-021025-1be7e2653b1a49e3b658b65694749242.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:23:22","author":"David Chiu","authors":["David Chiu"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":289136296,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: Feb. 11, 2025","text":"The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News.\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Monday unleashed new 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, a move that could heighten tensions with U.S. trading partners and set off a renewed bout of inflation at home.\n\nIt is Trump's first order to introduce sector-based tariffs since he returned to the White House on Jan. 20 for a nonconsecutive second term.\n\nWASHINGTON - Nippon Steel Corp. will not have a majority stake in United States Steel Corp., President Donald Trump said Sunday, reiterating his commitment to stop the Japanese company from taking control of its iconic but struggling American counterpart.\n\nTrump also told reporters aboard Air Force One that he will impose new 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States and hold a press conference on reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nChina protests Japan's \"negative\" moves during Ishiba-Trump talks\n\nBEIJING - China said Monday that it has lodged a protest with Japan over Tokyo's \"negative\" moves related to Beijing during talks last week between Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington.\n\nLiu Jinsong, head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Department, conveyed to Akira Yokochi, chief minister at the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, China's \"grave concern and strong dissatisfaction,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nChina levies up to 15% tariffs on U.S. goods to counter Trump duties\n\nBEIJING - China on Monday imposed additional tariffs of up to 15 percent on some American imports, as part of measures to counter a new 10 percent U.S. tariff on Chinese goods that was levied earlier this month, according to state-run media.\n\nBeijing's imposition of new tariffs rekindled a trade war that took place between the world's two largest economies during the first term of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nTOKYO - Japan posted a current account surplus of 29.26 trillion yen ($193 billion) in 2024, a record high, driven by its highest-ever returns on foreign investments amid a weak yen and a decline in the trade deficit, government data showed Monday.\n\nThe surplus in the current account balance, one of the widest gauges of international trade, grew 29.5 percent from a year earlier, rising for the second consecutive year and marking the highest since comparable data became available in 1985, the Finance Ministry said.\n\nWAKAYAMA, Japan - Prosecutors on Monday demanded a 15-year prison term for a man accused of attempted murder after a pipe bomb attack two years ago that targeted an election event attended by then Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nRyuji Kimura, 25, is accused of hurling an explosive device at Kishida, who was walking near a crowd gathered for a stump speech in the western Japan city of Wakayama in April 2023.

He is constantly trying to mix up the game plan and we don’t know how to respond.”\n\nThat’s the response from Deborah Yedlin, CEO of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, to President Donald Trump’s latest tariff announcement.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Trump signed an executive order, implementing a 25 per cent tariff on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum, of which Canada is a major supplier.\n\nIn 2024, Alberta’s Ministry of Jobs, Economy and Trade estimates the province exported $815 million worth of steel products and $239 million worth of aluminum products to the U.S..\n\nNationally, in 2023, Canada exported $20 billion worth of iron and steel and $15 billion worth of aluminum to the U.S.\n\nWhile American manufacturers will be forced to pay the tariffs on the raw materials, Alberta’s business community warned it is consumers on both sides of the border who will ultimately pay more.\n\n“How it affect us here is purchasing all of our products out of the United States,” said Dania Filippetto, President of Rangeland RV in Calgary during an interview with Global News. “This recent tariff being announced is really going to affect the cost of RVs.”\n\nFilippetto estimates that 95 per cent of RVs sold in Canada are manufactured in the U.S..\n\n“We’ll take a significant price increase from the tariffs of steel and aluminum,” added Filippetto. “That combined on top of the exchange rate for our dollar that is not very favourable — the cost of RVs are going to increase for sure.”\n\nThey were eventually removed after the trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico (CUSMA) was signed, but by then much of the damage had been done.\n\n“We know that this has happened before and the tariffs will obviously increase the cost of what we sell into the United States,” said Yedlin.\n\n“So those small- and medium-sized manufacturers are going to have to look for other markets. It’s their cost of inputs are going to go up. And it’s not going to be very helpful.”\n\nWhile the long-term impact of the tariffs will mean higher prices, Filippetto is hopeful there will be a positive impact in the short term.\n\n“I think what was positive is a lot of consumers that maybe were waiting to buy an RV up until the snow melts or spring comes, they’re a little bit quicker to want to purchase something right now that’s on the ground because it is going to be more affordable no matter what,” said Filippetto.","summary":"President Donald Trumps announcement of new tariffs on American imports of Canadian steel and aluminum is expected to mean higher prices for consumers in both countries.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11012785/alberta-business-community-says-everyone-will-feel-the-pain-from-trumps-tariffs/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tariffs-rv_1.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:21:38","author":"Adam Macvicar,Ken MacGillivray","authors":["Adam Macvicar","Ken MacGillivray"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":289139870,"title":"Chancellor hopeful Merz open to reform of Germany’s debt brake","text":"Friedrich Merz, the leading contender in Germany’s upcoming federal election, has said he is open to reforming the country’s debt rules.\n\nIn a televised debate on Sunday, organised by ARD and ZDF, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) said such a measure may be necessary to finance greater defence spending.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, leading the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), argued that it was “ridiculous” to suggest a bigger defence budget could be financed through spending cuts and economic growth alone.\n\nReferring to a loosening of Germany’s debt brake, Merz responded: “You can discuss everything, but that certainly won’t come at the beginning.\n\n“At the beginning comes the potential for savings, comes growth and real restructuring of the budget, which is urgently needed,” he pointed out.\n\nGermany’s debt brake limits how much money the German government can borrow, restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe rule seeks to limit the risks of overspending such as high debt servicing costs, reduced investor confidence and the prospect of high taxes in the long term.\n\nMerz’s comments deviate from his party’s official position, as the CDU seeks to maintain Germany’s spending limit.\n\nThis is despite the fact that numerous figures in the CDU have been pushing for a reform of the debt brake, claiming that it is contributing to Germany’s economic decline.\n\nThe brake has notably been hindering infrastructure investments, required to improve global competitiveness and support businesses.\n\nGermany’s economy shrank by 0.2% last year, after contracting by 0.3% in 2023.\n\nIn his bid to become Chancellor, Merz is proposing to cut red tape and taxes to boost growth, as well as reduce welfare benefits.\n\nDefence spending\n\nMerz noted on Sunday that defence spending in Germany would “probably go towards 3%” of GDP.\n\nPart of this push is linked to pressure from across the Atlantic.\n\nTo avoid an over-reliance on US funding, President Donald Trump is demanding that EU countries step up their military capabilities and raise defence spending to 5%.\n\n“Europe needs, basically, a surge in defence.

A mayoral spokesperson and a representative of his campaign all did not return inquiries.\n\nAfter Adams was indicted in September, he shifted his tone on Trump, rankling some in his own party for his public praise of the Republican and his hardline immigration agenda.\n\nThe Democrat chastised people who called Trump a fascist. While he still said he was voting for Kamala Harris, Adams stopped saying the then-vice president’s name at public events, except when goaded by reporters.\n\nAdams flew to Florida to meet with Trump on Jan. 17. Afterward, he said the two men hadn’t discussed his criminal case or the possibility of a pardon, but implied that Trump’s agenda would be better for New York than former President Joe Biden’s.\n\n“I’m looking forward to the next four years of having a president that loves the city like I love this city,” Adams said the day after the meeting. He has denied doing anything illegal, and said the criticism of his overseas trips and deeply discounted first-class travel was unfair.\n\nTrump, who was convicted last year of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment, has previously expressed solidarity with Adams.\n\n“I know what it’s like to be persecuted by the DOJ, for speaking out against open borders,” Trump said in October at a Manhattan event attended by Adams. “We were persecuted, Eric. I was persecuted, and so are you, Eric.”\n\nThe criminal case against Adams involves allegations that he accepted illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks worth more than $100,000 — including expensive flight upgrades, luxury hotel stays and even a trip to a bathhouse — while serving in his previous job as Brooklyn Borough President.\n\nThe indictment said a Turkish official who helped facilitate the trips then leaned on Adams for favors, at one point asking him to lobby the Fire Department to allow a newly constructed, 36-story diplomatic building to open in time for a planned visit by Turkey’s president.\n\nProsecutors also said they had evidence of Adams personally directing campaign staffers to solicit foreign donations, then disguising those contributions in order to qualify for a city program that provides a generous, publicly-funded match for small dollar donations. Foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. election campaigns under federal law. \n\nWilliams stepped down after Trump’s election victory. But as recently as Jan. 6th, prosecutors had indicated their investigation remained active, writing in court papers that they continued to “uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.” \n\nFederal agents had also been investigating other senior Adams aides. Prior to the mayor’s indictment, federal authorities seized phones from a police commissioner, schools chancellor, multiple deputy mayors and the mayor’s director of Asian Affairs. Each of those officials denied wrongdoing but have since resigned.\n\nIn December, Adams’ chief adviser and closest confidant, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, was indicted by a state prosecutor — the Manhattan district attorney — on charges that she and her son accepted $100,000 in bribes related to real estate construction projects.","summary":"A top official at the U.S. Department of Justice has ordered federal prosecutors to drop charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams and halt the ongoing investigation","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/eric-adams-donald-trump-justice-department-new-york-joe-biden-b2695788.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/11/00/NYC_Mayor_Investigations_75984.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:18:20","author":"Alanna Durkin Richer and Eric Tucker,Jake Offenhartz","authors":["Alanna Durkin Richer and Eric Tucker","Jake Offenhartz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":289135490,"title":"Gaza ceasefire: Hamas suspends hostage release, blames Israel","text":"Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire agreement and says American guarantees are undermined by Donald Trump’s plan to displace every Palestinian.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues announcing the establishment of a “Rapid Response Task Force and Litigation Working Group.”\n\n“We are engaged in a multifaceted struggle to protect and defend everyday Americans from the harm being inflicted by this administration,” he wrote in the letter. “As outlined last week, it’s an all hands on deck effort simultaneously underway in Congress, the Courts and the Community.” \n\nAs The Independent reported last week, this comes after plenty of Democratic voters and activists have expressed frustration at the apparently lackadaisical approach Democrats have taken. Mostly, Democratic activists want to know: what are Democrats going to do about what’s happening? Especially after they had spent the last year and a half calling Trump either a fascist at worst or a threat to democracy at best. \n\nBut as much as Democrats might want to resist Trump, they have precious few tools available to push back against them. \n\nFor one, they control neither the House nor the Senate. Although Republicans have only three more seats than Democrats in the House, in the majoritarian body, that’s enough to steamroll Democrats. Republicans’ biggest worry there is getting everyone on the same page.\n\nAs far as the Senate, Democrats are no longer able to filibuster cabinet nominees like Vought ever since former Senate majority leader Harry Reid invoked the “nuclear option” for cabinet and judicial nominees after Republicans repeatedly filibustered Barack Obama’s nominees. \n\nThen-majority leader Mitch McConnell extended that to Supreme Court nominees when Democrats filibustered Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court after he blocked Merrick Garland from even having a hearing.\n\nThat leaves Democrats with fewer options than they have had in the past to battle Trump. \n\nAlso, there are fewer Republicans willing to oppose Trump’s nominees, something Democrats saw when only McConnell as well as Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against confirming Pete Hegseth to be secretary of Defense.\n\nNow Democrats will mostly have to rely on the courts. Just today, a federal judge blocked Trump from sending Venezuelan migrants to Guantanamo Bay. Another judge said on Monday that Trump had not fully followed his order to unfreeze federal spending. \n\nBut Democrats have two other weapons they still might be able to wield against Republicans to stop Trump: the debt limit and the federal budget showdown. \n\nHistorically, Republicans have used the debt limit to extract spending cuts from Democratic presidents when they control the House or Senate. In the same vein, when the federal government runs out of money next month, Democrats could filibuster the federal budget if they choose to.\n\nThis go-around, Democrats might be able to use the fact that plenty of Republicans will always oppose raising the debt limit and oppose any kind of spending agreement to their advantage to get Mike Johnson to agree to at least some concessions lest a government shutdown happens under Trump’s watch. \n\nIt might not be the kind of grand gestures that Democratic voters want. But these are likely the best tools that Democrats have if they’re prepared to put up a fight against Trump.","summary":"Democrats don’t have many tools to stop Trump’s agenda.

The Democratic mayor who was accused of accepting bribes and campaign contributions from foreign nationals.\n\nIt was a win for Adams, a Democrat who fervently maintained his innocence and insinuated the charges were politically motivated as a form of retaliation for criticizing former president Joe Biden’s immigration policies. \n\nDespite being on the opposite political spectrum as Trump, Adams sought to strengthen his relationship with the president who also faced federal criminal indictments that he asserted were politically motivated. \n\nThe mayor broke from his party’s typical criticisms about Trump and praised the president’s anti-immigration agenda, believing it would benefit New York City which has seen a surge in the number of migrants. Adams previously said the city did not have the resources to support the influx and criticized the Biden administration for not providing him with federal support. \n\nTrump later said he would consider pardoning Adams. \n\nAdams was indicted by federal prosecutors in New York in September after a years-long investigation into alleged corruption within the mayor’s circle. \n\nThey alleged he unlawfully accepted more than $100,000 in benefits, many in the form of travel luxuries, from the Turkish government in exchange for helping expedite the Turksih consulate building in Manhattan. \n\nProsecutors also accused the mayor of accepting campaign donations through an illegal “straw donor” scheme and the used a public matching fund program to increase the amount. \n\nAdams, who is running for re-election, was supposed to go to trial in April. \n\nThe move from the Justice Department is a clear indication that the president is prepared to interfer with judicial matters that he deems unfair. \n\nAdams’ case was made all the more prevalent for Trump due to his status as the mayor of New York City which is considered a “sanctuary city” for immigrants.\n\nTrump and his administration have begun targeted large cities such as New York to begin Trump’s promised mass deportation plan to forcibly remove millions of undocumented immigrants. The administration had asked leadership in sactuary cities to cooperate with federal immigration law enforcement officers. \n\nIn January, Adams said the city would “not hesitate to partner with federal authorities to bring violent criminals to justice” when asked about immigration enforcement conducting sweeps in New York and directing the New York Police Department to work with those officials.\n\nThis appeared to solidify that Adams and Trump had become immigration allies. \n\nEarlier this month, Adams attended Trump’s inauguration at the last minute, canceling his appearance for various Martin Luther King Jr. Day events in New York. He later appeared on far-right conservative pundit Tucker Carlson’s show.\n\nThen on Friday, Adams’ defense lawyer, Alex Spiro, was seen meeting with Justice Department officials in Washington D.C.","summary":"Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove reportedly directed that the SDNY should drop the federal case against Adams and dismiss it without prejudice on Monday","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/eric-adams-corruption-charges-dropped-doj-b2690165.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/08/16/NYC_Mayor_Investigations_05449.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/801vwN0T-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:13:58","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":289139532,"title":"Donald Trump Is Asked If He Views J.D.

During their conversation, Baier, 54, asked President Trump, 78, whether he sees Vance as his successor.\n\n Baier specifically asked if Trump could envision Vance, 40, as the 2028 Republican nominee. \n\n “No,” Trump replied. \n\n He continued, “But he's very capable. I mean, I don't think that it, you know, I think you have a lot of very capable people. So far, I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's too early.

At a January rally in Las Vegas, he said, \"“It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve not once but twice – or three or four times.”\n\n Since Trump was inaugurated on Monday, Jan. 20, he has signed 53 executive orders, per the Federal Register. The orders concern various issues from immigration, medical research, eliminating federal diversity programs and climate change to orders defining gender.\n\n He also pardoned the roughly 1,500 people convicted over their roles in the 2021 Jan. 6 Capitol riot and has made attempts to end birthright citizenship.

Hollywood Insiders Debate","text":"As Kansas City Chiefs players continue to process their lopsided loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX, Hollywood insiders are watching to see whether Travis Kelce is ready to snag a coveted acting career.\n\n The year has not quite gotten off to the start that Kelce might have expected. Although the star tight end — along with quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the rest of the team — reached the Super Bowl with a chance to win a third straight championship, the Chiefs’ prolonged dominance saw some football fans turn on them or become convinced that refs give them more favorable calls. Kelce’s girlfriend Taylor Swift was booed at the Super Bowl by a seemingly pro-Eagles contingent, while Kelce himself caused a social media stir ahead of the big game after calling it a “great honor” to have President Donald Trump in the stadium.\n\n It remains uncertain whether the 35-year-old Kelce is ready to hang up his cleats. (He didn’t address his playing future after the game, and Mahomes was uncertain about Kelce’s plans.) But the year will be a memorable one for Kelce’s pursuit of Hollywood projects. After making his acting debut last fall in Ryan Murphy’s FX series Grotesquerie and continuing to host Prime Video’s Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?, Kelce will soon release his first film as an executive producer with the indie feature My Dead Friend Zoe. Then, he co-stars alongside Adam Sandler in the much-anticipated Netflix sequel Happy Gilmore 2.\n\n Can Kelce successfully launch a Hollywood acting career? The Hollywood Reporter connected with a number of industry insiders, and there appears to be optimism about his chances, despite some hurdles.\n\n “His acting was really good and funny, and he was just a genuinely nice guy,” Happy Gilmore director Dennis Dugan — who executive produces the Netflix sequel — tells THR of Kelce’s role in the new movie. “I met him for a day and a half, loved working with him, and now every time he catches a pass on TV, I say, ‘My best friend caught another pass.'”\n\n The track record for athletes who have tried to segue into an acting career is a bit checkered. Other active athletes exploring a Hollywood path include LeBron James, who has established himself as a producer and has acted in such films as the Amy Schumer-led Trainwreck and Space Jam: A New Legacy. Similarly, fellow NBA standout Stephen Curry is a prolific producer and has starred in projects that include the Peacock series Mr. Throwback. Some of the most successful athletes in Hollywood have come from professional wrestling — which clearly involves a bit of acting prowess in itself — such as Dwayne Johnson, Dave Bautista and John Cena.\n\n Casting director Matthew Barry, known for his work on hits like Rush Hour and The Notebook, can see Kelce’s skills appealing to those involved in high-profile projects. And Barry would know, having cast such athletes as NFL great Jim Brown in Mars Attacks!, hockey player Marty McSorley in Con Air and wrestler George “The Animal” Steele in Ed Wood. \n\n “I love working with dancers and athletes,” Barry says. “They have discipline, they know routine, and you can work with that. If they have a personality, even better. Kelce has a great personality, and it shows in whatever he’s pitching — and that’s true for Patrick Mahomes as well.” \n\n One former athlete who has steadily worked as an actor is retired NFL player Nnamdi Asomugha, a three-time Pro Bowl honoree who married Kerry Washington in 2013. His credits include starring opposite Tessa Thompson in the Amazon romance film Sylvie’s Love and landing a lead role alongside Jessica Chastain on the forthcoming Apple series The Savant. \n\n Renowned acting coach Howard Fine — who has worked with public figures like Johnson and Will Smith when they were new to acting and continues to help clients like Austin Butler — praises Asomugha for taking classes for two years before seeking acting roles. “I have such respect for athletes because what they put themselves through is extraordinary,” Fine says of athletes’ work ethic. “Anybody who is going to come from a different area should respect the craft and get the training and then pursue the career. That’s not how everybody does it, but I think Nnamdi did it right.”\n\n Among Kelce’s forthcoming projects is My Dead Friend Zoe, which hits theaters Feb. 28 from Briarcliff and stars Sonequa Martin-Green, Natalie Morales, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman. Kelce, who does not appear in the movie that centers on a female Afghanistan vet, joined as executive producer just before it started production.\n\n “When he came on as an investor and executive producer, it was so surreal, and we’re just all super grateful to have him part of the team,” says My Dead Friend Zoe writer-director Kyle Hausmann-Stokes. “He could have selected any film, and he chose an independent film about veterans starring two women of color and starring a 90 percent veteran cast that has three nonprofits attached to it.”\n\n Among the prominent athletes to have pursued an acting career is NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman, known for his contributions to the Chicago Bulls’ championship runs in the ’90s. Rodman, who launched his acting career with a starring role opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme in the 1997 action film Double Team, later starred in the 2007 comedy The Minis as a basketball legend convinced to coach a team of little people.\n\n “I was aware that Dennis wasn’t a Shakespearean actor, but I felt he was the perfect choice for the role because of his personality and public image,” The Minis writer-director Valerio Zanoli explains. The filmmaker tells THR that he enjoyed Kelce’s performance in Grotesquerie and adds about the Chiefs star, “His looks and charisma make him stand out, and his dedication to the craft will most likely pay off as he acquires further experience and lands more roles.”\n\n Kelce may have a leg up on some athletes who aspire to become thespians, given that he has extensive experience in front of the camera. In 2016, he was the star of the E! unscripted dating series Catching Kelce, which focused on him spending time with 50 women before choosing his romantic partner.\n\n “As great of an NFL player as Travis is, he was that great as a reality star as well,” says Catching Kelce producer Sam Berns. “He was in it to be a part of it — with his time, with his energy. It was fascinating how much he got involved.”\n\n After his turn in Grotesquerie, his cast gave praise, with co-star Niecy Nash-Betts telling THR at the time, “I thought that he did such a good job for this to be his acting debut.” (For his part, Kelce appeared proud of his work on the series and said on the New Heights podcast that he hosts with brother Jason Kelce: “They haven’t told me to fucking kick rocks after the first week, so it’s been awesome.”)\n\n In general, acting coach Fine recognizes that athletes are encouraged to control their emotions while playing, while an actor actually needs to be in touch with their vulnerabilities. Additionally, Fine warns that any known figure transitioning to acting will be met with harsher standards from the public than a typical acting newbie.\n\n “The public will automatically be skeptical,” Fine says of athletes taking on acting roles. “Are you just trying to trade in on your fame, or is this who you really are? Is this something you can really do? So you have to be actually even better.”","summary":"With the NFL standout — and boyfriend to Taylor Swift — set to appear in 'Happy Gilmore 2,' industry experts weigh in on his potential path to becoming an actor: \"The public will automatically be skeptical.\"","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-super-bowl-acting-career-1236129926/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196122902-H-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:10:35","author":"Ryan Gajewski","authors":["Ryan Gajewski"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.453},{"id":289137140,"title":"‘Back to plastic’: Trump pushes for plastic straws as he declares paper ones ‘don’t work’","text":"By MATTHEW DALY\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is moving to reverse a federal push away from plastic straws, declaring that paper straws “don’t work” and don’t last very long.\n\nThe move by Trump — who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 — targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.\n\nTrump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media post over the weekend.\n\nWhile plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks “it’s okay” to continue using them. “I don’t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they’re … munching their way through the ocean,” he said at a White House announcement.\n\nSeveral U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers.
