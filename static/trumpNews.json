They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, which was developed by aerospace company Boeing.\n\nBut after a number of technical problems during their flight, the option of Starliner carrying the astronauts home as planned was deemed to be a risk not worth taking - given that the pair could instead be brought back by another company, SpaceX.\n\nFor that reason, they stayed in space until they hitched a ride back on a SpaceX capsule. For its part, Boeing maintained that its own capsule was safe to use - and was proven right when the craft returned, uncrewed, in September 2024.\n\nAfter months of experiments aboard the space station, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore eventually returned to Earth on 18 March.\n\nDuring this phase of their mission, the pair were repeatedly described as stranded, implying there was no means for them to get off the ISS.\n\nBut that was not the case, as the space station always has spacecraft attached to it - which could have acted in an emergency as a lifeboat to carry the astronauts back to Earth.\n\nNonetheless, the pair's stay was longer than expected - though the Nasa pair embraced this.\n\n\"We knew nobody was going to just let us down... we knew everybody had our back and was looking out for us,\" Ms Williams said.\n\nWhile in limbo, the pair even found themselves in the middle of a political row, after US President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for abandoning them in space. \n\nBut the astronauts said they ignored the politics and didn't feel abandoned. \"We can't speak to that at all,\" said Mr Wilmore. \"We understand space flight is hard, human space flight is even harder.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clygd1vl9yeo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cb72/live/90140240-3c86-11f0-b6e6-4ddb91039da1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 01:18:04","author":"Regan Morris","authors":["Regan Morris"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.636},{"id":326634600,"title":"‘Unjustified’: Donald Trump claims steel tariff will double, as Australia lashes surprise move","text":"Donald Trump has claimed the tariff rate on steel will double to 50 per cent, drawing the ire of the Australian government.\n\nThe US President blurted out the latest development in his trade war at a steel mill rally in Pennsylvania, on Saturday morning Australian time.\n\nAustralian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the latest tariff hike was unjustified.\n\n“Australia’s position has been consistent and clear. These tariffs are unjustified and not the act of a friend,” he said in a statement.\n\n“They are an act of economic self harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade.\n\n“We will continue to engage and advocate strongly for the removal of the tariffs.”\n\nUS government data shows the price of steel products into the US have increased by 16 per cent since Trump’s second term began.\n\nAustralian car parts, steel and aluminium are currently being slapped with a 25 per cent levy, as per Trump’s sweeping protectionist policies.\n\nThe Pennsylvania rally on Friday was near a factory owned by US Steel, and the President said Japanese steel giant Nippon had invested in the American firm.\n\n“We’re here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storeyed American company stays an American company,” the President said.\n\n“You’re going to stay an American company, you know that, right?”\n\n“If you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country. You don’t have a country, you can’t make a military. What are we going to do? Say, ‘Let’s go to China to get our steel from the army tanks’,” Trump said.\n\nThe Trump administration initially promised to block Nippon’s bid to buy US Steel. Details of the “blockbuster agreement” have not been released. Nippon confirmed in a statement a proposed “partnership” had been agreed to.","summary":"Donald Trump has doubled down on an ‘an act of economic self harm’ by threatening to double the steel tariff to 50 per cent, Australia’s trade minister says.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/unjustified-donald-trump-claims-steel-tariff-will-double-as-australia-lashes-surprise-move-c-18875584","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18875584/148b7e6c8bbfdf3062e2f25ba3786d064f3bdd55-16x9-x0y192w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:50:43","author":"Blair Jackson,Us Steel","authors":["Blair Jackson","Us Steel"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":326633782,"title":"‘Unjustified’: Donald Trump claims steel tariff will double, as Australia lashes surprise move","text":"Camera IconAustralian Trade Minister Don Farrell says the US tariffs are not act of a friend.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy GETHIN HICKS \n Published:01:34 BST, 31 May 2025 |Updated:01:35 BST, 31 May 2025 \n\nEamonn Holmes and his new girlfriend looked smitten as they enjoyed a day out together days after a fresh update in the presenter's divorce saga. \nThe GB news broadcaster, 65, and marriage guidance counsellor Katie Alexander, 43, began dating in mid-2024. \nDespite engagement rumours swirling since December of the same year, the couple only went Instagram official last week after months of low-key holidays and dates.\nBut it seems they're now more than comfortable making their romance public, with the mother-of-two sharing a series of loved-up snaps of her and Eamonn enjoying a day in the woods. \nWith the presenter perched in his wheelchair, the couple posed for a few rare selfies together which Katie shared on Instagram on Friday.\nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail’s new Showbiz newsletter to stay in the loo\n\nEamonn Holmes, 65, and his new girlfriend Katie Alexander looked smitten as they enjoyed a day out together days after a fresh update in the presenter's divorce saga\n\nKatie and Eamonn, both sporting sunglasses, looked every bit the happy couple in the snaps as the 43-year-old pecked her new boyfriend on the cheek\n\nEamonn's marriage counsellor girlfriend shared the snaps to her Instagram on Friday\nKatie and Eamonn, both sporting sunglasses, looked every bit the happy couple in the snaps as the 43-year-old pecked her boyfriend on the cheek. \nWith his partner gazing lovingly at him, Eamonn seemed as happy as ever in another picture as he smiled for thre camera.\nThe smitten display comes just a matter of days after Eamonn's estranged wife Ruth Langsford, 65, called in the lawyers to ensure he will not receive a share of their £3.6 million marital home. \nThe former This Morning presenters left fans stunned last May when news of their split was first reported. \nWith their divorce in the works, Eamonn moved out of their plush six-bedroom home in Weybridge, Surrey, which they had lived in since 2014, last summer.\nAnd The Sun revealed earlier this week that Ruth has been granted a severance of joint tenancy on the property. \nThe publication said that public documents state that if Ruth were to pass away, her share of the house would not go to GB News host Eamonn.\nSarah Dwight, of the Law Society, told the outlet: 'One of the first things divorce lawyers do is to give their clients the option to sever the joint tenancy, so they can leave their share of the house to whoever they want.\n\nThe couple began dating in mid-2024 but only went Instagram official a couple of weeks ago (pictured in February)\n\nEamonn meanwhile has also been dealing with the collapse of his marriage to ex-wife Ruth Langsford (pictured in 2022)\n\nFollowing the split, Eamonn moved out of their six-bedroom home in Weybridge, Surrey, which the couple bought in 2014\n'This move protects Ruth in that if she were to die, she can leave her wealth to whoever she wants, rather than Eamonn getting everything.'\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Ruth and Eamonn for comment.\nAfter leaving his marital home, Eamonn has since moved into a plush penthouse in Kingston, south-west London, where he lives alone. \nWith the presenter reportedly 'lonely' at his new abode, it was thought that Katie may move down to join Eamonn from her native Yorkshire.\nHowever a source close to Ms Alexander told The Mail on Sunday: '‘There’s no way she will move in with Eamonn in the near future, or for many years.\n‘She has her children to consider. Truth be told, they are a little unsettled at her relationship being played out in the media and she doesn’t want to uproot them.\n‘They have met Eamonn on several occasions and get on great with him, so things will stay as they are for the time being. \n‘Eamonn seems so lonely since splitting with Ruth, so it’s not exactly ideal for him.’ \n\nEamonn's divorce woes have been compounded by his ongoing health struggles (pictured in February)\n\nHe sparked concern just last week when he fell off his chair live on air, shocking his GB News co-stars \n\nIn a candid post this week, Eamonn took to social media to share an old photo of himself broadcasting which he captioned: 'Great picture popped up from 3 years [ago] but it's made me sad - I could walk. Got to redouble my efforts'\n\nThe Irishman's divorce woes have been compounded with his ongoing health issues.\nEamonn has been left needing a wheelchair or a walking stick to get around after undergoing surgery on his back in 2022. \nHe sparked concern only last week when he fell off his chair live on air while presenting GB News. \nCo-host Ellie Costello cried 'oh my gosh' after Eamonn's tumble, before the prideful presenter could be heard saying: 'I'm fine, fine, fine, carry on, carry on, carry on.'\n\nEamonn and Ruth had been together 14 years before their shock split last summer \nThe show then cut to an extended adverts break, before Eamonn returned to screens telling viewers: 'They're very wonky wheels on chairs we've got here, as a matter of fact we don't really like the chairs here. \n'It was a shock for me because I had a fall two weeks ago in my bathroom that hospitalised me and that hit me right in the back.'\n'And that hit me again right in the back. Really really sore, really sore.'\nFollowing the two scares, Eamonn shared a heart-breaking update on his health a couple of days ago.\nTaking to social media to post on old photo of himself broadcasting, he wrote: 'Great picture popped up from 3 years but it’s made me sad - I could walk. Got to redouble my efforts.'\nEamonn HolmesGB NewsInstagramRuth Langsford\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEamonn Holmes puts on loved-up display with girlfriend Katie Alexander days after estranged wife Ruth Langsford 'called in the lawyers to secure their £3.6m family home'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Nobody is going to get around that,” Trump told a cheering crowd outside Pittsburgh. \n\nSteel tariffs were not part of the lawsuit in which a judge ruled this week that many levies imposed by the Trump administration were unlawful. \n\nTrump took to the podium at the U.S. Steel plant a week after announcing that he had approved a merger between the company and Nippon. \n\nThe president spoke to an enthusiastic crowd at the Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, with both union members and investors listening for answers on specifics of the deal, as details remain murky.\n\nNippon Steel has sought over the years to purchase U.S. Steel in a deal once criticized by Trump and ultimately blocked by former President Joe Biden in January. Biden blocked the purchase, citing national security risks of foreign control of a critical American supply chain.\n\nBut Trump has characterized the currentdeal as an investment and a “partnership,” while other reports have characterized it as an acquisition of U.S. Steel.\n\nThe steelworkers union was reserving judgement on the arrangement until it has more information.\n\nThe international president of the United Steelworkers, David McCall, said in a lengthy statement Friday: “We have not participated in the discussions involving U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel, and the Trump administration, nor were we consulted, so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the ‘planned partnership’ between USS and Nippon or the ‘golden share’ that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.”\n\nIssuing “press releases and making political speeches is easy. Binding commitments are hard,” McCall added. “The devil is always in the details, and that is especially true with a bad actor like Nippon Steel that has again and again violated our trade laws, devastating steel communities in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.”\n\nTrump vowed at the rally that the headquarters of U.S. Steel, a 120-year-old icon of American industry, would remain in Pittsburgh even amid significant investment from Nippon. \n\nCalling the investment “record-setting,” Trump said the company would make a “$14 billion commitment to the future of” U.S. Steel. \n\n“You’re gonna stay an American company, you know that,” he claimed at the rally, adding that “Japan has been a tremendous friend of mine.”\n\nLast Sunday Trump called the agreement is an “investment, it’s a partial ownership, but it will be controlled by the USA.”\n\nTrump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters outside the White House Friday that “Nippon Steel is going to have some involvement, but no control” of U.S. Steel, despite its massive $14 billion investment. \n\nU.S. Steel has said that the deal is a “merger,” yet is also set to become a “wholly owned subsidiary” of Nippon Steel North America. However, the company has also said that it will carry on operating as a separate entity, according to an April 8 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. \n\nNippon is set to close the deal with U.S. Steel at $55 per share, according to CNBC. \n\nOn Friday, Trump vowed U.S. Steel would see billions of dollars in new investments.\n\n“It’s going to be something even more special when you get all [those] billions of dollars of new equipment that they're going to be investing right here,” he said.\n\n“Companies all over the world have announced nearly $10 billion in new investments in steel, just in steel alone, but the Nippon investment we're announcing today blows them all away,” he added.\n\nThe president further claimed that Nippon would “also invest $2.2 billion to increase steel production in the Mon Valley works, specifically allocated to Mon Valley, along with $200 million for the Advanced Technology Research and Development Center that's being built already in Pennsylvania.”\n\n“And in addition, another $7 billion to modernize steel mills, expand ore mines, and build state-of-the-art facilities in Indiana, Minnesota, Alabama, and Arkansas,” he added.\n\nThe president said that the new investments would “create and save over 100,000 American jobs, including 14,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.”\n\n“U.S. Steel will maintain all of its current operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of the next 10 years,” he claimed.\n\nYet details of the deal have not been released.\n\nSteelworkers Union President McCall warned: “Our members know from decades of negotiating contracts: Trust nothing until you see it in writing.”","summary":"President vows ‘nobody is going to get around’ new 50 percent tariffs on foreign steel,’ but the details of Nippon’s U.S. Steel deal remain murky","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-us-steel-tariffs-b2761110.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/30/23/45/SEI253737615.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HDTwTlte-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:35:22","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":326633410,"title":"Donald Trump Has A Feeling QB Mason Rudolph Is 'Gonna To Be The Guy' In Pittsburgh","text":"President Donald Trump made a lot of news on Friday evening when he held a rally in Western Pennsylvania in support of United States Steel and announced he was doubling tariffs on foreign steel from 25 percent to 50 percent. Oh, yeah, Trump also predicted quarterback Mason Rudolph is \"gonna be the guy\" this season for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Steelers Past And Present Welcome Trump Talk about predictions out of the blue from President Trump. Let's take this in chronological order: Trump held a rally Friday evening at U.S. Steel’s Irvin Works in West Mifflin. And he announced the tariffs to an approving audience of working class men and women who work in the steel industry that has been under siege for some time. But Trump, who is perhaps the most sports-minded president in the history of the republic, also welcomed three current and former members of the Pittsburgh Steelers -- starting quarterback Mason Rudolph, Super Bowl winning running back Rocky Bleier, and current safety and special teams captain Miles Killebrew. It was an inspiring moment for the crowd, who were obviously mostly Steelers fans – especially when Trump brought all three men on stage. Rocky Bleier Names Trump Honorary Steeler Bleier presented Trump with a customized Steelers No. 47 jersey and called him an honorary member of the team. Bleier, by the way, fought in Vietnam in 1969 before he returned to the United States to play for the Steelers. \"I'd like to present this to a Hall of Fame president,\" Bleier said to Trump when handed the president his new honorary jersey. And, yes, Trump singled out Rudolph. \"I happen to think a really good quarterback is a man named Mason Rudolph,\" Trump said in initially welcoming Rudolph onto the stage. \"I think he’s going to get a big shot. He’s tall, he’s handsome, got a great arm, and I have a feel he’s gonna be the guy.\" The Aaron Rodger Factor Matters That, by the way, is a curveball from Trump. Because practically every authority who thinks they know is awaiting Aaron Rodgers to announce he's joining the Steelers to be their presumptive starter. That includes club owner Art Rooney II, who has said on multiple occasions that he's both optimistic about a Rodgers decision to join the team. If Rodgers finally decides to sign with the Steelers – and he's not given the Steelers any guarantees at this point – he would be the starter. The Steelers, after all, aren't bringing him to Pittsburgh to sit behind Rudolph. But Trump apparently believes whatever happens with Rodgers, his supporter Rudolph is going to be a factor. And if we've learned anything, it's do not dismiss Trump's instincts out of hand. So maybe Rodgers simply retires. Or the 41-year-old signs with the Steelers but suffers an injury – another one – that might thrust Rudolph into the lineup. We don't know. But we'll soon see.","summary":"At a rally before U.S. Steel workers in Western Pennsylvania, Donald Trump said he believes Mason Rudolph will be the Steelers&apos; starting quarterback in 2025.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/donald-trump-has-feeling-mason-rudolph-is-going-guy-pittsburgh","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/05/trump-steelers-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:32:31","author":"Armando Salguero","authors":["Armando Salguero"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.242},{"id":326632300,"title":"TACO Trade: Wall Street Has A New Acronym To Rally Behind, But Donald Trump Thinks It's \"Nasty\"","text":"Last Updated:May 31, 2025, 06:00 IST Crux World\n\nFinancial Times columnist Robert Armstrong coined a new terminology for US President Donald Trump - TACO or Trump Always Chickens Out.

He said both tariff hikes would go into effect on Wednesday.\n\nAustralia exports more than $400 million in aluminium to the US each year.\n\nTrump spoke at US Steel's Mon Valley Works–Irvin Plant in suburban Pittsburgh, where he also discussed a details-to-come deal under which Japan's Nippon Steel will invest in the iconic American steelmaker.\n\nThough Trump initially vowed to block the Japanese steelmaker's bid to buy Pittsburgh-based US Steel, he reversed course and announced an agreement last week for \"partial ownership\" by Nippon.\n\nIt's unclear, though, if the deal his administration helped broker has been finalised or how ownership would be structured. Nippon Steel has never said it is backing off its bid to outright buy and control US Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary, even as it increased the amount of money it promised to invest in US Steel plants and gave guarantees that it wouldn't lay off workers or close plants as it sought federal approval of the acquisition.\n\n\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Trump said as he opened an event at one of US Steel's warehouses. \"You're going to stay an American company, you know that, right?\"\n\nAs for the tariffs, Trump said doubling the levies on imported steel \"will even further secure the steel industry in the US.\" But such a dramatic increase could push prices even higher.\n\nREAD MORE: Appeals court allows Trump to continue collecting tariffs﻿\n\nSteel prices have climbed 16 per cent since Trump became president in mid-January, according to the government's Producer Price Index.\n\nAs of March 2025, steel cost A$1481 a metric tonne in the United States, significantly more than the price in Europe (A$1039) or China (A$590), according to the US Commerce Department. The United States produced about three times more steel than it imported last year, with Canada, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea being the largest sources of steel imports.\n\nAnalysts have credited tariffs going back to Trump's first term with helping strengthen the domestic steel industry, something that Nippon Steel wanted to capitalise on in its offer to buy US Steel.\n\nThe United Steelworkers union remained sceptical.\n\nIts president, David McCall, said in a statement that the union is most concerned \"with the impact that this merger of US Steel into a foreign competitor will have on national security, our members and the communities where we live and work.\"\n\nTrump stressed the deal would maintain American control of the storied company, which is seen as both a political symbol and an important matter for the country's supply chain, industries like auto manufacturing and national security.\n\nTrump, who has been eager to strike deals and announce new investments in the US since retaking the White House, is also trying to satisfy voters, including blue-collar workers, who elected him as he called to protect US manufacturing.\n\nUS Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel issued a statement approving of the proposed \"partnership\" but also has not disclosed terms.\n\nState and federal politicians who have been briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy US Steel and spend billions on US Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. The company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the US government's veto power in the form of a \"golden share.\"\n\nUnionised steelworkers said there is some split opinion in the ranks over Nippon Steel's acquisition, but that sentiment has shifted over time as they became more convinced that US Steel would eventually shut down their Pittsburgh-area plants.\n\nClifford Hammonds, a line feeder at the plant where Trump spoke, said at the very least the deal will help upgrade the ageing plant and help increase production.\n\n\"It's putting money back into the plant to help rebuild it, because this plant is old, it's falling apart. We ain't really producing as much as we should be because, like I said, this place is old. It's falling apart. We need some type of investment to fix the machines that we've got working,\" Hammonds said.\n\nNo matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of US Steel, as did former President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump promised during the campaign to make the revitalisation of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office. And the fate of US Steel, once the world's largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.\n\nTrump said Sunday he wouldn't approve the deal if US Steel did not remain under US control. He said it will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe president closed his remarks Friday by thanking steelworkers.\n\n\"With the help of patriots like you, we're going to produce our own metal, unleash our own energy, secure our own future, build our country, control our destiny,\" he said. \"We are once again going to put Pennsylvania steel into the backbone of America like never before.\"\n\nIn recent days, Trump and other US officials began promoting Nippon Steel's new commitment to invest A$21 billion on top of its A$22.3 billion bid, including building a new electric arc furnace steel mill somewhere in the US.\n\nHe was joined onstage Friday by several US Steel workers, including Jason Zugai, vice president of the United Steelworkers local union at the Irvin finishing plant that defied the international union in supporting Nippon Steel's bid to buy US Steel.\n\nZugai, whose father had lost his job in a steel mill years earlier, lobbied local officials and members of Congress to support the deal, believing that US Steel would otherwise shut down its Pittsburgh-area plants eventually.\n\nIn his remarks, Zugai told Trump, \"I knew you wouldn't let us down\" and called Nippon Steel's proposed A$21 billion in investments into steel production in the US \"life-changing.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump has dealt a blow to the Australian steel industry, with a pledge to double the existing tariff on steep imports.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/donald-trump-doubles-steel-aluminium-tariffs/ff4231e1-5d94-43ca-a46a-6900b9294caa","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/geOPVSg96lqhIJAE_HgymlBb2e8=/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F6f0b46c4-0846-45af-add3-05d7bded5128","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:27:19","author":"9News,Associated Press","authors":["9News","Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.102},{"id":326634884,"title":"Iconic UK band announce shock SPLIT after 15 years as they release final tour dates in a heartfelt update","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, May 31st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeru Two's Michaella McCollum reveals the hell that could await Brits accused of drug trafficking abroad - and why she sees them as 'victims'\n\n'It was obvious something had gone terribly wrong': In her first interview since Dr Michael Mosley's death, his widow Clare recounts the desperate search\n\nThousands of Britain's biggest jobless families in line for taxpayer-funded windfalls if Labour or Reform go through with plans to lift two-child benefit cap\n\nThis is the shocking truth about my very public fallout with Samantha Cameron - and why it broke my heart: SARAH VINE reveals how she went from dinner parties and holidays to social Siberia\n\nANDREW NEIL: Donald Trump promised the US a golden age but, so far, it's only his family that are enriching themselves.

We know we need to do it. It’s not a mystery.” \n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates outside of banking or government authority.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in March establishing a Bitcoin reserve, which he described as “a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold.” \n\n“We should be stockpiling bullets,” he continued. \n\n“Like, you know, the military guys tell you that, you know, if there’s a war in the South China Sea, we have missiles for seven days. Okay, come on. I mean, we can’t say that with a straight face and think that’s okay. So we know what to do. We just got to now go about doing it. Get the people together, roll up our sleeves, you know, have the debates.” \n\nDimon joined a fireside chat during the Reagan National Economic Forum in Simi Valley, California, at the Reagan Presidential Library Friday for a sweeping discussion on the economy and how the world’s “tectonic plates are shifting” in geopolitics in the form of wars, proxy terrorists and the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons. \n\nDimon underscored during his address that he does not view China as America’s top adversary, and instead pointed his attention to the “enemy within” that could lead to the U.S.’ status as the world’s leader crater. \n\n“I’m not as worried about China,” Dimon said. \n\n“China is a potential adversary. They’re doing a lot of things well, they have a lot of problems. But what I really worry about is us. Can we get our own act together, our own values, our own capability, our own management?”\n\n“I always get asked this question: Are we going to be the reserve currency?” he said. \n\n“No. You know, if we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That’s a fact. Just read history.” \n\nHe referred to the U.S. government as a “Leviathan” that is too weak to carry out policies, while simultaneously imposing “things on the American public that they’re getting sick of.” \n\nDimon argued that instead, the U.S. needs to celebrate its long-held values.\n\n“Celebrate our virtues: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, equal opportunity, family, God, country,” he said. \n\n“You know, and you can acknowledge the flaws that we have, which are extraordinary — what we did the Black population for years. Don’t denigrate the great things of this country, because those are two different things.”\n\n“We don’t talk that much to each other — deal with our policies — this is the enemy within,” he continued.\n\n“We’ve got to fix our permitting our regulations our immigration our taxation, which I, I think they’re on their way. We have to fix our inner city schools, our health care system.” \n\nThe Reagan National Economic forum kicked off Friday, and includes panels featuring Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, lawmakers such as Sens. Mike Rounds and Bill Cassidy, and leaders from the private sector, such as the CEO of Booz Allen Hamilton, Horacio Rozanski. \n\nThe bipartisan event works to promote “President Reagan’s enduring belief in the power of the free market and individual opportunity to drive national prosperity,” according to forum organizers.","summary":"The United States should stockpile guns, ammunition and drones instead of bitcoin, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday at the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum in California.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/30/business/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-calls-on-us-to-stockpile-bullets-rare-earth-instead-of-bitcoin/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105596368.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1IcSd2j3-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:23:13","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.159},{"id":326634634,"title":"Trump Fires National Portrait Gallery Director","text":"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump on May 30 announced that he has dismissed the director of the National Portrait Gallery, an institution in Washington known for hosting portraits of U.S. presidents and other artwork.\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery is part of the Smithsonian Institution and, along with the American Museum of Art, exhibits the portraits of every U.S. president alongside other prominent artwork by Americans and foreign artists.

Still, Trump played up the partnership between the two companies as a “blockbuster agreement”.\n\n“ There’s never been a $14bn investment in the history of the steel industry in the United States of America,” Trump said of the deal.\n\nA tariff hike on steel\n\nFriday’s rally was a return to the site of many election-season campaign events for Trump and his team.\n\nIn 2024, Trump hinged his pitch for re-election on an appeal to working-class voters, including those in the Rust Belt region, a manufacturing hub that has declined in the face of the shifting industry trends and greater overseas competition.\n\nKey swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan are located in the region, and they leaned Republican on election day, helping to propel Trump to a second term as president.\n\nTrump, in turn, has framed his “America First” agenda as a policy platform designed to bolster the domestic manufacturing industry. Tariffs and other protectionist policies have played a prominent part in that agenda.\n\nIn March, for instance, Trump announced an initial slate of 25-percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, causing major trading partners like Canada to respond with retaliatory measures.\n\nThe following month, he also imposed a blanket 10-percent tariff on nearly all trade partners as well as higher country-specific import taxes. Those were quickly paused amid economic shockwaves and widespread criticism, while the 10-percent tariff remained in place.\n\nTrump has argued that the tariffs are a vital negotiating tool to encourage greater investment in the US economy.\n\nBut economists have warned that attempting a “hard reset” of the global economy – through dramatic tax hikes like tariffs – will likely blow back on US consumers, raising prices.\n\nRachel Ziemba, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the latest tariff hike on steel also signals that negotiating trade deals with Trump may result in “limited benefits”, given the sudden shifts in his policies.\n\nFurther, Friday’s announcement signals that Trump is likely to continue doubling down on tariffs, she said.\n\n“The challenge is that hiking the steel tariffs may be good for steel workers, but it is bad for manufacturing and the energy sector, among others. So overall, it is not great for the US economy and adds uncertainty to the macro outlook,” Ziemba explained.\n\nTrump’s tariff policies have also faced legal challenges in the US, where businesses, interest groups and states have all filed lawsuits to stop the tax hikes on imports.\n\nOn Thursday, for instance, a federal court briefly ruled that Trump had illegally exercised emergency powers to impose his sweeping slate of international tariffs, only for an appeals court to temporarily pause that ruling a few hours later.\n\nA deal with Nippon Steel\n\nBefore the tariff hike was announced, Friday’s rally in Pittsburgh was expected to focus on Nippon Steel’s proposed acquisition of US Steel, the second largest steel producer in the country.\n\n“We’re here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,” Trump said at the outset of his speech.\n\nBut the merger between Nippon Steel and US Steel had been controversial, and it was largely opposed by labour unions.\n\nUpon returning to the White House in January, Trump initially said he would block the acquisition, mirroring a similar position taken by his predecessor, former US President Joe Biden.\n\nHowever, he has since pivoted his stance and backed the deal. Last week, he announced an agreement that he said would grant Nippon only “partial ownership” over US Steel.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Trump said the new deal would include Nippon making a “$14bn commitment to the future” of US Steel, although he did not provide details about how the ownership agreement would play out.\n\n“Oh, you’re gonna be happy,” Trump told the crowd of steelworkers. “There’s a lot of money coming your way.”\n\nThe Republican leader also waxed poetic about the history of steel in the US, describing it as the backbone of the country’s economy.\n\n“The city of Pittsburgh used to produce more steel than most entire countries could produce, and it wasn’t even close,” he said, adding: “If you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country.”\n\nFor its part, US Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon, meanwhile, issued a statement approving the proposed “partnership”, but it also has not disclosed terms of the arrangement.\n\nThe acquisition has split union workers, although the national United Steelworkers Union has been one of its leading opponents.\n\nIn a statement prior to the rally, the union questioned whether the new arrangement makes “any meaningful change” from the initial proposal.\n\n“Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in US Steel’s facilities if it owned the company outright,” the union said in a statement, which noted firmer details had not yet been released.\n\n“We’ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.”\n\nThe rally on Friday comes as Trump has sought to reassure his base of voters following a tumultuous start to his second term.\n\nCritics point out that steel prices have risen in the US by roughly 16 percent since Trump took office, and his Republican Party faces potentially punishing congressional elections in 2026.","summary":"In his campaign-style speech, Trump also hailed a &#039;blockbuster agreement&#039;

In footage taken at Hanoi airport, Macron 's profile can be seen through the door of his official plane. Seconds later, his wife Brigette quickly raises a hand to his face, and appears to strike him. The French president looks surprised and turns to wave outside, before the couple begin to walk down the staircase. Emmanuel Macron then attempts to hold her hand, but she chooses not to take it, and instead holds onto the handrail of the walkway. The couple arrived in Hanoi on Sunday evening for a week-long tour of Southeast Asia, which will include stops in Indonesia and Singapore. A source close to Macron speaking to French news channel BFMTV dismissed the incident as simply a married couple \"bickering.\" They added: \"It was a moment for the President and his wife to unwind one last time before the start of the trip by having a little fun.\" READ MORE: Man 'threatened to shoot Donald Trump in the head' after President deported his famil Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Donald Trump: \"Do you have any world leader-to-world leader marital advice?\" Trump, who has been married three times, quipped in response: \"Make sure the door remains closed.\" Trump said: \"I spoke to him[Macron].

Macron's wife, Brigitte Trogneux, was his drama teacher in high school and is 25 years his senior. He's 47, she's 72. The French President was just 16 when he vowed to marry Trogneux - a married mum-of-three at the time - and his parents even tried to put a stop to the schoolboy love affair, according to a book. Their romance blossomed as Trogneux taught Macron when he was a 15-year-old student at a Jesuit college in Amiens. A 2017 book says he defied orders from his parents to end the romance and his father ordered Trogneux to stay away from his son until he reached 18. Fulda said Macron's parents have since accepted the relationship and his mother has since described her as \"adorable\". In the book, Trogneux was discreet about the origins of the affair. The French president will is set to make a state visit to the United Kingdom in July. Macron will stay at Windsor Castle for the visit, which will take place from July 8 to July 10, Buckingham Palace confirmed earlier this month.","summary":"It comes after Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigette, appeared to slap him during a heated argument on an official tour - video footage of the incident got captured by the global media","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-gives-marriage-advice-35315341","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35289176.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_VIETNAM-FRANCE-DIPLOMACY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:13:17","author":"Paige Ingram","authors":["Paige Ingram"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.152},{"id":326631950,"title":"Donald Trump Announces Plan to Increase Tariffs on Foreign Steel to 50% for US Steelworkers","text":"WEST MIFFLIN, Pa. — President Donald Trump announced on Friday his decision to raise the tariff rate on steel to 50%, marking a significant increase that may further inflate the costs of metal employed in the production of housing, automobiles, and other goods.\n\nHe made this announcement during a visit to U.S. Steel’s Mon Valley Works-Irvin Plant located in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, in close proximity to Pittsburgh, where he discussed investment plans by Japan’s Nippon Steel.\n\nThe price of steel products has increased roughly 16% since Trump became president, according to the government’s producer price index.\n\nTrump assured that U.S. Steel would remain an American entity as part of an agreement allowing Japan-based Nippon to invest in the renowned American steel producer, although limited information about the deal has been disclosed.\n\n“We’re here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,” Trump said as he opened an event at one of U.S. Steel’s warehouses near Pittsburgh. “You’re going to stay an American company, you know that, right?”\n\nTrump said doubling the tariffs on imported steel “will even further secure the steel industry in the U.S.” But such a dramatic increase could push prices even higher.\n\nRELATED | Appeals court delays ruling that blocked Trump’s tariffs\n\nEmployees, Trump supporters, local officials and others filled one of the massive warehouses on the grounds of the Irvin finishing plant to hear Trump. Giant American flags hung from the ceiling and a sign read, “The Golden Age.” Steelworkers in orange hard hats and work clothes milled about, and part of the warehouse’s cement floor was packed with huge rolled coils of shiny steel sheet produced at the plant and used for appliances, doors and other applications.\n\nThough Trump initially vowed to block the Japanese steelmaker’s bid to buy Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, he changed course and announced an agreement last week for what he described as “partial ownership” by Nippon. It’s not clear, though, if the deal his administration helped broker has been finalized or how ownership would be structured.\n\nTrump stressed the deal would maintain American control of the storied company, which is seen as both a political symbol and an important matter for the country’s supply chain, industries like auto manufacturing and national security.\n\nTrump, who has been eager to strike deals and announce new investments in the U.S. since retaking the White House, is also trying to satisfy voters, including blue-collar workers, who elected him as he called to protect U.S. manufacturing.\n\nU.S. Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel issued a statement approving of the proposed “partnership” but also has not disclosed terms of the arrangement.\n\nState and federal lawmakers who have been briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy U.S. Steel and spend billions on U.S. Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. The company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the U.S. government’s veto power in the form of a “golden share.”\n\nIn the absence of clear details or affirmation from the companies involved, the United Steelworkers union, which has long opposed the deal, this week questioned whether the new arrangement makes “any meaningful change” from the initial proposal.\n\n“Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel’s facilities if it owned the company outright,” the union said in a statement. “We’ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.”\n\nUnionized steelworkers said there is some split opinion in the ranks over Nippon Steel’s acquisition, but that sentiment has shifted over time as they became more convinced that U.S. Steel would eventually shut down their Pittsburgh-area plants.\n\nClifford Hammonds, a line feeder at the plant where Trump spoke, said at the very least the deal will help upgrade the aging plant and help increase production.\n\n“It’s putting money back into the plant to help rebuild it, because this plant is old, it’s falling apart. We ain’t really producing as much as we should be because, like I said, this place is old. It’s falling apart. We need some type of investment to fix the machines that we’ve got working,” Hammonds said.\n\nOther U.S. Steel union members said recruiting new employees has been difficult because of the uncertainty around the Nippon Steel deal and the future of the plants.\n\nNo matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, as did former President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump promised during the campaign to make the revitalization of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office. And the fate of U.S. Steel, once the world’s largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.\n\nTrump said Sunday he wouldn’t approve the deal if U.S. Steel did not remain under U.S. control and said it will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Dan Meuser called the arrangement “strictly an investment, a strategic partnership where it’s American-owned, American run and remains in America.”\n\nHowever, Meuser said he hadn’t seen the deal and that “it’s still being structured.”\n\nPennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick called the plan “great” for the domestic steel industry, Pennsylvania, national security and U.S. Steel’s employees. He initially opposed Nippon Steel’s first proposal to buy U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion after it was announced in late 2023.\n\nIn recent days, Trump and other American officials began touting Nippon Steel’s new commitment to invest $14 billion on top of its $14.9 billion bid, including building a new electric arc furnace steel mill somewhere in the U.S.\n\nPennsylvania’s other senator, Democrat John Fetterman – who lives across the street from U.S. Steel blast furnace – didn’t explicitly endorse the new proposal. But he said he had helped jam up Nippon Steel’s original bid until “Nippon coughed up an extra $14B.”\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is seen as a potential presidential candidate, had avoided publicly endorsing a deal but said this week that he was “cautiously optimistic” about it.\n\nChris Kelly, the mayor of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel’s Irvin finishing plant is located, said he was “ecstatic” about the deal, despite the lack of details. He said it will save thousands of jobs for his community.\n\nAssociated Press writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWEST MIFFLIN, Pa. &#8212; President Donald Trump announced on Friday his decision&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump Announces Plan to Increase Tariffs on Foreign Steel to 50% for US Steelworkers first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-announces-plan-to-increase-tariffs-on-foreign-steel-to-50-for-us-steelworkers/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/President-Donald-Trump-tells-US-steelworkers-hes-going-to-double.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:10:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":326632098,"title":"Trump announces 50% steel tariffs and hails ‘blockbuster’ deal with Japan","text":"Donald Trump announced on Friday he was doubling foreign tariffs on steel imports to 50%, as he celebrated a “blockbuster” agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel’s to invest in US Steel during a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nSurrounded by men in orange hardhats at a US Steel plant in West Mifflin, Trump unveiled the tariff rate increase, declaring that the dramatic hike would “even further secure the steel industry in the United States”.\n\n“Nobody is going to get around that,” Trump said, of the tariff rate hike from what was 25%.\n\nIn a social media post after the conclusion of his remarks, Trump announced that the 50% tariffs on steel would also apply to imported aluminum and would take effect on 4 June.\n\nRelated: Trump says he fired National Portrait Gallery chief in latest conflict with arts\n\n“This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers,” he declared in the post.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the announcement would affect the trade deal negotiated earlier this month that saw tariffs on UK steel and aluminum reduced to zero.\n\nDuring the event, Trump invited members of the local United Steelworkers union onto the stage with him to promote the Nippon deal, which saw its leader break with the union to support it. Praising the president, Jason Zugai, vice-president of Irvin local 2227, said he believed the investments would be “life-changing”.\n\nBut the powerful United Steelworkers union remained wary.\n\n“Our primary concern remains with the impact that this merger of US Steel into a foreign competitor will have on national security, our members and the communities where we live and work,” United Steelworkers president David McCall said in a statement on Friday. “Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy. Binding commitments are hard.”\n\nTrump’s Friday announcement comes a day after a federal appeals court temporarily allowed his tariffs to remain in effect staying a decision by a US trade court that blocked the president from imposing the duties.\n\nThe trade court ruling, however, does not impede the president’s ability to unilaterally raise tariffs on steel imports, an authority granted under a national security provision called section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.\n\nDuring his remarks, Trump gloated that the Nippon investment would once again make the American steelmaker “synonymous with greatness” and included protections to “ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving”. He also promised that every US steel worker would soon receive a $5,000 bonus – prompting the crowd to start a round of “U-S-A!” chants.\n\nFew details have been publicly released, but Trump told the steelworkers in attendance that there was “a lot of money coming your way”.\n\n“You’re going to say, ‘Please, sir, we don’t want this kind of success. It’s too much, sir,’” the president said.\n\nTrump has thrown his full support behind the “partnership” between the Japanese and American steel giants, months after insisting he was “totally against” a $14.9bn bid by Nippon Steel for its US rival.\n\nTrump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, had blocked Nippon’s acquisition of US Steel, citing national security concerns, during his final weeks in office.\n\nThe president also asserted that the agreement ensured US Steel would remain under American control.\n\nTrump framed the administration’s drive to boost domestic steel production as “not just a matter of dignity or prosperity or pride” but as “above all, a matter of national security”.\n\nHe blamed “decades of Washington betrayals and incompetence and stupidity and corruption” for hollowing out the once-dominant American steel industry, as the jobs “melted away, just like butter”.\n\n“We don’t want America’s future to be built with shoddy steel from Shanghai. We want it built with the strength and the pride of Pittsburgh,” he said.\n\nIn his remarks at a US steel plant, Trump also repeated many of the false claims that have become a feature of his rallies including the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. He gloated over his 2024 victory and, gesturing toward his ear that was grazed by a would-be assassin’s bullet last year at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, said it was proof that a higher power was watching over him.\n\nHe also called on Congressional Republicans to align behind his “one big, beautiful bill,” urging attendees to lobby their representatives and senators to support the measure.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-announces-50-steel-tariffs-231444545.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/994cf5f6873a1714c41f47806b79e6f8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:07:09","author":"Lauren Gambino","authors":["Lauren Gambino"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.156},{"id":326631036,"title":"ANDREW NEIL: Donald Trump promised the US a golden age but, so far, it's only his family that are enriching themselves.

This week, not one but two US courts ruled that he had misused emergency powers to impose tariffs on whatever took his fancy, thereby blowing a massive hole in what has been the signature policy of his second administration so far.\n\nLast weekend, his Kremlin pal, President Putin, responded to his pleas for a Ukrainian ceasefire and peace talks by raining down scores of missiles and hundreds of drones on various Ukrainian cities.\n\nOn the frontline, meanwhile, he amassed tens of thousands of Russian troops on the border of that part of the Donetsk region in east Ukraine still not under Kremlin control (with 50,000 more poised to invade the country across its north east border).\n\nSo much for Trump's campaign promise to end the war 'on day one'.\n\nOr, for that matter, in 100 days, a second self-imposed deadline announced after he took power which has also come and gone.\n\nFar from being coaxed into peace talks by Trump's charm offensive (which included constantly dissing Ukrainian President Zelensky as if he was the bad guy), the Russian dictator has rebuilt his war machine and primed it for a major summer offensive, all while playing Trump like a fiddle.\n\nMatters are hardly going swimmingly on the domestic front either. The economy contracted a little in the first quarter, for the first time in three years, just as Trump was settling back into the Oval Office.\n\nThat's not necessarily all his fault. But by moving tariffs up and down on a whim, and with more frequency than the elevators in Trump Tower, he has created the fog of uncertainty which now shrouds the US economy.\n\nNaturally, business is holding back investment until it has a clearer view of the lie of the land. Consumers are avoiding major purchases because their pocketbooks are bare and they have very little savings in the bank. This explains why most major forecasters are downgrading their predictions for US economic growth this year and next to 2 per cent or less.\n\nThat's not a disaster – and its likely more growth than most major European economies will enjoy over the next two years, including Britain. But it might be worse. Almost 70 per cent of Americans fear a recession. Four out of five US chief executives expect one in the next 12 to 18 months. Sometimes these sentiments can become self-fulfilling.\n\nNot everything is going wrong. The jobs market is still robust, though unemployment is expected to creep up from the current 4.2 per cent to more than 4.5 per cent.\n\nUS stock markets, once Trump's preferred metric for measuring success, have oscillated wildly, largely in response to whatever the President was doing with tariffs. The S&P 500, a broad index of US stocks, was down 14 per cent last month, the worst stock market performance in the first 100 days of a presidential term since Gerald Ford in 1974.\n\nSince then it's recovered somewhat and is now down under 3 per cent since Trump returned to power. Investors are holding their breath until they see what happens as the latest court rulings on tariffs inevitably wend their way to ultimate resolution in the Supreme Court.\n\nInflation is still above the 2 per cent target – but not by much. However tariffs, which are inflationary, don't help – which is why word is seeping out from the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, not to expect any more interest rate cuts before the autumn. The dollar has also declined under Trump 2.0, which adds to inflationary pressures.\n\nAll of this is taking its toll on Trump's popularity – if not among his base, which is still pretty solid, then certainly with the wider public.\n\nHis positive economic approval rating was 45 per cent two months ago. It's now 39 per cent; 61 per cent have a negative view. His overall approval rating fell to 40 per cent last month.\n\nOnly George W Bush had a worse rating at this stage in his second term (2005). Only 35 per cent of Americans think Trump's second term will be a success, which is a lot less than voted for him last November.\n\nTrump has had a signal success, however, with the one policy that did more than any other to re-elect him: the number of illegal migrants coming across the southern border with Mexico has plummeted to the lowest on record. Suddenly immigration is less of an issue in US politics. But returning those illegals already in America has proved more difficult.\n\nTrump promised 'millions and millions' of deportations. But in the first three months of his administration, returns have been averaging only 13,000 a month, a run rate which amounts to a small fraction of the 430,000 Barack Obama managed to return in the first year (2013) of his second administration.\n\nTrump has done himself no favours second time round by appointing a number of MAGA whack-jobs to key positions, such as Pete Hegseth (defence) and Howard Lutnick (commerce) — 'the chief clowns in the clown car', as one White House aide muttered to me.\n\nBut even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, supposed to be the grown-up in the room, often seems at a loss.\n\nThis matters because of the biggest threat of all to the Trump presidency: the bond markets, where governments go to borrow. Lenders are already charging the US a premium because of the eye-watering scale of the national debt ($36trillion) and because the country is hooked on persistent budget deficits over 6 per cent of GDP.\n\nThe cost of borrowing will only rise as Trump champions his 'Big, Beautiful Bill' which rolls over previous tax cuts and adds new ones, with only token cuts in federal spending.\n\nIt's expected to add up to $4trillion more to the national debt and take annual deficits above 7 per cent of GDP. No wonder Moody's, the credit rating agency, has stripped America of its remaining triple A rating and investors are now demanding around 5 per cent interest to lend long-term.\n\nAmerica will always be able to borrow. The question is: at what cost? The country is already paying around $1trillion a year in interest on the debt alone. That can only rise, big time, on the fiscal trajectory Trump has currently set for the country.\n\nElon Musk, of course, promised to cut spending by $2trillion a year during last year's election campaign. That absurd figure was cut to a still ridiculous $1trillion after Trump won.\n\nNow Musk has gone, his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is claiming only $175billion in savings. Even that figure falls apart on scrutiny. I reckon bankable cuts amount to around only $70billion to date, a pittance in a $6trillion-plus federal budget.\n\nMusk is now back with his troubled Tesla cars and Starship rockets. He now wears an 'Occupy Mars' T-shirt. The MAGA baseball cap has gone.\n\nHe has made no discernible difference to the deficit. He must now realise that cutting the federal leviathan down to size requires more than waving a chainsaw on a stage – and that maybe going to Mars is easier than curbing Washington profligacy.\n\nTrump has time to change course. He could use the court rulings on tariffs as an off-ramp to ditch the whole tariff nonsense. That alone would reignite economic growth.\n\nHe could fan it further with targeted supply-side tax cuts and deregulation. But I fear he's more likely to continue on his current course, which will see his Republican Party go down to defeat in next year's mid-term elections, leaving him with two more years as a lame duck president confined by Congress.\n\nTrump promised America a 'new golden age'. We are still very far from that. It is, of course, a golden age for Trump and his family, who are using the spoils of office to enrich themselves with everything from a Qatari jumbo to cryptocurrency to Gulf property deals.\n\nIn all of that his presidency has been a conspicuous success.\n\nBut I suspect the American people were hoping for rather more than that.","summary":"It never seems to rain but it pours these days for Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14765835/ANDREW-NEIL-Donald-Trump-promised-US-golden-age-far-family-enriching-polls-tumbling-Putin-playing-like-fiddle-fear-come-next.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/30/17/98903895-0-image-m-12_1748623413311.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:04:21","author":"Andrew Neil,Editor","authors":["Andrew Neil","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":326629878,"title":"Savannah Chrisley Says She Can Now Accomplish This Travel 'Goal' Following Parents' Prison Release (Exclusive)","text":"Savannah Chrisley has big travel plans ahead.\n\n Chrisley, 27, tells PEOPLE exclusively that in this new era following her parents Todd and Julie Chrisley's releases from prison, she hopes to embark on a new journey.\n\n \"Personally, my whole goal was to travel to 30 countries by the time I turned 30,\" she said. \"I will be 28 in August.

Here is a look at the document and its ongoing implications for the US.\n\nWhat is the Heritage Foundation?\n\nThe Heritage Foundation is an influential conservative think tank in Washington, DC, whose stated mission is to “formulate and promote public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense”.\n\nYet, critics argue that Project Esther calls for government interference to curb individual freedoms, including the rights to free speech and association when it comes to opposing Israeli government policies.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report published earlier this month, the project is overseen by Victoria Coates, a vice president at the Heritage Foundation who served as deputy national security adviser during Trump’s first term.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation is also behind Project 2025, which critics describe as an authoritarian playbook for the second Trump presidency.\n\nAhead of the elections last year, Democrats repeatedly invoked Project 2025 to criticise Trump, but the then-candidate distanced himself from the document.\n\nWhat does Project Esther aim to achieve?\n\nThe initiative says that it aims to “dismantle the infrastructure that sustains” what it calls the “Hamas Support Network” within 24 months.\n\nWhat is the ‘Hamas Support Network’, according to Project Esther?\n\nThe authors claim that groups engaged in advocacy for Palestinian rights are members of the Hamas Support Network (HSN).\n\nThey define the supposed network as “people and organizations that are both directly and indirectly involved in furthering Hamas’s cause in contravention of American values and to the detriment of American citizens and America’s national security interests”.\n\nIn short, the document alleges that the “pro-Palestinian movement” is “effectively a terrorist support network”.\n\nDoes the ‘Hamas Support Network’ exist?\n\nThere is no such network in the US, which has stern laws against providing material support to groups designated as “terrorist organisations”, including Hamas.\n\nBeth Miller – the political director at Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), a group that the Heritage Foundation names as part of the network – called Project Esther’s allegations “outlandish”.\n\n“It exposes the length of lies and of absurdity that they are going through to try to tear down the Palestinian rights movement,” Miller told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.\n\nHow does Project Esther plan to take down the Palestinian rights movement?\n\nThe document calls for a multi-faceted campaign against supporters of Palestinian rights, targeting them legally, politically and financially.\n\nThe initiative outlines 19 goals that it labels as “desired effects”.\n\nThey include denying Palestinian rights supporters who are not US citizens access to universities, ensuring that social media platforms do not allow “anti-Semitic content”, and presenting evidence of “criminal activity” by Palestine advocates to the executive branch.\n\nIt also calls for refusing to grant permits for protests organised in support of Palestinian rights.\n\nProject Esther suggests that Israel’s backers should conduct “legal, private research” into pro-Palestine groups to “uncover criminal wrongdoing” and undermine their credibility.\n\n“We must wage lawfare,” it reads, referring to the tactic of using litigation to pressure opponents.\n\nIs the Trump administration turning Project Esther recommendations into policy?\n\nIt appears to be the case.\n\n“The phase we’re in now is starting to execute some of the lines of effort in terms of legislative, legal and financial penalties for what we consider to be material support for terrorism,” Coates told The New York Times.\n\nTrump’s crackdown on college protests seems to align with what Project Esther is trying to achieve.\n\nFor example, the US administration has been revoking the visas of foreign students critical of Israel. This echoes a proposal in Project Esther, which calls for identifying students “in violation of student visa requirements”.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation also extensively cites Canary Mission – a website dedicated to doxxing and smearing pro-Palestine students – in its footnotes for Project Esther. The Trump administration is also suspected of relying on the website, along with other pro-Israel groups, to identify students for deportation.\n\nIn addition, Project Esther singles out the “Middle East/North Africa or Islamic studies” programmes as having professors who are “hostile to Israel”.\n\nThe Trump administration has been pressuring elite universities to revamp academic departments, including Middle East studies programmes, that it views as biased in favour of Palestinians. Columbia University, for instance, appointed a provost to review its programmes at Trump’s request, “starting immediately with the Middle East” department.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.\n\nWhat groups does Project Esther name as targets?\n\nThe initiative explicitly identifies several Arab, Muslim and progressive Jewish organisations as well as student groups as part of the so-called Hamas Support Network.\n\nThe initiative claims that “the network revolves around” American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), an educational and civic advocacy group.\n\nOsama Abuirshaid, AMP’s executive director, said Project Esther points the finger at the group because it has “Muslim” in its name, playing on Islamophobic bigotry.\n\n“American Muslims for Palestine is an easy target. Given the Islamophobic tendencies, it’s easy to assume guilt of American Muslims, Palestinians. That’s a name that sticks,” Abuirshaid told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe added that the group is also a target because it is effective and has a “solid constituency”.\n\n“If they can cripple and bring down AMP, that will have a chilling effect within the movement. So they think, if they can bring us down, other organisations will stop working on Palestine solidarity,” Abuirshaid said.\n\nWhy focus on universities?\n\nTariq Kenney-Shawa, a US policy fellow at Al-Shabaka, a Palestinian think tank, said Project Esther targets universities because Israel is bleeding support among young people in the US.\n\n“That’s why there’s such an overwhelming focus on universities and college campuses,” he told Al Jazeera’s The Take podcast.\n\nKenney-Shawa explained that support for Israel’s war on Gaza has been trending downwards across US demographics. But on college campuses, the change is more pronounced.\n\n“While this change is absolutely across the political spectrum, it’s obviously a lot more acute in the left and among young Americans,” Kenney-Shawa said.\n\nA recent poll from the Pew Research Center showed that 53 percent of US respondents had negative views of Israel, a number that rises to 71 percent among Democrats below the age of 50.\n\nIs Project Esther working?\n\nAdvocates say that, in the immediate future, the crackdown on the Palestine solidarity movement threatens the safety and wellbeing of activists, especially foreign students. But it has also sparked a backlash.\n\n“The extreme nature of these attacks has also emboldened people to defiantly continue to speak out in the face of these attacks,” JVP’s Miller said.\n\n“And it has actually, in many cases, awoken people – who weren’t paying attention before – to the hypocrisy that has so long existed in the willingness to silence and censor Palestinian rights activists.”\n\nEarlier in May, several right-wing lawmakers and Trump allies came out in opposition of a bill that aimed to expand restrictions on boycotts of Israel, citing free speech concerns.\n\nAbuirshaid echoed Miller’s comments. He acknowledged that the media attacks, arrests and lawsuits against advocates and student protesters have been “distracting” from the mission of focusing on Palestine.\n\nHowever, he added, “I’m going to be clear: It’s energising us to continue this fight.”","summary":"Advocates say Trump administration appears to be following Project Esther&#039;s recommendations to crackdown on activism.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/31/what-is-project-esther-the-playbook-against-pro-palestine-movement-in-us?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PXL_20240821_230554664.MP-1724282636.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 00:00:51","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.051},{"id":326631728,"title":"Disgraced Democrat Anthony Weiner roasts Kamala Harris for blowing up her campaign on ‘The View’","text":"Despite going to prison for a sex scandal involving minors, disgraced former congressman and former New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner said on Friday he can still do a better job than his Democratic colleagues did in the 2024 election. During an appearance on ABC's \"The View,\" Weiner explained that he is attempting to get back into politics by running for New York City Council because he believes, despite his baggage, that he’s a better politician than current Democratic figures. He also mocked former Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing her of ruining her 2024 presidential campaign while appearing on the same show. \"By the way, was this where Kamala Harris was sitting when she blew up her campaign?\" he asked as soon as he took his seat between the four co-hosts. ANTHONY WEINER SAYS VOTERS DON'T WANT WHAT 'DEMOCRATS ARE SELLING,' TALKS ABOUT COMEBACK AS FIERY CENTRIST \"Is this the spot?\" Weiner asked, gesturing to his chair. \"I hope I don’t have the same fate.\" Harris told \"The View\" last year that there \"is not a thing that comes to mind\" when asked what she would have done differently than then-President Biden. The moment was widely seen as a turning point that led to the downfall of her campaign. Later in the interview, Weiner hit Harris again. He responded to co-host Joy Behar’s suggestion that even though men like Weiner and President Donald Trump have problematic pasts, a woman like the former vice president still can’t make it to the highest office. Though the aspiring city council member admitted female politicians are often judged harshly, he maintained that Harris made an obvious blunder in response to \"The View’s\" \"softball\" question last year. \"The problem is, it’s a little bit too easy an answer, though, because also there were things that Kamala Harris – I made a joking reference to the answer she gave on this show: ‘Is there anything you would do different?’ That is the softest of softball that – every politician dreams to have that question,\" Weiner replied. \"You still have to be a good candidate.\" Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. TAPPER ADMITS FEELING 'HUMILITY' ABOUT PAST BIDEN COVERAGE AS LIBERALS DISPARAGE NEW BOOK Weiner left Congress in 2011 following a photo of the married then-congressman leaking on one of his social media accounts. Additional sex scandals mounted in the following years, culminating in an FBI investigation that led to Weiner serving 21 months in prison and registering as a sex offender after sending sexually explicit images to a minor. After his dig toward Harris at the top of the segment, Behar pressed Weiner on why he believes he can get back into politics considering his scandal-plagued background. The aspiring city councilman said it’s because he believes he’s a better politician than many current Democratic lawmakers. \"I think what I said at the time was I couldn’t imagine there would ever be a chance that either people would want me back or that I would want to get back into that again,\" he replied. \"But when I woke up in November of ’24 and saw the election results, but more than who won, I looked around New York City and saw how many fewer Democrats even turned out to vote. And I started to say to myself, ‘Something is seriously wrong here.’\" Weiner said too many Democratic candidates were running \"frictionless\" campaigns and playing it too safe. He told the co-hosts that he felt compelled to jump back into politics because his contemporaries were not answering the public’s \"cry that they wanted things to change.\" He added that his past was not a \"good enough reason… not to get off the couch and try.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Co-host Ana Navarro pressed him on his specific scandals, asking, \"Why should New Yorkers give you a chance at a political comeback?\" He replied, \"I’m doing the opposite of what a lot of politicians do in my position – ignore that problem, pretend it didn’t happen, blame someone else. I am saying, yes, I did these things. I got into recovery. I tried to make my life better. And now, if I can be of service – and I’m a damn good politician.

Steel into a foreign competitor will have on national security, our members and the communities where we live and work”.\nTrump stressed the deal would maintain American control of the storied company, which is seen as both a political symbol and an important matter for the country’s supply chain, industries like auto manufacturing and national security.\nTrump, who has been eager to strike deals and announce new investments in the US since retaking the White House, is also trying to satisfy voters, including blue-collar workers, who elected him as he called to protect US manufacturing.\nUS Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel, which issued a statement approving of the proposed “partnership”, has also not disclosed terms of the arrangement.\nState and federal lawmakers briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy US Steel and spend billions on US Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota.\nThe company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the U.S. government’s veto power in the form of a “golden share.” Unionised steelworkers said there is some split opinion in the ranks over Nippon Steel’s acquisition, but that sentiment has shifted over time as they became more convinced that US Steel would eventually shut down their Pittsburgh-area plants.\nNo matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of US Steel, as did former president Joe Biden.\nTrump promised during the campaign to make the revitalisation of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office.\nAnd the fate of US Steel, once the world’s largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.

The high growth belied concerns about a softer print amid risks from higher US tariffs, as a recovery in investment and a stronger construction sector propped up the economy. An ET poll conducted earlier this month had pegged growth at a median 6.8% for the quarter and 6.3% for FY25. Key risks to growth include tepid urban consumer demand, muted private investment demand and a volatile global environment. India has held its own in a “growth-scarce” post-Covid global environment amid rising uncertainties due to political conflicts and trade tensions, said chief economic advisor V Anantha Nageswaran. To be sure, the full-year gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.5% marks a four-year low. India’s GDP had grown 9.2% in FY24. Despite the slowdown, India was the fastest-growing economy in the year and is on course to become the fourth largest later this year, overtaking Japan. 121525330The nominal GDP growth rate was 9.8% in FY25 against a 12% rise in FY24, indicating a broadbased decline in inflation. The gross value added (GVA) grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter and 6.4% in FY25. The economy had grown 6.4% in the December quarter and 8.4% in the year-earlier period. Gross fixed capital formation, an indicator of investment, rose 7.1% in FY25 and 9.4% in the March quarter. “Real GDP was expected to fare strongly, partly due to a boost from net indirect taxes,” said Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS Bank.Urban Demand an Issue“A catch-up in government spending, accompanied by betterperforming construction output, has lifted the headline figure,” Rao said. Agriculture grew 5.4% in the fourth quarter, compared with 6.6% in Q3 and 0.9% a year ago. Manufacturing sector growth was 4.8% in the three months ended March, lower than 11.3% in Q4 of the previous year. Construction output surged 10.8% driven by high government capex. The 60 basis point gap between GDP and GVA in the fourth quarter was due to higher net indirect taxes, which rose 12.7%.However, private consumption growth eased to a five-quarter low of 6% while government final consumption expenditure contracted 1.8% in the fourth quarter after a gap of two quarters. “The unevenness witnessed in the consumption recovery remains a critical monitorable going forward,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist, CareEdge Ratings. “The softness in urban demand continues to be an area of concern.” Economists said private sector participation in investment hanot yet taken off on a durable basis across sectors and, going ahead, India’s FY26 GDP growth is estimated at 6-6.6%. US President’s Donald Trump tariff threats also loom large. “The reciprocal tariff is casting its shadow over global GDP and trade growth, which may force investors to postpone their investment decisions,” said Paras Jasrai, associate director, India Ratings and Research, adding that the investment outlook is still hazy.

However, Trump said, “I know people are thinking about it” and “I think some people have been very close to asking,” adding that he would have to “look at what’s happening” in Diddy’s case as he hasn’t “been watching it too closely.”\n\n “First of all, I’d look at what’s happening, and I haven’t been watching it too closely, although it’s certainly getting a lot of coverage,” the president said. “I would certainly look at the facts.”\n\n Questions of whether Trump would consider pardoning Diddy were likely sparked both due to the president’s recent wave of pardons and his former friendship with the fallen mogul before Trump launched his political career.\n\n When Trump was asked if he’d consider a pardon, the reporter also noted that he previously said on The Apprentice in 2012 that Diddy was a “good friend.” The president also responded to this tidbit, noting that their “relationship busted up” after he got into politics. \n\n “I haven’t seen him, I haven’t spoken to him in years,” Trump said of Diddy. “He used to really like me a lot, but I think when I ran for politics, that relationship busted up from what I read. I don’t know, he didn’t tell me that, but I’d read some little bit nasty statements in the paper.” \n\n In recent days, Trump has pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were serving years-long prison sentences after being convicted of federal bank fraud and tax evasion charges, and rapper NBA Youngboy who was sentenced to just under two years in prison on gun-related charges, among others.\n\n The Bad Boy Records founder’s sex trafficking and racketeering trial began in early May, and has seen multiple witnesses take the stand with allegations of sexual and verbal abuse, non-consensual sex, violence and more.

(Photo by Tom ... More Kelley/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nPresident’s Trump new TACO nickvname reveals a flawed leadership strategy\n\nTrump’s new TACO nickname is an acronym for “Trump Always Chickens Out.\" It is back in the news today following Donald Trump decision to change course on his opposition to Nippon Steel’s acquisition to US Steel. Trump’s previous policy changes on tariffs, the Russian War on Ukraine, and deficit reduction, have led commentators to call him the TACO President.\n\nToday, I met with a corporate chief executive wrestling with how to mobilize his company into a new era of growth. His story connects with Trump’s because they are both seeking to manage change. They both have a bold vision and face a choice: should I make definitive declarations or move in small increments, gauging progress based on what you learn and what works?\n\nThe big bold actions and the small, learning steps, are different leadership strategies. Trump’s TACO moniker.\n\nTACO President\n\nTrump’s second presidency has been defined by a series of bold policy steps. Support or oppose his politics, it is impossible to deny that Trump represents a radical shift in the ideology governing the United States.\n\nHe has launched some of them with great theatre, such as the “Independence Day” announcement of his massive tariffs on almost every country in the world. These tactics are calculated to draw maximum attention for his actions in the hope of garnering support from the country.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMusk Cuts Off Reporter Asking About Drug Use Allegations—Including Ketamine, Ecstasy And Adderall\n\nBlackRock’s $70 Billion Bitcoin Price Nightmare Just Got A Lot Worse\n\nMicrosoft Confirms Password Deletion—Now Just 8 Weeks Away\n\nThe challenge for Trump is that these actions are very specific – tariffs of a certain percentage, commitments to end a war within a specific timeframe, opposition to a named takeover deal by a foreign company. These are all positions or policies where we can measure whether or not he acted as he claimed that he would. He either holds the line on these specific choices or he reverses course. The apparent reversal in his positions is what has led to the “TACO President” label.\n\nTACO Change\n\nThe “Trump Always Chickens Out” syndrome is precisely what I want my CEO to avoid as he launches his effort to transform his company. He too has a major change challenge to manage, taking a successful profitable firm to a new level in the face of serious threats from technological disruption.\n\nMy CEO is operating on a dramatically smaller scale. Nevertheless, he is still seeking to set a scale of ambition that is equal to the challenge and shake people out of their comfort zone. He wants to help the firm shift gear and find a path to growth that realizes its full potential. Today the team he leads is focused on operational and regulatory pressures which, though important, will not secure the firm’s long-term path to growth.\n\nThis is a radical break for a firm that has been run for operational performance for twenty years. It has neglected its back-office infrastructure and not invested in its people in a way that would enable it to achieve higher levels of performance. It has big opportunities and, with the new CEO a positive thesis for growth.\n\nTACO leaders\n\nMy CEO could make a bold leap by announcing that he is breaking with the past and developing a new business model. There are plenty of players in adjacencies with direct-to-consumer digital or AI enabled businesses. The CEO’s company is bricks and mortar with mostly analog systems.\n\nThe CEO could go big with a vision to turn the company upside down and make it digital only. This “burn the boats to the past” could play well with growth investors eager for evidence of radical action to bend the growth curve. This would signal a new paradigm for the business with the hope of scaring the legacy managers into action.\n\nHowever, success would depend on the actions the CEO announces being right. What if consumers don’t want to buy direct? What if existing customers flock to competitors fearful that they are about to be left behind? What if the talent his current business depends on run for greener pastures in fear for their jobs?\n\nIt’s a simple answer: he would need to reverse course quickly to preserve revenue and sustain the business. He would be a TACO leader too. The challenge of the bold, decisive approach to leadership is that you better get it right. Otherwise, you may find yourself backtracking to correct errors.\n\nTACO v. Ambition\n\nI am all in favor of ambition. When faced with an opportunity to lead disruption, the best option is to set a new scale of ambition. This resets a team’s expectations for what they need to deliver and frees them to think on a new scale. However, if your ambition includes lots of specific actions that you are going to take, you run the risk of getting it wrong.\n\nThe challenges that Trump faces are super complex. The USA has a massive (this is an understatement) budget deficit that is funded by global investors, including many from Japan and China. Any action on tariffs affects their willingness to buy this debt and so fund the future of the American government. This is a complex interplay between multiple factors.\n\nTrump’s actions may have a positive impact on the problem. However, the scale of these choices is unprecedented and the outcomes unknown. He has already learned that the bond-market creates a constraint on his actions, which is what caused him to “chicken out” from imposing his massive tariffs.\n\nTACO Alternative\n\nThe alternative to bold action with specifics, which you later need to reverse, is to commit to a strategy of learning. You still need a bold ambition, a sense of the long-term outcome that you are seeking to create. But, instead of a preset playbook, you have a set of mini actions, each of which are designed to teach you what works, so that you can adapt and respond.\n\nThis learning approach is far more successful for operating in complex environments. The OODA Loop is a good example of a decision-model for complex scenarios. OODA describes a four-stage process of observing, orienting, deciding, and acting. Developed by US Air Force Colonel John Boyd, it is still taught in the military as a way of managing situations with a high-level of uncertainty.\n\nMy advice to the CEO was to define a long-term ambition together with a broad roadmap for how to get there. This will provide his team with some guard rails but leave them in charge of designing actions to get them to the future, taking small steps to learn, then scaling the ones that work.\n\nThe paradox of TACO leadership is that in the long-run it exposes the leader to charges of weak leadership. The constant change of direction implies a lack of understanding and judgement, but more critically it also suggests that he lacks the courage of his own convictions.\n\nA more confident leadership stance is to paint the bold vision, but to move carefully, learning in increments, and moving in concert with those around you toward a change that is sustainable and effective. Otherwise, you end up making bold, but ultimately foolish moves that you need to reverse and being called TACO is your reward.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Trump Always Chickens Out is a nickname the president has earned because of his chosen strategy for leading change.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbinns/2025/05/30/leadership-lessons-from-trumps-latest-taco-moment/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/683a42d61d825fbdf44884c0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-30 23:56:12","author":"Andrew Binns,Contributor","authors":["Andrew Binns","Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.259},{"id":326632200,"title":"Stephen Miller ‘eviscerated’ ICE officials in private meeting for low deportation numbers","text":"At a time when collaboration is necessary to undertake President Donald Trump’s mass deportation goals, trust has eroded as some high-ranking employees feel they are being closely monitored by the White House over how they are carrying out arrest operations of illegal immigrants. \n\n“They’ve been threatened, told they’re watching their emails and texts and Signals,” the first official said. “That’s what is horrible about things right now. It’s a fearful environment. Everybody in leadership is afraid. … There’s no morale. Everybody is demoralized.”\n\nWhite House official ‘eviscerated everyone’\n\nICE’s top 50 field officials were given roughly a week’s notice of an emergency meeting in Washington.\n\nICE’s 25 Enforcement Removal Operations, or ERO, field office directors and 25 Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI, special agents in charge flew into Washington and descended on the agency’s Washington headquarters last Tuesday, May 20. There, they were met by Miller, ICE confirmed to the Washington Examiner.\n\n“Miller came in there and eviscerated everyone. ‘You guys aren’t doing a good job. You’re horrible leaders.’ He just ripped into everybody. He had nothing positive to say about anybody, shot morale down,” said the first official, who spoke with those in the room that day.\n\n“Stephen Miller wants everybody arrested. ‘Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?'” the official recited. \n\nOne of the ERO officials in attendance stood up and stated that the Department of Homeland Security and the White House had publicly messaged about targeting criminal illegal immigrants, and therefore, ICE was targeting them, and not the general illegal immigration population.\n\n“Miller said, ‘What do you mean you’re going after criminals?’ Miller got into a little bit of a pissing contest. ‘That’s what Tom Homan says every time he’s on TV: ‘We’re going after criminals,'” the ICE official told Miller, according to the first official.\n\nLater, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem came in and addressed the dozens of top ICE officials.\n\n“‘You guys are doing an OK job, but you’re not doing enough. You need to do more,'” the same official said.\n\nAn ICE spokesman told the Washington Examiner on Thursday afternoon that the statements from Miller were “inaccurate.” Other news outlets, including Axios, reported that it was a tense meeting with Miller and Noem last week.\n\n“Stephen Miller did not say many of the things you state,” said Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director of media affairs.\n\nBaksay added that ICE arrested nearly 1,600 illegal immigrants on Wednesday, May 28, one of the highest days since Trump took office.\n\nMiller did not respond to a request for comment. But he confirmed publicly that he had asked to triple the number of daily arrests of illegal immigrants.\n\n“Under President Trump’s leadership, we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day, and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every single day, so we can get all of the Biden illegals that were flooded into our country for four years out of our country,” Miller told Fox News’s Sean Hannity.\n\nThe White House maintained that it intended to ensure Trump’s promises, including those on immigration, were carried out.\n\n“Keeping President Trump’s promise to deport illegal aliens is something the administration takes seriously,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote in an email. “We are committed to aggressively and efficiently removing illegal aliens from the United States, and ensuring our law enforcement officers have the resources necessary to do so. The safety of the American people depends upon it.”\n\nHeads roll at ICE\n\nIn the fallout of that Tuesday meeting, ICE said it was undergoing a “leadership realignment to support its increasing operational tempo.”\n\nKen Genalo, acting executive associate director of ERO, will retire from his post and step down to the role of a special government employee. ICE cited it as a way for Genalo to spend more time with his family since he has been based in Washington since January.\n\nA former senior DHS official with firsthand knowledge of Genalo’s forthcoming retirement disputed why Genalo was leaving.\n\n“I believe this announcement is trying to put a spin on the changes; Ken was told he had to go,” the official wrote in a text message. “Ken retired when they told him they no longer wanted him as the EAD and they were not allowing him to return to NYC as the [field office director].”\n\nRobert Hammer, the acting executive associate director of HSI, has been replaced by Derek Gordon, a lower-ranking HSI official. Hammer had overseen 10,000 employees tasked with carrying out major investigations into cross-border crimes.\n\nThe changes come as the White House continues to pressure ICE to turn up the numbers on arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The agency announced eight new faces in leadership as part of its new direction.\n\nTrump has promised to carry out the “largest-ever” deportation operation but is on track to come in below the highest year during the Obama administration.\n\nICE officers ‘need to be better’\n\nThe White House’s frustrations with ICE are not unfounded, according to the same three officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner. \n\nICE, as well as the DHS overall, could be doing a far better job coordinating who to arrest, how to transport people to detention centers, where to detain them, and final removal flights, the three agreed.\n\n“There has been better coordination among FBI, [Drug Enforcement Administration], U.S. Marshals than I see within the DHS family,” the second official said.\n\n“We all know that they are not meeting expectations. Some of it is atrophy. Some of it is lack of funding/jail space,” the third official wrote in a text message, adding they “need to be better.”\n\nIn one example, the third official said he had heard of instances in which ERO officers who were temporarily assigned to metropolitan cities to help existing officers arrest illegal immigrants have been “more interested in checking out local sights than doing the work.” \n\n“These guys — it’s hard for them to step up and meet this moment because they’re just not that good,” the same person said.\n\nICE officers tasked with arresting and transporting illegal immigrants inside the U.S. have lamented internally about the massive task they have been assigned, the second official said. Agents from ICE HSI feel that making street arrests is below their pay grade, while ICE ERO officers feel too much is being asked of them, at a time when the White House keeps moving the goal post, according to two officials.\n\nThe second official said ICE officers making arrests have pushed back on having to accompany illegal immigrants on transport rides and flights to detention facilities once arrested, describing the tasks as menial and redundant.\n\nCan money change things?\n\nThe three officials were not optimistic about how ICE would fare or how the deportations would pan out, but they said the anticipated infusion of cash through the “big, beautiful bill,” expected to go before the Senate this summer, would double ICE detention space from 50,000 beds to 100,000 beds.\n\nThe heavily populated coastal regions of the country have been targets for ICE arrests. The challenge has been the lack of detention space necessary to keep immigrants detained, preventing officers from continuing to make arrests.\n\nThat’s where the billions of dollars in cash will help, landing detention and transport contracts, and the plethora of other related costs associated with the deportation effort.\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION FAILED TO INVESTIGATE 65,000 INSTANCE OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IN POSSIBLE DANGER: GRASSLEY\n\n“If you don’t really want to try that hard, you’ve got lots of excuses because you’ve got no space,” the third official said. “If they don’t get better … then everybody will know … they’re just not good at what they do. They can’t perform at the level of expectation.”\n\nThe White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comment.","summary":"Top Trump administration officials are unhappy with arrest and deportation numbers and have lambasted the federal immigration officials responsible for the operation, the Washington Examiner learned.

In a post later on his Truth Social platform, he added that aluminum tariffs would also be doubled to 50 per cent, and both tariff hikes would go into effect Wednesday.

Trump spoke at US Steel's Mon Valley Works–Irvin plant in suburban Pittsburgh, where he also discussed a details-to-come deal under which Japan's Nippon Steel will invest in the iconic American steelmaker. Though Trump initially vowed to block the Japanese steelmaker's bid to buy Pittsburgh-based US Steel, he reversed course and announced an agreement last week for what he described as “partial ownership” by Nippon. Also Read | Who Is Megha Vemuri? Indian-American MIT Student Who Called Out Gaza Genocide in Graduation Speech. It's unclear, though, if the deal his administration helped broker has been finalised or how ownership would be structured. “We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,” Trump said as he opened an event at one of US Steel's warehouses. “You're going to stay an American company, you know that, right?” As for the tariffs, Trump said doubling the levies on imported steel “will even further secure the steel industry in the US\". But such a dramatic increase could push prices even higher. Steel prices have climbed 16 per cent since Trump became president in mid-January, according to the government's Producer Price Index. As of March 2025, steel cost USD 984 a metric tonne in the United States, significantly more than the price in Europe (USD 690) or China (USD 392), according to the US Commerce Department. The United States produced about three times more steel than it imported last year, with Canada, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea being the largest sources of steel imports. Analysts have credited tariffs going back to Trump's first term with helping strengthen the domestic steel industry, something that Nippon Steel wanted to capitalise on in its offer to buy US Steel. The United Steelworkers union remained skeptical of Nippon's investment. Its president, David McCall, said in a statement that the union is most concerned “with the impact that this merger of U. Steel into a foreign competitor will have on national security, our members and the communities where we live and work\". Trump stressed the deal would maintain American control of the storied company, which is seen as both a political symbol and an important matter for the country's supply chain, industries like auto manufacturing and national security. Trump, who has been eager to strike deals and announce new investments in the US since retaking the White House, is also trying to satisfy voters, including blue-collar workers, who elected him as he called to protect US manufacturing. US Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel, which issued a statement approving of the proposed “partnership”, has also not disclosed terms of the arrangement. State and federal lawmakers briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy US Steel and spend billions on US Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. The company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the U.S. government's veto power in the form of a “golden share.” Unionised steelworkers said there is some split opinion in the ranks over Nippon Steel's acquisition, but that sentiment has shifted over time as they became more convinced that US Steel would eventually shut down their Pittsburgh-area plants. No matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of US Steel, as did former president Joe Biden. Trump promised during the campaign to make the revitalisation of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office. And the fate of US Steel, once the world's largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.

Please read at your own discretion.\n\nA woman identified only as the pseudonym “Mia,” a former assistant of Sean “Diddy” Combs, continued her testimony Friday at his sex trafficking and racketeering trial.\n\nMia said that she threw her phone across the room in terror and ran outside when she saw the hip-hop mogul calling her days after his longtime ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, sued him two years ago.\n\n“It was just so triggering to see that,” the former assistant said. She was the second of three women expected to testify at the federal trial in Manhattan that they were sexually abused by Combs.\n\nVentura’s lawsuit, which alleged years of sexual abuse, was settled within a day for $20 million.\n\nMia said, at first, she was elated to hear from D-Roc, one of Combs’ former bodyguards, when he reached out to her days after Ventura’s lawsuit — until she realized he was at the Bad Boy Records founder’s home and trying to reconnect her with her former boss.\n\n“Puff wanted D-Roc to get to me and make sure I wasn’t a threat,” Mia told jurors.\n\nThen, she said, she felt “terrified, threatened, scared, nervous.” Mia said she “wanted to play dumb” and needed a game plan to protect herself.\n\n“I didn’t want my life to be in danger,” Mia said.\n\nCombs has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of an indictment accusing him of a pattern of abuse toward Ventura and others.\n\nMia testified that Combs told her to go to South Africa with Ventura in October 2015 while she was shooting a movie.\n\nWhile Mia and Ventura were in South Africa, Combs’ then-girlfriend found out he was cheating on her when she saw a video of him with another woman, Mia said.\n\n“She was devastated. They were on the phone, and then at one point, she didn’t want to speak with him so she stopped answering his calls,” she told the court.\n\nThe jury was shown a series of text messages between Mia and Combs’ chief of staff Kristina Khorram about Combs demanding to speak to Mia so he could get to Ventura.\n\nKhorram texted and called Mia while she was asleep and she eventually answered the chief of staff after she spoke to Combs on the phone.\n\n“He doesn’t sound in the right mind at the moment. Any reasoning should be in the a.m. your time,” Mia wrote in a message to Khorram.\n\nMia said that when she spoke to Combs prior to sending the message, Combs was “irate, forgetting what he was talking about, slurring quite a bit, saying irrational things.”\n\nShe said that Combs was “threatening my job, threatened to kill me, lots of threats, telling me he was on the phone with HR even though I knew that wasn’t true.”\n\nThe jury was also shown a message between Combs and Mia from a few days later.\n\n“If you dont call me now f— it all. And imma tell everything. And dont ever speak me again. You have 2 min. F— her. Call my [house] now or never speak to me again. F— abc and all lawyers. Let’s go to war,” Combs wrote in the message.\n\nMia said that Combs was threatening to tell Ventura about the sexual assaults she testified about on May 29 but would frame it “as though it was my fault or that I was, or that I had a part in it.”\n\nShe said that Combs mentioned ABC because they had recently purchased the rights to a comedy show she had written, calling it “the most exciting thing that’s ever happened in my life, and he’s threatening to take that away.”\n\nMia responded to Combs and told him that Ventura was busy but he sent her a series of more than 10 text messages, telling her to call him before writing, “I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s best that we no longer have any dealings.”\n\n“It didn’t it matter what I wanted or what anyone else wanted, it matters what he wants and he was in charge,” Mia said.\n\nMia told the court that she tried to “run away” from her job working for Combs before she eventually left in 2017. She said that she felt that Combs would make sure she was unable to get different employment elsewhere.\n\n“He would’ve made sure of it,” Mia added. “He would destroy my reputation. I was scared of him.”\n\nShe said that later in 2016, she had a meeting with Brian Offutt, the chief operating officer of Combs Enterprises.\n\n“Out of the blue, he just said ‘I hate to tell you this, but I talked to Mr. Combs and he no longer wants to be involved with film, so he basically wants to end Revolt Films,’” Mia testified.\n\nShe said she was shocked by the decision and felt “betrayed” that Combs didn’t tell her himself.\n\nMia recounts being kicked off a yacht for counting money too slowly\n\nMia spoke about an experience she had on a yacht with Combs, Kim Porter and his family in St. Barts for New Year’s Eve in 2010 going into 2011.\n\nShe said that Combs told her to get off the boat because she was counting the money in his safe too slowly.\n\n“He told me, ‘You better learn to walk on water like Jesus, b—h. Get the f— out of here,” Mia said.\n\nAfter that, she hid on the boat away from Combs before a crew member took her to shore.\n\nOnce she reached the shore, a yacht crew member radioed the person she was with to say Combs wanted her back on the boat. Mia said she didn’t want to but needed to obey “Puff’s orders.”\n\nShe said that Combs then forced her to go with him on a jet to Las Vegas and although she didn’t want to go, she said she went with him otherwise she’d be fired.\n\nCombs’ ex-assistant says she hasn’t been able to work since quitting\n\nAfter she left Bad Boy Entertainment, Mia said, she received $250,000 of a $400,000 settlement to reimburse her for promised bonuses that were never paid and for unpaid overtime. But she said she never told her lawyers about the sexual abuse.\n\nShe said she hasn’t been able to work since leaving the job because she suffers “from severe complex PTSD” after her employment with Combs.\n\n“I would have to leave because I would be triggered by really normal situations with like an overwhelming sense of fear of being in trouble,” Mia said.\n\nShe acknowledged during her testimony that she referenced her co-workers as “family” and used the word “love” in her correspondence with Combs even after he sexually assaulted her.\n\n“That’s how we all talked to each other,” Mia said. While working for Combs, she said, she dated his sound engineer, although it wasn’t a typical relationship because they rarely saw one another outside work.\n\nShe said that she was scared for her own safety whenever Combs was unhappy.\n\n“I was in fear any time Puff was not happy, because I wanted to make sure that he was, because then I was safe,” she said.\n\n“Why did you need someone else saying that it was wrong of Mr. Combs to make you feel like he would kill you?” defence lawyer Brian Steel asked her.\n\nMia said that she has a “logic brain” and a “trauma brain,” noting that the “trauma brain” often wins.\n\n“I just wanted to do my best and make everybody happy all the time. So I tend to take a lot more than normal people. I don’t know how to explain that. I don’t know if I should apologize for that. I forgive people all the time for things,” she said.\n\n“I am a sexual assault victim, just survive,” Mia added. “I’m unravelling a lot of this now in therapy. Nobody told me, nobody was there to say the things that were happening were wrong.”\n\nSteel went on to suggest that Mia made up the sexual assault allegations against Combs.\n\n“Mr. Combs never had unwanted nonconsensual forcible sexual contact with you, isn’t that true?” he asked.\n\n“What I said in this courtroom is true. I have not lied to anyone at all,” she responded.\n\nTrump says he will ‘look at the facts’ when asked about pardoning Combs\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump was asked by Fox News’ Peter Doocy whether he would consider pardoning Combs.\n\nTrump told Doocy that he would “certainly look at the facts,” adding that “nobody’s asked” but “people are thinking about it.”\n\nTrump said that he hasn’t seen or spoken to Combs in years and hasn’t been following his trial closely.\n\nWhat Combs is on trial for\n\nU.S. prosecutors allege that for 20 years, behind the scenes, Combs was coercing and abusing women with help from a network of associates who helped silence victims through blackmail and violence.\n\nCombs faces an indictment that includes descriptions of freak-offs, which are defined in the court doc as “elaborate and produced sex performances that Combs arranged, directed, masturbated during, and often electronically recorded.”\n\nNumerous witnesses have come forward to accuse Combs of terrorizing people into silence by choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, according to prosecutors. One indictment alleges that Combs dangled someone from a balcony.\n\nAlthough dozens of men and women have alleged in lawsuits that Combs abused them, this trial will highlight the claims of four women.\n\nCombs is charged with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has denied all the charges against him and has rejected a plea deal, choosing to go to trial instead.\n\nIf found guilty in the New York court, he could face life in prison.\n\nDay 11 testimony\n\nDay 10 testimony\n\nGlobal News will be covering the Diddy trial in its entirety.

Trump’s order is an “existential threat” to the station, the lawsuit said.\n\nA PBS spokesman said that “after careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television’s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations”.\n\n‘Lawful authority’\n\nThrough an executive order earlier this month, Trump told the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the two systems. Through the corporation alone, PBS is receiving $325m this year, most of which goes directly to individual stations.\n\nThe White House deputy press secretary, Harrison Fields, said the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers’ dime.\n\n“Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS,” Fields said. “The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.”\n\nPBS, which makes much of the programming used by the stations, said it gets 22 percent of its revenue directly from the feds. Sixty-one percent of PBS’s budget is funded through individual station dues, and the stations raise the bulk of that money through the government.\n\nInterrupting ‘a rich tapestry of programming’\n\nTrump’s order “would have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans”, Chen wrote.\n\nPBS said the US Department of Education has cancelled a $78m grant to the system for educational programming, used to make children’s shows like Sesame Street, Clifford the Big Red Dog and Reading Rainbow.\n\nFor Minnesota residents, the order threatens the Lakeland Learns education programme and Lakeland News, described in the lawsuit as the only television programme in the region providing local news, weather and sports.\n\nBesides Trump, the lawsuit names other administration officials as defendants, including Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. PBS says its technology is used as a backup for the nationwide wireless emergency alert system.\n\nThe administration has fought with several media organisations. Government-run news services like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are struggling for their lives.

Gretchen Whitmer says Trump told her he would not pardon men convicted in kidnapping plot","text":"By ISABELLA VOLMERT\n\nMACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. (AP) — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says President Donald Trump would be going back on his word to her if he pardoned two men who are serving prison sentences for leading a 2020 plot to kidnap her.\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat, told Michigan Public Radio on Thursday that Trump asked her about a month ago how she would feel if he pardoned the two men.\n\n“I said, ‘I think it would be the wrong decision,’” Whitmer recounted. “I would oppose it and he said, ‘OK, I’ll drop it.’”\n\nWhitmer, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, recounted the conversation one day after Trump said he was considering a pardon for the men, saying, “I will take a look at it. It’s been brought to my attention.”\n\nThe Republican president said he followed the men’s trial and “it looked to me like somewhat of a railroad job.” He said the men “were drinking and I think they said stupid things.”\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department’s new pardon attorney also said this month he would take a “hard look” at pardoning Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox.\n\nCroft, 49, and Fox, 42, were portrayed as leaders of the kidnapping scheme. They were convicted of conspiracy in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 2022. Croft, a trucker from Delaware, was also found guilty of a weapons charge.\n\nCroft was sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison, while Fox, a Grand Rapids man, got a 16-year term. They are being held at a prison in Colorado — the most secure in the federal system.\n\nWhitmer later told an audience following a speech at the Detroit Regional Chamber Mackinac Policy Conference that she plans to talk to Trump again about the pardoning matter.\n\n“We have an ongoing dialogue now … very different from the first term,” she said about Trump and turned to smile at the audience.\n\nA spokesperson said the White House cannot confirm nor deny any upcoming actions.\n\n“The White House does not comment on the President’s private meetings, and any speculation about future pardons is just that—speculation,” principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said in a statement.\n\nWhitmer and Trump clashed publicly during his first term, with Trump referring to her as “ that woman from Michigan.” She has blamed Trump for the political anger that motivated the plot to kidnap her right before the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhitmer also hinted Thursday at anger over the possibility of pardons, saying she was disappointed to hear the news he was considering it.\n\n“No one should hesitate to condemn political violence,” she said, noting the arson attack on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s residence and the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last year.\n\nWhitmer has faced scrutiny from some Democrats for taking a more collaborative approach to the Trump administration in his second term.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat who has criticized Whitmer for working with and appearing with Trump, said releasing the convicted men is “no laughing matter.”\n\n“The reward you get for cozying up to Trump is him threatening to pardon the terrorists who plotted to kidnap and murder you,” she said on social media.\n\nWhitmer’s collaboration with Trump has come with several awkward moments for her this year, including when she was unexpectedly in the Oval Office during a press conference as Trump ordered the Justice Department to investigate two former members of his previous administration who had publicly criticized him.\n\nTheir new dynamic also led to some wins for her administration, including securing new jets at a military air base in Michigan and a commitment from Trump to fund a project to protect Lake Michigan from invasive carp.","summary":"Trump said he was considering a pardon for Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/05/30/whitmer-trump-pardons/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Democrats_Whitmer_34652_5e8852-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-30 23:37:06","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":326625798,"title":"Letters: State’s leaders are the cause of our high cost of living","text":"State’s leaders are\ncause of high prices\n\nRe: “Menu prices getting harder to swallow” (Page A1, May 21).\n\nDespite claims of rising costs due to tariffs, March’s Consumer Price Index and April’s Producer Price Index showed the sharpest declines since the early pandemic days, and crude oil prices have dropped nearly 25% since Inauguration Day.

He claimed that both moves would strengthen steelmaking in America.\nWithout exception, Trump said, steel import tariffs would jump to 50 per cent, “which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States”. He later said on his Truth Social platform that the increase would be effective on June 4.\n“We are here to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays in America,” Trump said during a speech in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, a manufacturing town long tied to US Steel operations.\nTrump said he rejected Nippon Steel’s offer “about four times”, but eventually concluded that the Japanese company “really wants to do the good things” as America will “maintain control” of one of its largest steelmakers.\nTrump’s speech followed his announcement last week on his Truth Social account backing the deal, rebranding the once-blocked foreign acquisition as a “planned partnership”.\n\nFirst announced in late 2023, the proposed acquisition was met with resistance by former president Joe Biden’s administration, which cited national security concerns and moved to block the deal in the final weeks of his term.\nTrump also had voiced opposition to during the presidential campaign, and in December as president-elect pledged to “block” the deal once he returned to the White House, posting: “I am totally against the once great and powerful US Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan.”\nSince the start of his second term in January, though, his tone has shifted. In February, for example, after meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Trump announced that Nippon Steel would invest “heavily” in US Steel “as opposed to own it”.\nTrump said in his speech on Friday that Nippon Steel has offered a “US$14 billion commitment to the future of this company”, with another US$7 billion to modernise steel mills, and expand ore mines and build facilities in Indiana, Minnesota, Alabama and Arkansas.\nThe Japanese company will also invest US$2.2 billion in Mon Valley, where the speech took place, to increase steel productions, along with a US$200 million research and development centre that is currently being built in Pennsylvania.\nNippon Steel has not publicly commented on the terms of a deal, but Senator David McCormick, Republican of Pennsylvania, told CNBC on Tuesday that Trump’s administration is currently allowing the sale to proceed under conditions including an American chief executive, a majority-American board of directors and a “golden share” that gives the government veto power over key corporate decisions.\nNippon Steel representatives have not responded to requests for comment.\nThe administration has pushed broadly to strengthen the US manufacturing sector, including the use of protectionist tariffs.\nThe United Steelworkers union, which opposes the acquisition, issued a statement on Wednesday saying its core concerns about Nippon Steel, “a foreign-owned corporation with a documented history of violating US trade laws”, remained “as strong and valid today as ever”.\n\nThe union also noted it was unclear how much of Nippon Steel’s investment would finance “genuinely new capital improvements as opposed to routine repair and maintenance”.\nIn February, the White House reinstated a 25 per cent tariff on steel imports and raised tariffs on aluminium to the same level, citing the need to protect American industries from “unfair trade practices and global excess capacity”. Japan, however, was exempt from the steel tariffs.\nBut last month, Japan was among the US allies hardest hit by Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, with Japanese imports facing new levies of up to 24 per cent.\nAfter Trump announced a 90-day pause on full tariff enforcement, Japan companies remains subject to a 10 per cent base rate. Japanese auto manufacturers also continue to face a 25 per cent tariff on their vehicles, Japan’s pillar exports.\nDespite multiple rounds of negotiations, Tokyo has yet to reach a tariff reduction deal with Washington.\nTokyo has announced it will spend US$6.3 billion in an effort to thwart the economic impact of the Trump tariffs.\nIt remains unclear whether the Nippon Steel deal would formally be part of the broader US-Japan trade talks.\nRyosei Akazawa, Japan’s top trade negotiator, visited Washington again this week for a fourth round of talks.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump had “a very good call and a good discussion” with Ishiba on Thursday, though she did not disclose the topics discussed. Ishiba told reporters in Tokyo that the conversation was friendly.\nThe US Steel deal has become a symbol for the Trump administration, aligning closely with its agenda to revitalise American manufacturing and boost working-class employment. The company is based in Pennsylvania, a key swing state that played a decisive role in Trump’s victories in both 2016 and 2024.\nAt the same time, China’s outsize role in global steel production – accounting for more than half the world’s output – remains a core target of US trade policy. The steel tariffs imposed in February were partly aimed at closing loopholes that previously allowed Chinese exports to avoid US duties.\nTrump has repeatedly accused Beijing of overcapacity and dumping since his first administration, vowing to prompt more countermeasures in his term.\nHe took a swipe at China trade practices in his speech on Friday, claiming that “they were dumping steel, as you know, from China and from all over the world”.","summary":"US President Donald Trump on Friday pledged support for investments of more than US$20 billion by Japan’s Nippon Steel into US Steel, and said he would double tariffs on the industrial metal that they produce.

Few details about the deal have been made public.\n\n\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Trump said as he opened an event at one of U.S. Steel's warehouses near Pittsburgh. \"You're going to stay an American company, you know that, right?\"\n\nTrump said doubling the tariffs on imported steel \"will even further secure the steel industry in the U.S.\" But such a dramatic increase could push prices even higher.\n\nRELATED | Appeals court delays ruling that blocked Trump's tariffs\n\nEmployees, Trump supporters, local officials and others filled one of the massive warehouses on the grounds of the Irvin finishing plant to hear Trump. Giant American flags hung from the ceiling and a sign read, \"The Golden Age.\" Steelworkers in orange hard hats and work clothes milled about, and part of the warehouse's cement floor was packed with huge rolled coils of shiny steel sheet produced at the plant and used for appliances, doors and other applications.\n\nThough Trump initially vowed to block the Japanese steelmaker's bid to buy Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, he changed course and announced an agreement last week for what he described as \"partial ownership\" by Nippon. It's not clear, though, if the deal his administration helped broker has been finalized or how ownership would be structured.\n\nTrump stressed the deal would maintain American control of the storied company, which is seen as both a political symbol and an important matter for the country's supply chain, industries like auto manufacturing and national security.\n\nTrump, who has been eager to strike deals and announce new investments in the U.S. since retaking the White House, is also trying to satisfy voters, including blue-collar workers, who elected him as he called to protect U.S. manufacturing.\n\nU.S. Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel issued a statement approving of the proposed \"partnership\" but also has not disclosed terms of the arrangement.\n\nState and federal lawmakers who have been briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy U.S. Steel and spend billions on U.S. Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. The company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the U.S. government's veto power in the form of a \"golden share.\"\n\nIn the absence of clear details or affirmation from the companies involved, the United Steelworkers union, which has long opposed the deal, this week questioned whether the new arrangement makes \"any meaningful change\" from the initial proposal.\n\n\"Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel's facilities if it owned the company outright,\" the union said in a statement. \"We've seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.\"\n\nUnionized steelworkers said there is some split opinion in the ranks over Nippon Steel's acquisition, but that sentiment has shifted over time as they became more convinced that U.S. Steel would eventually shut down their Pittsburgh-area plants.\n\nClifford Hammonds, a line feeder at the plant where Trump spoke, said at the very least the deal will help upgrade the aging plant and help increase production.\n\n\"It's putting money back into the plant to help rebuild it, because this plant is old, it's falling apart. We ain't really producing as much as we should be because, like I said, this place is old. It's falling apart. We need some type of investment to fix the machines that we've got working,\" Hammonds said.\n\nOther U.S. Steel union members said recruiting new employees has been difficult because of the uncertainty around the Nippon Steel deal and the future of the plants.\n\nNo matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, as did former President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump promised during the campaign to make the revitalization of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office. And the fate of U.S. Steel, once the world's largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.\n\nTrump said Sunday he wouldn't approve the deal if U.S. Steel did not remain under U.S. control and said it will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Dan Meuser called the arrangement \"strictly an investment, a strategic partnership where it's American-owned, American run and remains in America.\"\n\nHowever, Meuser said he hadn't seen the deal and that \"it's still being structured.\"\n\nPennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick called the plan \"great\" for the domestic steel industry, Pennsylvania, national security and U.S. Steel's employees. He initially opposed Nippon Steel's first proposal to buy U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion after it was announced in late 2023.\n\nIn recent days, Trump and other American officials began touting Nippon Steel's new commitment to invest $14 billion on top of its $14.9 billion bid, including building a new electric arc furnace steel mill somewhere in the U.S.\n\nPennsylvania's other senator, Democrat John Fetterman - who lives across the street from U.S. Steel blast furnace - didn't explicitly endorse the new proposal. But he said he had helped jam up Nippon Steel's original bid until \"Nippon coughed up an extra $14B.\"\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is seen as a potential presidential candidate, had avoided publicly endorsing a deal but said this week that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about it.\n\nChris Kelly, the mayor of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel's Irvin finishing plant is located, said he was \"ecstatic\" about the deal, despite the lack of details. He said it will save thousands of jobs for his community.\n\nAssociated Press writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.","summary":"President Donald Trump told U.S. steelworkers Friday in Pennsylvania that he is going to double tariffs on foreign steel from 25% to 50%.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/president-donald-trump-tells-us-steelworkers-hes-going-double-tariffs-foreign-steel-25-50/16603738/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16603828_AP25150791190527.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/053025-wls-steel-tariffs-5p-vo-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-30 23:27:43","author":"Michelle L.

That took the crypto tokens out of its purview just weeks after President Donald Trump launched his own meme coin and saw it immediately soar in value, lifting his paper net worth by billions of dollars. \n\nPeirce told CNBC that it's a similar situation to when nonfungible tokens (NFTs) gained popularity in 2021. They weren't securities but they did rise and fall in value based on investor activity in the market. Peirce said the SEC missed an opportunity to announce publicly that the agency wasn't getting involved.\n\n\"Here was something where I saw a lot of interest in this out in the world — in meme coins — and it made sense for us to say, 'People, if you are expecting that there's SEC protection around these, you should not expect that,'\" Peirce said in an interview at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas. \"You can package almost anything into a securities transaction. But generally, it's good for people to know, I should not be looking to the SEC for protection in this area.\"\n\nIn other words, buy at your own risk. \n\nSince President Trump took office in January, the SEC has been rolling back its enforcement in crypto, taking a more industry-friendly approach to the asset class. It's a controversial strategy, as the president and his family deepen their involvement in crypto, profiting in a way that's led many Democratic lawmakers to declare a clear conflict of interest. \n\nThe $TRUMP token, 80% of which is controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliated entities, has become the centerpiece of Trump's expanding crypto empire. \n\nLike most meme coins, the token has no underlying value. But after debuting in January, just ahead of the inauguration, $TRUMP soared to a $15 billion market cap, fueled by President Trump's social media posts declaring, \"It's time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!\"\n\nWithin days, the token lost most of its value.

Not many planes have movies named for them. Any Air Force plane carrying the president is called Air Force One, though the term is usually applied to the jetliners modified for the purpose. The current aircraft are 35 years old.\n\nIn February, President Donald Trump criticized Boeing for its failure to deliver a new Air Force One that was due by 2024. In Trump’s first term, his administration agreed to the contract for the new planes. Delays and miscalculations have pushed the delivery date back and increased the contract cost by billions.\n\nAir Force One has advanced encrypted communications systems as well as defensive countermeasures that include missiles. In the early 1990s Air Force One was secretly outfitted with a directed infrared countermeasures system to defend against missiles. According to some reports, the plane can also deploy flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course.\n\nUp in the air\n\nThe jet from Qatar is much bigger and newer than the current Air Force Ones. It has been called a palace in the sky.\n\nThere are many concerns about how a plane from a foreign government could imperil both the president and national security if it is not properly inspected and rebuilt. According to NBC News, a refitting could cost $1 billion and take years to complete.\n\nThere has been talk of tapping a Defense Department discretionary fund that’s around $3 billion. But that is only a matter of debate for now.\n\nThe Qatari 747-8 is more than 18 feet longer than the current Air Force One. “Frankly, it’s much too big,” Trump told reporters during a media session in the Oval Office at the White House on Wednesday. Asked if the plane will ever serve as Air Force One, Trump said, “It is being refitted for military standard.”\n\nPricey ticket\n\nAccording to Kenneth Walsh, author of “Air Force One: A History of Presidents and Their Planes,” the cost to operate presidential aircraft in the 1950s was roughly $348 per hour. That shot up to around $1,995 per hour during Lyndon Johnson’s administration. In 2021, the Air Force disclosed it cost approximately $177,843 per flight hour to operate its two Air Force One jets.\n\nPersonnel and resources\n\nThe 89th Air Wing is the Air Force unit that operates Air Force One. Based at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, D.C., it comprises more than 1,400 personnel and handles flights, logistics and communications for the president, vice president, cabinet members, combatant commanders and other senior military and elected leaders.\n\nAs a security measure, presidential helicopter Marine One often flies in a group of as many as five identical aircraft. One carries the president while the others serve as decoys.\n\nSources: U.S. Air Force, Whitehouse.gov, Boeing, Military.com, NBC, Popular Science\n\nPhotos from the National Archives, Boeing and U.S. Air Force","summary":"Here's how much bigger the jet from Qatar is compared to the current Air Force One.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/05/30/you-might-be-surprised-by-how-old-air-force-one-is/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LDN-L-TRUMP-LAX-0125-KB2.jpg?w=1024&h=577","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-30 23:16:00","author":"Kurt Snibbe","authors":["Kurt Snibbe"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":326632740,"title":"'Make sure door remains closed': Trump teases Macron after French Prez 'smacked by wife' on plane","text":"US President Donald Trump said he spoke to Emmanuel Macron after a viral video showed the French president being shoved in the face by his wife. “He’s fine.

The president announced on Truth Social that he was firing Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, and accused her of being “a highly partisan person.”\n\n “Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am herby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery,” Trump wrote in his post. “She is a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly.” \n\n Whether the president has the authority to terminate Sajet is unclear, as the gallery runs under the purview of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n The representative for the National Portrait Gallery or the Smithsonian did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. \n\n According to her biography on the National Portrait Gallery website, Sajet was the first woman to serve as director of the Smithsonian’s art museum in Washington, D.C. Prior to that, per the bio, she was the president and CEO of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the vice president and deputy director of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the director of corporate relations at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \n\n In February, Trump’s appointed himself chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts — leading to a cascade of program and artist cancellations following the news — and a month later, the president announced his executive order to eliminate “anti-American ideology” from the Smithsonian Institution. Trump ordered that spending on exhibits or programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy” would be prohibited and directed Vice President JD Vance to lead the purge within the institution.\n\n The Smithsonian spans 21 museums and, per its website, is the world’s largest museum, education and research complex, encompassing 14 education and research centers, and the National Zoo. The National Portrait Gallery currently features an exhibition containing pictures of every US president and concludes with Kehinde Wiley’s popular 2018 painting of Barack Obama and a photo of Donald Trump, taken by Matt McClain in 2017. The succinct caption for Trump reads: “Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.

The back-and-forth injected more volatility into markets this week after several weeks of relative calm, and court observers and economists told Fox News Digital they do not expect the dust to settle any time soon. Here's what to know as this litigation continues to play out. TRUMP DENOUNCES COURT’S 'POLITICAL' TARIFF DECISION, CALLS ON SUPREME COURT TO ACT QUICKLY What's happening now? The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit temporarily stayed a lower court ruling Thursday that blocked two of Trump's sweeping tariffs from taking force. The ruling paused a decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) allowing Trump to continue to enact the 10% baseline tariff and the so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" that he announced April 2 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. It came one day after the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled unanimously to block the tariffs. Members of the three-judge panel who were appointed by Trump, former President Barack Obama and former President Ronald Reagan, ruled unanimously that Trump had overstepped his authority under IEEPA. They noted that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have \"unbounded authority\" to impose tariffs under the emergency law. Now, lawyers for the Trump administration and the plaintiffs are tasked with complying with a fast schedule with deadlines in both courts. Plaintiffs have until 5 p.m. Monday to file their response to the Court of International Trade, according to Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation of the Liberty Justice Center, which represents five small businesses that sued the administration. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit gave plaintiffs until Thursday to file a response to the stay and the Trump administration until June 9 to file a reply, Schwab told Fox News Digital in an interview. The goal is to move expeditiously, and lawyers for the plaintiffs told Fox News they plan to file briefs to both courts before the deadlines to mitigate harm to their clients. \"Hopefully,\" Schwab said, the quick action will allow the courts to issue rulings \"more quickly than they otherwise would.\" What's at stake? The Trump administration praised the stay as a victory. The appellate court stay on the CIT ruling \"is a positive development for America’s industries and workers,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country’s national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the president in the Constitution and by Congress.\" But some economists warned that continuing to pursue the steep tariffs could backfire. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS 5 TRUMP TARIFF EXECUTIVE ORDERS The bottom line for the Trump administration \"is that they need to get back to a place [where] they are using these huge reciprocal tariffs and all of that as a negotiating tactic,\" William Cline, an economist and senior fellow emeritus at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview. Cline noted that this had been the framework laid out earlier by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had embraced the tariffs as more of an opening salvo for future trade talks, including between the U.S. and China. \"I think the thing to keep in mind there is that Trump and Vance have this view that tariffs are beautiful because they will restore America's Rust Belt jobs and that they'll collect money while they're doing it, which will contribute to fiscal growth,\" said Cline, the former deputy managing director and chief economist of the Institute of International Finance. \"Those are both fantasies.\" 'AMERICAN HERO' OR 'FAILURE': ELON MUSK'S DOGE DEPARTURE DIVIDES CAPITOL HILL What happens now? Plaintiffs and the Trump administration wait. But whether that wait is a good or bad thing depends on who is asked. Economists noted that the longer the court process takes, the more uncertainty is injected into markets. This could slow economic growth and hurt consumers. For the U.S. small business owners that have sued Trump over the tariffs, it could risk potentially irreparable harm. \"Some of the harm has already taken place. And the longer it goes on, the worse it is,\" said Schwab. The White House said it will take its tariff fight to the Supreme Court if necessary. But it's unclear if the high court would choose to take up the case. The challenge comes at a time when Trump's relationship with the judiciary has come under increasing strain, which could make the high court wary to take on such a politically charged case. Lawyers for the plaintiffs described the case as \"very likely\" to be appealed to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether it will move to review it. \"It's possible that because the case is before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which essentially applies to the country, unlike specific appellate courts, which have certain districts, that the Supreme Court might be OK with whatever the Federal Circuit decides and then not take the case,\" Schwab said. For now, the burden of proof shifts to the government, which must convince the court it will suffer \"irreparable harm\" if the injunction remains in place, a high legal standard the Trump administration must meet. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Beyond that, Schwab said, the court will weigh a balancing test. If both sides claim irreparable harm, the justices will ask, \"Who is irreparably harmed more? \"And I think it's fair to say that our clients are going to be more irreparably harmed than the United States federal government. Because our clients might not exist, and the United States federal government is certainly going to exist.\"","summary":"Trump officials are back in court pushing to save the president&apos;s sweeping reciprocal tariffs.

Joni Ernst is defending the controversial \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\"\n\n While speaking at a town hall, the Iowa Republican condemned critics of the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" that passed in the House of Representatives on May 22. The bill, should it be signed into law, would introduce significant cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by implementing more requirements on possible beneficiaries.\n\n An attendee in the crowd interrupted Ernst, per The Hill, yelling that people are \"going to die\" as a result of the reforms.\n\n \"Well, we're all going to die,\" Ernst replied. Angry jeers erupted from the crowd in response, to which she replied, “For heaven’s sakes. For heaven’s sakes, folks.”\n\n Ernst then tried to regain control of the town hall and offered her explanation of the bill's benefits.\n\n “What you don’t want to do is listen to me when I say that we are going to focus on those that are most vulnerable,” she said. “Those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid, we will protect. We will protect them. Medicaid is extremely important here in the state of Iowa.”\n\n She continued, “Those that are not eligible, those that are working and have opportunity for benefits elsewhere, then they should receive those benefits elsewhere and leave those dollars for those that are eligible for Medicaid.\"\n\n Ernst added that undocumented residents \"will be coming off\" Medicaid — a sentiment partially drowned out by protests from the crowd, per The Hill. \n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n The \"Big, Beautiful Bill,\" which narrowly passed in the House in a party-line 215-214 vote, revives President Donald Trump's tax cuts from 2017; prioritizes funding for deportation and border efforts; diminishes green energy tax incentives; increases the national deficit by $3.8 trillion; and, as discussed at the town hall, puts stricter limits on who can claim benefits from Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n The bill has proved controversial already. Equipped with multiple facets to bolster government spending, the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" appeared to be a part of a rift between Trump and Elon Musk, who spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting initiatives. On May 28, Musk said he was \"disappointed to see the massive spending bill ... [which] undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\"\n\n The bill next has to pass in the Senate before Trump can sign it into law.","summary":"The bill narrowly passed in the House of Representatives in a 215-214 vote on May 22","url":"https://people.com/gop-senator-bashes-constituents-who-say-trump-big-beautiful-bill-cuts-will-kill-people-11745792","image":"https://people.com/thmb/dE4CDUcKlNgKAZgVZlRLtPhnOrk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Sen-Senator-Joni-Ernst-at-the-us-capitol-022824-466211b2fea741f9bccf7aa261d0e1e3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-30 23:10:17","author":"Rachel Raposas","authors":["Rachel Raposas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.001},{"id":326629702,"title":"California Senate Launches Paramount-Trump Settlement Talks Investigation, Invites Bill Owens and Wendy McMahon to Testify","text":"The California State Senate has launched an investigation into Paramount Global’s ongoing discussions with President Donald Trump to settle his $20 billion lawsuit against CBS.\n\nIn a Friday letter, the state’s lawmakers invited former “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and former CBS News president Wendy McMahon to testify as part of an investigation into Paramount’s settlement discussions with President Donald Trump over his $20 billion lawsuit against the program’s Oct. 7 interview with former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\n“Your recent resignations from CBS’s leadership, amid public reports of internal concern about the editorial and ethical implications of the proposed settlement, suggest that you may possess important, first-hand knowledge relevant to our legislative oversight responsibilities,” the joint letter from its Energy, Utilities & Communications committee chair Josh Becker and Judiciary committee chair Thomas Umberg states. “If Paramount is entertaining a settlement primarily to secure favorable regulatory treatment, this raises deeply troubling implications not just for journalism, but for the rule of law and the integrity of corporate governance.”\n\nThe committees are seeking information from the pair on whether newsroom staff raised internal objections to the settlement or its motivations, whether any editorial decisions were impacted or overridden, whether internal counsel or leadership acknowledged the weakness of the lawsuit’s claims and whether anyone within the company indicated that the settlement may be “advantageous or necessary” in order to influence the regulatory review of the pending $8 billion Skydance merger.\n\nThe lawmakers argue that a settlement to clear regulatory approval of the Skydance deal could constitute a violation of federal anti-bribery laws, an infraction of California’s unfair competition law, a breach of fiduciary duties owed by Paramount board members to shareholders and the misuse of corporate funds vulnerable to shareholder derivative litigation.\n\n“These issues go beyond internal policy,” the letter states. “They have real legal exposure for Paramount and its board of directors, including Ms. Shari Redstone, Ms. Barbara Byrne, Ms. Judith McHale, Ms. Linda Griego, and Ms. Susan Schuman.”\n\nThey also said it could have a “potential chilling effect” on investigative and political journalism, signaling “politically motivated lawsuits can succeed when paired with regulatory threats.”\n\n“It would damage public trust in CBS News and other California-based outlets, diminishing the state’s stature as a national leader in ethical journalism. Paramount’s capitulation would also undermine two essential pillars of a liberal democracy: a free press and an impartial, rule-of-law regulatory system,” the letter continues.\n\nThe California State Senate noted that while the invite is a voluntary request, they retain full subpoena authority under California law should additional testimony or documentation become necessary during its investigation.\n\n“We respectfully encourage you to participate in this important hearing,” the letter concluded. “Your cooperation will help safeguard the values you have each worked to uphold in your distinguished careers.”\n\nRepresentatives for Paramount declined to comment on the letter. \n\nOwens resigned from “60 Minutes” in April, telling staff in a memo that he lost the ability to make independent decisions as the network. Meanwhile, McMahon resigned earlier this month, saying in a memo to staff that “it’s become clear the company and I do not agree on the path forward.” She described the tension between herself and Paramount as “challenging.” \n\nThough neither referenced the Trump lawsuit directly, both executives had previously expressed opposition to a settlement. \n\nThe lawsuit takes aim at the news program’s Oct. 7 interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which Trump has said was deceptively edited to make her look good. \n\nCBS News has maintained that Trump’s accusations of deceitful editing were false, explaining that the promo shown on “Face the Nation” used a longer section of Harris’ answer. It also turned over the transcript and camera footage from the interview to the FCC as part of the agency’s investigation into allegations of “news distortion.” In a March filing to dismiss the Trump suit, CBS called it “an affront to the First Amendment” and “without basis in law or fact.”\n\nIn a Wednesday legal filing asking the court to deny Paramount’s motion to dismiss, Trump’s attorneys claimed that the interview caused him “mental anguish and confusion.” They also said that “viewers withheld attention from President Trump and Truth Social,” his social media platform, due to the “false advertising and tampering” tied to the Harris interview, resulting in a decrease in value for Trump Media and Technology Group and his other media holdings.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump recently shot down Paramount’s offer to settle the lawsuit for $15 million, with the president aiming to get at least $25 million and an apology.\n\nThe Paramount-Skydance merger, which is subject to regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses of Paramount’s 28 owned-and-operated local TV stations, recently triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close by April 7.\n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr has argued that the settlement talks with Trump are unrelated to the agency’s review of the Skydance deal. But he has warned that “all options remain on the table” in the agency’s ongoing investigation into alleged “news distortion,” including potentially revoking CBS’ broadcast license if the network is found to have violated the agency’s public interest standard. \n\nHe has also previously threatened to block M&A for companies who embrace diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and is reportedly seeking concessions in the Paramount-Skydance deal.\n\nParamount’s settlement talks come as Disney previously paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit Donald Trump brought against ABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos. Meta also paid $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit about being kicked off Facebook and Instagram after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.","summary":"The lawmakers argue settling the $20 billion lawsuit to clear regulatory approval of the pending $8 billion Skydance merger could violate federal anti-bribery laws and the state's unfair competition law \n\n\nThe post California Senate Launches Paramount-Trump Settlement Talks Investigation, Invites Bill Owens and Wendy McMahon to Testify appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/california-state-senate-bill-owens-wendy-mcmahon-paramount-trump-settlement-talk-investigation/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Owens-McMahon.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-30 23:06:10","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.346},{"id":326621154,"title":"Olympic champ Imane Khelif banned on the spot amid gender test furore","text":"The international federation says it is introducing the policy after the furore surrounding women’s welterweight gold medallist Imane Khelif of Algeria at the Paris Olympics last year.\n\nWorld Boxing will organise the boxing competition at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics after being granted provisional recognition by the International Olympic Committee.\n\nWorld Boxing said it had informed the Algerian Boxing Federation that Khelif would have to undergo the test if she wanted to compete at the Eindhoven Box Cup in the Netherlands on June 5-10.\n\n“In light of plans to introduce this policy and the particular circumstances surrounding some boxers that competed at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing,” World Boxing wrote in a press release.\n\nUnder the new policy, all athletes over 18 that want to participate in a World Boxing owned or sanctioned competition will need to undergo a PCR, or polymerase chain reaction genetic test, to determine what sex they were at birth and their eligibility to compete.\n\nThe PCR test is a laboratory technique used to detect specific genetic material, in this case the SRY gene, that reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex.\n\nThe test can be conducted by a nasal or mouth swab, or by taking a sample of saliva or blood.\n\nNational federations will be responsible for testing and will be required to confirm the sex of their athletes when entering them into World Boxing competitions by producing certification of their chromosomal sex, as determined by a PCR test.\n\nKhelif said in March: “As we say in Algeria, those who have nothing to hide should have no fear.\n\n“The truth became clear at the Paris Olympics — the injustice was exposed and later, the truth was acknowledged by the Olympic Committee in Paris.”\n\nKhelif then continued: “For me, I see myself as a girl, just like any other girl.

She said 43 million people in America listen to NPR programs each week. PBS estimates 36 million watch its television programs on a local broadcaster every month.The Trump administration is also moving to slash government spending drastically, firing tens of thousands of civil servants across many departments, often with little to no warning.In the news media sector this has meant the elimination of government-funded news outlets projecting outside the United States such as Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.The Defense Department has also expelled several major national news outlets from their dedicated office spaces to make way for smaller, largely conservative sites.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/05/30/public-broadcaster-sues-trump-over-funding-cut-order","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-05-30/dtd5m918/00048PJ9RB.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-30 23:03:02","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.288}]}
