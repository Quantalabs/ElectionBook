In the wake of a rapid overhaul of the EU’s regulatory process, the commission is listening.\n\nThe eye-opening Draghi report, published late last year by the former European Central Bank president, warned Europe that it was asleep at the wheel and, thus, missing out on the digital revolution and its productive gains.\n\nSince its publication, the EU has found itself in an identity crisis, with the report sending shockwaves through the union and prompting a complete overhaul of its regulatory, innovation, and competitiveness strategies in fear that the bloc will fall irrevocably behind its fellow superpowers.\n\nSince, the watershed analysis has become a cornerstone of the EU’s policy agenda, with promises of cutting red tape, endorsing AI, and simplifying laws all part of the bloc’s wider strategy to boost competitiveness and close the innovation gap.\n\nPushback from climate activists \n\nHowever, the EU’s approach has been met with significant pushback from climate activists, who argue that much of the bloc’s new agenda comes at the expense of the environment.\n\nEarlier this year, a group of more than 30 legal scholars in the EU and the UK issued a letter urging lawmakers to rethink their planned revision of environmental, social, and governance due diligence requirements.\n\nThe initial requirements were supposed to include companies’ transition plans, outlining how they would cut emissions in line with the EU’s 2050 net-zero goal, which the bloc has enshrined in law.\n\nHowever, the wording of the omnibus proposal following the Draghi report dropped the requirement obliging companies to put transition plans into effect.\n\nEU seeks to ease green rules \n\nThe EU is increasingly looking to ease green rules in a bid to match the productivity gains of its major rivals, undermining the bloc’s own 2050 net-zero targets.\n\nIts reversal of the ban on new internal combustion engine cars is just the next piece of the puzzle, but whether the stark shift in priorities even comes to bear fruit remains to be seen.\n\nLeading European eco-think tank Transport & Environment (T&E) does not believe that it will. The group says that playing for time will not make European car makers great again.\n\nAs it views it, the pullback will divert investment away from electrification at a time when European manufacturers urgently need to catch up with Chinese EV makers, adding that up to 25% fewer battery EVs would be sold in 2035 than under the current target.\n\n“The EU has chosen complexity over clarity,” said T&E executive director William Todts.\n\n“Breeding faster horses could never have halted the ascent of the automobile. \n\n Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs while China races further ahead. \n\n\"Clinging to combustion engines won’t make European automakers great again.”\n\nWhile leading car brands have welcomed the move for which they largely lobbied, not all of them are behind the shift.\n\nDiverging from its competitors, Swedish car maker Volvo called out the move.\n\n“Weakening long-term commitments for short-term gain risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for years to come,” it said.\n\n“A consistent and ambitious policy framework, as well as investments in public infrastructure, is what will deliver real benefits for customers, for the climate, and for Europe’s industrial strength.\n\n'Volvo ready to go full electric'\n\n“Volvo Cars has built a complete EV portfolio in less than 10 years and is ready to go full electric with a bridge of long-range hybrids. If we can do it, others can as well.”\n\nWhile Europe hits the brakes, China accelerates ahead. The country is continuing its rapid electrification of transport, and foreign brands are being muscled aside in the world’s biggest car market.\n\nEven in their home countries, European car makers are facing a growing competitive threat from Chinese imports, with new tariffs thrown up by the EU offering only limited protection.\n\nAs Michael Lochscheller, chief executive of Swedish EV manufacturer Polestar, notes: “Moving from a clear 100% zero-emissions target to 90% may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won’t just hurt the climate. We’ll hurt Europe’s ability to compete.”\n\nWhile European automakers, the key beneficiaries of the reversal, remain divided on the issue, the EU has made its decision for them, signalling its priorities and once again leaving climate ambitions to the wayside.\n\nWhat the EU is yet to realise, however, is that it has pitted not-so-opposing forces against each other and has failed to consider how competitiveness and sustainability can work in tandem.","summary":"The EU hits the brakes on its 2035 combustion engine ban","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-41763263.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9814/4907102_6_seoimage1x1_f94af4047c514f14beb744c1e00f6720.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 01:11:00","author":"Emer Walsh,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Emer Walsh","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":387760418,"title":"Brown attack suspect died the 2 days before his body was found, autopsy finds","text":"An autopsy determined that the man suspected in last weekend’s attack at Brown University and the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor days later had been dead for two days when his body was found, New Hampshire’s attorney general’s office said Friday\n\nAuthorities found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday night, said Providence’s police chief, Col. Oscar Perez.\n\nThe autopsy determined that Neves Valente, a Portuguese national who had been living in the U.S., died on Tuesday, the same day that his countryman, MIT professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro, died at a hospital, New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella’s office said in a statement. It didn’t note an exact time of death.\n\nAuthorities believe that after killing two students and wounding nine others last Saturday at Brown, where he was a graduate student studying physics during the 2000-01 school year, Neves Valente shot Loureiro at his Boston-area home on Monday night.\n\nInvestigators on Friday were still trying to sort out why Neves Valente allegedly opened fire on the campus decades after he dropped out and later killed Loureiro, whom he attended school with in Portugal in the 1990s.\n\nThe discovery of Neves Valente’s body at a New Hampshire storage facility ended the nearly weeklong hunt for the person who killed two students and wounded nine others in a Brown lecture hall last Saturday. Investigators believe the onetime Brown student killed Loureiro in his home in Brookline, a Boston suburb about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Providence, on Monday. Perez said as far as investigators know, Neves Valente acted alone.\n\nPortugal’s foreign minister, Paulo Rangel, said Friday that the government was taken aback by revelations that a Portuguese man is the main suspect in the mass shooting at Brown and the killing of Loureiro.\n\nRangel said Portugal has provided “very broad cooperation” in the case. He said in comments to the national news agency Lusa that “the investigation is far from over.”\n\nBrown University President Christina Paxson said while Neves Valente is a former Brown student, “he has no current affiliation with the university.”\n\nNeves Valente and Loureiro attended the same academic program at a university in Portugal between 1995 and 2000, U.S. attorney for Massachusetts Leah B. Foley said. Loureiro graduated from the physics program at Instituto Superior Técnico, Portugal’s premier engineering school, in 2000, according to his MIT faculty page. That same year, Neves Valente was let go from his temporary student support and faculty liaison position at the Lisbon university, according to an archive of a termination notice from the school’s president at the time.\n\nNeves Valente, who was born in Torres Novas, Portugal, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) north of Lisbon, had come to Brown on a student visa. He eventually obtained legal permanent resident status in September 2017, Foley said. It wasn’t immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017. His last known residence was in Miami.\n\nAfter officials revealed the suspect’s identity, President Donald Trump suspended the green card lottery program that allowed Neves Valente to stay in the United States.\n\nThere are still “a lot of unknowns” in regard to motive, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said. “We don’t know why now, why Brown, why these students and why this classroom,” he said.\n\nThe FBI previously said it knew of no links between the Rhode Island and Massachusetts shootings.\n\nPolice credited a person who had several encounters with Neves Valente for providing a crucial tip that led authorities to him.\n\nAfter police shared security video of a person of interest, the witness — known only as “John” in a Providence police affidavit — recognized him and posted his suspicions on the social media forum Reddit. Reddit users urged him to tell the FBI, and John said he did.\n\nJohn said he encountered Neves Valente about two hours before the attack in a bathroom in the engineering building, where the shooting occurred, and noticed he was wearing inappropriate clothing for the weather, according to the affidavit. Still before the attack, he saw Neves Valente suddenly turn away from a Nissan sedan when he saw John.\n\n“When you do crack it, you crack it. And that person led us to the car, which led us to the name,” Neronha said.\n\nHis tip pointed investigators to a Nissan Sentra with Florida plates. That enabled Providence police to tap into a street camera network operated in the city by surveillance company Flock Safety to track the vehicle.\n\nAfter leaving Rhode Island, Providence officials said Neves Valente stuck a Maine license plate over his rental car’s plate to help conceal his identity.\n\nInvestigators found footage of Neves Valente entering an apartment building near Loureiro’s in a Boston suburb. About an hour later, Neves Valente was seen entering the Salem, New Hampshire, storage facility where he was found dead, Foley said. He had with him a satchel and two firearms, Neronha said.\n\nLoureiro, a 47-year-old physicist and fusion scientist, joined MIT in 2016 and was named last year to lead the school’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, one of its largest laboratories. The scientist from Viseu, Portugal, had been working to explain the physics behind astronomical phenomena such as solar flares.\n\nThe two Brown students killed during a study session for final exams were 19-year-old sophomore Ella Cook, who was vice president of the Brown College Republicans, and 18-year-old freshman MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, who aspired to be a doctor.\n\nSix of those wounded were in stable condition and three had been discharged as of Thursday, officials said.\n\nAlthough Brown officials say there are 1,200 cameras on campus, the attack happened in an older part of the engineering building that has few, if any, cameras. And investigators believe the shooter entered and left through a door that faces a residential street bordering campus, which might explain why the cameras Brown does have didn’t capture footage of the person.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Barry Hatton and Helena Alves in Lisbon, Portugal, Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu, Hallie Golden in Seattle and Matt O’Brien in Providence contributed.","summary":"It didn't note an exact time of death.\n\n\nThe post Brown attack suspect died the 2 days before his body was found, autopsy finds appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/12/19/brown-attack-suspect-died-the-2-days-before-his-body-was-found-autopsy-finds/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Brown_University_Shooting_02973-69450a53656c3-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 01:00:25","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":387761084,"title":"Trump Kennedy Center: Kerry Kennedy vows to remove president’s name; Maria Shriver calls it ‘not dignified’","text":"US President Donald Trump’s name was affixed to the front of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Friday morning, irking some people, especially the Kennedy family. Kerry Kennedy, daughter of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, said she would “grab a pickax” to remove President Trump’s name from the Kennedy Center after letters spelling Trump’s name were added. “Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy posted on the social platform X. “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!” The Kennedy Center board voted to include Trump’s name on the building on Thursday, and the exterior now reads “The Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Kerry Kennedy criticised the name change as it related to her uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, saying he “proudly stood for justice, peace, equality, dignity, diversity, and compassion for those who suffer.” “President Trump stands in opposition to these values, and his name should not be placed alongside President Kennedy’s,” she wrote in a post on X. Other Kennedy family members also opposed the renaming. Maria Shriver, former President Kennedy’s niece and former first lady of California, described the change as “not dignified” and “not funny.” “It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable,” Shriver wrote on X. “It is not. Next thing perhaps he will want to rename JFK Airport, rename the Lincoln Memorial, the Trump Lincoln Memorial. The Trump Jefferson Memorial. The Trump Smithsonian. The list goes on.” Robert F. Kennedy’s grandson, former Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), questioned the legality of the new name, noting that the centre “is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law.” “It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,” he wrote on X. The centre’s interim President Richard Grenell rejected doubts over the legality of the name change, arguing on X that the board’s vote “doesn’t impact the Memorial to Kennedy set up by Congress.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Roma Daravi, the vice president of public relations at the Kennedy Center, confirmed the name change. Trump, who serves as the centre’s board chair and handpicked its members earlier this year, praised the vote, calling the board “the most distinguished people in the country” and telling reporters the centre was “in such bad shape, physically, financially, and in every other way, and now it’s very solid, very strong.” The President had teased the centre’s new name while emceeing the Kennedy Center Honors earlier this month. “The Trump Kennedy Center,” he said to the audience before adding with a grin, “Oops.”","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-kennedy-center-kerry-kennedy-vows-to-remove-presidents-name-maria-shriver-calls-it-not-dignified/articleshow/126086946.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-126087032/126087032.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 00:55:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.09},{"id":387761168,"title":"US visa panic disrupts Detty December","text":"The fear of detention at ports of entry and sudden cancellation of visas have forced some Nigerians in the United States to shelve planned trips for Detty December.\n\nThis was after US President Donald Trump imposed fresh travel restrictions on Nigerians.\n\nDetty December is a term in Nigeria referring to the festive season often marked with parties, concerts, family reunion, homecomings and celebrations.\n\nDetty, a Pidgin twist of ‘dirty,’ implies loose and wild fun.\n\nFindings by Saturday PUNCH indicate that Nigerians with valid US visas have cancelled their trips, worried that they may be denied re-entry or even removed upon arrival back in the US.\n\nThe fear, according to several persons who spoke to our correspondents, extends to long-time travellers, students and even green card holders.\n\nA visa holder said the tension surrounding the new US policy was so intense that he advised his son not to return to Nigeria for Christmas.\n\nSince its inception, the Trump administration has steadily rolled out a series of visa restrictions and travel bans targeting Nigeria and several other countries.\n\nHe has cited the need to reform the US immigration system, strengthen border security and improve the vetting of foreign nationals as justification for the decisions.\n\nThese measures, which have generated diplomatic unease and personal distress, reached a new phase with the latest proclamation signed by the US President on Tuesday.\n\nThe proclamation imposed travel restrictions on Nigerians and citizens of 16 other African countries.\n\nAccording to the White House, holders of the B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M and J visas are barred from entering the United States from January 1, 2026.\n\nThe visa categories cover business and tourist travel, as well as students and exchange visitors, effectively affecting a broad spectrum of Nigerians.\n\nBeyond security concerns, the US government also cited what it described as a high rate of visa overstays by Nigerian nationals as part of the justification for the restrictions.\n\nNigerians in US defer travel\n\nSome Nigerians resident in the US said they decided against travelling home for Detty December because of associated risks.\n\nA Nigerian contesting for a council seat in District 4 of Prince George’s County Council, Dr Juliet Agocha, said travelling home under the current climate could endanger her political ambitions.\n\nShe said, “It would pose a significant political risk for me to travel to Nigeria while actively running for the 2026 election. More than 18,000 Nigerian immigrants could be impacted by the Trump visa ban, and nobody wants to take unnecessary chances at this point.”\n\nSimilarly, a doctoral candidate and microbiologist at Indiana University noted that many Nigerian students had abandoned plans to travel home for the holidays.\n\nHe explained that many students had already completed extensive academic documentation as early as December 1, and travelling to Nigeria for Detty December could undo months of preparation.\n\n“There is panic everywhere, especially among students. People are worried that if they leave the US now, the Trump administration might block them from coming back,” the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAccording to him, some students had already called relatives in Nigeria to inform them that they would not be coming home as planned.\n\n“It’s painful, but many feel it’s the safer option,” he added.\n\nAnother Nigerian student in Kansas, who also did not want to be identified, echoed similar sentiments.\n\nHe said, “Coming to Nigeria now is like telling him (Trump) that you’ve completed your programme. Even though I hold a valid visa, re-entry might be challenging. I feel he has something against Nigeria.”\n\nA doctoral student at Ohio University, Dolapo Oyedoku, said prospective students planning to resume studies in January 2026 might face significant challenges entering the US.\n\nAccording to Oyedoku, while the restrictions may not directly invalidate existing visas, they could result in increased denials and stricter scrutiny across all visa categories.\n\n“At the point of entry, students may face intense questioning and additional scrutiny,” he said.\n\nNigerians shelve US trips\n\nIn the wake of Tuesday’s proclamation, Saturday PUNCH gathered that fear of revocation and detention also affected many Nigerians who already hold valid US visas.\n\nSeveral individuals said they were unwilling to risk the emotional and financial trauma of being turned back at the US border or detained by immigration authorities.\n\nAn entrepreneur with about two years of validity remaining on his US visa said he had cancelled a trip scheduled for February 2026.\n\nThe Osogbo, Osun State-based businessman said the uncertainty surrounding the new rules made the journey too risky to attempt.\n\n“I was supposed to visit Maryland in February next year, but I’m not going again,” he said. “I can’t take chances with what Trump is doing with visas. It’s better to wait and see how everything settles.”\n\nThe entrepreneur also recounted the experience of a close family member that reinforced his fears.\n\nAccording to him, his aunt, who departed Nigeria on Tuesday for Houston, Texas, was detained on arrival at the airport despite holding a US green card and being a regular traveller between Nigeria and the United States.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, he said, “My aunt left Lagos on Monday and got to Houston on Tuesday. She was detained immediately on arrival, even though she has a green card and travels often. As I’m speaking with you today (Thursday), she is still with Customs at the airport. They haven’t allowed her to go. If this can happen to a green card holder, then no Nigerian is safe under this visa regime.”\n\nHe added that the prospect of being turned back or detained was too traumatic to contemplate.\n\n“I can’t imagine spending all that money on tickets, only to be embarrassed and deported at the border. I will travel when the dust around this visa restriction settles,” he said.\n\nA Nigerian-born US citizen, however, suggested that some of the difficulties faced by green card holders at ports of entry could be linked to unresolved legal issues.\n\nHe said, “I am aware that some green card holders are having problems re-entering the US after travelling abroad. In many cases, before Trump’s visa rules, some of them may have had minor criminal issues that were overlooked because of the privileges attached to holding a green card.”\n\nAccording to him, the new enforcement posture means that past infractions, even those committed decades earlier, could now be scrutinised.\n\n“With the new visa rules, anybody with a green card—especially Africans with any criminal record—will face challenges. They will be made to answer for those crimes, even if they happened 20 years ago. That is why some people are having issues with Customs and Immigration officers at airports.”\n\nHe also alleged that the policy had political undertones. “Trump’s visa policies are targeted at blacks. He believes we always support the Democrats. For him, this is political,” he said.\n\nAnother US visa holder based in Lagos told Saturday PUNCH that he had also shelved plans to visit the United States in January.\n\n“Mr Trump is unpredictable,” he said. “Even if you have a valid visa today, it can be revoked tomorrow. What if I buy a ticket and suddenly receive a message that my visa has been cancelled? Who will refund my money?”\n\nHe added that the fear extended to family members already in the US.\n\n“I have told my son, who wanted to come home to Nigeria for Christmas, to cancel his trip. Nobody knows what could happen. He could come home now and be denied entry back into the US, or have his visa revoked. We have to look at this logically,” he said.\n\nUS varsities suspend admission offers\n\nMeanwhile, uncertainty about future access to student visas has prompted some universities to suspend admission offers.\n\nIn a post via his X handle, Dr Oludayo Sokunbi, a Canada-based Nigerian running a consultancy firm, Japa Consults, said someone from his platform who had got a fully-funded master’s scholarship in the US received an email to defer his admission to 2027.\n\nHe shared an email which he claimed the student received.\n\nIt read, “The White House issued an updated proclamation on Tuesday, December 16, 2025, that included updated restrictions on several countries from entering the United States. This order becomes effective at 12:01am. Eastern Daylight Time on Jan. 1, 2026.\n\n“I am here to assure you that Arizona State University remains strongly committed to you. We believe that nothing should hinder your academic journey and goals. We are a problem-solving team, ready to help you find your next best step so you can keep moving forward with your education. Our commitment to our global mission, our ideals and to you is unwavering.\n\n“While you are no longer eligible to start the in-person MGM in Fall 2026, we are excited to offer you two options for how to move forward. The first option is to have your MGM application considered for Fall 2027 instead, with the hope that the travel ban will be lifted by then.”\n\nOne @SamzyVG, equally shared a post from another varsity which withdraw admission offer to a student.\n\nSeveral other users shared similar experiences.\n\n‘Visa restrictions unfortunate’\n\nReacting to the development, the Chief Executive Officer of Cardinal E-School and Edu Services, Sulaimon Okewole, described the visa restrictions as an “unfortunate development” with far-reaching consequences.\n\nAccording to Okewole, the policy was not merely a security measure but an action that could sever professional ties, disrupt academic aspirations and signal rejection to an entire nation. “This restriction may fracture families, stifle opportunity and pour diplomatic contempt on a relationship built over centuries on mutual respect and shared enterprise,” he said.\n\nHe warned that the move threatened to punish talent and ambition that contributed to progress in both Nigeria and the United States. “The United States, a nation of immigrants, is building a needless wall—not of brick, but of bureaucratic spite—and this diminishes us all. I hope this decision is reversed as quickly as possible,” Okewole said.\n\nHe advised Nigerians affected by the ban to explore alternative destinations such as Canada and the United Kingdom, which he said remained more welcoming to international students and professionals.\n\nA Nigerian student preparing for a 2026 resumption in the United States, who identified himself only as Olayomi, said the ban had come at a particularly painful time.\n\nAccording to him, many Nigerian students had already secured admission into US universities and paid non-refundable fees.\n\n“I have paid deposits and joined several meetings in preparation for the 2026 academic year,” he said. “What should those of us who have paid deposits and are awaiting visa interviews do? We also paid application fees that schools will not refund.”\n\nOlayomi appealed for a reversal of the policy.\n\n“This decision could truncate our dreams. It is disheartening,” he said.\n\nOffering a diplomatic perspective, a former Nigerian Ambassador to the Philippines, Yemi Farounbi, said the visa policy appeared designed to pressure the Nigerian government rather than address genuine security concerns.\n\n“Ideally, President Trump wanted to execute his plan based on what he called genocide,” Farounbi said. “It was supposed to target those in government, collaborators or security officials considered ineffective.”\n\nAccording to him, the expansion of the policy to cover all Nigerians, including students and innocent travellers, suggested a loss of focus.\n\n“When this is extended to everyone, including young people who only want to advance their education, then it is no longer targeted. At that point, it becomes counterproductive,” he said.\n\nA retired ambassador, Mabdul Mohammed, said visa issuance is based on the trust that visitors will abide by the laws of their host countries.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria’s security status continues to influence Washington’s decisions.\n\n“As long as Nigeria’s status remains as a Country of Particular Concern, the US authorities will continue to enforce these restrictions. The only way out is for Nigeria to intensify the fight against acts of terrorism, banditry and other forms of criminal violence.\n\n“Until it is decimated to a minimum level, it will convince the US to remove Nigeria from the list and lift the restrictions,” Mohammed said.\n\nAlso, a foreign affairs analyst, Charles Onunaiju, said Nigerians should brace for more difficulties in engagements with the United States under Trump’s administration.\n\n“Nigerians should be ready at all times for pushback, especially under Trump’s administration.

She worried what her teachers would think or if she would lose friends over her convictions. But she said something changed when Charlie Kirk was assassinated in September, and she started crying in her classroom at Indiana University while other students cheered and clapped.\n\n“We can’t be silenced,” Glover decided.\n\nNow she’s visiting Phoenix with her parents and brothers for this year’s Turning Point USA conference, the first to take place since Kirk’s death. Although the organization became a political phenomenon with its masculine appeals to college men, it’s also been expanding outreach to young women like Glover. The shift is poised to accelerate now that Turning Point is led by Erika Kirk, Charlie’s widow, who has embraced her new role at the helm of a conservative juggernaut with chapters across the country.\n\nIf successful, the organization that helped return President Donald Trump to the White House could narrow a gender divide that has been a persistent challenge for Republicans. Turning Point offers a blend of traditional values, such as encouraging women to prioritize marriage over careers, and health trends that have become popular online.\n\nOn Friday, young women lined up for selfies with wellness influencer Alex Clark while vendors sold health products and Trump merchandise. One of Clark’s fans had a “Make America Pro-Life Again” hat and “MAHA red” lipgloss, a reference to the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda pushed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Another attendee sported a “grass-fed conservative” pin on her lanyard.\n\nGlover, 18, said discovering Turning Point in high school gave her an appreciation for dialogue when she felt like an outcast for her beliefs, such as being anti-abortion. At her first conference, she feels like she’s found a political and cultural home for herself.\n\n“They want to promote a strong independent woman who does hold these values and can go stand up for herself,” she said. “But it’s also OK to do it in heels, put some makeup on, wear a dress.”\n\n‘If Erika can do it, I can do it’\n\nOne of Glover’s classmates, Stella Ross, said she stumbled upon Charlie Kirk on TikTok in the months before the last presidential election.\n\nShe already felt like her perspectives were being treated differently on campus and thought she was receiving unfairly low grades in her political science classes. A devout Catholic, Ross said she was inspired by how Charlie Kirk wasn’t afraid to weave his evangelical faith into his political arguments.\n\nShe also noticed how many women posted comments of appreciation on Erika Kirk’s videos, and she joined Indiana University’s Turning Point chapter in the same month that Trump won his comeback campaign.\n\n“I was like, wow, if Erika can do it, I can do it,” Ross said.\n\nRoss has career aspirations of her own — she interns with Indiana’s Republican Party and aspires to be a press secretary for a governor or president. But she hopes to have flexibility in her job to be fully present with her children and believes that a traditional nuclear structure — man, woman and their children — is “God’s plan.”\n\nWhen she thinks of Erika Kirk, “it’s really cool to see that she can live out that balance and it makes me feel like that could be a more realistic future for me because I’m seeing it firsthand.”\n\nA new messenger\n\nErika Kirk often appeared alongside with her husband at Turning Point events. A former beauty pageant winner who has worked as a model, actress and casting director, she also founded a Christian clothing line and a ministry that teaches about the Bible.\n\nIn a recent interview with The New York Times, she said she had fully bought into “boss babe” culture before Charlie showed her a “healthier” perspective on life. Now she leads the multimillion-dollar organization, which she said at a memorial for her husband would be made “10 times greater through the power of his memory.”\n\nThe political gap between young men and women has been growing for years, according to a recent Gallup analysis. Not only have women under 30 become more likely to identify as ideologically liberal, they’ve also embraced liberal views on issues such as abortion, the environment and gun laws.\n\nThe schism was clearly apparent in the last presidential election, where 57% of male voters under 30 supported Trump, compared to only 41% of women under 30, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nTurning Point has been working to change that, hosting events like the Young Women’s Leadership Summit and urging attendees to embrace traditional family values and gender roles.\n\nCharlie Kirk said earlier this year that if a young woman’s priority is to find a husband, she should go to college for a “MRS degree.” Matthew Boedy, a professor of rhetoric at University of North Georgia, said Erika Kirk could be a more effective messenger because she was focused on her career before meeting her husband.\n\n“I do think her story resonates more because she tried it out and can tell them it is not for them,” he said.\n\nSome conservative women are turned off by this approach. Raquel Debono, an influencer who lives in New York City, described the event as a “Stepford wives conference,” featuring women in pink floral dresses.\n\nShe said Turning Point’s emphasis on being traditional wives “leaves out a lot of women who work,” she said, “and I think they’re going to lose all those voters, honestly, in the next election cycle if they keep it up.”\n\nDebono founded her own organization, Make America Hot Again, where she throws parties intended to make voters feel welcomed into the conservative movement and allow them to get to know people who share their politics.\n\n‘Big time’ growth for some chapters\n\nAubree Hudson had been president of Turning Point’s chapter at Brigham Young University for only two weeks when she visited nearby Utah Valley University for an event with Charlie Kirk.\n\nShe said she was standing only about six feet away when he was fatally shot. She ran to find her husband, who was at the back of the crowd, and they fled to her car.\n\nHudson, 22, is from a rural farm town in southwestern Colorado. Her conservative convictions are rooted in her family’s faith and patriotism. A copy of the U.S. Constitution hangs in her parents’ home, and her father taught her to value God, family and country, in that order. Her mother stayed at home, telling her children that “you guys are my career.”\n\nSince Kirk’s assassination, Hudson said the number of people — particularly women — getting involved with the organization jumped “big time.”\n\nEmma Paskett, 18, is one of them. She was planning to attend the Utah Valley University event after one of her classes, but Kirk was shot before she made it there.\n\nAlthough she wasn’t very familiar with Turning Point before that point, Paskett said she started watching videos of Kirk later that night.\n\nPaskett considers Erika Kirk to be a “one in a million” role model, and her role as a leader was a driving factor in signing up.\n\n“That’s exactly what I want to be like,” she said.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/young-conservative-women-find-a-home-in-turning-point-with-charlie-kirks-widow-at-the-helm/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Turning-Point-Women-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 00:28:52","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.353},{"id":387758554,"title":"Voters may be rethinking everything: 2028 US Presidential polls reveal a stunning shift","text":"AP2028 US Presidential polls\n\nUS Presidential 2028 polls: The 2028 US presidential election may still be years away, but early polling suggests voters are already challenging long-held assumptions about who could lead the next race for the White House.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez vs JD Vance: A Close 2028 MatchupA recent poll by The Argument/Verasight shows Democratic Rep.

Some of the material was already made public, but other documents are \"very likely to have never seen the light of day before,\" CNN reported.

US President Donald Trump signed into law legislation passed by Congress in November that mandates the release of all non-exempt information from the files by December 19, CNN reported.\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act required the Department of Justice to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by today. At around 4 pm (local time), the Justice Department released some of the documents.The massive trove includes thousands of apparently never-before-released documents along with thousands of files that were already public from various court cases and public records requests. DOJ disclosures, court records, public records requests, and congressional releases were among the documents released, according to CNN.Several previously unreleased photographs of former President Bill Clinton with Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, were released.The DOJ's redactions of the files are extensive, and the reasons for them extend beyond what the law requires. In some cases, entire pages are redacted. To comply with the law, several redactions had to be made, according to the DOJ. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said, \"any material that contained personally identifiable information of victims, child sexual abuse materials, classified national defence or foreign policy information, or would jeopardise an active investigation.\" Among the thousands of documents released as part of the Epstein files is a photo of pop icon Michael Jackson standing next to Epstein. The two are seen standing in front of a painting of what appears to be a naked woman. It is unclear when or where the photo was taken.Another photo released shows President Bill Clinton with his arm around Jackson. A woman whose identity is redacted and Supreme's singer Diana Ross are to their right. Epstein is not pictured, as per CNN.Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Multiple underage girls, many of them high school students, would later tell police Epstein hired them to give sexual massages.\n\nMay 2006: Palm Beach police officials sign paperwork to charge Epstein with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor, but the county’s top prosecutor, State Attorney Barry Krischer, takes the unusual step of sending the case to a grand jury.\n\nJuly 2006: Epstein is arrested after a grand jury indicts him on a count of soliciting prostitution. The relatively minor charge upsets Palm Beach police leaders, who publicly accuse Krischer of giving Epstein special treatment. The FBI begins an investigation.\n\n2007: Federal prosecutors prepare an indictment, but for a year Epstein’s lawyers engage in talks with the U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, about a deal that would avoid a federal prosecution. Epstein’s lawyers decry his accusers as unreliable.\n\nSecret deal leads to a light jail term\n\nJune 2008: Epstein pleads guilty to state charges: one count of soliciting prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. He is sentenced to 18 months in jail. Under a secret arrangement, the U.S. attorney’s office agrees not to prosecute Epstein for federal crimes. Epstein serves most of his sentence in a work release program that allows him to leave jail during the day.\n\nMay 2009: One of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, files a lawsuit claiming Epstein and Maxwell arranged for her to have sexual encounters with “royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen” and others. The lawsuit doesn’t name the men.\n\nJuly 2009: Epstein is released from jail. For the next decade, Epstein’s accusers wage a legal fight to get his federal non-prosecution agreement voided.\n\nNews media and lawsuits keep public interest high\n\nMarch 2, 2011: The Daily Mail publishes an interview with Giuffre in which she describes traveling with Epstein to London at age 17 and spending a night dancing with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, then known as Prince Andrew. The story and a photo of the prince with his arm around Giuffre creates a crisis for the royal family. FBI agents subsequently interview Giuffre.\n\nDec. 30, 2014: Giuffre’s lawyers file court papers claiming she had sexual encounters with Mountbatten-Windsor and other men, including “foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” All those men deny the allegations.\n\nNovember 2018: The Miami Herald revisits the handling of Epstein’s case in a series of stories focusing partly on the role of Acosta — who by this point is President Donald Trump’s labor secretary. The coverage intensifies public interest in Epstein.\n\nNew York prosecutors revive case\n\nJuly 6, 2019: Epstein is arrested on sex trafficking charges after federal prosecutors in New York conclude they aren’t bound by the terms of the earlier non-prosecution deal. Days later, Acosta resigns as labor secretary.\n\nAug. 10, 2019: Epstein kills himself in his jail cell in New York.\n\nJuly 2, 2020: Federal prosecutors in New York charge Maxwell with sex crimes, saying she helped recruit and abuse Epstein’s victims.\n\nDec. 30, 2021: After a monthlong trial, a jury convicts Maxwell of sex trafficking and other crimes.\n\nJune 28, 2022: Maxwell is sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nJanuary, 2024: Public interest in the Epstein case surges again after a judge makes more court records public in a related lawsuit. Conspiracy theories flourish, pushed by people who believe Epstein ran an international sex traffic network that served rich and powerful men.\n\nA new president and a fresh political crisis\n\nJan. 20, 2025: Trump, who was friends and neighbors with Epstein for years, becomes president again. During his 2024 campaign, he had suggested that he’d seek to open more government files on Epstein.\n\nFebruary 2025: Attorney General Pam Bondi suggests in a Fox News Channel interview that an Epstein “client list” is sitting on her desk. The Justice Department distributes binders marked “declassified” to far-right influencers, but much of the information had long been public.\n\nApril 25, 2025: Giuffre dies by suicide.\n\nJuly 7, 2025: The Justice Department says Epstein didn’t maintain a “client list” and it won’t make any more files related to his sex trafficking investigation public.\n\nJuly 15, 2025: Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., introduce the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nJuly 17, 2025: The Wall Street Journal describes a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album for Epstein’s 50th birthday. Trump denies writing the letter and sues the newspaper.\n\nJuly 24-25, 2025: In an effort to put a political crisis to rest, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviews Maxwell. She denies wrongdoing and says she never saw Trump involved in any sexually inappropriate activity. Afterward, she is moved from a low-security prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas.\n\nA prince loses his royal title\n\nOct. 21, 2025: Giuffre’s posthumous memoir is published. In it, she revisits her claims that Epstein and Maxwell sexually trafficked her to powerful men, including Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nOct. 30, 2025: King Charles III strips Mountbatten-Windsor of his remaining titles, meaning he can no longer be referred to as “prince,” and evicts him from his royal residence.\n\nNov. 12, 2025: A House committee releases a trove of email correspondence between Epstein and others, including Mountbatten-Windsor, Trump ally Steve Bannon, ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. In one 2019 email to a journalist, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls” but didn’t explain what he meant by that.\n\nNov. 14, 2025: At Trump’s urging, Bondi announces that the U.S. attorney in Manhattan will investigate Epstein’s ties to some of the Republican president’s political foes, including former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat; Summers; and Hoffman, a prominent Democratic donor. None of those men has been accused of misconduct by Epstein’s victims.\n\nNov. 18, 2025: Congress passes the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Trump signs it into law the next day.\n\nDec. 19, 2025: The Justice Department begins releasing records.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of Jeffrey Epstein at https://apnews.com/hub/jeffrey-epstein.","summary":"The release is the culmination of a yearslong fight over the records.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/19/epstein-files-timeline/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Justice_Department_Jeffrey_Epstein_19646-1.jpg?w=1024&h=726","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 00:08:13","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.057},{"id":387759886,"title":"Five key takeaways from US Secretary of State Rubio’s year-end briefing  - Puerto Rico Tribune – Daily","text":"Top diplomat Marco Rubio has laid out foreign policy priorities under United States President Donald Trump, saying that the administration is focused on advancing Washington’s interests across the world.\n\nIn a two-hour briefing to reporters on Friday, the US secretary of state reiterated Trump’s hard line against Venezuela and defended cuts to foreign aid programmes.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, also expressed outrage against “mass migration” into the US, echoing Trump’s own stance.\n\nIn addition to his diplomatic duties, Rubio also serves as White House national security adviser and the chief of the now-gutted US Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the secretary of state’s wide-ranging media briefing:\n\nMaduro cannot be trusted\n\nRubio suggested that further talks with Venezuela would be futile because President Nicolas Maduro cannot be trusted to live up to his commitments.\n\n“He’s never kept any of the deals he’s made in the past, which makes it difficult to consider making one in the future,” Rubio said of Maduro.\n\nThe top US diplomat kept hammering accusations that Maduro has used the Venezuelan government to lead a campaign of narcotics trafficking and “terrorism”.\n\nTrump has made similar allegations himself, accusing the Venezuelan president of masterminding a flood of drugs and criminals into the US.\n\nHe has also portrayed Maduro as a cartel leader, in charge of groups like the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Those assertions, however, have been contradicted by the US intelligence community, which found no evidence Maduro controls the gang.\n\nOn Friday, Rubio said the US is working with governments in the Western Hemisphere to ensure stability in the Caribbean region. But Venezuela, he underscored, is an outlier.\n\n“There’s one place that doesn’t cooperate, and it’s the illegitimate regime in Venezuela. Not only do they not cooperate with us, they openly cooperate with terrorist and criminal elements,” he said.\n\n“For example, they invite Hezbollah and Iran to operate from their territory.”\n\nTrump’s allies have accused Maduro of forging ties with Hezbollah, but the US has not provided evidence that the Lebanese group, which was weakened by last year’s war with Israel, is operating in the South American country.\n\nRubio’s comments come as the US continues to amass troops and military assets around Venezuela, raising speculation about plans to topple Maduro by force.\n\nTrump has also announced an oil blockade on Caracas as he and his top aides continue to falsely claim that Venezuela’s oil belongs to the US.\n\nRubio was asked on Friday how he would square Trump’s self-image as a peacemaker with the escalating military threats to Venezuela.\n\n“We reserve the right — and have the right — to utilise every element of national power to defend the national interest of the United States,” Rubio said. “And no one can dispute that. Every country in the world reserves the same option. We just simply have more power than some of them.”\n\nUkraine ‘not our war’\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine — which has been raging since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 — was also a key topic in Friday’s news conference.\n\nRubio explained that the Trump administration is trying to gauge what Russia and Ukraine are able to accept in order to help reach a peace deal, but he emphasised that the conflict is not a top priority for Washington.\n\n“It’s not our war. It’s a war on another continent,” he said.\n\nBut Rubio insisted that only the US can bring about a peace agreement in Ukraine.\n\n“What we’re trying to figure out here is: What can Ukraine live with and what can Russia live with? Sort of identify what both sides’ positions are, and see if we can sort of drive them towards each other to some agreement,” Rubio said.\n\n“If you were to ask [for] prioritisation, I would argue that something in our hemisphere for our national interest is more important than something in another continent,” he said. “But it doesn’t make Ukraine and Russia unimportant. We care about it. That’s why we’re involved in it.”\n\nWhile campaigning for re-election in 2024, Trump had pledged to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of reclaiming the presidency.\n\nHe has since had to walk back those remarks, but the Republican leader has maintained an active role in peace negotiations, even hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin for an Alaska meeting in August.\n\nTrump has lobbied to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on ending world conflicts.\n\nUS pressing to finalise Gaza phase one\n\nRubio also stressed on Friday that Washington is pushing to complete phase one of the truce in Gaza, so the second stage can begin.\n\nThe three elements Rubio highlighted were setting up a Palestinian technocratic committee to help govern Gaza, establishing the foreign-led “Board of Peace”, and deploying an international policing force to the territory.\n\n“This is something we’re aiming at very soon. It’s what we’re focused on right now like a laser,” he said.\n\n“No one is arguing that the status quo is sustainable in the long term, nor desirable, and that’s why we have a sense of urgency about bringing phase one to its full completion.”\n\n“Once we’ve established that, we have a lot of confidence that we are going to have the donors for the reconstruction effort and for all the humanitarian support in the long-term, building of phases two and phases three.”\n\nThe US is currently hosting talks with officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye to discuss moving to the next stage.\n\nSince the Trump-brokered ceasefire in October, Israel has killed 395 people in Gaza, including an average of two children a day. On Friday, Israeli forces targeted a wedding gathering, killing at least six people and wounding many others.\n\nIsrael has also refused to allow an adequate amount of aid into the territory and blocked the entry of temporary homes, despite the fact that displaced people’s tents have flooded amid harsh winter weather.\n\nAl Jazeera asked Rubio about Israel’s violations, but the US secretary of state failed to address the premise of the question. Instead, he stressed that work to ensure peace in Gaza is ongoing.\n\n“This is the hard work of diplomacy and peacemaking. Peacemaking isn’t just signing a piece of paper; it’s actually complying with it,” he said. “And compliance oftentimes, in most cases, requires daily, constant follow-up and nurturing.”\n\nCooperation with China\n\nAs a senator, Rubio was a China hawk. But on Friday, he struck a softer tone when he spoke about relations with Beijing, underscoring the need for cooperation despite bilateral tensions.\n\n“I think I’ve been nice to China,” Rubio said jokingly. He added that the US has made “good progress” with China.\n\n“If there’s a global challenge that China and the US can work together on, I mean, we can solve it,” he told reporters. “And there’ll be points of tension. We recognise that our job is to balance these two things.

Those assertions, however, have been contradicted by the US intelligence community, which found no evidence Maduro controls the gang.\n\nOn Friday, Rubio said the US is working with governments in the Western Hemisphere to ensure stability in the Caribbean region. But Venezuela, he underscored, is an outlier.\n\n“There’s one place that doesn’t cooperate, and it’s the illegitimate regime in Venezuela. Not only do they not cooperate with us, they openly cooperate with terrorist and criminal elements,” he said.\n\n“For example, they invite Hezbollah and Iran to operate from their territory.”\n\nTrump’s allies have accused Maduro of forging ties with Hezbollah, but the US has not provided evidence that the Lebanese group, which was weakened by last year’s war with Israel, is operating in the South American country.\n\nRubio’s comments come as the US continues to amass troops and military assets around Venezuela, raising speculation about plans to topple Maduro by force.\n\nTrump has also announced an oil blockade on Caracas as he and his top aides continue to falsely claim that Venezuela’s oil belongs to the US.\n\nRubio was asked on Friday how he would square Trump’s self-image as a peacemaker with the escalating military threats to Venezuela.\n\n“We reserve the right — and have the right — to utilise every element of national power to defend the national interest of the United States,” Rubio said. “And no one can dispute that. Every country in the world reserves the same option. We just simply have more power than some of them.”\n\nUkraine ‘not our war’\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine — which has been raging since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 — was also a key topic in Friday’s news conference.\n\nRubio explained that the Trump administration is trying to gauge what Russia and Ukraine are able to accept in order to help reach a peace deal, but he emphasised that the conflict is not a top priority for Washington.\n\n“It’s not our war. It’s a war on another continent,” he said.\n\nBut Rubio insisted that only the US can bring about a peace agreement in Ukraine.\n\n“What we’re trying to figure out here is: What can Ukraine live with and what can Russia live with? Sort of identify what both sides’ positions are, and see if we can sort of drive them towards each other to some agreement,” Rubio said.\n\n“If you were to ask [for] prioritisation, I would argue that something in our hemisphere for our national interest is more important than something in another continent,” he said. “But it doesn’t make Ukraine and Russia unimportant. We care about it. That’s why we’re involved in it.”\n\nWhile campaigning for re-election in 2024, Trump had pledged to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of reclaiming the presidency.\n\nHe has since had to walk back those remarks, but the Republican leader has maintained an active role in peace negotiations, even hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin for an Alaska meeting in August.\n\nTrump has lobbied to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on ending world conflicts.\n\nUS pressing to finalise Gaza phase one\n\nRubio also stressed on Friday that Washington is pushing to complete phase one of the truce in Gaza, so the second stage can begin.\n\nThe three elements Rubio highlighted were setting up a Palestinian technocratic committee to help govern Gaza, establishing the foreign-led “Board of Peace”, and deploying an international policing force to the territory.\n\n“This is something we’re aiming at very soon. It’s what we’re focused on right now like a laser,” he said.\n\n“No one is arguing that the status quo is sustainable in the long term, nor desirable, and that’s why we have a sense of urgency about bringing phase one to its full completion.”\n\n“Once we’ve established that, we have a lot of confidence that we are going to have the donors for the reconstruction effort and for all the humanitarian support in the long-term, building of phases two and phases three.”\n\nThe US is currently hosting talks with officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye to discuss moving to the next stage.\n\nSince the Trump-brokered ceasefire in October, Israel has killed 395 people in Gaza, including an average of two children a day. On Friday, Israeli forces targeted a wedding gathering, killing at least six people and wounding many others.\n\nIsrael has also refused to allow an adequate amount of aid into the territory and blocked the entry of temporary homes, despite the fact that displaced people’s tents have flooded amid harsh winter weather.\n\nAl Jazeera asked Rubio about Israel’s violations, but the US secretary of state failed to address the premise of the question. Instead, he stressed that work to ensure peace in Gaza is ongoing.\n\n“This is the hard work of diplomacy and peacemaking. Peacemaking isn’t just signing a piece of paper; it’s actually complying with it,” he said. “And compliance oftentimes, in most cases, requires daily, constant follow-up and nurturing.”\n\nCooperation with China\n\nAs a senator, Rubio was a China hawk. But on Friday, he struck a softer tone when he spoke about relations with Beijing, underscoring the need for cooperation despite bilateral tensions.\n\n“I think I’ve been nice to China,” Rubio said jokingly. He added that the US has made “good progress” with China.\n\n“If there’s a global challenge that China and the US can work together on, I mean, we can solve it,” he told reporters. “And there’ll be points of tension. We recognise that our job is to balance these two things. I think both sides understand that.”\n\nAfter an escalating trade war early in Trump’s second term, the US and China reached a one-year deal in November to freeze tariffs and resolve other issues.\n\nFor nearly a decade, US officials have described the global competition with Beijing as their most pressing foreign policy issue.\n\nBut in recent months, Trump has turned his attention to the Americas, appearing to de-prioritise the rivalry with China.\n\nCommitment to NATO\n\nThe Trump administration has been blasting Europe and its leaders over their migration policies and the regulations of the European Union, but Rubio reasserted the US commitment to NATO military alliance on Friday.\n\nHe suggested that NATO’s common defence, as spelled out in Article Five of the alliance treaty, would deter any Russian military campaign beyond Ukraine.\n\n“It’s why we remain in NATO,” he said. “That’s why we’re in this alliance, and that’s why Article Five in the NATO alliance is important.”\n\nThe only request the US has of its fellow NATO allies, Rubio added, is that they increase their military spending.\n\nTrump has sought to raise the minimum defence spending for members of the alliance to five percent of each country’s gross domestic product (GDP), but some countries, most notably Spain, have pushed for greater flexibility in their military budgets.\n\nEuropean allies in NATO have also expressed concern about Trump’s commitment to the military alliance, citing ambiguous statements he has made in the past about the Article Five commitment. But Rubio sought to put those worries to rest.\n\n“We’re committed to the alliance. And our commitment isn’t just rhetorical,” Rubio said. “Our commitment is action, in the troops that have been deployed and the monies that have been spent and the capabilities that are located in the cooperation.”","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/five-key-takeaways-from-us-secretary-of-state-rubios-year-end-briefing/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-19T164045Z_1383729569_RC2SJIAA3018_RTRMADP_3_USA-DIPLOMACY-RUBIO-1766176808-Yis1eg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 00:06:00","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":387758552,"title":"Stock market today: S&amp;P 500, Dow, Nasdaq rise as AI stocks rebound – here's why Oracle, Nvidia, and Micron led gains","text":"TIMESOFINDIA.COMUS stock market today\n\nS&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq today: US stocks climbed on Friday as investors regained confidence in the artificial intelligence sector, with Oracle leading the charge following a major deal involving TikTok.US Stock Market Today: S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Ended HigherThe Nasdaq Composite rose 1.31% to close at 23,307.62, while the S&P 500 gained 0.88%, ending the day at 6,834.50.

Complying would mean releasing all of the files about Jeffrey Epstein, President Donald Trump’s longtime pal, by Friday But Blanche dares ask: what if we just don’t?\n\n“I expect that we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today. I expect that we’re going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand, and then over the next couple of weeks,” Blanche said. “I expect several hundred thousand more.”\n\nThe law set a deadline for releasing all the files. Friday. Not the deadline to start to release and then roll it out over several weeks. Not the deadline to “expect” to release. Friday. All of them. Friday. Instead, we got some half-assed DOJ website with an impossible-to-navigate structure and no information as to how much has already been released and how much the DOJ still has left to try to read through and figure out a way to limit any damage to Trump. \n\nBut per Blanche, the delay is because they are just so gosh-darned worried about protecting Epstein’s victims. “There’s a lot of eyes looking at these, and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials that we’re producing, that we’re protecting every single victim.”\n\nThis excuse might land better if Blanche’s boss, Attorney General Pam Bondi, hadn’t bragged back in February about how she very sternly requested all the Epstein documents for her review. Or talked about how she was ready to review the Epstein client list sitting on her desk right away, only to later backtrack and say there was no such thing. Or if the DOJ hadn’t announced back on July 7 that it had finished its “exhaustive review of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\nIf any of these things were actually true, these documents would have been reviewed multiple times, making a last-minute scramble to determine where victims’ names appeared and get them redacted unnecessary. \n\nAnd it’s not like the administration didn’t know this was coming. Sure, they worked night and day to stop the release, and sure, House Speaker Mike Johnson basically shut down the House of Representatives to lend a hand, but given that the public pressure on this has been unrelenting for months, the DOJ could have been reviewing and redacting all along. \n\nUnfortunately, when the administration thumbs its nose at yet another law, what on earth would be the recourse? Congress was barely able to get it together to pass a law requiring the release. The United States Supreme Court seems very willing to agree that if Trump doesn’t want to follow laws, he doesn’t have to. \n\nRelated | Epstein kept photos of Trump, young women, and sex toys\n\nHowever, the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are smartly playing the long game here, releasing material in bits and pieces with no fixed schedule. Keep that threat hanging over the heads of Trump and the DOJ, House Democrats. \n\nBlanche and Bondi aren’t in their roles to execute the laws, they are there to protect Trump. And if that means breaking the law, they don’t care.","summary":"Well, we got our Friday Epstein Files news dump. Sort of. \n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice did indeed post some files.

Many of the images are heavily redacted, in line with legal requirements to remove information that could identify potential victims or contain child sexual abuse material.\n\nThe Justice Department included a prominent warning on the website hosting the files, stating that \"all reasonable efforts\" had been made to review and redact personal information related to victims and other private individuals. However, it cautioned that due to the volume of material, some sensitive or non-public information could appear inadvertently. The department also warned that parts of the collection contain descriptions of sexual assault and may not be suitable for all readers.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether Friday's disclosure represents a complete release of all materials held by the department or only a portion, with officials signaling that additional documents could follow.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said earlier that the release would involve \"several hundred thousand\" records, adding that more files could be published in the coming weeks. That timeline has drawn scrutiny, as the law requires the department to disclose all records in its possession by December 19. Some materials remain exempt from disclosure, including records tied to active investigations, documents that could identify victims, and any images depicting abuse, death, or injury.\n\nThe release follows months of political pressure and public controversy surrounding the Epstein case, which has resurfaced repeatedly since Epstein's death in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.

But the president has made it a priority to be a peacemaker. And so you've seen us engaged, whether it's Russia, Ukraine, or India and Pakistan, or Thailand and Cambodia, which is an ongoing challenge, or the tragedy we see now in Sudan, or the potential for further strife in South Sudan, and that's falling apart. We are always looking for opportunities, if possible, to serve as mediators that help prevent war or end conflicts. And obviously, in many of these cases, you can get people to the table and agree, and then there's the implementation process,' he said.\n\nRubio defended the Trump administration's strict immigration policies, stating it's a sovereign decision to ensure the country's safety and security. \n\n'The US remains one of the most generous countries in the world...but we do have a right, like every sovereign country does, to know who you are...We have a right to make sure you're not going to come to this country and impose a burden on our social safety network,' he said.\n\nHe also pointed out Trump's focus on Venezuela's drug trafficking, calling it a significant threat to the US.\n\n'Until US President Donald Trump started doing something about these narcotrafficking links, nobody disputed that Maduro and his regime were in cahoots with narcotraffickers -- not to mention the fact that they unleashed Tren de Aragua... That's what Trump has been focused on,' he said.\n\n'The single most serious threat to the United States from the Western Hemisphere is from transnational terrorist criminal groups, primarily focused on narcotrafficking... There's one place that doesn't cooperate -- and it's the illegitimate regime in Venezuela,' added Rubio.\n\nHe emphasised the need for Hamas to be disarmed for Middle East peace and the US's role in mediating international conflicts, prioritising national interests, and stressed that peace won't prevail if Hamas attack Israel.\n\n'Everyone wants peace... If Hamas is ever in a position in the future that they can threaten or attack Israel, you're not gonna have peace. You're not gonna convince anyone to invest money in Gaza if they believe another war is going to happen in 2-3 years,' said Rubio.\n\nHe emphasised the US's unique position to mediate the Russia-Ukraine war, prioritising national interests in its foreign policy.\n\nRubio said, 'It's not our war... but there's only one entity on Earth that can actually talk to both sides and figure out whether there's a way to end this war peacefully, and that's the United States.'\n\nRubio said that US foreign policy was aimed at serving its national interests.\n\n'The core principle behind our foreign policy needs to be our national interests... We are in favour of foreign policies that will make America safer, or stronger, or more prosperous -- hopefully all three, but at least one of those,' he said.

This is not the beginning of a war -- it is a declaration of vengeance. The United States of America, under President Trump's leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people.'\n\n'As we said directly following the savage attack, if you target Americans -- anywhere in the world -- you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you. Today, we hunted, and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,' he added.\n\nTrump warned in a post on Truth Social that the terrorists will be hit harder than they have ever been.\n\n'Because of ISIS's vicious killing of brave American Patriots in Syria, whose beautiful souls I welcomed home to American soil earlier this week in a very dignified ceremony, I am hereby announcing that the United States is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible. We are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated.'\n\n'The Government of Syria, led by a man who is working very hard to bring Greatness back to Syria, and is fully in support. All terrorists who are evil enough to attack Americans are hereby warned -- YOU WILL BE HIT HARDER THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN HIT BEFORE IF YOU, IN ANY WAY, ATTACK OR THREATEN THE U.S.A,' he added.\n\n'Operation Hawkeye,' a reference to the fact that the two US soldiers killed were from the 'Hawkeye State' of Iowa, the strikes hit dozens of targets the military connected to ISIS -- including infrastructure and weapons storage sites across Syria, one of the officials told CNN.\n\nThe two US service members killed in Syria were identified this week as Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, Iowa. They were killed while engaging hostile forces in Palmyra, Syria, the US Army said. Both soldiers were assigned to the Iowa National Guard's 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division.\n\nThree additional Iowa National Guard members were wounded in the attack and evacuated for further medical treatment.

The DOJ is releasing a massive tranche of new documents that the Biden and Obama administrations refused to release. The story here: the Trump administration is providing levels of transparency that prior administrations never even contemplated. The initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.'\n\n'I expect that we're going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,' Blanche said. 'There's a lot of eyes looking at these and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials we are producing, that we are protecting every single victim.'\n\nThe delay indicates the White House is in apparent conflict with a law US President Donald Trump signed in November that mandated the wholesale release of all non-exempt Epstein information within 30 days, according to Politico.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined a request to expand on Blanche's comments, saying they speak for themselves, as per Politico.\n\n'President Trump signed that law 30 days ago,' Blanche told Fox News. 'And we have been working tirelessly since that day to make sure that we get every single document that we have within the Department of Justice, review it and get it to the American public.'\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for Thomas Massie (R-Ky) -- who led the successful discharge petition effort to trigger eventual passage of the law -- pointed to a video on X on Thursday where he indicated he'd know whether the administration had met his disclosure standards. Following conversations with lawyers for Epstein's victims, he believes the FBI has at least 20 names of men who are accused of committing sex crimes.\n\n'If we get a large production on December 19, and it does not contain a single name of any male who is accused of a sex crime or sex trafficking or rape or any of these things, then we know they haven't produced all the documents,' he said. 'It's that simple.'\n\nRo Khanna (D-California), who partnered with Massie to push the discharge petition, said in a statement that 'if DOJ is producing real documents of interest that are not overly redacted, and if they are clear about a timeline for full production, then that is a positive step.'

Kennedy, Jr. is reportedly planning on making significant changes to recommendations for childhood vaccines, even as the country’s worst measles outbreak in 30 years continues to fester.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post and The New York Times, HHS plans to stop recommending most childhood vaccines as Kennedy, a well-known vaccine skeptic, seeks to align the U.S. immunization schedule with Denmark’s. Danish public health officials, however, say the two countries can’t be compared because of different health needs and the fact that Denmark has universal health care.\n\nIt’s unclear which vaccines could potentially be affected.\n\nThe proposed changes come as measles — a disease for which there is a very effective vaccine and which was eradicated from the U.S. in 2000 — spreads, with a particular uptick in South Carolina.\n\nThere were 144 cases in the state as of Friday, mostly among unvaccinated school children, according to the South Carolina Department of Public Health. Another 224 people are in quarantine because they’ve been exposed and four are in isolation because they are contagious. \n\nThere have been 1,958 confirmed cases of measles this year, the largest outbreak since 1991, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two unvaccinated children in Texas and one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico have died from the disease.\n\nKennedy has remained mostly quiet about the worsening situation.\n\nPublic health experts have long advised that the best way to protect yourself and your children from measles — a potentially deadly infectious disease that can cause rash and fever — is to get vaccinated.\n\nBut as anti-vaccine rhetoric has spread throughout the country in recent years, so have cases of measles. Vaccine rates are on the decline. Nationwide, 92.5% of kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella during the 2024-2025 school year. The rate needs to be 95% in order to slow transmission. \n\nTypically, the federal government plays a crucial role in ending epidemics with public campaigns about vaccination and federal funding to states experiencing outbreaks. \n\nWhen a measles outbreak between 1989 and 1991 left 55,000 people infected and more than 100 people dead, the CDC embarked on a publicity campaign to encourage people to get vaccinated. In response to the outbreak, Congress created the Vaccine for Children program in 1993, which provided free vaccines to low-income children.\n\nDuring a 2015 outbreak, Thomas Frieden, who was the CDC director during the Obama administration, publicly called for vaccination. He wrote an op-ed and appeared on television, urging parents to get their children vaccinated and to check their own status. \n\nAnd although experts warn that silence from officials can spread misinformation even further, putting lives at risk, it’s hard to imagine the Trump administration, or even Congress, embarking on public health initiatives of that sort.\n\nThe CDC is tracking reported measles cases in South Carolina and across the country, but has not launched a broad public effort to encourage vaccines.\n\n“Secretary Kennedy has been very clear that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles,” HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told HuffPost when asked if the agency would be making any public statements about the situation in South Carolina. “Any attempts to spin this are baseless. Individuals should consult with their health care provider on what is best for them.”\n\nHilliard also said she was not concerned that the measles outbreak in South Carolina would rival that in Texas. \n\n“CDC is not currently concerned that this will develop into a large, long-running outbreak as was seen in Texas earlier this year and whose outbreak has been declared over,” she said in an emailed statement to HuffPost.\n\nWhen measles began circulating in Texas in January, Kennedy did say that infected people should get vaccinated, but he also pushed unproven treatments like vitamin A, which left some Texas patients with liver damage.\n\nKennedy has a long history of spreading skepticism about vaccines. He was the chair of the Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine organization that promoted false claims about immunizations from 2015 until 2023.

Kennedy, Jr. is reportedly planning on making significant changes to recommendations for childhood vaccines, even as the country’s worst measles outbreak in 30 years continues to fester.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post and The New York Times, HHS plans to stop recommending most childhood vaccines as Kennedy, a well-known vaccine skeptic, seeks to align the U.S. immunization schedule with Denmark’s. Danish public health officials, however, say the two countries can’t be compared because of different health needs and the fact that Denmark has universal health care.\n\nIt’s unclear which vaccines could potentially be affected.\n\nThe proposed changes come as measles — a disease for which there is a very effective vaccine and which was eradicated from the U.S. in 2000 — spreads, with a particular uptick in South Carolina.\n\nThere were 144 cases in the state as of Friday, mostly among unvaccinated school children, according to the South Carolina Department of Public Health. Another 224 people are in quarantine because they’ve been exposed and four are in isolation because they are contagious. \n\nThere have been 1,958 confirmed cases of measles this year, the largest outbreak since 1991, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two unvaccinated children in Texas and one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico have died from the disease.\n\nKennedy has remained mostly quiet about the worsening situation.\n\nPublic health experts have long advised that the best way to protect yourself and your children from measles — a potentially deadly infectious disease that can cause rash and fever — is to get vaccinated.\n\nBut as anti-vaccine rhetoric has spread throughout the country in recent years, so have cases of measles. Vaccine rates are on the decline. Nationwide, 92.5% of kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella during the 2024-2025 school year. The rate needs to be 95% in order to slow transmission. \n\nTypically, the federal government plays a crucial role in ending epidemics with public campaigns about vaccination and federal funding to states experiencing outbreaks. \n\nWhen a measles outbreak between 1989 and 1991 left 55,000 people infected and more than 100 people dead, the CDC embarked on a publicity campaign to encourage people to get vaccinated. In response to the outbreak, Congress created the Vaccine for Children program in 1993, which provided free vaccines to low-income children.\n\nDuring a 2015 outbreak, Thomas Frieden, who was the CDC director during the Obama administration, publicly called for vaccination. He wrote an op-ed and appeared on television, urging parents to get their children vaccinated and to check their own status. \n\nAnd although experts warn that silence from officials can spread misinformation even further, putting lives at risk, it’s hard to imagine the Trump administration, or even Congress, embarking on public health initiatives of that sort.\n\nThe CDC is tracking reported measles cases in South Carolina and across the country, but has not launched a broad public effort to encourage vaccines.\n\n“Secretary Kennedy has been very clear that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles,” HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told HuffPost when asked if the agency would be making any public statements about the situation in South Carolina. “Any attempts to spin this are baseless. Individuals should consult with their health care provider on what is best for them.”\n\nHilliard also said she was not concerned that the measles outbreak in South Carolina would rival that in Texas. \n\n“CDC is not currently concerned that this will develop into a large, long-running outbreak as was seen in Texas earlier this year and whose outbreak has been declared over,” she said in an emailed statement to HuffPost.\n\nWhen measles began circulating in Texas in January, Kennedy did say that infected people should get vaccinated, but he also pushed unproven treatments like vitamin A, which left some Texas patients with liver damage.\n\nKennedy has a long history of spreading skepticism about vaccines. He was the chair of the Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine organization that promoted false claims about immunizations from 2015 until 2023. Kennedy went to Samoa, a remote island country in the Pacific Ocean, in 2019 to campaign against the measles vaccine. The country’s officials had suspended their program after two infants were killed when nurses prepared the vaccine incorrectly. The country suffered from a measles outbreak the following year. \n\nWhen Donald Trump nominated him to be HHS secretary, he pledged to let him “go wild” with implementing health policies related to food, medicine, and even promoting baseless claims about links between vaccines and chronic disease.\n\nKennedy’s promotion of a potentially dangerous remedy is a symbol of the anti-vaccine sentiment coming from the upper echelons of government.\n\nIn September, he fired CDC director Susan Monarez, and she alleged that he did so because she declined to sign off on an unscientific vaccine policy. \n\nEarlier this month, the Advisory Committee on Immunizations and Practices, which is now stacked with vaccine skeptics, voted to stop recommending the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, causing public health experts to warn that infection rates among children could go up.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-anti-vaccine_n_6945ca49e4b00a59b4a6adab?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6945cafe19000067377f4b02.jpeg?cache=xAceqZLdNa&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 23:55:13","author":"Nathalie Baptiste","authors":["Nathalie Baptiste"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":387755688,"title":"Operation Hawkeye: US Launches Airstrikes In Syria, Days After Deadly ISIS Ambush Killed American Soldiers","text":"The United States launched major airstrikes against Islamic State positions in Syria on Friday, following a deadly attack that killed two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter on December 13 in Palmyra. The strikes came hours after President Donald Trump vowed a strong response, aiming to eliminate ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites used in planning and carrying out attacks.,American fighter jets, attack helicopters, and artillery targeted multiple locations across central Syria, including suspected weapons storage facilities, supply points, and operational buildings, according to a US official. The goal was to disrupt the Islamic State’s networks and reduce the group’s ability to threaten US forces and their partners in the region.,,US President Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to announce a forceful response to the deadly attack on American soldiers in Syria. ,Trump wrote, “Because of ISIS’s vicious killing of brave American Patriots in Syria, whose beautiful souls I welcomed home to American soil earlier this week in a very dignified ceremony, I am hereby announcing that the United States is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible.”, ,He continued, “We are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated. The Government of Syria, led by a man who is working very hard to bring Greatness back to Syria, and is fully in support.”,Trump also issued a stern warning to terrorist groups, saying, “All terrorists who are evil enough to attack Americans are hereby warned — YOU WILL BE HIT HARDER THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN HIT BEFORE IF YOU, IN ANY WAY, ATTACK OR THREATEN THE U.S.A.”,What US War Secretary Pete Hegseth Said,The airstrikes were a direct response to the ambush in Palmyra, where an attacker targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces. The assailant was shot dead on the spot. Three other US soldiers were wounded during the incident. US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth described the operation as “Operation Hawkeye Strike”. ,READ ALSO | Why Are US Troops in Syria's Palmyra?

The United States of America, under President Trump’s leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people. As we said directly following the savage attack, if you target Americans — anywhere in the world — you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you. Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue.”, ,US And Syria Military Operations,The US maintains a military presence in Syria to prevent the Islamic State from regaining strength. While the group no longer controls large territories, it operates through sleeper cells and small units capable of deadly attacks. In 2024, the Pentagon’s Central Command reported that ISIS inspired at least 11 plots or attacks on U.S. targets. Recent operations detained 119 insurgents and killed 14., ,In November, US and Syrian forces destroyed more than 15 ISIS weapons caches in southern Syria, including over 130 mortars and rockets, multiple rifles, machine guns, anti-tank mines, and materials for improvised explosive devices. Following the Palmyra attack, partner forces carried out 10 assaults on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. ,(With inputs from agencies),Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"US Strikes ISIS Targets in Syria: American fighter jets, attack helicopters, and artillery targeted multiple locations across central Syria","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/us-launches-retaliatory-airstrikes-in-syria-after-isis-ambush-kills-two-american-soldiers-article-153319882","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153319942,thumbsize-421868,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153319942.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 23:53:54","author":"Dimple Singh","authors":["Dimple Singh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":387758626,"title":"Is winter warmer in Sacramento than it was 50 years ago? What the science says","text":"Heather Fargo, a former Sacramento mayor, was in her senior year at UC Davis in 1975. Though she wasn’t a skier, she recalled that snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains was always “reliable” in those days.\n\n“There was never a time when there wasn’t snow for people to ski in during the winter,” Fargo said. The snow did not melt as quickly as it does today, she added.\n\n“It was just very predictable. It was reliable. And things started getting less reliable.”\n\nHer observation reflects today’s reality of global warming, as Sacramento’s average winter monthly temperatures have risen over the past 50 years.\n\nA small rise with big consequences\n\nThe Sacramento area recorded a high of 60 degrees and a low of 31 on Dec. 19, 1975, according to the National Weather Service. Fifty years later, the forecast high for Dec. 19, 2025, is 55 with a low of 51.\n\nWhile the high temperature sits at the 55-degree normal mark, Friday’s low far exceeds the normal low of 38 for December 19.\n\n“You have to be a little careful when you’re looking at single (temperatures) comparing two years because some years are warmer than others, just because of nature,” said Eugene Cordero, meteorology and climate science professor at San Jose State University.\n\nAverage winter temperatures in Sacramento have risen by about 2 degrees over the last 50 years. And the significance of comparing the two periods lies in that long-term warming trend driven by climate change, he said.\n\n“If the temperatures continue to rise like they are, we could basically lose most of our snow pack by the end of the century,” Cordero added.\n\nAcross the western United States, including Northern California, snowpack has declined at most monitoring sites over several decades.\n\nFrom 1955 to 2020, April snowpack measurements, which reflect how much snow has accumulated during winter, showed decreases at about 86% of sites in the western U.S., with the most pronounced declines in Washington, Oregon, Northern California and the northern Rockies, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA’s California Institute for Water Resources, said snow historically accumulated most reliably at elevations above 4,000 to 6,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada, where temperatures often hovered near freezing and where a lot of California’s major watersheds are.\n\n‘Lowest snow pack’ recorded at this time of year\n\nToday, those same mid-elevation zones are warmer by a few degrees.\n\n“It can result in very large decreases in snow right around where that historic snow line once was. We see that with lower snowpack in the Sierra Nevada on average than we used to have, (and) a later seasonal onset of snow accumulation,” Swain said.\n\n“This December is the most dramatic version of that we’ve ever seen. This is the lowest snow pack we’ve ever recorded for the central and northern Sierra as of this December 18 date.”\n\nAnd the impacts of declining snowpack hit California’s water supply directly.\n\nCalifornia’s water system is designed with the assumption that much of the state’s winter precipitation in the mountains will fall as snow, storing water until it gradually melts in spring and summer, Swain explained. That snowpack acts like a natural reservoir, releasing water slowly and replenishing rivers and reservoirs during the dry season.\n\nEven a small temperature increase can shift precipitation from snow to rain, and when precipitation falls as rain instead of snow, water runs off more quickly and is harder to capture and store for later use.\n\n“It also affects ecosystems. The forests, for example, evolved and grew where they did, because there was snow on the ground through the spring and sometimes into the early summer as it melted,” Swain added.\n\n“So you’ve got this watering snow pack that would constantly replenish moisture in the soil and keep those plants growing, and that can also affect wildfire risk.”\n\nState climate action under federal pressure\n\nRising temperatures are a global phenomenon, most scientists agree, driven by greenhouse gases emitted worldwide. Carbon dioxide accounted for nearly 80% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, according to the EPA.\n\nTo counter the trend, California has set its own statewide goals, including reaching carbon neutrality by 2045. But those efforts have faced federal pushback, including when President Donald Trump moved to overturn California’s authority to enforce some of its vehicle emissions standards earlier this year.\n\n“Right now, the U.S. government is not a leader in this field, which is a shame, because it’s an economic opportunity to supply (green) technology and innovation across the world,” Cordero said. “China is now going to become the leader in that area — which is OK, but the U.S. might like to have that leadership, too.”\n\nMeanwhile, additional warming is inevitable in the coming decades driven by continued global greenhouse gas emissions, Swain said.\n\nThough the pace of future warming depends on political and economic decisions that influence emissions levels, the world is still releasing record amounts of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, making further temperature increases unavoidable in the decades to come.\n\n“In fact, the warming we see moving forward may even be faster than the warming we’ve seen so far,” Swain continued, adding that the warming over the last 15 years in California has been greater than the warming in the 15 years prior to that.\n\n“For better or for worse, it’s something we do need to take seriously, because it is not just that warming we’ve already seen will persist, but that there will be additional warming on top of it to come.”","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article313846640.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/pggblm/picture313847517/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_JUMP-PHOTO_2_1_UJQE8LO7_L893040331.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 23:52:42","author":"Chaewon Chung","authors":["Chaewon Chung"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":387752950,"title":"Trump Signs EO for Moon & Mars Missions—Experts Link Move to China's Space Ambitions","text":"President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order on 18 December 2025 that commits the United States to landing astronauts on the Moon by 2028 and establishing initial groundwork for a permanent lunar presence by 2030, while laying strategic foundations for future Mars missions.The order—titled Ensuring American Space Superiority— marks the most significant shift in US space policy in decades and is widely seen as a direct response to China's rapidly advancing space ambitions.Bold Space Goals With a Competitive EdgeThe executive order underscores a renewed focus on America's position in space, especially as China eyes its own crewed lunar landing by 2030. Officials framed the policy as essential to ensure that the US 'leads the world in space exploration, security, and commerce.'Trump's directive calls not only for returning humans to the Moon but also for deploying nuclear reactors on the lunar surface and in orbit to support long‑term habitation and scientific operations — technology seen as critical to sustained presence on the Moon and future missions to Mars.Experts point out that focusing on lunar infrastructure will help test crucial systems necessary for Mars exploration, such as power generation and habitat sustainability.China's space programme has made no secret of its intent to establish a significant presence on the Moon, with autonomous missions already scouting sites and planning crewed expeditions later in the decade.NASA Leadership and Strategic PrioritiesJust days before the order was signed, the US Senate confirmed private astronaut Jared Isaacman—a billionaire advocate of Mars missions—as NASA's new administrator. Backed by SpaceX's Elon Musk, Isaacman's leadership signals a stronger emphasis on commercial partnerships to help achieve these ambitious goals.At his confirmation hearing, he stressed the urgency of beating China to the Moon: 'America will return to the Moon before our great rival, and we will establish an enduring presence' — a statement that reflects the competitive framing of current US space policy.Policy analysts note that the order also reorganises how space decisions are made at the federal level, shifting greater coordination to the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy.This reflects Trump's desire for tightly integrated civilian, commercial and defence efforts to advance space objectives. Critics, however, warn that streamlining agencies could sideline some expert voices in favour of political priorities.Lunar Infrastructure: Power, Science and CommerceA standout feature of Trump's directive is the emphasis on nuclear power systems for lunar operations. These reactors are intended not just for basic life support but as long‑term energy sources that could sustain habitats, research labs, and resource extraction sites.Industry experts argue that reliable power beyond solar panels, which fail during the Moon's lengthy nights, is a technological game‑changer.Advanced small modular reactors could provide continuous energy, supporting everything from communications to propulsion systems.The emphasis on nuclear power also reflects geopolitical considerations: being first to deploy advanced energy infrastructure on the Moon could offer strategic leverage over rival nations.Geopolitical Implications and the Space RaceThis latest policy move has clear geopolitical overtones. Political analysts describe the directive as a 21st‑century space race reminiscent of Cold War competition, with China and the U.S. vying for strategic dominance off Earth.The ambition to build a lunar base, coupled with plans to push toward Mars, reflects a broader competition for technological leadership, national prestige and economic opportunity.As nations invest in lunar and Martian capabilities, the direction of human exploration in the solar system may be shaped as much by rivalry as by discovery. And the next decade could prove decisive in determining who leads humanity's next giant leap.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-signs-eo-moon-mars-missionsexperts-link-move-chinas-space-ambitions-1764325","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1774935/donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=93c46b6475c8cfee18143d30aa9eb4a9","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 23:52:38","author":"Marty Vergel Baes","authors":["Marty Vergel Baes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.266},{"id":387755040,"title":"Head of group suing over White House ballroom says she trusts Trump-picked chairman to do his job","text":"The president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation said Friday she trusts the Trump-appointed chairman of a federal planning commission to do his job and give serious review to President Donald Trump’s proposal to add a ballroom to the White House. Carol Quillen said in an interview that she takes Will Scharf, chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, “at his word” after he said at the panel's December meeting that the review process would be handled seriously and deliberately once the White House submits the plans. Scharf said at that meeting that he expected to receive the plans sometime this month, and the panel's review process would happen at a “normal and deliberative pace.” Quillen said she trusted that would be the case. “I take him at his word that the process will be conducted as it always is, deliberately and seriously, and that the commission will do its job,\" she said. The White House has not responded to multiple queries about when the ballroom plans will be shared with Scharf’s panel as well as the Commission of Fine Arts. The capital planning commission on Friday released the agenda for its January meeting and the “East Wing Modernization Project” is listed for an “information presentation,” often the first step in its review of a project. The National Trust last week asked a federal court to halt the ballroom construction until it is subjected to multiple independent reviews and public comment and wins approval from Congress. The government argued in court that the lawsuit was premature. A federal judge this week denied the National Trust's request for a temporary restraining order but scheduled a January hearing on its motion for a preliminary injunction. Such a step would halt all construction until the reviews, which could take months, are completed. Quillen said her private nonprofit organization was not asking for the Republican president's ballroom proposal to go through reviews for the sake of doing so. She said the process inevitably leads to a better project because multiple independent parties will have commented on it, she said. The National Trust was chartered in part to ensure the public gets to have a say in decisions that affect the country's historic resources, she said, “and the White House is arguably the nation's most iconic building.” When Trump was president the first time, his administration participated in the process and submitted plans to the National Capital Planning Commission for new fencing for the White House perimeter and a tennis pavilion on the south grounds. Quillen declined to speculate on why Trump had not already done so for a White House ballroom he has long desired and has moved quickly to build since he returned to office. He complains regularly that the East Room and State Dining Room — two of the largest public spaces in the White House — are too small and has criticized the practice of hosting foreign leaders at state dinners in tents on the south grounds. Trump has proposed building a 90,000-square-foot ballroom, big enough to accommodate 999 people, where the East Wing of the White House stood for decades before he had it torn down in October in a move that “caught us by surprise,” Quillen said. He recently upped the construction cost estimate to $400 million, double the original $200 million price, and has said no public money will pay for it. The White House has said the ballroom will be ready before Trump's term ends in January 2029. The National Trust asserted in its lawsuit that the ballroom plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action. The lawsuit notes that the organization wrote to those entities and the National Park Service, which oversees the White House grounds, on Oct. 21, after the East Wing demolition began, asking for the projects to be paused and for the administration to comply with federal law. It received no response, the lawsuit said. The government said in its written response to the lawsuit that the ballroom plans have not been finalized despite continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction, which is not expected to begin until April 2026, at the earliest. The administration also argued that Trump has authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to statutes cited by the National Trust.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/head-of-group-suing-over-white-house-ballroom-says-she-trusts-trump-picked-chairman-to-do-his-job-10429665/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/12/US-3-19.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 23:50:53","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.119},{"id":387757106,"title":"US launches 'massive' strike on IS in Syria","text":"The U.S. has announced that its military conducted a massive strike against the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria, in retaliation for a deadly attack on American forces in the country.\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Operation Hawkeye Strike was aimed at eliminating IS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites, News.Az reports, citing BBC.\nFighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery hit multiple targets in central Syria, US officials told CBS.

Another U.S. official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations, said more strikes should be expected.\n\nThe attack was conducted using F-15 Eagle jets, A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft and AH-64 Apache helicopters, the officials said. F-16 fighter jets from Jordan and HIMARS rocket artillery also were used, one official said.\n\n“This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance. The United States of America, under President Trump’s leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people,” Hegseth said on social media.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had pledged “very serious retaliation” after the shooting in the Syrian desert last Saturday that killed two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian interpreter. He blamed IS for their deaths. The troops were among hundreds of U.S. troops deployed in eastern Syria as part of a coalition fighting IS.\n\nThe attack was a major test for the warming ties between the United States and Syria since the ouster of autocratic leader Bashar Assad a year ago. Trump has stressed that Syria was fighting alongside U.S. troops and said Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa was “extremely angry and disturbed by this attack,” which came as the U.S. military is expanding its cooperation with Syrian security forces.\n\nSyrian state television reported that strikes hit targets in rural areas of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa provinces and in the Jabal al-Amour area near Palmyra. It said they targeted “weapons storage sites and headquarters used by ISIS as launching points for its operations in the region.”\n\nWhite House officials noted that Trump had made clear that retaliation was coming.\n\n“President Trump told the world that the United States would retaliate for the killing of our heroes by ISIS in Syria, and he is delivering on that promise,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement.\n\nTrump this week met privately with the families of the slain Americans at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware before he joined top military officials and other dignitaries on the tarmac for the dignified transfer, a solemn and largely silent ritual honoring U.S. service members killed in action.\n\nThe guardsmen killed in Syria on Saturday were Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, according to the U.S. Army. Ayad Mansoor Sakat, of Macomb, Michigan, a U.S. civilian working as an interpreter, was also killed.\n\nThe shooting nearly a week ago near the historic city of Palmyra also wounded three other U.S. troops as well as members of Syria’s security forces, and the gunman was killed. The assailant had joined Syria’s internal security forces as a base security guard two months ago and recently was reassigned because of suspicions that he might be affiliated with IS, Interior Ministry spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba has said.\n\nThe man stormed a meeting between U.S. and Syrian security officials who were having lunch together and opened fire after clashing with Syrian guards.\n\nWhen asked for further information, the Pentagon referred AP to Hegseth’s social media post.\n\nAssociated Press writer Abby Sewell in Beirut, Lebanon, contributed.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pete-hegseth-operation-in-syria-aims-to-eliminate-isis-fighters-after-americans-killed-ambush_n_6945dfc9e4b00a59b4a6b251?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6945e0152600000641837979.jpeg?cache=qt2qfT1o2D&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 23:46:04","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":387755702,"title":"DOJ Website Down?

In another, he was shown swimming with Epstein’s convicted madam Ghislaine Maxwell and a woman whose face was redacted.\n\nThere was also a photo showing the former US president and Epstein close together; and one showing Clinton with his arm around Michael Jackson. \n\nAnother photo showed Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, lying across row of women with Maxwell smiling in the background.\n\nMORE: ‘Big allure’: Secret MJ homes reveal sad life\n\nMr Trump, once a close friend of Epstein, fought for months to prevent the release of the records related to the investigation of Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. \n\nThe Republican president eventually caved to pressure from Congress, including from his own party, and signed a law last month compelling publication of the materials. \n\nSome of the documents were heavily redacted, however, with one file in Data Set 4 - 100 pages total - entirely blacked out. \n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law that prompted the DOJ to release the files, allows the Justice Department to withhold certain information such as the personal information of victims and materials that would jeopardise an active federal investigation. \n\nWithin 15 days of the files’ release, The Attorney General is required to give a summary of the redactions and their legal basis. \n\nInvestigators travelled to Sydney, files show\n\nFBI agents travelled to Sydney to interview a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in a “child prostitution” case, thousands of newly released files show.\n\nThe FBI records said the victim was 14 at the time and “could identify several other women that were underage and had engaged in sexual situations” with Epstein.\n\n“EPSTEIN is believed to have manipulated underage girls from local high schools to perform massages and sexual acts at his residence,” the files said.\n\n“The victims were usually recruited by other underage females and after performing various acts were paid sums of money in the $200-$1000.”\n\nHigh-profile Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre moved to Australia to start a new life around 2007. She died by suicide in April at the age of 41.\n\nMORE: Staggering wealth of MJ’s kids exposed\n\nHundreds of thousands of files released\n\nFriday was the deadline set by Congress for release of the records. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, in an interview with “Fox and Friends,” said several hundred thousand documents would be released on Friday and several hundred thousand more in the coming weeks. \n\nProsecutors have the latitude to withhold material related to active investigations and Blanche said the files will also be painstakingly redacted to protect the identities of Epstein’s hundreds of victims. \n\nHe said “no new charges” were imminent in a scandal that continues to shock America.\n\nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the partial release, saying “the Trump administration had 30 days to release ALL the Epstein files, not just some.” \n\n“This is nothing more than a cover up to protect Donald Trump from his ugly past,” Schumer said in a statement. \n\n‘Democrat hoax’ \n\nFor Trump, the moment carries enormous personal and political sensitivity. The president was once a close friend of Epstein, moving in the same Palm Beach and New York social circles in the 1990s and appearing together at parties for years. Trump severed ties with Epstein years before the 2019 arrest and is not accused of wrongdoing in the case. \n\nBut his right-wing base has long been obsessed by the Epstein saga and conspiracy theories that the financier oversaw a sex trafficking ring for the world’s elite. \n\nRunning for the White House, Trump promised to release all the files. However, after returning to office, Trump dismissed the push for transparency as a “Democrat hoax.” Trump’s FBI and Justice Department triggered a political furor in July with a memo stating that there would be no further disclosures of evidence from the Epstein probe. \n\nThe memo said there was “no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions” or had a “client list.” Trump then fought Congress over its drive to get the records out in public, only relenting in the face of a populist revolt. \n\nGhislaine Maxwell\n\nEpstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell is the only person convicted in connection with Epstein, even if Trump’s MAGA supporters have for years believed that “deep state” elites are protecting a Who’s Who of Democratic politicians and Hollywood figures. \n\nMaxwell, 63, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein, whose death was ruled a suicide. \n\nFor the public and victims, the release of the files marks the clearest opportunity yet to shed light on the scandal.\n\nThe newly released records could clarify how Epstein operated, who assisted him and why prosecutors stalled for years before bringing charges against him.\n\n– with the NY Post\n\nOriginally published as Half-naked Clinton in explosive Epstein pics as thousands of new files released","url":"https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/world/doj-set-to-release-several-hundred-thousand-jeffrey-epstein-files-today/news-story/e898d3df715c36653abf5d42630e1cc3","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/7fda348d8d9a5cc5c7b605108f127871","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 23:42:00","author":"Harrison Christian","authors":["Harrison Christian"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":387745990,"title":"Republican says Trump DOJ's Epstein files dump 'grossly fails to comply' with his law","text":"Both cosponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) are accusing President Donald Trump's administration of violating the law the president signed last month.\n\nAfter the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday released its first tranche of several thousand documents and photos pertaining to convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's two federal investigations, legal observers remarked that hundreds of pages of files were entirely redacted, while significant portions of other documents are also redacted.

The models that stand to be subject to enforcement include ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI; Claude by Anthropic; LLaMA by Meta; Gemini by Google; and Copilot by Microsoft.\n\nHochul pushed for New York’s approach to mirror California’s SB 53 law and help set a national standard on AI guardrails. Tech industry leaders have warmed to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who like Hochul is a Democrat, and the AI law he signed in September.\n\nWhat ultimately became law in California is laxer than earlier iterations of SB 53, which is known as the Transparency in Frontier AI Act. New York’s RAISE Act will be stricter than California’s regulations, which give frontier model developers 15 days to report critical safety incidents and cap penalties at $1 million per violation. But it’s less stringent than what state legislators passed in June. As an example, the earlier version of the RAISE Act included penalties of up to $10 million for the first violation and $30 million for subsequent violations.\n\n“Big tech oligarchs think it’s fine to put their profits ahead of our safety — we disagree,” Gounardes, a Brooklyn Democrat, said in a statement. “With this law, we make clear that tech innovation and safety don’t have to be at odds.
