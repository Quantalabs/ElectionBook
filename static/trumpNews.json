Delivering his usual rhetoric and bigotry — from accusing Harris of being a communist to calling her a liar (“she gets up and just lies”) and claiming she’s “flooding our country with millions and millions of low wage migrants” whom he baselessly claims are mostly prisoners, mental institution patients, and terrorists — Trump also whined about having had to spend money to battle Biden, but now his strategy has been messed up with a new candidate. “I spend $100 million,” he claimed on what he has forked out for his initial run against President Joe Biden. “Now, I have to run against somebody else. Is that fair? I think they should reimburse me for the 100 million. Who wants to collect?” In the days following Biden leaving the race to Harris becoming the presumptive nominee, Trump struggled to combat his new foe, falling back to primarily attacking Biden. During Saturday’s rally, he still called Biden “crooked,” but he also went off teleprompter to claim that Biden “hates [Harris]. This was an overthrow of a president,” he claimed. As for his attacks on Harris, he played a video, which included snippets from when she previously ran for president. He criticized her laugh. “Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person… It’s a laugh of a lunatic. Have you heard her?,” he said, then he claimed: “You know, they prohibited her. They prohibited her for laughing. I’ve been waiting for the laugh, because as soon as she laughs, the election’s over.” Trump also took umbrage with Harris’ looks. He brought up her cover with Time Magazine, and pointed out that it was a drawing. He said he thought it was Sophia Loren in the depiction, and that someone else had told him Harris had the advantage of being a “very beautiful woman,” which drew boos and sneers from the audience. So he said he want back to look at the story, and wildly concluded: “I say that I am much better looking than her… I’m a better looking person than Kamala.” Beyond his direct attacks on Harris, he also claimed that the “country is going to die” should he not be reelected. It was his seventh visit to the battleground state, and his second in Pennsylvania since he was shot and wounded in Butler. A poll published yesterday by Emerson College/RealClearPennsylvania has him leading with Pennsylvania voters by a slim margin of one percentage point, whereas a week ago, a poll from The New York Times and Siena found that he was trailing Harris by four percentage points among Pennsylvania voters (red state polls are also worrying the GOP). Trump and Harris will also face-off in the state during their first debate on Sept. 10 in Philadelphia.","summary":"Former president continues to complain a month later about facing a new candidate leading into the Democratic National Convention","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-rally-biden-harris-time-magazine-pennsylvania-dnc-1235082447/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DonaldTrump2-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 00:30:18","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":254345718,"title":"Trump remarks on economy laced with personal insults at Pennsylvania rally","text":"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday repeatedly swerved from a message focused on the economy into non-sequiturs and personal attacks, including declaring several times that he was better looking than Vice President Kamala Harris.Trump wound back and forth between hitting his points on economic policy and delivering a smattering of insults and impressions of President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron as he held a rally in northeastern Pennsylvania.The former president has seemed to struggle to adjust to his new opponent after Democrats replaced their nominee. Over the past week, he has diverged during campaign appearances away from the policies he was billed to speak about and instead diverted to a rotation of insults.Trump seemed to spend more of his rally on Saturday than usual sticking to the script, but he diverged early and often.As he attacked Democrats for inflation at the top of his speech, he asked his crowd of supporters, \"You don't mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? Joe Biden hates her.\"Trump's rally was in a swath of the pivotal battleground state where he hopes conservative, white working-class voters near Mr. Biden's hometown will boost the Republican's chances of winning back the White House.His remarks Saturday came as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention that kicks off Monday in Chicago and will mark the party's welcoming of Harris as their nominee. Her replacement of Mr. Biden less than four months before the November election reinvigorated Democrats and their coalition and has presented a new challenge for Trump.Trump on Saturday hammered Harris on the economy, associating her with the Biden administration's inflation woes and likening her latest proposal against price gouging to measures in communist nations. Trump has said a federal ban on price gouging for groceries would lead to food shortages, rationing and hunger and on Saturday asked why she hadn't worked to solve prices when she and Mr. Biden were sworn into office in 2021.\"Day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. So why didn't she do it then? So this is day 1,305,\" Trump said.To address high prices, Trump said he would sign an executive order on his first day sworn in as president \"directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down, but we're going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way,\" he said.But he maundered in his remarks, touching on the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 to doing impressions of Macron's French accent. But he took issue with the way his free-wheeling style is typically portrayed in news reports.\"They will say he's rambling. I don't ramble. I'm a really smart guy. I don't ramble.\"Trump laced in attacks on Harris' laugh and said she was \"not a very good wordsmith\" and mocked the names of the CNN anchors who moderated the debate he had with Mr. Biden in June.When he began musing on Harris' recent image on the cover of Time magazine, he forked off, commenting on the picture's resemblance to classic Hollywood icons Sophia Loren and Elizabeth Taylor and then took issue with a Wall Street Journal columnist remarking earlier this month on Harris' beauty.\"I am much better looking than her,\" Trump said, drawing laughs from the crowd. \"I'm a better looking person than Kamala.\"He predicted financial ruin for the country and Pennsylvania in particular if Harris wins, citing her past opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process.\"Your state's going to be ruined anyway. She's totally anti-fracking,\" Trump said.In 2016 and 2020, Trump crushed his Democratic rivals in the county that is home to blue-collar Wilkes-Barre. The Rust Belt region, home to Mr. Biden's native Scranton, offers Trump hope and helps him spotlight Democratic vulnerabilities after the president ended his reelection bid and Harris launched her campaign.Her campaign has tried to soften her stance on fracking, saying she would not ban it, even though that was her position when she was seeking the 2020 presidential nomination.Some Democrats in Pennsylvania acknowledge the challenges but say the economy is what concerns most people in the area.On Sunday, Harris plans a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh, with a stop in Rochester, a small town to the north. Trump has scheduled a visit Monday to a plant that manufactures nuclear fuel containers in York. Trump's running mate JD Vance is expected to be in Philadelphia that day.Trump's Saturday rally was his fifth at the arena in Wilkes-Barre, the largest city in Luzerne County, where he has had victories the past two elections. Mr. Biden bested Trump in neighboring Lackawanna County, where the Democrat has long promoted his working-class roots in Scranton.Some of Mr. Biden's loyal supporters in this former industrial city of 76,000 were upset to see party leaders put pressure the president to step aside.Diane Munley, 63, says she called dozens of members of Congress to vouch for Mr. Biden. Munley eventually came to terms with Mr. Biden's decision and is now very supportive of Harris.\"I can't deny the enthusiasm that's been going on with this ticket right now. I am so into it,\" Munley said. \"It just wasn't happening with Joe, and I couldn't see it at the time because I was so connected to him.\"Robert A. Bridy, 64, a laborer from Shamokin, Pennsylvania, traveled on Saturday to the rally to show support for Trump. He said the election feels tight in this state and added that his union and a close friend are trying to convince him to vote for Harris and other Democrats, but he has voted for Trump since 2016.Bridy called Trump a \"working class guy like us.\" Trump is a billionaire who built his fortune in real estate.\"He's a fighter,\" Bridy said. \"I'd like to see the closed borders. He doesn't mess around. He goes at it right away and takes care of business the way it should be.\"","summary":"During the rally, former President Donald Trump declared several times that he was better looking than Vice President Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-economic-remarks-personal-insults-pennsylvania-rally/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/16/32f17d1f-41a5-4878-8bf6-0168320d249c/thumbnail/1200x630/98f547bff1333206c25937bf82aeb1ee/cbsn-fusion-trump-says-hes-entitled-to-personal-attacks-on-kamala-harris-thumbnail.jpg?v=d8f7565ef3e8b72561ee316b","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3128818_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-08-18 00:25:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":254345370,"title":"“Insightful Interview: Olena Zelensky Opens Up to LORD ASHCROFT about Life in Ukraine amid War, Strengthening Emotional Bonds with Husband”","text":"The tragic events of the past two-and-a-half years would have tested any marriage: an unprecedented war, a potentially life-or-death decision on whether to flee the fighting and a close-knit family forced to live apart. Add to that the huge responsibilities that go with being the President and First Lady of Ukraine after their country was invaded by a neighbouring power, and the marriage of Volodymyr and Olena Zelensky could easily have crumbled under the pressure. However, the First Lady made it clear to me that this is a long way from the reality. Speaking in an exclusive interview at the office of the President in central Kyiv, Olena Zelenska (in Ukrainian, the married name often takes on a feminine ending) reveals that war has made the couple’s 20-year-marriage stronger than ever. ‘I think we are closer and more tied because we have supported each other the way in which we hoped. ‘I think I didn’t let him down, and he never lets me down,’ she said. ‘We don’t see each other as often as we would like, so every meeting is a joy. We’re never tired of each other, we never bore each other. And it makes the family stronger, too.’ For the duration of the conflict, the First Lady and their two children, daughter Oleksandra, 20, and son Kyrylo, 11, have had to live apart from the President. They are able to see each other more now than at the start of the war, but family life still has its challenges, as it does for all those living in the war-torn country. Ms Zelenska told me: ‘It’s not a normal life for any person to live in a country at war. It’s a constant psychological burden and pressure. ‘I hope when this pressure is relieved, with our victory, we will be able to stay sane and we’ll be fine. However, now I think that we are as close as ever emotionally. ‘And we understand each other very well. In fact, it is very important that you can respect your nearest and dearest. ‘I am sure love is not enough. And I am happy that I can respect my husband because it would have been very hard to stay with him, even given huge love, if I hadn’t believed in his honesty.’ As Russian special forces troops swarmed all over the capital hours after the all-out invasion in February 2022, the U.S. gave the President an option to leave Ukraine. He is famously said to have replied: ‘The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride.’ The softly spoken First Lady, wearing a stylish black-belted trouser suit, told me: ‘I have to be frank, yes, I am proud of him. ‘But it was not a surprise for me. It was just another proof that I chose the right person. ‘In the terrifying days, weeks and months at the start of the war, I didn’t doubt for a second the way he’d behave. ‘But I am even more proud of his resilience. This is a long-lasting marathon.’ She added: ‘Displaying your courage once is possible – sometimes it may be an accident. ‘But when you constantly put all of your effort and power into achieving the common goal, it demands something extra. ‘He’s managing, and I pray that he does not lose his power and strength, because we need him as he is, strong and stubborn.’ Her pride in her husband goes hand in hand with her concerns for his safety and the wider family. President Zelensky has been the target of several reported assassination attempts. ‘I hope everything that could be done for his safety has been done, and the same for my family, too… I don’t want to think about bad stuff. I’m afraid to think about it,’ said the First Lady who, despite her good English, preferred to answer my questions in Ukrainian. Just as Ms Zelenska cannot disguise her admiration for her husband, nor can she hide her hatred for Vladimir Putin for causing widespread death, destruction and chaos in her country, the second largest in Europe. Ukraine does not publish casualty figures but tens of thousands of its service personnel and civilians have been killed during the war. The First Lady said of Putin: ‘Many people, for a long time, have not considered him to be a person. It is some sort of a monster that rules the country.’ The atrocities inflicted on Ukraine’s people seem endless: last month, a Russian missile hit a children’s hospital on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people and injuring 300 more, mostly children. At least 46 people – including 33 in Kyiv – were killed across Ukraine in a wave of missile and drone strikes on the same day. ‘Who is this person, this officer of the Russian army, who pushed the button, knowing he was launching a rocket to a children’s hospital? ‘And it is 100 per cent that they knew. It is proven,’ said the First Lady, still deeply moved. Like her husband and Ukraine’s military, she is dismissive of a peace deal that would cede Russia the nearly 20 per cent of land it has seized from Ukraine, saying it would mean the struggle of the last two-and-a-half years had been in vain. She fears such a pause would give Russia the chance to regroup and attack again at some point, adding: ‘In many fairy tales of many nations, there is a dragon who, every year is given a girl so that the monster won’t burn down the city. ‘But for how long can we keep feeding the dragon? Somebody has to stop it.’ Does she contemplate the consequences of a Russian victory? Saying she tries not to think about such a scenario, she added: ‘I have a strong hope that won’t happen. ‘I cannot confidently say that it wouldn’t happen, but it would be a loss, not just of Ukraine, but also the entire democratic world.’ If peace and victory come to Ukraine, the First Lady insists that her country and the international community must prosecute Russia and its servicemen for war crimes, including those who committed rape and also crimes against the elderly and children. ‘The victims need this justice,’ she said firmly. Ms Zelenska said various phases of the war had presented different challenges: ‘Everyone gets tired, everyone wants to preserve hope inside – and it takes effort.’ I learned that, like me as the author of seven books on bravery, the First Lady has a huge admiration for the courage of her nation’s service personnel and civilians. She thanked me for telling the stories of Ukrainian bravery in newspaper articles, adding: ‘It hurts a lot when I see the stories of our warriors, especially those who died at the very start. ‘It is painful because those were the bravest, those who joined the army in the first days of the war. ‘Those were the people who felt this call, this sincere urge to defend their country. ‘Unfortunately, many of them are not with us any more. And in this war, we lose those most valuable ones.’ I told the First Lady that, over the past two years, I have interviewed many Ukrainian women – from a female sniper to a front-line aid worker – to champion their bravery. She replied: ‘Military service for Ukrainian women is not mandatory, and all the women who took weapons into their hands, including sniper rifles, are women who made the choice for themselves. It is incredibly courageous and inspiring.’ She added that when she is at her most weary, her work inspires her to carry on. ‘Of course, everyone has moments of exhaustion, when it is hard to start every morning all over again. ‘And in this moment I can keep moving when I know there are things I haven’t done yet. ‘There are different kinds of people. Some give birth to an idea, those who develop processes and plan, and others who implement. I think I represent the first group – I am full of ideas.’ Ms Zelenska has been touched by the way the UK has rallied behind Ukraine. ‘When I visit Great Britain, I feel how strong the support of the British people is on every level – from the Royal Family to ordinary citizens who I meet every time I go back.’ As for the suggestion that Donald Trump would, if he is re-elected U.S. President, cut the huge levels of aid for Ukraine, the First Lady said: ‘I hope it is mere speculation. ‘The US election is something that a lot depends on for many countries, especially for those who, like us, hope for their support.’ I was touched when she greeted me as a ‘big friend of Ukraine’. I have visited the country eight times since the start of this war, including many trips to the front line. My numerous newspaper articles supporting Ukraine resulted in me being one of a number of individuals to be sanctioned by Russia earlier this year. Like all other first ladies, or first gentlemen, Ms Zelenska had the chance to opt for a private life out of the spotlight or to have a public role of her own. She chose the latter. That role, of course, expanded hugely after the war. Within months of the outbreak, she founded the Olena Zelenska Foundation, a charity that has raised millions of pounds for humanitarian aid, education and health care. Many of these projects support children by building bomb shelters in schools and places where children can learn outside of schools, as well as rebuilding destroyed homes, hospitals and the like. She told me: ‘When the war commenced, I realised that, through my contacts, my trips abroad, the fact I can talk to a great number of people outside of our country, I could channel all that to help Ukrainians inside the country.’ That so much of the foundation’s work is with children is no coincidence. ‘I think any conscious adult understands that, first of all, children are the most vulnerable category of people who suffer from war. They are the least protected. And when you see them suffer, it tears your heart,’ she said. ‘We owe them because we didn’t manage to preserve the peace in their country. As adults, we owe them because they don’t have the starting opportunities their peers have abroad. ‘They don’t have a normal childhood. So to do something for their childhood, to become at least better, is a normal desire of every adult. ‘And the fact that I’m a mother, I think, only amplifies all that.’ Next month, Ms Zelenska will host the fourth ‘Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen’ in Kyiv, focussing on the safety and security of children. Commended for her charitable and other work, she was named among Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2023, in which she was described as ‘a warrior for the people of Ukraine’. She modestly played down suggestions she is a role model but added: ‘I hope greatly that my activities, my behaviour, inspire somebody, give somebody hope.’ Despite the strains of war, she retains a sense of humour. I told her that her husband, when once asked by a journalist what he most looked forward to doing after a peace agreement, replied: ‘To catch a carp in the Dnipro [river].’ So I wondered if she has a similar interest she wants to rekindle? ‘It is a very interesting thing about the carp. Let me put it this way. I hate cleaning fish. ‘In my family it was a tradition that the one who fishes is the one who cleans and fries the fish. ‘But when Volodymyr catches a carp, I promise to clean and cook that fish, because that would mean victory is here. And in the meantime, I will think about some carp recipes!’ Finally, I asked Ms Zelenska if she sometimes feels her life is surreal. Only a handful of years ago, her husband was an actor and she was a screenwriter. Now she is the First Lady of a country fighting for its survival. ‘Well, nobody ever planned that, that my husband and I would find ourselves in a situation like this, especially that there would be a war. ‘I never thought I would be a wife of a president. But to be honest, when we were young, I didn’t expect him to become a TV star and then a movie actor, either.’ She said that her husband has involved her at every step of the way. ‘Each turn in our journey made me stronger and demanded development from me. And I thank him for that.’ Lord Ashcroft KCMG PC is an international businessman, philanthropist, author and pollster. For more information on his work, visit lordashcroft.com.

CNN anchor Michael Smerconish showed a Fox News poll showing a 22-point gender gap — men favor Trump by 12 percentage points, and women prefer Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 — during a segment on the network Saturday. “The problem is that Kamala Harris reminds men of their first wife and Donald Trump reminds women of their first husband’s divorce lawyer, and it’s actually kind of true,” Luntz said. “I know it’s funny, but it’s kind of true.” Luntz went further, saying he believes “there are actually going to be divorces” because of the unprecedented nature of what he called a gender “chasm.” He also offered three pieces of advice for Trump on the campaign trail with about 2 1/2 months until Election Day. “First, don’t insult your opponent for how they look, how they speak,” Luntz said. “Women can’t stand that.” Later in the day, at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Trump rejected a suggestion he said he received that Harris has an advantage in the race because “she’s a very beautiful woman.” “I say that I am much better-looking than her, I think I’m much better, much better,” Trump said. “I’m a better-looking person than Kamala.” Luntz also alluded to Trump’s tendency to dwell on his 2020 election defeat, which he often encourages supporters to avoid a repeat of by voting in numbers that make it “too big to rig.” “Second, they expect you to focus on the future, not on anger about the past, and that’s, again, the exact opposite of what Trump is actually doing,” Luntz said. “Third, particularly now, we’ve had arguably eight years of this rough-and-tumble kind of politics,” Luntz said. “The economy has been challenging, inflation has clearly made lives more difficult for so many people, and you want to lean into that. You acknowledge it, you show people a solution, you give them ideas for how they can change it.” At a Friday event in Raleigh, North Carolina, Harris outlined a plan to lower costs for households over the next four years in her first policy-focused speech since she became the Democratic nominee. ​​“That’s exactly what Harris did yesterday,” Luntz said. “You may disagree with what she’s saying, but at least she’s addressing it.” Smerconish also showed New York Times/Siena College polling data indicating the gender gap is more pronounced in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, three states that have served as bellwethers over the past four cycles. The margin grew to 32 points in the so-called “blue wall” states, with women favoring Harris by 17 points and a 15-point lead among men for Trump. “No one’s seeing the campaign except for those three states and four others,” Luntz said, highlighting the importance of the dollars being spent on advertising in rallies in swing states.

Price | Associated Press WILKES-BARRE, Pa. — Former President Donald Trump on Saturday repeatedly swerved from a message focused on the economy into nonsequiturs and personal attacks, including thrice declaring that he was better looking than Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump wound back and forth between hitting his points on economic policy and delivering a smattering of insults and impressions of President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron as he held a rally in northeastern Pennsylvania. The former president has seemed to struggle to adjust to his new opponent after Democrats replaced their nominee. Over the past week, he has diverged during campaign appearances away from the policies he was billed to speak about and instead diverted to a rotation of familiar attack lines and insults. As he attacked Democrats for inflation at the top of his speech, Trump asked his crowd of supporters, “You don’t mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? Joe Biden hates her.” Joseph Costello, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, responded to Trump in a statement by saying, “Another rally, same old show” and that Trump ” resorts to lies, name-calling, and confused rants,” because he can’t sell his agenda. “The more Americans hear Trump speak, the clearer the choice this November: Vice President Harris is unifying voters with her positive vision to protect our freedoms, build up the middle class, and move America forward — and Donald Trump is trying to take us backwards,” Costello said. Trump’s rally in Wilkes-Barre was in a swath of a pivotal battleground state where he hopes conservative, white working-class voters near Biden’s hometown of Scranton will boost the Republican’s chances of winning back the White House. His remarks Saturday came as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention that kicks off Monday in Chicago and will mark the party’s welcoming of Harris as their nominee. Her replacement of Biden less than four months before the November election has reinvigorated Democrats and their coalition. It has also presented a new challenge for Trump. Trump hammered Harris on the economy, associating her with the Biden administration’s inflation woes and likening her latest proposal against price gouging to measures in communist nations. Trump has said a federal ban on price gouging for groceries would lead to food shortages, rationing and hunger. On Saturday asked why she hadn’t worked to solve prices when she and Biden were sworn into office in 2021. “Day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. So why didn’t she do it then? So this is day 1,305,” Trump said. To address high prices, Trump said he would sign an executive order on his first day sworn in as president “directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down, but we’re going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way,” he said. He predicted financial ruin for the country, and Pennsylvania in particular, if Harris wins, citing her past opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process commonly used in the state. Her campaign has tried to soften her stance on fracking, saying she would not ban it, even though that was her position when she was seeking the 2020 presidential nomination. “Your state’s going to be ruined anyway. She’s totally anti-fracking,” Trump said. But he also meandered, going from ripping the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 to doing impressions of Macron’s French accent. Trump laced in attacks on Harris’ laugh and said she was “not a very good wordsmith” and mocked the names of the CNN anchors who moderated the debate he had with Biden in June. When he began musing on Harris’ recent image on the cover of Time magazine, he commented on the picture’s resemblance to classic Hollywood icons Sophia Loren and Elizabeth Taylor and then took issue with a Wall Street Journal columnist remarking earlier this month on Harris’ beauty. “I am much better looking than her,” Trump said, drawing laughs from the crowd. “I’m a better looking person than Kamala.” He also took issue with the way his style is typically portrayed in news reports. “They will say he’s rambling. I don’t ramble. I’m a really smart guy,” he said. Trump’s Saturday rally was his fifth at the arena in Wilkes-Barre, the largest city in Luzerne County, where he has had victories in the past two elections. Biden bested Trump in neighboring Lackawanna County, where the Democrat has long promoted his working-class roots in Scranton. On Sunday, Harris plans a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh, with a stop in Rochester, a small town to the north. Trump has scheduled a visit Monday to a plant that manufactures nuclear fuel containers in York. Trump’s running mate JD Vance is expected to be in Philadelphia that day. Some of Biden’s loyal supporters in Scranton, a former industrial city of 76,000, were upset to see party leaders put pressure on the president to step aside. Diane Munley, 63, says she called dozens of members of Congress to vouch for Biden. Munley eventually came to terms with Biden’s decision and is now very supportive of Harris. “I can’t deny the enthusiasm that’s been going on with this ticket right now. I am so into it,” Munley said. “It just wasn’t happening with Joe, and I couldn’t see it at the time because I was so connected to him.” Bridy called Trump a “working class guy like us.” Trump is a billionaire who built his fortune in real estate. “He’s a fighter,” Bridy said. “I’d like to see the closed borders. He doesn’t mess around. He goes at it right away and takes care of business the way it should be.” Price reported from New York.

After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls.” With food prices surging more than 20% nationwide during the Biden-Harris administration, Harris, during a North Carolina rally on Friday, unveiled economic policies she’d enact during her first 100 days as president. They include having the Federal Trade Commission enforce a federal ban on price gouging that would slap hefty penalties on companies that set exorbitantly high prices. “What they are doing is a communist takeover of our country,” Trump said of the Harris proposal. “Her plan is very dangerous because it may sound good politically … This is Communist; this is Marxist; this is fascist.” The ex-president also took a few minutes to offer the left-wing Washington Post rare praise for publishing a scathing editorial ripping Harris for claiming price gouging is causing inflation and, rather than offer a legit plan to fix it, offering only “populist gimmicks.” Trump’s appearance was his seventh this year in the key battleground state where recent polls show a stalemate between him and Harris for Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes up for grabs.","summary":"Donald Trump on Saturday on Saturday ripped Vice President Kamala Harris' plan to slap socialist price controls on groceries, saying she’s gone “full Communist.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/trump-kamala-harris-price-control-plan-is-full-communist/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87917771.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/eWNI4j6M-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:57:56","author":"Rich Calder","authors":["Rich Calder"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":254344808,"title":"Free abortions, vasectomies will be available to DNC attendees in Chicago","text":"Attendees at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will have the opportunity to get a free abortion or vasectomy just blocks away from the event — and vasectomy appointments are filling up fast. Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which serves most of Missouri and part of southern Illinois, is sending a mobile health center to the Windy City’s West Loop to offer the reproductive services on Monday and Tuesday. Medication abortions are reportedly available on both days, with vasectomies being exclusively offered Monday, according to The New York Times. Vasectomies are reportedly in high demand and there’s already a waiting list. “There are going to be people traveling to Chicago from all over the country,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers told the paper. “And I think we should be doing what we can as health care providers to show what the impact of good policy and bad policy is.” The services will be provided “on a sliding-fee scale — pay what you can and get the health care you need,” according to the appointment reservation form, which only requires a name, date of birth and basic contact information. Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee at the convention, has been outspoken in her support for abortion rights after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had federally protected abortion access for half a century. Abortion has become one of the integral parts of Harris’ campaign after several states passed their own strict abortion bans since the Supreme Court’s decision in 2022. Harris has called abortion one of America’s “fundamental freedoms,” according to a White House release announcing her “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” in December. Unlike previous years, abortion is expecting to be a front and center issue for Democrats at the convention, according to The Times. “There’s a direct through line between what Donald Trump did and loss of access to abortion care,” said Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota, who previously worked for Planned Parenthood. “That’s one of the reasons why people are seeing this in a kind of completely different frame than they were even just four years ago.” In addition to the mobile clinic, another group, Americans for Contraception, plans to erect an 18-foot-tall inflatable intrauterine device, or IUD, named “Freeda Womb,” The Times reported. Other activists are planning a “Hotties for Harris” party, in addition to a number of other events. Meanwhile, businesses in downtown Chicago have started boarding up their doors and windows in anticipation of thousands of anti-Israeli protesters that have planned to take over the city streets during the convention.","summary":"Attendees at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will have the opportunity to get a free abortion or vasectomy just blocks away from the event &#8212; and vasectomy appointments are filling up fast.

While Trump appeared set to cruise in many purple states against Joe Biden, polling has shown Harris gaining ground in some states and leading in others. However, her chances of claiming all seven of the toughest contests – considered by experts to be Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada – are quite low. British oddsmakers William Hill give Harris just a 50-to-1 odds of sweeping those states, essentially a two percent chance. Biden notoriously flipped Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan from red to blue to win in 2020, while hanging on to Nevada and losing North Carolina to beat Trump. Harris holds decent to better than a coinflip odds on winning all of these states on their own. The current vice president has a 69.2 percent shot of flipping North Carolina, 66.7 percent in Michigan, 61.9 percent in Wisconsin and 60 percent in both Georgia and Pennsylvania. With those seven states in play, if Harris and Trump both equaled their results in the remaining races, it would leave Harris with an electoral vote lead of 226 to 219, with 270 votes needed to win. Aside from Nevada and its six electoral votes, if Harris won any four of the remaining six swing states indicated, she would have the numbers to claim victory. Based on the new figures, Harris has erased the lead Trump was building in the states before President Biden dropped out of the race. However, in a DailyMail.com poll published earlier this week, the former president still holds a two-point lead over the new Democratic nominee. Where other recent polls show the vice president surging ahead, our survey of 1001 likely voters found that 43 percent would vote for Trump if the election were tomorrow, compared with 41 percent who would vote for Harris. With a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent it sets the stage for a nail-biter of an election in November. A separate online survey teased out the attributes responsible for Trump’s lead. It found that voters still see him as the stronger, more charismatic candidate, who is more likely to get things done. Even so, Harris scores better than Biden across the board. And it all suggests that she is shaping up to be a more formidable opponent than the 81-year-old she replaced. Harris was catapulted into the race after Biden announced last month that he was giving up his reelection campaign. Trump insiders were initially jubilant, expecting weeks of Democratic infighting. But the party quickly rallied around the vice president and will show a united front at its convention in Chicago next week. The result has been a series of polls showing that Harris has overturned, or at least reined in, Trump’s clear poll lead. The first presidential debate between the two is set to be held in Philadelphia on September 10 and will be moderated by ABC News. The first vice presidential debate between Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio will take place on October 1 in New York City, and will be hosted by CBS.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe odds of Kamala Harris hitting a lucky seven and winning all&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala&#8217;s odds of winning all seven swing states uncovered &#8211; unexpected outcomes favor one candidate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamalas-odds-of-winning-all-seven-swing-states-uncovered-unexpected-outcomes-favor-one-candidate/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/17/23/88634963-13753803-image-a-9_1723934909033.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:49:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":254344738,"title":"Economy takes center stage in presidential race","text":"Economy takes center stage in presidential race Former President Donald Trump has focused his latest line of attacks against his rival on the economy, which comes after Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled her first round of economic policy proposals.

She was also paid another $220,000 for a speaking gig in at the 2022 Log Cabin Republican gala. Trump and his wife made a combined $7.4 million on his NFT “Collect Trump Cards” trading cards. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort itself made $56.9 million in revenues, up $4.6 million from last year’s report— although costs were not reported, so how profitable to club is is unknown. His golf courses also brought in nine figures for the former president. Trump’s National Doral golf resort brought in $160.1 million alone with his Bedminster club following at $37 million, his Scottish Turnberry golf course brought in another $33.5 million and finally his Jupiter, Florida, Trump National Golf Club raked in $31 million.

Jean Carroll’s sexual abuse and defamation cases against him and then another $454 million to New York state for his civil fraud judgement. Trump is appealing both rulings. Trump also owns 114,750,000 shares of Trump Media and Technology Group.

The former president argued, “Nobody knows how to say her first name. Is it ‘Day-na’ or ‘Dah-na’? Nobody knows. It’s been going on for 20 years; she’s been around a long time. Is it ‘Day-na’ or ‘Dah-na’? And now the fake news will say, ‘Trump didn’t know how to pronounce her first name.’ She doesn’t know how to pronounce it.” Trump also extended an olive branch to Bash’s CNN colleague, Jake Tapper. The pair hosted the first presidential debate between Trump and President Joe Biden. “But look, but Dana and Jake, I used to call him ‘Fake Tapper,’” Trump said. “Now I call him Jake Tapper because he treated us very fairly and so did Dana — treat me very fairly. I think it was, you know, just about neutral.” As he played media critic, Trump also went back to his continued attacks on ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos, who he referred to as “George Slopadopoulos.” “The worst network to me is ABC. Worse than NBC, worse than CBS, worse than CNN — the home of George Slopadopoulos, a nasty guy.” He went on to make fun of the journalist’s height and mock his questions as being too easy for Biden, despite the president’s interview being seen as part of Biden’s ongoing poor appearances that led to him stepping down as the Democratic Party’s candidate. Elsewhere, Trump praised the invention of TiVo and waxed nostalgic for its glory days. “I love the playback controls you have nowadays. They used to call it ‘TiVo,’ now they TiVo— I think it’s the single greatest invention. It is better than television,” he told attendees. Trump’s Pennsylvania event was also discussed on social media by self-described “political junkie” Peter Henlein, who tweeted, “Trump’s rally today: ‘I’m better looking than Kamala. no one knows how to pronounce Dana Bash’s name. Tariffs good. It should be illegal to criticize the Supreme Court. TiVo is awesome. I won Minnesota twice.’ This is dumb. Stop pretending it isn’t.” Trump received fewer votes than rivals Hillary Clinton and Biden in both 2016 and 2020. Despite pleading from fellow Republicans to focus on policy, Trump has continued to levy personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris. While speaking to reporters from his New Jersey golf club earlier this week, Trump insisted, “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks. I don’t have a lot of respect for her” and added, “They want me to be nice. But they’re not being nice to me. They want to put me in prison.” Trump also took issue with Jewish Democrats at the Saturday rally. He told the crowd, “Any Jewish person that votes for her or a Democrat has to go out and have their head examined. Because if you see what’s happening with Israel and Jewish people right now, there has never been a more dangerous time since the Holocaust if you happen to be Jewish in America.” This isn’t the first time Trump has attempted to shame Jews in the United States who plan to vote for the Democratic candidate. Back in May, he said, “What Biden is doing with respect to Israel is disgraceful. If any Jewish person voted for Joe Biden, they should be ashamed of themselves.” The commentary prompted a retort from “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart, who said, “My apologies to you, Rabbi. Thank you so much for taking time off of your condomless porn star hush money trial to deliver a shame lecture to Jews. I will reflect on your moral standing next Yom Kippur.” You can watch Donald Trump’s full Saturday rally from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania below","summary":"The GOP's presidential candidate also laments the heyday of TiVo and says he's better looking than Kamala Harris\n\n\nThe post Donald Trump Explains Why He Stopped Calling Jake Tapper ‘Fake,’ Argues Dana Bash Can’t Pronounce Her Own Name | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-dana-bash-jake-fake-tapper/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/trump-apprentice-book.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:36:17","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":254344258,"title":"Ukrainian First Lady reveals toll ongoing war with Russia has on relationship with Volodymyr Zelenskyy","text":"The First Lady of Ukraine gushed in a new interview that the ongoing war with Russia has strengthened her marriage to her presidential husband. Olena Zelenska said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s stamina in the face of their bloodshed and political turmoil is “proof” she married the right partner 20 years earlier. “I think we are closer and more tied because we have supported each other the way in which we hoped,” Olena Zelenska told the Daily Mail at the office of the President in central Kyiv. “I think I didn’t let him down, and he never lets me down,” she continued. Olena Zelenska (in Ukrainian, the married name often takes on a feminine ending, the Daily Mail notes) told the outlet that she and the couple’s two children have been living apart from the Ukrainian President since Russia invaded their country in February 2022. Volodymyr Zelenskyy famously chose to stay in the wartown capital of Ukraine despite being given the opportunity to shelter safely. The bravery the former actor displayed — and continues to display — has only made Olena Zelenska’s love for her husband grow stronger, despite having few opportunities to spend with her life partner. “I have to be frank, yes, I am proud of him,” Olena Zelenska said. “But it was not a surprise for me. It was just another proof that I chose the right person,” she continued. “In the terrifying days, weeks and months at the start of the war, I didn’t doubt for a second the way he’d behave. But I am even more proud of his resilience. This is a long-lasting marathon.” As much as Olena Zelenska gushed about her husband, she made it clear she harbors hatred for Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the First Lady, Russia is being run by “some sort of monster.” When asked whether she worried about the possibility of Donald Trump — who has campaigned on cutting funding for Ukraine’s military — winning his re-election bid, Olena Zelenska said she hopes that is nothing more than “mere speculation.” “The US election is something that a lot depends on for many countries, especially for those who, like us, hope for their support,” she said. More than 11,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the war broke out 18 months prior, as well as up to 100,000 soldiers, officials estimate. On Saturday, Russia launched a cruise missile and an aerial bomb across the border into Ukraine that sparked a fire in the city of Sumy, killing two Ukrainian soldiers. The Kremlin also flew kamikaze drones overnight into Ukrainian airspace Friday. The attack came as Ukraine continued to push into Russian territory. One expert slammed Russia for its “complete intelligence failure” in the face of Ukraine’s historic offensive. Moscow appeared to have been taken by surprise as Ukraine pushed its way into the town of Sudzhe in the Kursk region this week, with authorities giving no indication that anything was remiss, according to a report. One French military expert blasted Russia for its inability to see what was coming. “The Russians had a complete intelligence failure here,” Yohann Michel, a research fellow at IESD Institute in Lyon, told Reuters.","summary":"\"This is a long-lasting marathon.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/world-news/ukrainian-prez-volodymyr-zelenskyys-wife-says-war-with-russia-makes-relationship-stronger/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87915338.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QgIlaycN-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:30:43","author":"Katherine Donlevy","authors":["Katherine Donlevy"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.032},{"id":254344238,"title":"New Poll Reveals Significant Change in Race Between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Four Crucial Swing States in the Sunbelt","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has now closed the gap between her and former president Donald Trump across four key swing states. New findings by The New York Times suggest that the two presidential hopefuls are now in tight races across Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. Trump had seemed set to run away with these states just a few weeks ago, but new polling shows Harris is gradually erasing his lead. He remains ahead in Georgia 50 percent to her 46, and in Nevada it is 48 percent for him while 47 for Harris. Harris has claimed 49 percent of voters to Trump’s 47 in North Carolina, one of the core battleground states he carried in 2020. The polls do continue to show some risk for Harris – including that 49 percent of voters see her as too liberal, while 33 percent of voters see Trump as too conservative. Democratic voters meanwhile are now excited by Harris being the nominee, with 85 percent saying they are enthusiastic about voting for her. This roughly matches voters’ level of enthusiasm for Trump Harris, who would be the first Black woman to serve as president, has the support of 84 percent of Black voters, according to the polls. That is higher than President Biden’s support than when he dramatically dropped out of the race just a few weeks ago. Meanwhile her backing among Latino voters sits at 54 percent, and has taken a 14 percent point lead over Trump among women in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. Harris now leads nonwhite voters in those three states by 29 points, while Biden had led those voters in the same states by 17 points in May of this year. Trump meanwhile is maximizing his support among white voters without a college degree, taking 66 percent of support from them across the Sun Belt states. Harris also holds a 13 point advantage over Trump among TikTok users in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, indicating her online traction with younger voters. Voters gave both candidates a 48 percent favorable rating. In one survey in February voters had viewed Harris more unfavorably. Despite the positives, Trump holds the advantage among voters on what are bound to be two issues integral to the race to the White House, the economy and immigration. Voters ranked those as the most important facing the nation, but the two are closely tied on the question of who would handle those issues better. Trump is still favored on the economy, the polls found, but has dropped considerably since Biden dropped out of the race. Harris meanwhile had widened the Democratic edge over Trump on the topic of abortion. Trump is more trusted by voters when dealing with immigration, leading Harris 53 percent to her 43. When third party candidates were included, the state of the race in the states was unchanged, with Robert F. Kennedy taking just 4 percent of likely voters. A significant amount of voters viewed Trump as being a stronger leader and believed that he would shake things up. When asked ‘who cares about people like me’, Harris had a slight advantage over Trump, 52 percent to 48 percent. Alina Szmant, 78, a Democrat and retired scientist in Wilmington, North Carolina, told the Times she was excited about the possibility of voting for the first female president. She said: ‘Kamala is extremely well prepared to be an excellent president. As for Mr. Biden? She would have voted for him mostly because of her disgust for Mr. Trump. ‘[Biden] was not my first choice. He wasn’t even my second or third or fourth choice.’ While Sergio Villavicencio, a Marine veteran who lives in Arizona, told the Times he voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. The 40-year-old now plans to support Harris because she seems more concerned about his issues. He said: ‘If that person’s supposed to be representing all of us, and he’s picking and choosing who’s he’s representing, billionaires and Elon Musk and all these kinds of corporations. ‘He’s not speaking for the people. [Trump is] not talking to the people. He doesn’t give a damn about the people.’ Just last week, the Times published polling showing how Harris had moved ahead of Trump by four points in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Among likely voters in each state, 50 percent said they would likely vote for Harris while 46 for Trump. Based on the new figures, Harris has erased the lead Trump was building in the states before President Biden dropped out of the race. The first presidential debate between the two is set to be held in Philadelphia on September 10 and will be moderated by ABC News. The first vice presidential debate between Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio will take place on October 1 in New York City, and will be hosted by CBS.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has now closed the gap between her and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Poll Reveals Significant Change in Race Between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Four Crucial Swing States in the Sunbelt first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-poll-reveals-significant-change-in-race-between-donald-trump-and-kamala-harris-in-four-crucial-swing-states-in-the-sunbelt/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Shock-new-poll-shows-dramatic-shift-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:27:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":254344310,"title":"Walz makes pitch to Republican, Libertarian voters during Nebraska rally","text":"Minnesota Gov.

This guy is the opposite of everything here. \"I know where I'm at, and I know my family. Many of you can probably remember when Republicans talked about freedom. They meant it.

And while most of Nebraska is deep red, its 2nd Congressional District has gone for Democrats in recent years. Former President Obama won the 2nd Congressional District in 2008, splitting the state's vote for the first time since 1964 after strategically targeting it, and President Biden won its sole electoral vote in 2020.

I'm a better looking person than Kamala,\" Trump declared to the crowd, responding to a critique he had read from a Republican commentator.According to Trump, the commentator suggested that one of Harris' greatest assets in this election was her attractiveness. \"She said, Kamala has one big advantage, that she's a very beautiful woman,\" Trump recounted, before dismissing the notion with his own assessment of their relative appearances.Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign on Saturday via email for comment.Online commentators took to social media to mock Trump for not sticking to policy and making fun of Harris during the key swing state rally.This latest comment is part of a growing pattern of personal attacks Trump has leveled against Harris since she entered the 2024 race despite being warned by GOP analysts to stick to policy over attacks.The former president has taken to describing her as a \"radical liberal\" and has crafted a variety of unflattering nicknames, including \"Kamabla,\" \"Lyin' Kamala,\" and \"Laffin Kamala.\"Far from backing down from these personal jabs, Trump has doubled down on his approach. In a news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the former president defended his right to attack Harris personally.\"I think I am entitled to personal attacks,\" Trump stated bluntly. \"I don't have a lot of respect for [Harris]. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she'll be a terrible president.\"Trump attempted to justify his stance by accusing Harris of weaponizing the justice system against him and others. He also claimed that Harris had called him \"weird,\" though fact-checkers were quick to point out that it was actually her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who first began describing Republican policies as \"weird\" in late July.The former president's comments have raised eyebrows and concerns across the political spectrum. Trump's penchant for personal attacks has extended beyond mere nicknames and insults about intelligence.During an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference in July, Trump questioned Harris's racial identity, stating that she had only recently \"became a Black person.\" This comment drew particular criticism, given that Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, and is the first Black, Asian American, and woman to hold the office of vice president.Republican pollster Frank Luntz has warned that such comments could further damage Trump's already precarious standing with women voters. Luntz described the gender gap between Harris and Trump as a \"chasm,\" citing recent polling data that shows a significant disparity in support between male and female voters.\"Trump is actively going out of his way and insulting his way... and it's not a [gender] gap, it's a chasm. We've never seen this before,\" Luntz said in an interview with CNN. He went on to explain that Trump's personal attacks against Harris are particularly damaging, stating, \"Don't insult your opponent on how they look, how they speak, women can't stand that.\"Even some of Trump's former advisors are cautioning against this approach. Kellyanne Conway, who served as a senior consultant on Trump's 2016 campaign, recently appeared on Fox Business to discuss the race. She advocated for a different strategy, saying, \"The winning formula for President Trump is very plain to see it's fewer insults, more insights, and that policy contrast.\"Conway emphasized the importance of focusing on policy differences, noting that Trump has a \"two-to-one advantage over Biden-Harris on the economy and inflation, on the border, on Israel and Hamas.\" She suggested that if Trump would \"just contrast the policies, he'll win.\"As the 2024 presidential race intensifies, both candidates face significant challenges. For Harris, the task is to convince voters that she can effectively lead the country and implement her proposed policies. Her campaign has recently released a comprehensive economic policy agenda, focusing on lowering costs for American families. The proposal includes measures such as offering $25,000 to over a million first-time homebuyers with a history of timely rent payments, as well as expanding child tax credits and other tax incentives.For Trump, the challenge is to maintain discipline in his messaging and broaden his appeal beyond his core supporters. Recent polling averages show Harris leading Trump in five out of seven battleground states, buoyed by strong support from women and younger voters.The coming weeks will be crucial for both campaigns as they prepare for their first debate, scheduled for September 10 on ABC News. Trump has proposed additional debates on September 4 with Fox News and September 25 with NBC News, although the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these dates.","summary":"The former president admitted Harris was \"beautiful\" before saying he was \"better looking\" than her during a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-beautiful-mocked-pennsylvania-rally-1940750","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2449707/donald-trump-kamala-harris-frank-luntz.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:17:07","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":254343808,"title":"FBI searches the residence of a Russian-born advisor for Trump’s campaign in 2016.","text":"A former advisor to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims his Virginia home was raided by FBI agents this week. Dimitri Simes was mentioned over 130 times in Robert Mueller’s 2019 report on Russian interference in the presidential election. Simes recently stated to the Rappahannock News that he was not in the U.S. and was not informed in advance of the search that took place on Tuesday. He also insisted he’s not aware of being the focus of any law-enforcement investigation. The Russian-born policy analyst advised Trump’s 2016 campaign. The raid “clearly is an attempt to intimidate, not only somebody from Russia, but just anyone who goes against official policies and particularly against the deep state,” he later told the Russian government-owned Sputnik News. “My suspicion is that instead of trying to get me to come to the United States and to interrogate me — or even to arrest me — their real purpose is to make sure that I would not come back,” said Simes, who hasn’t been in the U.S. since October 2022 Simes also compared the raid of his property in Huntly, about an hour outside Washington D.C., to law enforcement crackdowns on Trump and other political figures connected to the ex-president and current Republican presidential nominee, including ex-NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. “A number of prominent Americans were subjected to searches or even put in jail, or made bankrupt,” he said. “So, this is the way American law enforcement is working today? If somebody goes against the political mainstream, in particular against the Biden administration, the punishment may be very swift.” His son, Dimitri Simes Jr, openly suggested the Biden administration is trying to intimate his dad and others who promote improving Russian-American relations. “The Biden regime is terrified of being called out over Ukraine and Israel,” the younger Simes posted on X Friday. He also alleged “elements of [President Biden’s] regime are trying to disrupt any possibility for de-escalation with Russia and plunge America into World War III.” Simes moved to the U.S. from the former Soviet Union in the 1970s. He worked as an informal foreign policy adviser under former President Richard Nixon before heading to the Center for the National Interest for nearly three decades. He began providing Trump’s campaign with informal counsel on foreign policy in 2016, including advising on a speech where Trump said he envisioned the U.S. having greater cooperation with Russia. Simes and the Center for the National Interest were featured prominently in the Mueller report, but were cleared of any wrongdoing. “The FBI conducted court-authorized law enforcement activity. We have no further comment as this is an ongoing matter,” an FBI spokesperson told the Rappahannock News.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA former advisor to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims his Virginia&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FBI searches the residence of a Russian-born advisor for Trump&#8217;s campaign in 2016. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/fbi-searches-the-residence-of-a-russian-born-advisor-for-trumps-campaign-in-2016/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FBI-raids-home-of-Russian-born-advisor-for-Trumps-2016-campaign.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:10:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":254345154,"title":"Trump zigzags between economic remarks and personal insults at rally in critical Pennsylvania","text":"WILKES-BARRE, Pa. - Former U.S. president Donald Trump on Saturday repeatedly swerved from a message focused on the economy into non sequiturs and personal attacks, including thrice declaring that he was better looking than Vice-President Kamala Harris. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Trump wound back and forth between hitting his points on economic policy and delivering a smattering of insults and impressions of U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron as he held a rally in northeastern Pennsylvania. The former president has seemed to struggle to adjust to his new opponent after Democrats replaced their nominee. Over the past week, he has diverged during campaign appearances away from the policies he was billed to speak about and instead diverted to a rotation of familiar attack lines and insults. As he attacked Democrats for inflation at the top of his speech, Trump asked his crowd of supporters, “You don’t mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? Joe Biden hates her.” Trump's rally in Wilkes-Barre was in a swath of a pivotal battleground state where he hopes conservative, white working-class voters near Biden’s hometown of Scranton will boost the Republican's chances of winning back the White House. His remarks Saturday came as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention that kicks off Monday in Chicago and will mark the party's welcoming of Harris as their nominee. Her replacement of Biden less than four months before the November election has reinvigorated Democrats and their coalition. It has also presented a new challenge for Trump. Trump hammered Harris on the economy, associating her with the Biden administration’s inflation woes and likening her latest proposal against price gouging to measures in communist nations. Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2024, in Asheville, N.C. (AP Photo/Matt Kelley) Trump has said a federal ban on price gouging for groceries would lead to food shortages, rationing and hunger. On Saturday asked why she hadn't worked to solve prices when she and Biden were sworn into office in 2021. “Day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. So why didn’t she do it then? So this is day 1,305,\" Trump said. To address high prices, Trump said he would sign an executive order on his first day sworn in as president “directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down, but we’re going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way,” he said. He predicted financial ruin for the country, and Pennsylvania in particular, if Harris wins, citing her past opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process commonly used in the state. Her campaign has tried to soften her stance on fracking, saying she would not ban it, even though that was her position when she was seeking the 2020 presidential nomination. “Your state’s going to be ruined anyway. She’s totally anti-fracking,” Trump said. But he also meandered, going from ripping the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 to doing impressions of Macron’s French accent. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective Trump laced in attacks on Harris’ laugh and said she was “not a very good wordsmith” and mocked the names of the CNN anchors who moderated the debate he had with Biden in June. When he began musing on Harris' recent image on the cover of Time magazine, he commented on the picture's resemblance to classic Hollywood icons Sophia Loren and Elizabeth Taylor and then took issue with a Wall Street Journal columnist remarking earlier this month on Harris' beauty. \"I am much better looking than her,\" Trump said, drawing laughs from the crowd. “I’m a better looking person than Kamala.\" He also took issue with the way his style is typically portrayed in news reports. “They will say he’s rambling. I don’t ramble. I’m a really smart guy,” he said. Trump’s Saturday rally was his fifth at the arena in Wilkes-Barre, the largest city in Luzerne County, where he has had victories in the past two elections. Biden bested Trump in neighboring Lackawanna County, where the Democrat has long promoted his working-class roots in Scranton. On Sunday, Harris plans a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh, with a stop in Rochester, a small town to the north. Trump has scheduled a visit Monday to a plant that manufactures nuclear fuel containers in York. Trump's running mate JD Vance is expected to be in Philadelphia that day. Some of Biden's loyal supporters in this former industrial city of 76,000 were upset to see party leaders put pressure on the president to step aside. Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips Diane Munley, 63, says she called dozens of members of Congress to vouch for Biden. Munley eventually came to terms with Biden's decision and is now very supportive of Harris. “I can’t deny the enthusiasm that’s been going on with this ticket right now. I am so into it,” Munley said. “It just wasn’t happening with Joe, and I couldn’t see it at the time because I was so connected to him.” Robert A. Bridy, 64, a laborer from Shamokin, Pa., traveled on Saturday to the rally to show support for Trump. He said the election feels tight in this state and added that his union and a close friend are trying to convince him to vote for Harris and other Democrats, but he has voted for Trump since 2016. Bridy called Trump a “working class guy like us.” Trump is a billionaire who built his fortune in real estate. “He’s a fighter,” Bridy said. “I’d like to see the closed borders. He doesn’t mess around. He goes at it right away and takes care of business the way it should be.” ___ Price reported from New York.

But those who followed her career closely saw a mixed record. As a prosecutor, she faced public outcry for refusing to seek the death penalty for a man convicted of killing a young police officer. And then as attorney-general, she upheld the state’s death penalty despite her personal opposition. Having reached the peaks of California state politics, she was elected to the US Senate the same night that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In her brief tenure, she made headlines for her searing and direct questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his testy 2018 confirmation hearings. “Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?” she asked the Trump appointee, in an exchange that cascaded across social media and late night television. Like Mr Obama, she was a young senator of limitless ambition. Halfway through her first term, she launched a presidential campaign. That campaign, like this one, was met with great fanfare. More than 20,000 people gathered in her hometown of Oakland, California, for its launch. But her effort to become the Democratic nominee sputtered and collapsed before the first presidential primary ballot was even cast. Ms Harris failed to carve out a clear political identity and distinguish herself in a field of rivals that included Mr Biden and left-wing senator Bernie Sanders. Critics said she endorsed a range of progressive policies but seemed to lack clear conviction. A breakthrough June 2019 debate moment in which she challenged her then-opponent Mr Biden’s record on the racial desegregation of schools resulted in a brief surge in polling. She attacked Mr Biden for an earlier campaign moment in which he fondly recalled working with two segregationist senators, before accusing him of opposing the bussing of students between schools to help integrate them. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Ms Harris said. “And that little girl was me.”","summary":"When Kamala Harris arrives at the Democratic National Convention this week, she will face many who spent years doubting her.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gqr48zld2o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6e22/live/305f3e80-5ce1-11ef-ad2e-252430c5dda7.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:04:55","author":"Courtney Subramanian","authors":["Courtney Subramanian"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.22},{"id":254343948,"title":"Supporters of former US president Donald Trump stand for the national anthem before a campaign rally at Mohegan Sun Arena in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on August 17, 2024","text":"Supporters of former US president Donald Trump stand for the national anthem before a campaign rally at Mohegan Sun Arena in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on August 17, 2024 | National News | guampdn.com Skip to main content You have permission to edit this image.

Attending night three of Taylor’s second round of London shows at Wembley, the Celebrity Big Brother star was spotted in a white sweater begging the Grammy winner to try her luck in the presidential race. Sporting her usual red hair, a pearl necklace and matching earrings, the star grinned as she posed in the jumper, which read ‘Taylor For President 2024’. The US presidential race is currently in full swing, with Democratic leader Kamala Harris and Republican leader and former President Donald Trump both campaigning for a seat in the White House. The election is due to take place on November 5, 2024. Sharon made a bold statement with her outfit choice on Saturday night (Pictures: X) Taylor is currently performing her final round of shows in London (Picture: TAS2024/Getty Images) Sharon is one of many A-list celebrities to be spotted at Taylor’s Eras Tour shows in recent weeks. Popular actor Idris Elba joined the crowd on Thursday along with One Day star Ambika Mod, Chicken Shop Date host Amelia Dimoldenberg and actress Jameela Jamil. Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran joined the singer on stage for a special performance to her 92,000 person strong crowd also on Thursday. The long-time friends playing a medley of Taylor’s song Everything Has Changed from her 2012 album, Red, and End Game from her 2018 record, Reputation, both of which Ed helped co-write and sing. They also played an emotional acoustic rendition of Ed’s 2014 track Thinking Out Loud.

The theory was spawned on social media after eagle-eyed fans saw a typewriter symbol featured on posters beside the Friday show date. Taylor and the star, real name Austin Richard Post, collaborated on the song Fortnight from her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, and included multiple typewriters in the music video. However, despite the strong theory, the singer did not welcome her friend on stage. She did, however, debut a new bedazzled bodysuit as part of the Midnights era. Taylor will finish her almost 150-date tour in December (Picture: TAS2024/Getty Images) The Eras Tour is the top-grossing music tour in history (Picture: Kate Green/Getty Images) The Zuhair Murad costume featured multiple sparkly moons and was accessorised with her signature knee-high sparkly boots and a garter belt. Taylor will take a brief break from the stage tomorrow night before returning on Monday and Tuesday in what will be her final London shows before returning to North America. The Eras Tour is believed to have grossed over $1.04 billion, making it the highest-grossing music tour in history. It began on March 17, 2023, and will conclude on December 8, 2024. In total, Taylor will have performed almost 150 shows on five continents. Got a story?

Kennedy Jr.","text":"It wasn’t long ago that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign—amid his unsuccessful lawsuit against Daily Kos to reveal the identity of a community member who dared criticize his interaction with neo-Nazis in Berlin—was taken seriously by the political press. He was polling favorably among the public, often with Republicans delighted at his anti-vaccine activism and shots at President Joe Biden. His independent presidential bid was being financed largely by Republican megadonors eager to see him eat into Biden’s support. As recently as early July, a Pew Research Center poll had him garnering 15% of the national vote. Now? He’s all but forgotten, a loser trying—and failing—to trade his endorsement to both Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris for a Cabinet position. Kennedy is, as we’ve long established, a bad man. He thinks America’s gun epidemic is caused by video games and antidepressant medications. He thinks Wi-Fi and cell phones cause brain tumors, like glioblastoma. (My father died of glioblastoma before either Wi-Fi or cell phones were common.) Kennedy thinks chemicals in drinking water make people gay or transgender. He said COVID-19 vaccine mandates were worse than Nazi Germany: “Even in Hitler’s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland. You can hide in an attic, like Anne Frank did.” Can someone please tell him what happened to Anne Frank? He even thinks I’m a CIA agent. And all that is before you get to his extremely dangerous anti-vaccine work. A March 2021 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which monitors online hate speech and disinformation, found that just 12 people were responsible for a whopping 73% of vaccine misinformation on Facebook—and No. 2 on their list? Kennedy. More recently, he “won” Politifact’s 2023 “Lie of the Year” for his body of conspiracy theories. It was a stretch that Kennedy would hurt the Democratic presidential ticket. Not only do his views often line up with the QAnon conspiratorial right, but also the main media outlets willing to platform him were right-wing. Indeed, his presence on conservative media was so pervasive that even Trump’s people sounded the alarm. “It is concerning and beyond logic,” Trump campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita told Politico. “They see an opening, they see a robust ecosystem on the right that they can pull votes from,” Matt Gorman, a former communications adviser for South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott’s presidential campaign, told Politico. “I think sometimes, Republicans tend to lull ourselves into believing, ‘Oh, he’s just taking votes from Biden.’ No, he’s going after everybody.” A Politico analysis of Kennedy’s media appearances the first four months of 2024 found that nearly half of his 69 media appearances were on right-wing outlets. The joke is on them. Kennedy draws support disproportionately from Trump, according to an April poll conducted for NBC News. That alignment in Kennedy, his base, and Trump was made extra clear when the two met in July, at the Republican National Convention, in a meeting brokered by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which should tell you everything you need to know. Here’s The New York Times: The independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with former President Donald J. Trump on Monday in Milwaukee, a remarkable encounter in the hours before Mr. Trump officially became the Republican nominee. The Kennedy campaign confirmed the meeting after early reports of the encounter stirred speculation that Mr. Kennedy was planning to drop out of the race and possibly endorse Mr. Trump. That story was published on July 15, and exactly one week later, The Washington Post reported that in that meeting and other conversations, Kennedy and Trump discussed an endorsement from Kennedy and a potential role—possibly a Cabinet position—in a second Trump administration. On Thursday, The Washington Post also reported that Kennedy had reached out to the Harris campaign for a meeting with the vice president “to discuss the possibility of serving in her administration, perhaps as a Cabinet secretary, if he throws his support behind her campaign and she wins, according to Kennedy campaign officials.” Trump has rebuffed Kennedy (so far), and the Harris campaign isn’t even entertaining a conversation. Harries and her allies are essentially ignoring him, as they should. Can you imagine his delusions in even asking? Kennedy has no other options. He’s nowhere to be seen on the trail. His campaign is broke. His poll numbers, which hovered around 10% before Biden ended his reelection bid, have cratered since Harris entered the race, falling to the 5% range. His friends in the conservative media are abandoning him, and he’s now making headlines only when it highlights his weirdness: Brain worms! Dead bear cub! Allegedly eating a dog! Hell, the bear-cub story isn’t just weird—he tried to preempt The New Yorker’s article about it by issuing a video of him telling the story to Roseanne Barr, of all people. Apparently, the racist comedian is the only person left who will talk to him. Kennedy was only a part of the 2024 cycle because right-wing media and donors pushed him out there and the traditional press took the bait. Now, that fad is over and he’s slinking back into ignominy.","summary":"It wasn’t long ago that Robert F.

Dimitri Simes, whose name came up over 130 times in former special counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 report into Russian interference in the presidential election, told the Rappahannock News he was out of the U.S. and wasn’t notified ahead of Tuesday’s search. He also insisted he’s not aware of being the focus of any law-enforcement investigation. The Russian-born policy analyst advised Trump’s 2016 campaign. The raid “clearly is an attempt to intimidate, not only somebody from Russia, but just anyone who goes against official policies and particularly against the deep state,” he later told the Russian government-owned Sputnik News. “My suspicion is that instead of trying to get me to come to the United States and to interrogate me — or even to arrest me — their real purpose is to make sure that I would not come back,” said Simes, who hasn’t been in the U.S. since October 2022 Simes also compared the raid of his property in Huntly, about an hour outside Washington D.C., to law enforcement crackdowns on Trump and other political figures connected to the ex-president and current Republican presidential nominee, including ex-NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. “A number of prominent Americans were subjected to searches or even put in jail, or made bankrupt,” he said. “So, this is the way American law enforcement is working today? If somebody goes against the political mainstream, in particular against the Biden administration, the punishment may be very swift.” His son, Dimitri Simes Jr, openly suggested the Biden administration is trying to intimate his dad and others who promote improving Russian-American relations. “The Biden regime is terrified of being called out over Ukraine and Israel,” the younger Simes posted on X Friday. He also alleged “elements of [President Biden’s] regime are trying to disrupt any possibility for de-escalation with Russia and plunge America into World War III.” Simes moved to the U.S. from the former Soviet Union in the 1970s. He worked as an informal foreign policy adviser under former President Richard Nixon before heading to the Center for the National Interest for nearly three decades. He began providing Trump’s campaign with informal counsel on foreign policy in 2016, including advising on a speech where Trump said he envisioned the U.S. having greater cooperation with Russia. Simes and the Center for the National Interest were featured prominently in the Mueller report, but were cleared of any wrongdoing. “The FBI conducted court-authorized law enforcement activity. We have no further comment as this is an ongoing matter,” an FBI spokesperson told the Rappahannock News.","summary":"FBI agents this week reportedly raided and searched the Virginia home of a Russian-born policy analyst who advised Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/fbi-raids-home-of-russian-born-advisor-for-trumps-2016-campaign/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-ybaeg0dmi-1723932652753.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723918366&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/eWNI4j6M-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-17 22:42:57","author":"Rich Calder","authors":["Rich Calder"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":254344294,"title":"Trump labels Harris as 'radical left lunatic' in Pennsylvania rally; says 'Biden hates Kamala'","text":"Former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday launched a fierce critique of Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden, stressing his disdain for their economic policies and leadership.Trump’s central claim was that Harris’s policies have worsened the economic situation for Americans. \"Joe Biden hates her,\" Trump declared.

(WCIA) – Illinois Republicans have been all in for former president Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who officially became the party’s presidential and vice presidential nominees, respectively, at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee last month. Illinois Republicans reiterated that support Thursday when they took over the fairgrounds. “People’s eyes are open and they want change,” Kathy Salvi, the state party’s chairwoman, said speaking to reporters after the Republican Day event at the fair. “The change that we will deliver is Trump-Vance and it will restore our economy, secure our border, cut down on the rampant crime and tamp down on the out of control inflation and all the mistakes of the Democrat supermajority here in Illinois are on account of bad policies.” Republicans are focused on changing the Democrats’ supermajorities in November by growing their numbers across the state. “Our base is fired up and enthusiastic, but it’s really broadening our tent and our reach, and the more and more the Democratic policies in this state are pushing people out,” Senate Minority Leader John Curran said. “We have to make sure we’re pulling them in and we’re not also pushing them away.” During Governor’s Day at the fair Wednesday, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel Chris Welch celebrated the Democrats’ historic supermajorities in both chambers. Democrats point to the new direction for the Republican Party under Trump as part of the reason for their success. Trump has lost Illinois by around 15 points in each of the last two elections. But House Republican Leader Tony McCombie wasn’t buying it. She doesn’t think having Trump at the top of the ticket will hurt Republicans chances. “It is because of Speaker Welch’s mismanagement of the crafting of a map,” McCombie said. “That has certainly nothing to do with President Trump.” Curran agreed, criticizing Democrats’ economic policies. “Voters are also going to think back to the robust economy under the Trump-Pence administration as compared to the out of control high cost of living that’s going on under the Biden-Harris administration coupled with the additional tax increases that Governor Pritzker and his democratic allies have forced on Illinois voters to pay for his migrant crisis, to pay for all these non-citizen welfare programs they put in place,” Curran said. While all eyes are on the presidential race this November, Republicans already started building hype for the next governor’s race in 2026, when they hope to unseat Governor JB Pritzker. “If we can show that we have a great turnout, we are going to get a great Republican candidate,” McCombie said. “We will turn the state around. I promise you that. It might not happen this year, but it is going to start happening because people are tired of what is going on here.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill.

On Saturday, the campaign announced it is reserving $370 million in advertising from September to November. The Harris campaign decided to book television advertisements early so it could secure the best ad spots on the most viewed programs including, but not limited to, the major sports, ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy, Abbott Elementary, and the Golden Bachelorette, as well as CBS’s Survivor. Daytime Fox News viewers are also being targeted in the ad blitz, as campaign officials believe that is when the network has a “more moderate audience.” Harris campaign officials said it is a strategic move to court Republicans who aligned with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary. President Joe Biden and Harris have made numerous efforts to appeal to Republicans who supported Haley over former President Donald Trump in the primary and have criticized the GOP presidential nominee for not doing enough to earn the support of Haley fans. Television ads will account for $170 million, but as Harris has leaned into online campaigning to target young voters, her team is reserving even more money, $200 million, for digital advertising. By comparison, nearly 80% of the 2020 Biden campaign’s initial reservation was used on television ads. “This is a modern campaign in 2024 and we’re not just stuck in the times of old, where 80 percent of the budget has to be on television,” Harris’s principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, told the New York Times. In the fall, Harris will launch more national ads in addition to continuing to advertise in swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. She will also spend more than double her $150 million summer ad blitz.

(AP) — Tim Walz touted his Nebraska roots Saturday in his first trip back to his home state since becoming the Democratic vice presidential nominee, and drew sharp contrasts between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Playing to the crowd, Walz noted his love of Nebraska football and joked about the historical significance of the Stonehenge replica built out of classic cars known as Carhenge that sits near where he taught in the Panhandle. He then emphasized the values he learned growing up of helping neighbors and minding everyone’s own business. “More than anything else — just like here in Nebraska — Minnesota’s strength comes from our values,” he said about the state he serves as governor. Walz stressed that he and Harris believe in helping all Americans succeed — not just the millionaires and billionaires he said Trump wants to help. It was all part of his appeal for the lone electoral vote in Omaha’s swing Second Congressional District that can be split off from the rest of the heavily Republican state. Going after Republicans as intrusive in people’s everyday lives, Walz said the fact they want to make decisions about Americans’ health care including abortion rights and try to hurt Social Security is “not just weird, it’s dangerous. And when they try to overturn elections, that’s not just weird, it’s un-American.” He said Trump and his fellow Republicans are “super concerned with our bedrooms, our exam rooms and libraries.” Nebraska Democrats Chairwoman Jane Kleeb joked near the start of the event that Omaha has a new nickname, “Kamaha,” as she encouraged everyone at the rally to work hard to elect Harris and Walz in November. Supporters hope Walz’s knowledge of rural America — he grew up in the small towns of Valentine and Butte in the Sandhills — could help Democrats appeal to wide swaths of Republican strongholds where they have rarely been competitive in recent elections. His appearance in Omaha also reinforces the campaign’s interest in securing the single electoral vote that comes with winning the swing 2nd District that Joe Biden secured in 2020 and Barack Obama in 2008. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is expected to visit Omaha next week for a private fundraiser hosted by Nebraska Sen. Pete Ricketts. “I think it just proves the importance that we as the blue dot — CD2 — has,” Omaha teacher Wes Jensen said. Former state Sen. Al Davis, who represented the Panhandle town of Alliance where Walz taught for six years before moving to Minnesota after meeting his wife, said he thinks Walz “can speak to rural parts of the country in ways that other candidates never could do.” He added, “so I’m hoping that that will turn some votes in rural parts of Nebraska and across the Midwest.” Alliance residents are planning a local rally of their own next week to watch Walz speak at the Democratic convention in Chicago. Even before Walz took the stage in Omaha, the Republican National Committee accused the Kamala Harris-Walz ticket of not representing “Midwestern values” and said Nebraska voters “will send a resounding message” when they help put the former president back in office. Bill McCamley of Lincoln said he remembers that Walz, now the governor of Minnesota, was interested in government when he taught him social studies in the seventh grade in Valentine but he never expected him to go on to become governor or perhaps vice president someday. McCamley said Walz came up with the idea on his own in the seventh grade to build a veterans memorial for everyone from Cherry County who had served in the military, and then he convinced local leaders to build a sidewalk for the memorial. “I went with him, but he did the job. He talked to them and said this is that idea. This is what I want to do,” McCamley said. “Then he got that he got them to agree to go along with it. I thought that was pretty impressive.” McCamley had to call the state Democratic Party to get access to Saturday’s rally after the online registration system was shut down once 10,000 had expressed interest in attending the rally at a theater in the Omaha suburb of La Vista that’s only designed to hold about 2,500 people. However unlikely it is, McCamley hoped for a chance to reconnect with his former student and jokingly confront him about a valentine he gave his daughter, Julie Long, when the two dated in the seventh grade. Long said she hung onto the valentine Walz gave her for a lot of years because the message declaring, “Ours is a strange and wonderful relationship,” made her laugh. On the inside, the card said, “You’re strange and I’m wonderful.” “That kind of sums up his humor,” said Long who used to compete with Walz to see which one of them was smarter because her dad was a teacher and his was the superintendent there. They both moved away in high school and Long lost track of Walz — outside of a chance meeting when both of them lived in the Panhandle — until she noticed him showing up in the news as governor dealing with difficult problems like the protests that followed George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police. After dealing with that unrest and managing to pass key priorities like protections for abortion and free lunches for school kids, Walz has a long list of accomplishments that will appeal to Democratic voters. But Long said Walz might also appeal to Republicans because he is smart, funny and cares about helping people. “I think if people are willing to listen — really listen — to the things that he says and, and those kinds of things, that it will open some doors,” said Long who lives in Hot Springs, South Dakota, and won’t be able to accompany her dad to the rally.","summary":"Supporters hope Walz's knowledge of rural America could help Democrats appeal to wide swaths of Republican strongholds where they have rarely been competitive in recent elections.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/08/17/walz-touts-nebraska-roots-in-visit-to-his-home-state-where-theres-a-battle-over-one-electoral-vote/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TCFallback.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 22:35:32","author":"Josh Funk","authors":["Josh Funk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.059},{"id":254344186,"title":"Trump zigzags between economic remarks and personal insults at rally in critical Pennsylvania","text":"WILKES-BARRE, Pa. — Former President Donald Trump on Saturday again sought to deliver a campaign message focused on the economy, but the Republican repeatedly swerved into non-sequiturs and personal attacks, including twice declaring that he was better looking than Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump wound back and forth between hitting his points on economic policy and delivering a smattering of insults and impressions of President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron as he held a rally in northeastern Pennsylvania. As he attacked Democrats for inflation, he asked his crowd of supporters, “You don’t mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? Joe Biden hates her.” Trump’s rally was in a swath of the pivotal battleground state where he hopes conservative, white working-class voters near Biden’s hometown will boost the Republican’s chances of winning back the White House. His remarks Saturday came as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention that kicks off Monday in Chicago and will mark the party’s welcoming of Harris as their nominee. Her replacement of Biden with less than four months before the November election reinvigorated Democrats and their coalition, and has presented a new challenge for Trump. Trump laced in attacks on Harris’ laugh and said she was “not a very good wordsmith” and mocked the names of the CNN anchors who moderated the debate he had with Biden in June. He also hammered Harris on the economy, associating her with the Biden administration’s inflation woes and likening her latest proposal against price gouging to measures in communist nations. Trump has said a federal ban on price gouging for groceries would lead to food shortages, rationing and hunger and on Saturday asked why she hadn’t worked to solve prices when she and Biden were sworn into office in 2021. “Day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. So why didn’t she do it then? So this is day 1,305,” Trump said. He maundered in his remarks from the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 to doing impressions of Macron’s French accent. But he took issue with the way his free-wheeling style is typically portrayed in news reports. “They will say he’s rambling. I don’t ramble. I’m a really smart guy.” “I don’t ramble.” He predicted financial ruin for the country and Pennsylvania in particular if Harris wins, citing her past opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process. “Your state’s going to be ruined anyway. She’s totally anti-fracking,” Trump said. In 2016 and 2020, Trump crushed his Democratic rivals in the county that is home to blue-collar Wilkes-Barre. The Rust Belt region, home to Biden’s native Scranton, offers Trump hope and helps him spotlight Democratic vulnerabilities after the president ended his reelection bid and Harris launched her campaign. Her campaign has tried to soften her stance on fracking, saying she would not ban it, even though that was her position when she was seeking the 2020 presidential nomination. Some Democrats in Pennsylvania acknowledge the challenges but say the economy is what concerns most people in the area. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis said in an interview that voters are “really fired up.” David Harris’ rally in Philadelphia to introduce her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, along with 36 field offices, including several in more Republican-leaning parts of the state. “The energy has clearly shifted in a dramatic way toward Vice President Harris,” Davis said. He argued that Trump “just goes on rambling rants and just makes personal attacks on Harris.” On Sunday, Harris plans a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh, with a stop in Rochester, a small town to the north. Trump has scheduled a visit Monday to a plant that manufactures nuclear fuel containers in York. Trump’s running mate JD Vance is expected to be in Philadelphia that day. Trump’s Saturday rally is his fifth at the arena in Wilkes-Barre, the largest city in Luzerne County, where he has had victories the past two elections. Biden bested Trump in neighboring Lackawanna County, where the Democrat has long promoted his working-class roots in Scranton. Some of Biden’s loyal supporters in this former industrial city of 76,000 were upset to see party leaders put pressure the president to step aside. Diane Munley, 63, says she called dozens of members of Congress to vouch for Biden. Munley eventually came to terms with Biden’s decision and is now very supportive of Harris. “I can’t deny the enthusiasm that’s been going on with this ticket right now. I am so into it,” Munley said. “It just wasn’t happening with Joe, and I couldn’t see it at the time because I was so connected to him.” She said she does not know a Democrat or even independent in her circle of a couple hundred people who is not fully committed to Harris and Walz. “We are all-in on Kamala Harris,” Munley said. “All in 110%.” Robert A. Bridy, 64, a laborer from Shamokin, Pennsylvania, traveled to the rally to show support for Trump. He said the election feels tight in this state and added that his union and a close friend are trying to convince him to vote for Harris and other Democrats, but he has voted for Trump since 2016. “It’s close. You can’t change Democrats’ minds no matter what. They’ve got a one-track mind, and that’s it,” he said. Bridy called Trump a “working class guy like us.” Trump is a billionaire who built his fortune in real estate. “He’s a fighter,” Bridy said. “I’d like to see the closed borders. He doesn’t mess around. He goes at it right away and takes care of business the way it should be.” ___ Price reported from New York.

By JOSH FUNK Associated Press August 17, 2024 at 10:18PM Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks at a campaign rally, Saturday, Aug. 17, 2024, at The Astro in La Vista, Neb. (Bonnie Ryan/Associated Press) OMAHA, Neb. — Tim Walz touted his Nebraska roots Saturday in his first trip back to his home state since becoming the Democratic vice presidential nominee, and drew sharp contrasts between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Playing to the crowd, Walz noted his love of Nebraska football and joked about the historical significance of the Stonehenge replica built out of classic cars known as Carhenge that sits near where he taught in the Panhandle. He then emphasized the values he learned growing up of helping neighbors and minding everyone's own business. ''More than anything else — just like here in Nebraska — Minnesota's strength comes from our values,'' he said about the state he serves as governor. Walz stressed that he and Harris believe in helping all Americans succeed — not just the millionaires and billionaires he said Trump and the GOP want to help. It was all part of his appeal for the lone electoral vote in Omaha's swing Second Congressional District that can be split off from the rest of the heavily Republican state that Democrats Joe Biden secured in 2020 and Barack Obama in 2008. That swing vote is sure to be contested. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is expected to visit Omaha next week for a private fundraiser hosted by Nebraska Sen. Pete Ricketts. ''I think it just proves the importance that we as the blue dot — CD2 — has,'' Omaha teacher Wes Jensen said. Going after Republicans as intrusive in people's everyday lives, Walz said the fact they want to make decisions about Americans' health care including abortion rights and try to hurt Social Security is ''not just weird, it's dangerous. And when they try to overturn elections, that's not just weird, it's un-American.'' He said Trump and his fellow Republicans are ''super concerned with our bedrooms, our exam rooms and libraries.'' Nebraska Democrats Chairwoman Jane Kleeb joked near the start of the event that Omaha has a new nickname, ''Kamaha,'' as she encouraged everyone at the rally to work hard to elect Harris and Walz in November. Supporters hope Walz's knowledge of rural America — he grew up in the small towns of Valentine and Butte in the Sandhills — could help Democrats appeal to wide swaths of Republican strongholds where they have rarely been competitive in recent elections. Former state Sen. Al Davis, who represented the Panhandle town of Alliance where Walz taught for six years before moving to Minnesota after meeting his wife, said he thinks Walz ''can speak to rural parts of the country in ways that other candidates never could do.\" He added, \"so I'm hoping that that will turn some votes in rural parts of Nebraska and across the Midwest.\" Alliance residents are planning a local rally of their own next week to watch Walz speak at the Democratic convention in Chicago. Related Coverage Elections House Republicans launch probe into Tim Walz’s relationship to China News & Politics Tim Walz admitted to drunken driving in 1995. But his 2006 congressional campaign claimed he didn’t. News & Politics Formed by Nebraska small towns, Tim Walz brings unconventional background to race Even before Walz took the stage in Omaha, the Republican National Committee accused the Harris-Walz ticket of not representing ''Midwestern values'' and said Nebraska voters ''will send a resounding message'' when they help put the former president back in office. Bill McCamley of Lincoln said he remembers that Walz was interested in government when he taught him social studies in the seventh grade in Valentine but he never expected him to go on to become governor or perhaps vice president someday. McCamley said Walz came up with the idea on his own in the seventh grade to build a veterans memorial for everyone from Cherry County who had served in the military, and then he convinced local leaders to build a sidewalk for the memorial. ''I went with him, but he did the job. He talked to them and said this is that idea. This is what I want to do,'' McCamley said. ''Then he ... got them to agree to go along with it. I thought that was pretty impressive.'' McCamley had to call the state Democratic Party to get access to Saturday's rally after the online registration system was shut down once 10,000 had expressed interest in attending the rally at a theater in the Omaha suburb of La Vista that's only designed to hold about 2,500 people. However unlikely it was, McCamley hoped for a chance to reconnect with his former student and jokingly confront him about a valentine he gave his daughter, Julie Long, when the two dated in the seventh grade. Long said she hung onto the valentine Walz gave her for a lot of years because the message declaring, ''Ours is a strange and wonderful relationship,'' made her laugh. On the inside, the card said, ''You're strange and I'm wonderful.'' ''That kind of sums up his humor,'' said Long who used to compete with Walz to see which one of them was smarter because her dad was a teacher and his was the superintendent there. They both moved away in high school and Long lost track of Walz — outside of a chance meeting when both of them lived in the Panhandle — until she noticed him showing up in the news as governor dealing with difficult problems like the protests that followed George Floyd's murder at the hands of Minneapolis police. After dealing with that unrest and managing to pass key priorities like protections for abortion and free lunches for school kids, Walz has a long list of accomplishments that will appeal to Democratic voters. But Long said Walz might also appeal to Republicans because he is smart, funny and cares about helping people. ''I think if people are willing to listen — really listen — to the things that he says and, and those kinds of things, that it will open some doors,'' said Long who now lives in Hot Springs, South Dakota.","summary":"Tim Walz touted his Nebraska roots Saturday in his first trip back to his home state since becoming the Democratic vice presidential nominee, and drew sharp contrasts between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/tim-walz-is-returning-to-his-home-state-where-theres-a-battle-over-a-key-nebraska-electoral-vote/601117218","image":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/startribunemedia/GE2JHFVMINGXXFYMJWLVH3WK2M.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 22:18:00","author":"van Gogh","authors":["van Gogh"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.012},{"id":254342264,"title":"Why JD Vance and Tim Walz Need to Pay Attention to Veterans","text":"Veteran Jim Whaley explained to Newsweek on Saturday why vice presidential candidates Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz should pay attention to veterans in the upcoming election.For the first time in two decades, Republicans and Democrats have former military men on their presidential tickets with Vance, former President Donald Trump's running mate, and Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.Whaley, the CEO of Mission Roll Call, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for veterans' issues and relies on their own polling to do so, told Newsweek via telephone on Saturday afternoon that having Vance, 40, and Walz, 60, as vice presidential candidates, \"sends a great message that we value and continue to value the importance of service to the country.\"Vance served in the Marine Corps as a combat correspondent in Iraq between August 2005 and February 2006. Meanwhile, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at the age of 17 and served for 24 years before retiring in 2005.Whaley, who served two decades in the U.S. Army, explained how the vice presidential candidates from both parties can best champion veterans' issues.\"I think most veterans would like to see a robust discussion on the issues that are most important to veterans and we poll our veterans across the nation and they will tell you that it's important that we have a discussion around veteran benefits, around veteran homelessness, and then access to health care,\" Whaley said.But how much of a difference could veteran voters and voters who care about veterans' issues make in November's election?\"Of the veterans that we poll, 97 percent are registered to vote,\" Whaley said. \"When you think about 18.5 million veterans in our country, that's not a small number.\"Whaley said that number gets bigger when you factor in veterans' families, caregivers, spouses and dependents.\"That's a sizable block of voters that feel that veterans issues are very important,\" he said.When asked how Vance plans to champion veterans' issues, Luke Schroeder, a spokesman for the senator, told Newsweek via email on Saturday afternoon: \"The Trump-Vance administration will do more for veterans and our military than any other administration in modern history. They'll ensure veterans receive the respect, treatment, and benefits they deserve, while also pursuing peace through strength on the world stage to prevent unnecessary wars in the future.\"He continued: \"In his first term, President Trump's VA Mission Act passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. The legislation expanded veterans' access to quality care and cut needless red tape, but Tim Walz voted no. That's not the kind of leadership veterans need in Washington.\"Newsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment on Saturday afternoon.What Issues Are Veterans Facing?According to Whaley, food insecurity, underemployment, homelessness, and suicide are some of the issues plaguing the veteran community.\"We have nearly 1. 4 million veterans struggling with food insecurity in our country and over 60 percent of veterans report that they're underemployed due to a systemic mismatching in their skills and education,\" he said.Even current servicemembers struggle with food insecurity. Whaley said, \"Twenty-four percent of active-duty military have food insecurity issues.\"There are anywhere from 30,000 to 40,000 veterans experiencing homelessness every night and 17 to 20 veterans take their lives every single day, Whaley said.\"It should not be a surprise that we're having struggles as a nation in recruitment efforts, all those things are intertwined,\" he said, adding that the struggles that veterans are facing \"is a national security issue that should be discussed and should be debated.Last fiscal year, the military services collectively missed its recruitment goals by roughly 41,000 recruits, according to U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) official Ashish Vazirani.\"It would be great if both campaigns present a plan to help veterans transition to civilian life because right now that's not working,\" Whaley added.Vance/Walz Military Service DramaAs the race to the White House heats up, Vance has criticized a recently resurfaced comment Walz made about being in combat from a political event in 2018, accusing the Minnesota governor of lying about his military service.\"What bothers me about Tim Waltz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance told reporters in Michigan on August 7.Speaking about gun control, Walz, who was a U.S. representative at the time, said in the 2018 clip, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\"However, Walz never went to war. The Harris-Walz campaign recently said that the Minnesota governor \"misspoke\" at the time and Walz previously acknowledged that he never saw combat in an NPR News interview, in which he said, \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did.\"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a Democrat and a veteran himself said on CNN last Sunday a veteran disparaging another veteran \"goes against certainly everything I learned during my time in service.\"Meanwhile, at a campaign event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Walz said, \"To anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words: Thank you for your service and sacrifice.\"When asked how veterans felt about the recent Vance/Walz drama, Whaley said that he could only go based on the conversations he's been having with veterans as Mission Roll Call has not polled this question.\"From the ones I speak to at different events and just normal life and those that I've served with and others we want to see the big problem solved,\" Whaley said. \"We want to see the issues that are really affecting veterans' lives. If you're struggling to get food on the table, I don't think you really are paying attention to this banter that's going on.\"Whaley did say that he thinks Vance and Walz \"honor and love their time and service.\"\"They both signed a blank check to serve their country. It would be great if we can, and I know it's an election year and this could be naive, but it would be great if...both candidacies talk about what they're going to do about changing the trajectory that veterans are on right now,\" he added.Mission Roll Call wants to make veterans' voices heard on the local, state and federal level, Whaley said who urged veterans to visit Mission Roll Call's website to participate in polls, volunteer and/or get involved with other organizations.","summary":"Veteran Jim Whaley explained to Newsweek on Saturday why Vance and Walz should pay attention to veterans in the upcoming election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-tim-walz-pay-attention-veterans-1940721","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2452195/vance-walz.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 22:09:01","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.067},{"id":254342304,"title":"China’s post-Gaza war ambitions will have to include Israel eventually: experts","text":"With the Israel-Gaza war in its 10th month and the prospect of a widening in the conflict to include Iran, Washington and Beijing have stepped up their diplomatic efforts in recent weeks to exert their influence and achieve a ceasefire. Israel has welcomed the interventions of the United States, its long-standing ally, promising to send negotiators to ceasefire and hostage release talks backed by the US, Qatar and Egypt. But Tel Aviv largely gave the cold shoulder to a Beijing-brokered reconciliation deal between rival Palestinian groups including Hamas and Fatah – reached in early July in readiness for a potential agreement on post-war governance. Chinese diplomats have also largely avoided stops in Israel in their rounds of shuttle diplomacy to find an end to the crisis. After decades of a balanced approach to Middle East diplomacy, China’s unambiguous support for the Palestinian cause in the Israel-Gaza war has increased Beijing’s leverage with the Arab nations and Iran, but at what cost to its ties with Tel Aviv, now and after the war? There has been little high-level communication between Tel Aviv and Beijing since the war in Gaza started with the attack on Israel last October by the militant group Hamas, which took hundreds of hostages and left 1,200 Israelis dead. China has not condemned the Hamas attack – a major concern for Israel – and Beijing’s diplomatic efforts have been largely focused on the Palestinian side and the Arab nations. There was further strain on the relationship just a week after the reconciliation deal was signed, when Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. The killing, which Iran and its allies blamed on Israel, drew Beijing’s strong condemnation. Observers pointed out that frosty relations between the two sides were to be expected, given China’s Arab-leaning positions and Israel’s enduring alliance with the US, which is in competition with China on numerous fronts. The only ministerial-level exchange since the war began was a phone call between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Israeli counterpart on October 23 last year, on the same day as a similar call to the Palestinian Authority’s foreign minister. As part of Beijing’s efforts to play a mediation role in the conflict, special envoy Zhai Jun was on a tour of the region at the same time. His stops did not include Israel. Former US defence adviser Jesse Marks, a non-resident fellow with the Stimson Centre’s China programme, said Beijing historically had balanced its ties with both the Israelis and Palestinians. “However, since October 7, China’s diplomatic engagements have leaned towards a pro-Arab stance, straining relations with Israel,” he said. “China may still be open to rebuilding ties with Israel if there is constructive dialogue about the future of a Palestinian state. Given the current conditions, significant state-level rapprochement between China and Israel seems unlikely.” Galia Lavi, deputy director of the Diane and Guilford Glazer Israel-China Policy Centre at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), predicted Tel Aviv’s alignment with Washington would continue, along with its further move away from Beijing. “Israel looks to secure its standing in the area in terms of security and the economy. China cannot guarantee Israel’s security and may even undermine it by supporting Israel’s enemies. That leaves us with the economy,” she said. “There is only room for cooperation with China where the economy does not conflict with security.” Lavi added that the US had proven that it was “Israel’s best friend”, and that “Israel will find it difficult to refuse the Americans’ demands”. Meanwhile, China has been stepping up its wooing of the Arab nations in the region and has accused Israel of causing a humanitarian crisis. The growing animosity between Beijing and Tel Aviv has also been evident in recent opinion polls in Israel. An INSS survey in May showed that around 54 per cent of Israelis have started to consider China as an unfriendly or hostile country. According to Fan Hongda, a professor at Shanghai International Studies University’s Middle East Studies Institute, the souring of China-Israel relations began earlier, when Tel Aviv found itself caught up in the growing rivalry between Beijing and Washington. “Frankly speaking, China-Israel’s ‘honeymoon phase’ has long gone,” he said, adding that the distrust would last beyond the war, with “no favourable conditions in sight for a significant warmth”. Ties between China and Israel grew rapidly after they established diplomatic relations in 1991. Trade volumes doubled from 2013 to 2022, catapulting China into second place behind the US, Israel’s biggest trading partner. Technology played a crucial role in the growing bond between the two countries, as China’s ambitions coincided with Israel’s desire to capitalise on its partnerships with the Chinese tech giants. But when China-US rivalries ramped up under former president Donald Trump, Israel’s cooperation with China came under ever-closer scrutiny. In 2019, under pressure from Washington, Israel opened a national security investigation into foreign investment, especially in technology, targeting the growing inflow of Chinese money. The pressure continued under Joe Biden’s administration. In January 2022, Israel agreed to notify the US of any major deals with China. Later that year saw the launch of the US-Israel Strategic High-Level Dialogue on Technology, as the US tightened control over technological cooperation with China and put pressure on its allies to do the same. John Calabrese, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said Beijing’s outreach to Tel Aviv had been frustrated by Israel’s move to position itself as a trusted partner to the US, “akin to other American allies like the EU and Japan”. According to Fan, China’s ambition to expand its influence and become an alternative to the US in the Middle East makes it inevitable that Beijing will eventually extend an olive branch to Tel Aviv. “If China wishes to contribute to the resolution of the Palestinian issue, it must cooperate with Israel. Without Israel’s endorsement, any effort to resolve the Palestinian issue would be futile,” Fan said. Israel must also not underestimate Beijing’s influence in the region, even though Tel Aviv has largely relied on Washington’s grand plan to achieve normalisation between Israel and the Arab nations. China’s relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia have continued to grow – from economic ties to defence – since Beijing brokered a peace deal between the two regional powers last year. Iran – Israel’s strategic enemy – has become reliant on China for its oil trade, giving Beijing some leverage in the relationship. In the aftermath of Hamas leader Haniyeh’s killing, Wang called his Iranian counterpart Ali Bagheri to offer support and give Beijing’s backing to Iran’s right to defend its sovereignty. The two foreign ministers exchanged similar phone calls in April after Israel’s assault on Tehran’s embassy in Syria. Simone Lipkind, a research associate in Middle Eastern studies at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations, said the economy may be key to unlocking strained Israel-China ties. In an opinion piece for the US-based magazine Time, Lipkind said both had financial incentives to maintain a relationship, given the two countries’ sluggish economic outlook. “Israel’s war has shrunk its GDP and hurt its credit rating, creating obstacles for Israeli firms looking to raise funds … Meanwhile, Chinese investors are facing a lagging domestic economy and pursuing investment opportunities abroad,” she wrote. “This dynamic could generate a mutual – albeit reluctant – desire to bolster commercial ties.” China remains Israel’s second-largest trading partner and is a major investor, adding weight to its sway over the Israeli economy, according to Marks, the former US defence adviser. “A crucial factor is the economic relationship between Beijing and Tel Aviv. China and Israel have invested billions in science, technology, and research, which provides China with considerable leverage in Israel’s economy,” he said.","summary":"Beijing’s diplomatic efforts since conflict’s outbreak have been weighted towards its Arab partners and disregarded by Tel Aviv.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3274690/chinas-post-gaza-war-ambitions-will-have-include-israel-eventually-experts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/16/43aea1fe-fb33-46a2-bd7e-8f239e9040d6_b0f9a89f.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2023/06/15/WEB_VERSION_0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-17 22:00:16","author":"Zhao Ziwen","authors":["Zhao Ziwen"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":254342572,"title":"Pro-Palestinian ‘uncommitted’ movement at a standstill with top Democrats","text":"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Of the thousands of delegates expected to gather Monday at the Democratic National Convention, just 36 will belong to the “uncommitted” movement sparked by dissatisfaction with President Joe Biden‘s handling of the Israel–Hamas war. But that small core has outsized influence. Anger over U.S. backing for Israel’s offensive in Gaza could generate unwelcome images for convention organizers, with raucous protests expected outside and potentially inside the Chicago arena where Harris will accept the nomination Thursday. Top Democrats have spent weeks meeting with “uncommitted” voters and their allies — including a previously unreported sit-down between Vice President Kamala Harris and the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan — in an effort to respond to criticism in key swing states like Michigan, which has a significant Arab American population. Weeks of meetings and calls between pro-Palestinian activists and the Harris campaign have yielded progress in some areas, but their core policy demands remain unmet. The activists want Harris to endorse an arms embargo to Israel and a permanent cease-fire. Harris has supported Biden’s negotiations for a cease-fire but rejected an arms embargo. Rima Mohammad, one of Michigan’s two “uncommitted” delegates, said she sees the convention as a chance to share their movement’s concerns with the party leadership. “It is a way for protesters outside to be able to share their frustration with the party,” she said. The Democratic nominee meets a key Arab American mayor Questions remain about the leverage “uncommitted” voters hold now that Biden has stepped aside and Harris has taken his place. Democrats have seen a significant surge in enthusiasm for Harris’ campaign and concerns about voter apathy in key areas, such as Detroit’s large Black population, appear to have diminished. But Harris and her team have still made communication with Arab American leaders a priority.During a campaign trip to Michigan last week, Harris met with Abdullah Hammoud, the 34-year-old mayor of Dearborn, a Detroit suburb that has the largest number of Arab Americans of any city in the United States. The meeting was disclosed by a person who was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The person familiar with the meeting did not provide specific details but said the focus was on Harris’ potential policy, if elected, on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Hammoud declined to comment. “Vice President Harris supports the deals currently on the table for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and for the release of hostages,” her campaign said in a statement. “She will continue to meet with leaders from Palestinian, Muslim, Israeli and Jewish communities, as she has throughout her vice presidency.” According to a source familiar with convention planning, two panel discussions will take place during the convention in Chicago: one addressing Arab and Palestinian issues with leaders from the “Uncommitted” movement, and another focused on Jewish American issues, including the rise in antisemitism and hate speech. Campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez on Thursday held separate one-on-one meetings with leaders in the Arab American community and “uncommitted” movement in metro Detroit. “They are listening and we are talking,” said Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News, who met with Chavez Rodriguez. “But none of us can garner votes in the community without public statements from Harris. She doesn’t need us; she can win over votes by saying and doing the right thing.” According to Siblani, Chavez Rodriguez agreed that “the killing has to stop.” In response, Siblani said he pressed: “How? There is no plan.” Lavora Barnes, the Democratic chair in Michigan, said the party would “continue working toward our goal of coming together to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot.” “We are committed to continuing these conversations with community leaders, activists and organizations because we want to ensure that everyone in the Michigan Democratic Party has a seat at the table,” Barnes said in a statement. No agreement on an arms embargo Some on the Democratic Party’s left have called for including a moratorium on the use of U.S.-made weapons by Israel in the platform of policy goals that will be approved during next week’s convention. But such language isn’t included in a draft platform party officials released earlier this summer, and it’s unlikely that those close to Harris’ campaign would endorse including it. The Uncommitted National Movement has also requested a speaking slot at the convention for a doctor who has worked on the frontlines in Gaza, along with a leader of the movement. And they have asked for a meeting with Harris “to discuss updating the Gaza policy in hopes of stopping the flow of unconditional weapons and bombs” to Israel, said Abbas Alawieh, another “uncommitted” delegate from Michigan and one of the founders of the movement. Before a Harris rally just outside Detroit last week, Alawieh and Layla Elabed, co-founders of the movement, briefly met with the vice president. They requested a formal meeting with Harris and urged her to support an embargo on weapons shipments to Israel. According to them, Harris seemed open to the idea of meeting. However, shortly after news of the meeting became public, Harris’ national security adviser Phil Gordon reaffirmed that she does not support an arms embargo. Alawieh mentioned Wednesday that the group has not received any further response from Harris’ team or the DNC regarding their requests ahead of the convention. Since then, leaders of the “Uncommitted” movement have met with senior staff from the DNC and the Harris campaign to discuss their requests. “I hope she doesn’t miss the opportunity to unite the party,” said Alawieh. The Trump campaign continues its outreach Elsewhere in metro Detroit this week, Massad Boulos, the father-in-law of Trump’s youngest daughter and now a leader in his Arab American outreach, was holding meetings with various community groups. Boulos has come to Michigan often for the outreach, along with Arab Americans for Trump chair Bishara Bahbah. According to Bahbah, their pitch highlights the situation in Gaza under Biden’s administration and a promise from Trump’s team to give the community a seat at the table if he wins. “We have been told by the Trump circle, which is not part of the campaign, that in return for our votes, there would be a seat at the table and a voice to be heard,” said Bahbah. But any apparent political opportunity for Trump in the Arab American community or the “uncommitted” movement may be limited by his past remarks and policies. Many Arabs remain offended by Trump’s ban, while in office, on immigration from several majority Muslim countries as well as remarks they consider insulting. Trump also has criticized Biden for not being a strong enough supporter of Israel.

The group, known as Storm-1679, generated articles and social-media comments to shape public opinion around Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, according to OpenAI. In addition to targeting 2024 U.S. presidential candidates, OpenAI said Storm-1679 also generated content around Israel’s invasion of Gaza and its presence at the 2024 Olympics, the rights of U.S.-based Latinx communities, Venezuelan politics, and Scottish independence from the U.K. Most of the posts and articles spotted by OpenAI received little pickup from real people, the company said. Still, it described the incident in detail on its blog, writing that it found a dozen X (formerly Twitter) accounts posing as conservatives and progressives and using hashtags such as “#DumpTrump” and “#DumpKamala.” Storm-1679 also tapped at least one Instagram account to spread AI-generated content, per OpenAI. OpenAI has previously described “state-affiliated threat actors” using its tools, but this is the first time it’s disclosed a specific election interference campaign utilizing ChatGPT. OpenAI said it responded to said discovery by banning a “cluster” of accounts that created the content; the company also said it “shared threat intelligence with government, campaign, and industry stakeholders.” The firm did not name those stakeholders specifically, but it did share screenshots of a few of the posts. Those screenshots featured view counts ranging from 8 to 207 views and hardly any likes. OpenAI said Storm-1679 also shared ChatGPT-generated articles across several websites that “posed as both progressive and conservative news outlets.” The firm added, “The majority of social media posts that we identified received few or no likes, shares, or comments. We similarly did not find indications of the web articles being shared across social media.” An August 6 report from Microsoft described Storm-2035 in a similar manner — as an Iranian network with “four websites masquerading as news outlets.” According to Microsoft, the network created “polarizing” posts about the election, LGBTQIA+ rights, as well as Israel’s invasion of Gaza. Reports of online foreign interference in U.S. elections are now virtually commonplace. Microsoft’s August 6 report, for example, also detailed an Iran-linked phishing attack that targeted an unnamed, “high-ranking” U.S. campaign official. Shortly after Microsoft dropped the report, the Trump campaign announced that “foreign sources” had stolen some of its emails and documents in an attempt to influence the 2024 presidential election. Eight years earlier, a Russia-linked hacking group known as Guccifer 2.0 made off with Democratic National Committee emails through a similar phishing attack; they ultimately leaked thousands of DNC emails and documents ahead of the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Under tidelike pressure from lawmakers, big tech companies have launched various efforts over the years in response to such incidents. Their efforts include meme fact checks, wishful thinking, a short-lived political ad ban, a “war room,” and collaborations with rivals and cops alike.","summary":"An attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election harnessed ChatGPT to generate stories and social media comments, per OpenAI.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/openai-chatgpt-iran-us-election-2000488246","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/08/chatgpt-iran-linked-election-influence-openai.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 21:56:30","author":"Harri Weber","authors":["Harri Weber"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":254341710,"title":"Kamala Harris gives a strong reaction to Trump’s disorganized Musk interview.","text":"Kamala Harris has slammed Donald Trump’s ‘extremism and dangerous agenda’ after his rambling two-hour interview with Elon Musk. The Republican nominee returned to X Monday for an interview with the Tesla billionaire that was riddled with technical delays and saw Trump ‘slur’, talk with a ‘lisp’ and claim that Harris looks like his wife Melania. Trump, 78, during the conversation insulted Harris several times, referring to her as ‘third rate’, ‘incompetent’ and ‘a radical left lunatic’, and expressed anger that she had been swapped in for President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. He also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin , Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – all authoritarian strongmen – as at the ‘top of their game’. The Vice President’s campaign, after the interview concluded, issued a fiery response on X, mocking the pair’s technical challenges and slamming Trump for only aiming to serve ‘self-obsessed rich guys like himself’. ‘Donald Trump’s extremism and dangerous Project 2025 agenda is a feature not a glitch of his campaign, which was on full display for those unlucky enough to listen in tonight during whatever that was on X.com,’ the Harris HQ account tweeted. ‘Trump’s entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself – self-obsessed rich guys who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024.’ Trump sat Monday for a friendly two-hour interview with the SpaceX founder on Musk’s social media platform X after technical problems delayed the start of the event for more than 40 minutes. Their chat offered Trump an unfiltered chance to air his usual mix of grievances, personal attacks and overstated or false claims. Trump took aim at Biden and Harris, blaming the pair for a rise in illegal immigration. ‘She is a San Francisco liberal who destroyed San Francisco, and then as attorney-general, she destroyed California,’ he said. ‘She’s going to be worse than him,’ he added, referencing Biden, saying the country needed to prevent anything happening under ‘stupid people like Biden’. Musk let Trump lead the conversation and did not challenge Trump’s inaccurate statements, like the assertion that other countries were sending criminals from their prisons across the southern U.S. border, or that bacon prices had risen four or five times. Studies show immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans. The talk was Trump’s latest effort to seize the spotlight from his Democratic rival, whose 11th-hour entry into the race has galvanized her party and boosted Democratic fundraising. Trump started by talking about last month’s assassination attempt at a campaign rally, pledging to return to the Pennsylvania town of Butler where a bullet hit his ear. ‘Doctors later told me that the ear is a place, that is a very bloody place if you’re going to get hit,’ he said. ‘If I had not turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now – as much as I like you.’ Trump also trumpeted his good relationships with Putin and Kim-Jong Un, while Musk questioned whether Harris was tough enough to stand up to overseas leaders. ‘There’s some real tough characters out there,’ he said. ‘And if they don’t think the American president is tough, they will do what they want to do.’ And although Trump insulted his rival several times, he also praised her looks. He likened the recent Time magazine cover illustration of Harris to another highly visible woman adjacent to American politics: his own wife. ‘She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live,’ he said. ‘It was a drawing, and actually, she looked very much like a great first lady, Melania.’ Additionally, he claimed that Biden dropping off the Democratic ticket was a ‘coup’ and expressed anger over Harris’ response to the situation. ‘She hasn’t done an interview since this whole scam started,’ Trump said. Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election, but is now trailing Harris in some of the same states. The conversation saw Musk – who has endorsed Trump in the upcoming election – and the former President exchange praise repeatedly. The Tesla chief lauded Trump for his bravery during the attempt on his life last month and Trump congratulated Musk for his willingness to fire workers demanding better conditions. ‘You’re the greatest cutter,’ Trump said. ‘I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike – I won’t mention the name of the company – but they go on strike. And you say: ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone.” Musk, the world’s richest person, announced his support for Trump shortly after the assassination attempt against him – despite the Republican’s opposition to state support for electric carmakers like Tesla. The Tesla CEO did back Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since. ‘I think we’re at a fork in the road of destiny, of civilization, and I think we need to take the right path, and I think you’re the right path,’ he told Trump as the interview concluded.

The party gathers this week for the Democratic National Convention in the same city with anger simmering over another far-away war, this time in Gaza. But leaders hope to avoid the images of chaos and violence on the streets outside that derailed their chances of winning the White House in 1968. Pro-Palestinian protesters are vowing to fill the streets of the Windy City with loud demonstrations of up to 25,000 people expected to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. military support for Israel. With peace talks stalled, progressive demonstrators are livid at President Biden for failing to stop the war, which has dragged on for 10 months since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack, or at least rein in the aggressive military stance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In some ways, the tumult mirrors the scene in ’68, when an unpopular President Lyndon Johnson, who oversaw the escalation of the war in Vietnam, abandoned his reelection bid and Vice President Hubert Humphrey was vying to take over the mantle ahead of a fall election against Republican Richard Nixon. But there are major differences which may limit the peril for Team Blue. Kamala Harris has largely unified Democrats in just a few weeks after President Biden stepped aside and handed her the baton. The party is remarkably unified behind what many see as an existential battle to defeat former President Donald Trump. That’s a big difference from Humphrey, who faced widespread opposition within the party over his support for the war in Vietnam, which was also a much more serious issue than Gaza because American soldiers were fighting and dying on the battlefield. Humphrey was also grappling with rifts between the Democrats working-class base and youthful leftist protesters, as well as deep splits over the civil rights movement. Harris, on the other hand, says she shares protesters’ concerns about the war in Gaza and has sought to carve out a bit of distance between herself and Biden even as she mostly stands by his side. The presumptive presidential nominee has vowed to meet with members of the so-called “uncommitted” movement of pro-Palestinian Democrats who won slots as delegates on a platform of protest against Biden’s handling of the war, although she has balked at their demand for talks over cutting arms to Israel. Harris has already gotten a taste of pro-Palestinian protests as she held a round of successful rallies with her vice-presidential running mate Tim Walz. She silenced a heckler who interrupted her sprawling rally in Detroit: “If you want Trump to win, say that. Otherwise I’m speaking.” But she took a more sympathetic tack in Phoenix the next day. “The president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home,” she said. “I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about the race in 2024.” ©2024 New York Daily News.

But the galloping advance has cost the Ukrainian invasion corps—made up of around a half-dozen brigades and a few independent battalions plus supporting units—a significant number of precious armored vehicles plus potentially scores of troops. Russian forces have lost only a few vehicles but their bewildered infantry have surrendered to the attacking Ukrainians by the dozen. The ratio of equipment losses—heavy Ukrainian write-offs compared to relatively few Russian write-offs—is unusual. On average throughout Russia’s 29-month wider war on Ukraine, the Russians have lost many more vehicles than the Ukrainians. Whether the high losses are worth it to the general staff in Kyiv depends on the invasion’s objectives—and whether the loss ratio flips as the Kursk campaign develops. On an average day in the 905-day wider war, the Russian military loses nearly four tanks and nearly eight infantry vehicles, according to a running tally by the analysts at Oryx. The Ukrainian military loses just one tank and three infantry vehicles on an average day. Ukraine’s invasion of Kursk has not been average. Rolling across the border through gaps in Russian defenses on Aug. 6, Ukrainian forces restored maneuver to a war that, for many months, has been static: both sides fighting from trenches and struggling to advance more than a few hundred yards at a time. But the Ukrainian maneuvers have exposed their tanks and infantry vehicles to Russian drones, artillery and ambushes. In the first nine days of the invasion, the Ukrainians lost four tanks and 41 infantry vehicles, according to one Oryx analyst. The losses have included a rare British-made Challenger 2 tank and several American-supplied Stryker fighting vehicles. The attrition of infantry vehicles—including tracked fighting vehicles and wheeled personnel carriers—has been especially acute for the Ukrainian armed forces. They’re losing these valuable vehicles at almost double the normal rate. And where the average loss rate is for the entire 700-mile front of the wider war, those losses in Kursk are occurring along a 50-mile front. The loss of so much valuable equipment may not worry Ukrainian planners—provided, of course, the strategic gains of the Kursk campaign justify the material cost. If Jack Watling, an analyst for the Royal United Services Institute in London is correct in his assessment, Ukraine wants Kursk Oblast as a bargaining chip. As a bargaining chip, the oblast might be worth—so far—a few dozen armored vehicles. “Politically, the purpose of the operation is to build leverage ahead of possible negotiations,” Watling wrote in The Guardian. “If Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidency in November, the threat of withdrawing military-technical assistance is likely to force Kyiv to negotiate. The Ukrainian government wants to make sure that if it has to enter that process, it has things that Russia wants to trade for concessions.” “The Ukrainian military, therefore, must take and hold a sizeable chunk of Russian land for the duration of potential negotiations,” Watling stressed. It’s also possible that, as the pace of Ukrainian advance inevitably slows, the loss ratio flips. “There is a limit to how far this force can push before it overextends, meaning it will need to dig in soon if the Ukrainians are to hold the ground until negotiations,” Watling explained. “The best-case scenario for Ukraine is that its units dig in and Russia—feeling compelled to retake the ground—suffers inordinate losses in trying to push the Ukrainians back.” In that sense, the fighting in Kursk could begin to look more like the fighting along the front line in Ukraine, where poorly-trained Russian troops suffer heavy losses trying—and usually failing—to defeat entrenched Ukrainians. For now, however, the Ukrainians are out in the open and on the move in Kursk. That makes them vulnerable—and prone to lose many more vehicles than they normally do. Follow me on Twitter.

Lt. Governor","text":"Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan warned on Saturday how significant Native American votes can be amid this year's presidential race, stating they can \"make or break\" elections.Native American voters have become increasingly recognized as a crucial voting bloc in U.S. elections, particularly in swing states like Arizona, Nevada, and Michigan. Their impact has been seen as significant in previous elections as their turnout has sometimes been the deciding factor in close races.In Arizona, Native American voters were instrumental in securing victories for Democratic candidates in both the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms. Additionally, their turnout helped President Joe Biden win the state, making him the first Democrat to do so in over two decades. Similarly, in Nevada and Michigan, Native American voters have contributed to maintaining Democratic strongholds.With a tumultuous election race ahead with Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee and running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, expected to face off against GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance in November, key voting blocs are emerging as battleground states continue to play a key role in determining the result of this year's election.In a Saturday interview with MSNBC's The Katie Phang Show, Flanagan, who has served as Minnesota's lieutenant governor since 2019 and is the highest-ranking Native American official in the United States, discussed the importance of the Native American vote.\"I think Native people are strategically located in swing states across the country and our vote, the Native vote, can make or break a campaign or election. So, in many ways, ignore us at your peril,\" she said.Newsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign and Trump's campaign via email for comment.This comes as Harris, who made history as the first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, has continued to reach marginalized communities since announcing her White House bid last month following Biden's decision to step down from this year's race as she has made several campaign stops and promises to those communities.Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the country's oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization, endorsed Harris, the first time in the group's nearly 100-year history that it has thrown its formal backing behind a presidential candidate. While a group called South Asian Women for Harris organized a call that more than 4,000 women joined.Trump has also continued to make efforts to reach Black voters including several campaign stops in predominantly Black communities, calling into the Black American Business Leader Barbershop Roundtable at a barbershop in Atlanta, and most recently attending a Q&A session at this year's National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention.Flanagan said on Saturday that Native Americans face significant challenges with voting suppression, including issues with voter ID laws, transportation to polling sites, and inadequate voter engagement from political parties.\"There are several folks who have tried to throw obstacles to Native participation by suddenly deciding that tribal ID's are no longer a valid form of identification, saying that you need to have a physical address and not a PO box when in so many reservations communities that's not how people live,\" she said.The lieutenant governor added: \"It is very clear that there is only one team that is interested in making sure that everyone has access to the ballot box and the freedom to vote, and that is Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\"According to the Native American Voter Rights Fund, only 66 percent of the known eligible Native American voting population is registered to vote. There are over 1 million eligible Native American voters in the U.S. who are not registered.Newsweek has reached out to the Native American Voter Rights Fund via email for comment.These challenges have led to efforts to pass the Native American Voting Rights Act, which aims to reduce these barriers, although it has not yet been enacted into law.Flanagan, who would become the country's first Indigenous governor and Minnesota's first woman governor if Walz is elected as vice president in November with Harris, has continued to make her own efforts in the state including the integration of tribal consultation into state governance, the establishment of one of the first state offices dedicated to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives, and strengthened protections for Native children in adoption processes.","summary":"\"In many ways, ignore us at your peril,\" Peggy Flanagan said on Saturday during an interview on MSNBC.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/native-american-votes-can-make-break-elections-peggy-flanagan-1940731","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2452196/peggy-flanagan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 21:38:31","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.163},{"id":254341624,"title":"X closes Brazil office, citing judge’s ‘censorship orders’","text":"Social media platform X has decided to shut down its office in Brazil after a judge threatened to arrest one of the company’s legal representatives in a censorship dispute. The decision comes one day after what the company called a “secret order” from Supreme Federal Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes, which it shared in a post to “expose his actions.” “Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process,” the X Global Governmental Affairs account posted. In a follow-up post, X shared a watermarked court order in which de Moraes allegedly demanded the arrest of X representative Rachel Nova Conceicao and daily fines of about $3,650 in lieu of full compliance with the order. The judge had been investigating “digital militias” accused of spreading misinformation and hate speech on the platform during former President Jair Bolsonaro’s tenure, according to Reuters. He also opened an inquiry into X owner Elon Musk, who said he would reactivate accounts de Moraes had ordered blocked as part of that investigation. The platform, formerly known as Twitter, will still be accessible to users in the country. “We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision,” the company posted. “The responsibility lies solely with Alexandre de Moraes. His actions are incompatible with democratic government. The people of Brazil have a choice to make – democracy, or Alexandre de Moraes.” Musk called the decision a difficult one, “but, if we had agreed to @alexandre’s (illegal) secret censorship and private information handover demands, there was no way we could explain our actions without being ashamed.” In separate posts, Musk called de Moraes an “utter disgrace to justice” and compared him to Harry Potter villain Voldemort, saying, “The resemblance is uncanny.” X also faced a legal threat from the European Union earlier in the week, as Thierry Breton, the commissioner for the internal market, warned Musk ahead of his interview with former President Donald Trump that he could face repercussions if the platform did not keep hate speech and disinformation in check.","summary":"Social media platform X has decided to shut down its office in Brazil after a judge threatened to arrest one of the company’s legal representatives in a censorship dispute.

So its presidential election show was a quadrennial tradition from 1964 to 2016, before COVID scuttled it in 2020. But Brave New Workshop is tapping into the current electoral zeitgeist again with “No Country for Two Old Men.” And, seeing as thinking on your feet is an essential part of the troupe’s improvisational training, it’s appropriate that the past month’s events have forced the team of writer/performers to revise and revise again. For example, that title may have seemed obsolete when President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid. But it works in the context of the opening song, a recap of the campaign thus far that allows audiences to laugh at events that may have seemed too worrisome at the time. The show is a landslide winner in the political comedy category. “No Country for Two Old Men” is the funniest thing the company’s concocted since before the pandemic, a high-energy collection of skits and songs that tosses caution overboard and could be the ideal antidote for news-infected gloominess. While TV viewers speculate about who’s going to play Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on “Saturday Night Live,” it bears remembering that that show was made possible by pioneers like Brave New Workshop and such kindred contemporaries as Chicago’s Second City and Los Angeles’ Groundlings. And please note that it’s far more thrilling to experience this kind of comedy up close in an intimate space like the theater that now bears the name of company founder Dudley Riggs. Not only that, but the writing’s often much better and more slickly delivered than on “SNL.” Even if you think that you’d rather escape political discussions altogether, perhaps what you need is an opportunity to laugh about all that’s happened in recent months. If you witnessed Biden’s decline with heart-sinking sadness, check out the hilarious version of him offered by new addition Jeffrey Nolan, who brings smiles as he mumbles raspily about “histrionic achievements” and “exploding health care.” Or enjoy the campaign advice offered by Doug Neithercott’s “Pander Bear,” who oversees the dumbing down of candidate Lauren Anderson’s stump speech. And witness divisiveness in action in a game of “Black or Woman” or its dance-pop antidote, Isabella Dunsieth’s Madonna-esque “Ethnically Ambiguous.” Granted, the material isn’t consistently strong. Denzel Belin’s burlesque-style profession of lust for old white male politicians and a brief tutorial on “Project 2025” lack the cleverness or bite of the bits around them. But bite is preponderant in most of this revue, and what a welcome return that is after a few years of post-pandemic carefulness. Directed with briskness and punch by Brave New Workshop’s artistic director, Caleb McEwen, it bears echoes of the delightfully snarling shows he created early this century in tandem with wife Katy McEwen. While some may complain that “No Country for Two Old Men” isn’t an equal-opportunity offender, it will likely evolve to include more campaigning critiques for Kamala Harris and Walz. And our governor does make a cameo courtesy of Neithercott. Given a little more time, his imitation might rival his spot-on Donald Trump.

The reality is that the US is already dominant, which is expected to produce 13.2 million barrels of oil per day on average this year – millions of barrels more than Saudi Arabia or Russia, according to the report. Biden’s signature 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, has also helped boost production of solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy, but he has struggled to significantly wean the US economy from fossil fuels because of legal obligations, political challenges and market demand, said the report. “The prospect of high gas prices is a political nightmare that haunts all presidents, and Biden is no exception. Each time gas prices have shot upward, Biden has taken steps to relieve the pain at the pump – even if those steps were seemingly in conflict with his climate goals,” it said.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/us-crude-oil-output-keeps-rising-under-democratic-republican-administrations/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/P11-D_18082024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 21:01:41","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":254340128,"title":"‘Things I Trust More Than Donald Trump’ List Goes Viral: ‘Dinner with Jeffrey Dahmer’","text":"TCF vendors Exponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: IP addresses, Device identifiers, Browsing and interaction data, Privacy choices, Non-precise location data, Users’ profiles, Probabilistic identifiersmoreCookie duration resets each session.

On Saturday, Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the fighting forces in Russia' Chechnya region, posted a video of himself on a Cybertruck with a machine gun mounted to the vehicle. In the video he said he planned to send the vehicle to fight in the Russian-Ukraine war. \"The Cybertruck will soon be sent to the SVO zone, where it will be in demand under the appropriate conditions. I am confident that this 'beast' will greatly benefit our soldiers,\" he wrote in a Telegram post. The \"SVO zone\" refers to the Ukraine warzone. Kadyrov praised the vehicle — and Musk — in the Telegram post, according to Reuters. \"We received a Tesla Cybertruck from the esteemed Elon Musk. I was pleased to test this new technology and personally witnessed why it's rightfully called the 'Cyberbeast,'\" he wrote in the post. The Independent has requested comment from Tesla. He called Musk the \"strongest genius of modern times\" and invited the Tesla and X CEO to visit Chechnya. \"We... await your future products that will help us finish the special military operation,\" he wrote. \"Special military operation\" is Russia's official terms for describing its war in Ukraine. Kadyrov is a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said in May that 43,500 Chechen combatants had fought in Russia's war with Ukraine. The Cybertruck isn't the only one of Musk's products to show up during the war in Ukraine. His Starlink satellite internet system has been used by the Ukrainian and Russian militares since 2022. However, Musk has previously stated that he did not want his Starlink system to be used in wars, Insider reports. During an interview Musk hosted with Donald Trump on Monday, Trump told the Tesla CEO that \"nobody feels worse about the Ukraine situation than I do,\" insisting that he cautioned Putin against invading, and repeating the dubious claim that the invasion would not had happened if he were president. He also called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"very honorable\" for the way he handled a phone call that led to Trump's 2019 impeachment. Trump's first impeachment came after it was revealed he tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine. Zelensky insisted at the time that he did not feel the call constituted blackmail or cocercion.","summary":"The Chechen leader called Musk the ‘strongest genius of modern times’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tesla-cybertruck-machine-gun-elon-musk-b2597901.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/17/20/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vZgHZzXB-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-17 20:54:46","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.359},{"id":254345150,"title":"Trump scares his followers with talk of \"illegals,\" but border crossings are lowest in four years","text":"During Donald Trump's press conference at his Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey on Thursday, he pivoted from speaking points meant to focus on inflation to, once again, rattle off misinformation about Kamala Harris wanting to \"end detention of illegal alien migrants, releasing vicious monsters into our communities to rape, maim and murder.\" And this has been a popular loop-de-doop of his for years, regardless of who his opponent is.

But that small core has outsized influence. Anger over U.S. backing for Israel’s offensive in Gaza could generate unwelcome images for convention organizers, with raucous protests expected outside and potentially inside the Chicago arena where Harris will accept the nomination Thursday. Top Democrats have spent weeks meeting with “uncommitted” voters and their allies — including a previously unreported sit-down between Vice President Kamala Harris and the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan — in an effort to respond to criticism in key swing states like Michigan, which has a significant Arab American population. TODAY: Israeli airstrike kills 18 members of a family in Gaza as mediators hope for a cease-fire Weeks of meetings and calls between pro-Palestinian activists and the Harris campaign have yielded progress in some areas, but their core policy demands remain unmet. The activists want Harris to endorse an arms embargo to Israel and a permanent cease-fire. Harris has supported Biden’s negotiations for a cease-fire but rejected an arms embargo. Rima Mohammad, one of Michigan’s two “uncommitted” delegates, said she sees the convention as a chance to share their movement’s concerns with the party leadership. “It is a way for protesters outside to be able to share their frustration with the party,” she said. The Democratic nominee meets a key Arab American mayor Questions remain about the leverage “uncommitted” voters hold now that Biden has stepped aside and Harris has taken his place. Democrats have seen a significant surge in enthusiasm for Harris’ campaign and concerns about voter apathy in key areas, such as Detroit’s large Black population, appear to have diminished. But Harris and her team have still made communication with Arab American leaders a priority. During a campaign trip to Michigan last week, Harris met with Abdullah Hammoud, the 34-year-old mayor of Dearborn, a Detroit suburb that has the largest number of Arab Americans of any city in the United States. The meeting was disclosed by a person who was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The person familiar with the meeting did not provide specific details but said the focus was on Harris’ potential policy, if elected, on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Hammoud declined to comment. “Vice President Harris supports the deals currently on the table for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and for the release of hostages,” her campaign said in a statement. “She will continue to meet with leaders from Palestinian, Muslim, Israeli and Jewish communities, as she has throughout her vice presidency.” According to a source familiar with convention planning, two panel discussions will take place during the convention in Chicago: one addressing Arab and Palestinian issues with leaders from the “Uncommitted” movement, and another focused on Jewish American issues, including the rise in antisemitism and hate speech. Campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez on Thursday held separate one-on-one meetings with leaders in the Arab American community and “uncommitted” movement in metro Detroit. “They are listening and we are talking,” said Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News, who met with Chavez Rodriguez. “But none of us can garner votes in the community without public statements from Harris. She doesn’t need us; she can win over votes by saying and doing the right thing.” According to Siblani, Chavez Rodriguez agreed that “the killing has to stop.” In response, Siblani said he pressed: “How? There is no plan.” Lavora Barnes, the Democratic chair in Michigan, said the party would “continue working toward our goal of coming together to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot.” “We are committed to continuing these conversations with community leaders, activists and organizations because we want to ensure that everyone in the Michigan Democratic Party has a seat at the table,” Barnes said in a statement. No agreement on an arms embargo Some on the Democratic Party’s left have called for including a moratorium on the use of U.S.-made weapons by Israel in the platform of policy goals that will be approved during next week’s convention. But such language isn’t included in a draft platform party officials released earlier this summer, and it’s unlikely that those close to Harris’ campaign would endorse including it. The Uncommitted National Movement has also requested a speaking slot at the convention for a doctor who has worked on the frontlines in Gaza, along with a leader of the movement. And they have asked for a meeting with Harris “to discuss updating the Gaza policy in hopes of stopping the flow of unconditional weapons and bombs” to Israel, said Abbas Alawieh, another “uncommitted” delegate from Michigan and one of the founders of the movement. Before a Harris rally just outside Detroit last week, Alawieh and Layla Elabed, co-founders of the movement, briefly met with the vice president. They requested a formal meeting with Harris and urged her to support an embargo on weapons shipments to Israel. According to them, Harris seemed open to the idea of meeting. However, shortly after news of the meeting became public, Harris’ national security adviser Phil Gordon reaffirmed that she does not support an arms embargo. Alawieh mentioned Wednesday that the group has not received any further response from Harris’ team or the DNC regarding their requests ahead of the convention. Since then, leaders of the “Uncommitted” movement have met with senior staff from the DNC and the Harris campaign to discuss their requests. “I hope she doesn’t miss the opportunity to unite the party,” said Alawieh. The Trump campaign continues its outreach Elsewhere in metro Detroit this week, Massad Boulos, the father-in-law of Trump’s youngest daughter and now a leader in his Arab American outreach, was holding meetings with various community groups. Boulos has come to Michigan often for the outreach, along with Arab Americans for Trump chair Bishara Bahbah. According to Bahbah, their pitch highlights the situation in Gaza under Biden’s administration and a promise from Trump’s team to give the community a seat at the table if he wins. “We have been told by the Trump circle, which is not part of the campaign, that in return for our votes, there would be a seat at the table and a voice to be heard,” said Bahbah. But any apparent political opportunity for Trump in the Arab American community or the “uncommitted” movement may be limited by his past remarks and policies. Many Arabs remain offended by Trump’s ban, while in office, on immigration from several majority Muslim countries as well as remarks they consider insulting. Trump also has criticized Biden for not being a strong enough supporter of Israel. Speaking to an audience of Jewish supporters Thursday, Trump painted the protesters expected in Chicago as antisemitic and invoked an Arabic term that is sometimes used by Muslims to mean war or struggle. “There will be no jihad coming to America under Trump,” he said. But Bahbah acknowledges that his and Boulos’ strategy isn’t necessarily aimed at converting voters to support Trump — but to stop them from voting for Harris. “If I can’t convince people to vote for Trump, having them sit at home is better,” said Bahbah. Associated Press writer Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"The activists want Vice President Kamala Harris to endorse an arms embargo to Israel and a permanent cease-fire.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/08/17/the-pro-palestinian-uncommitted-movement-is-at-a-standstill-with-top-democrats-as-the-dnc-begins/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Election_2024_DNC_Uncommitted_97371.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 20:43:55","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":254343820,"title":"Harris races to define her image before Republicans can","text":"WASHINGTON (Tribune News Service) — Vice presidents seeking the top job almost always feel a need to separate themselves from the presidents they’ve served. For Hubert Humphrey, the moment came late in his campaign. In a nationally televised speech on Sept. 30, 1968, he called for a halt to the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, departing from the Johnson administration’s war policy. George H.W. Bush struggled to establish a distinct identity with voters after eight years as second fiddle to the very popular President Ronald Reagan. In his speech to the Republican convention in August 1988, he called for a “kinder, gentler nation”— to which Nancy Reagan famously retorted: “Kinder and gentler than whom?” Vice President Al Gore faced a problem less acute than Humphrey’s, but more pressing than Bush’s: Most voters in 2000 approved of President Bill Clinton’s job performance, but many disapproved of his personal conduct. Gore chose a symbolic separation, picking as his running mate Sen. Joe Lieberman, who two years earlier had become the first prominent Democrat to publicly rebuke Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky, calling his actions ‘’disgraceful’’ and ‘’immoral.” Major points to watch for at the convention At next week’s Democratic convention, one major question to pay attention to will be the extent to which Vice President Kamala Harris follows the pattern of those previous vice presidents and defines herself by contrast with President Joe Biden. That’s not the only question mark. Among others: • How heavily will Harris lean into her experience as a prosecutor? Her law enforcement experience served as a liability during her 2020 primary campaign, but now has reemerged as a political asset. Expect to hear multiple references to it over the course of the week. • How will she respond to expected protests over U.S. policy toward the war in Gaza? Harris has tried to show more empathy than Biden toward the suffering of Palestinian civilians. But that’s done little to placate protest groups that have called for a full-scale reversal of U.S. support for Israel. • Which voices in the party will she elevate with prime speaking positions? Convention organizers have said they will feature major voices from the Democratic past, including Biden and former Presidents Barack Obama and Clinton. The more important question, however, will be which potential voices of the party’s future Harris chooses to highlight. • How much policy detail will she roll out? Republicans gave the Democrats running room by adopting a platform with almost no policy detail. Harris seems likely to provide more detail while still sidestepping efforts to lock her into potentially controversial commitments. Big gains among Latino voters Leading into convention week, Harris has succeeded in uniting and motivating her party. She’s also won over a significant share of less partisan voters who had soured on Biden. That has catapulted her into a small lead over Donald Trump in most national polls and at least a tie in most swing states. Some of the most striking gains have come among Latino voters, especially younger Latinos who do not hold strongly partisan views. While Biden led Trump by just 5 percentage points among Latino voters in battleground states, Harris leads by 19 points, according to a poll released this week by Equis Research. The result has been to “reset the race,” back to the levels of Latino support that Democrats had in 2020, said Equis co-founder Carlos Odio. That’s still below what Democrats received in 2008 and 2012, but “far from the apocalyptic levels” that some polls indicated this spring and “enough to win” key states, Odio said. Harris has been able to win over those voters by appearing as a fresh face while, at the same time, presenting herself as experienced and tested, Odio said. “To a remarkable degree, she’s been able to pull from the advantages of being an incumbent while also being someone new,” he said. “It’s a tricky balancing act, but so far, it’s working.” Illustrating that, a poll conducted for the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter found that 56% of voters in battleground states said Harris represents a chance to “turn the page of the Trump/Biden era.” The survey found that 59% of the voters in the seven battleground states — Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — said Harris represents “a new generation of leadership,” Walter wrote in reporting the findings. Shift on immigration One of the most notable areas in which Harris has tried to define her identity in a way that’s separate from the administration has been on border security, which has been one of Biden’s biggest political weak spots. Republicans want to hold Harris responsible for the administration’s border policies. They’ve used the border as part of a wider attack on Harris as a “San Francisco liberal” who is soft on crime and disorder. As evidence, they cite the assignment Biden gave Harris early in 2021 to work on the “root causes” of international migration. Harris hasn’t split with any of Biden’s policies. Instead, she’s countered by trying to focus voters’ attention on a different chapter of her life — her experience as California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney. Campaign ads laud her as a “border-state prosecutor” who “took on drug cartels” and who, as president, “will hire thousands more border agents.” “Fixing the border is tough. So is Kamala Harris,” a recent ad declares. That emphasis on border security represents a dramatic shift from the 2020 presidential campaign, in which prominent Democrats talked about decriminalizing the border and abolishing ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. “It’s a 180-degree difference from what the Democratic orthodoxy has been” on immigration, said Mike Madrid, a California-based anti-Trump Republican strategist. Madrid, author of “The Latino Century,” a new book on Latino politics, believes the approach could help Harris with younger Latino voters who are often two or three generations removed from the immigrant experience. Whether or not that proves true, it’s clear that Harris’ emphasis on border enforcement has not generated the sort of public protest that might have been expected even a few months ago. That adjustment testifies to how much the party has shifted to match changing public sentiment on immigration issues. Turning the page Harris has succeeded so far in part because the unusual circumstances of 2024 have allowed her to turn one of the traditional liabilities of the vice presidency — its obscurity — into an asset. Voters don’t hold Harris fully accountable for Biden administration policies they dislike, said Evan Roth Smith, a Democratic pollster who leads Blueprint, a Democratic message-testing project. That’s especially the case on foreign policy, which voters traditionally see as a realm dominated by the president, but it also holds true on other issues, including economic policy and the border, Blueprint polling has indicated. “Voters’ attitudes toward Harris are far less calcified” than their views of either Biden or Trump, Roth said in a briefing for reporters Thursday. Political science research points in the same direction. In early August, political scientists Joshua Kalla of Yale and David Broockman of UC Berkeley tested 35 different political messages to see which had the greatest impact on how voters judged the race. For all the attention that Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz has gotten by labeling Trump and his allies as “weird,” an attack framed around that idea did very little to shift voter opinions, they found. Indeed, none of the messages that attacked Trump, whether it was about his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol or his position on abortion, showed much potential for changing voters’ minds. “Voters have been hearing about Donald Trump for almost 10 years now. If they’re willing to vote for him based on that near-decade of experience, a few ads or a new quip are unlikely to change their minds about him,” the pair wrote in describing their research. The messages that did show potential for moving voters were ones that responded to voters’ curiosity about Harris by explaining where she stood on major issues, they found. That’s why both sides in the campaign are investing huge resources in the competition to define Harris’ image for voters. So far, Harris has had a big advantage because the news of the last month has centered on her, allowing her message to dominate coverage. With the convention, she’ll likely enjoy that advantage for at least one more week. The Harris campaign has been seeking to take maximum advantage of that spotlight while they have it. In the race to define how voters see the vice president, luck has given them a head start. The election likely will turn on how effectively they can use that time to build up Harris’ image before the expected Republican onslaught starts to tear it down. ©2024 Los Angeles Times.

Their loved ones — and then the Union Jack. And how does Sir Keir Starmer distance himself from the Brit-hating, lefty lunacy of Jeremy Corbyn? By standing next to the Union Jack at every possible opportunity. That flag is Starmer’s red, white and blue shadow. For Team GB and Starmer, the flag is a symbol of pride, belonging and unapologetic patriotism. After the Paris Olympics and Labour’s landslide, the Union Jack is hotter, cooler and more totally on trend than it has been since the glory days of Britpop, when Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit reclined under a Union Jack on the cover of Vanity Fair. Yet we still hear voices saying the flag is offensive to foreigners, intrinsically racist, and all those other knackered old left-wing banalities. In the village of Claxton, Norfolk, the committee that runs the local village hall were given permission by the parish council to fly the Union flag during major holidays. But in a plot twist worthy of an Ealing comedy, some locals objected to flying the flag. What are we meant to be ashamed of? This is the flag that flew when the Royal Navy’s West Africa Squadron suppressed the Atlantic slave trade, freeing some 150,000 Africans half a century before the US abolished slavery. The flag that flew when our country fought fascism. “The flag is often used as a symbol against immigration, and it would worry me if it was being used in the wrong way,” whined one local, words of cringing self-loathing you would not hear in any other country on Earth. Ben Goldsborough, newly elected Labour MP for South Norfolk, says he was contacted by a villager opposed to the flag who has urged him to intervene, but believes that the villagers should resolve the issue among themselves. The most important thing is making sure that all residents feel listened to,” he said. The most important thing is that our country should feel nothing but pride in the Union JackTony Parsons No, Ben. The most important thing is that our country should feel nothing but pride in the Union Jack. That’s the important thing. And if you dream of rising through the Labour ranks to the Cabinet, you are going to have to show the love for our country that your leader has shown. Starmer was elected by a landslide a few years after many of us believed Labour would never win another General Election. He did it as a Labour leader who was comfortable with the Union Flag — and the quiet, unapologetic patriotism that it represents. Beautiful flag This is not nationalism. Most immigrants see the Union Flag as a symbol of democracy, opportunity, and the rule of law. To the world, the Union Jack represents freedom. Only the masochistic comrades on the wilder shores of the liberal left perceive it as something akin to a swastika. But look at all those young Olympic athletes who were celebrated by the nation yesterday. This beautiful flag does not divide us, it brings us together. It expresses our shared values. It represents a pride in our past, a belief in our present and all our hopes for the future. The young athletes of Team GB get it. And to his eternal credit, so does this Labour Prime Minister. CHARLIE KING, celebrity PT and former Towie star, writes in The Sun that we should all get more of the vitamin D that sunshine provides. I agree with Charlie but don’t agree this means men should be taking their shirts off in public. “I spent a couple of days down on Southend high street this week when it was over 30C,” Charlie says, “and there was a hell of a lot of men, of all walks of life, walking down the street with their shirts off.” Sounds like a vision of hell, Charlie. Some blame Simon “Pecs Factor” Cowell for the trend. But it really began with Vladimir Putin flashing his man boobs while sitting on a horse, his hairy nipples gleaming in the sunshine of the Russian steppes (Putin not the horse) From Southend to Vladivostok, Putin with his top off casts a dark shadow over every other man who is thinking about removing his shirt. Simon Cowell is in good nick for a man of his age. But when Simon is strolling through Miami or Venice Beach with his top off, even he looks like he is about to invade Ukraine. Here weird go, folks DONALD TRUMP said that a magazine front cover made his presidential rival Kamala Harris look like, “the most beautiful actress ever to live”. It was not meant to be a compliment. Trump is implying the US media is doing all they can to make the Democratic candidate look good. It’s a fair point. But a weird way to express it. Trump’s “weirdness” is becoming a huge factor in this White House race. A Harris spokesperson said a recent typically rambling Trump speech made him sound “like someone you wouldn’t want to sit near in a restaurant”. “They’re the weird ones,” Trump said defensively in an interview with conservative radio host Clay Travis. “Nobody’s ever called me weird. I’m a lot of things, but weird I’m not. I think we’re the opposite of weird. They’re weird.” Weird or what? A word to the Wise on movie star George AS George Clooney and Brad Pitt pose in bed in their jim-jams for GQ magazine, George complains that director Quentin Tarantino says he is not a real movie star because nobody can name a film Clooney has been in since the millennium. Top of my head, Quentin – Clooney’s career-defining masterpiece Up In The Air (2009), where he plays a self-obsessed businessman who falls for the mysterious Vera Farmiga. And Clooney – more than any man alive, even Brad Pitt – always looks like a movie star should look. Even when he is part of a Morecambe and Wise tribute act. Left's funny turn “IT’S not funny,” Liz Truss said when pranksters lowered a banner behind her showing a lettuce with the words “I crashed the economy”. Well, it is a bit funny, Liz. These stunts always are. The banner is lowered so slowly, and the audience clocks it long before the person on stage does. Led By Donkeys, the organisation that pranked Liz, pulled the same stunt on Nigel Farage, with Mad Vlad Putin giving a thumbs-up with the words “I love Nigel”. How can it not be a bit funny? But it is also cowardly, cruel, and pointless. And SAFE. The Tories are gone now. Reform UK has five MPs. Labour will rule the roost for the next five years. Shouldn’t cutting-edge comedians and savage satirists now be going after Labour figures? There’s plenty of material. Did you ever catch David Lammy on Mastermind? “Who succeeded Henry VIII?” “Er – Henry VII?” Leftish comedians have had the Tories to kick around for 14 years. Now it should be Labour’s turn for mockery. And if left-wing comedians do not have the nerve to go after Labour – well, what a bunch of pranksters. Kissing dogs a no-no NICOLA PELTZ BECKHAM – wife of Brooklyn, daughter-in-law to David and Victoria – divided the Internet by sharing an image where she was kissing her late chihuahua Nala on the mouth. Some argued that dogs carry dangerous diseases. Others claimed that because humans and dogs evolved together, kissing canines is a good way to get healthy bacteria. But is it ever really OK to kiss your dog? My late, beloved Stan did not think so. Stan would not have kissed me any more than he would have picked up my dry cleaning. Kissing was an alien act to Stan. Kissing is not the way any dog alive expresses affection. Humans don’t sniff another human’s butt when we meet in the street, do we? Nicola loved her little Nala. Anyone who has ever loved and lost a dog will understand the depth of her feelings. But that doesn’t mean we should kiss our mutts on the mouth. Kissing simply does not come naturally to dogs. And I suspect that while Nala undoubtedly loved Nicola, Nala loved the taste of Nicola’s lipstick even more.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/29935187/union-jack-flag-team-gb-tony-parsons/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/crop-29935525.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 20:17:17","author":"Ashephard,Tony Parsons","authors":["Ashephard","Tony Parsons"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.047},{"id":254338750,"title":"Ex-Prez Shared Outlandish 'God Gave Us Trump' Video, Calling Himself America’s ‘Caretaker’","text":"Donald Trump once shared a bizarre video that portrayed him as the messiah of America. Shared on January 5, before the Iowa caucus, the former President went ahead on his Truth Social handle and captioned it, \"So God made Trump.\" The video appears to have a narration of American broadcaster Paul Harvey via Artificial Intelligence, as reported by CNN. As per The Independent, the video stated, \"And on June 14, 1946, God looked down on his planned paradise, and said, 'I need a caretaker.' So God gave us Trump. God said, 'I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, fix this country, work all day, fight the Marxists, eat supper, then go to the Oval Office and stay up past midnight at a meeting of the heads of state.' So God made Trump.\" The video also claimed that the ex-POTUS was 'gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild' while still being tough enough to deal with the 'deep state.' It went on, \"Somebody to ruffle the feathers, tame the cantankerous World Economic Forum, come home hungry, have to wait until the First Lady is done with lunch with friends, then tell the ladies to be sure and come back real soon – and mean it. So God gave us Trump,\" speaking highly of the business mogul. Continuing the speech, the voiceover followed, \"I need somebody who can shape an axe but wield a sword, who had the courage to set foot in North Korea, who can make money from the tar of the sand, turn liquid to gold, who understands the difference between tariffs and inflation, will finish his 40-hour week by Tuesday noon and then put in another 72 hours. So God made Trump.\" The voiceover also states, \"God had to have somebody willing to go into the den of vipers, call out the Fake News for their tongues as sharp as a serpent’s. The poison of vipers is on their lips…\" The concept was reportedly inspired by Harvey's famous speech in 1978 at the Future Farmers of America convention, also famously known as So God Made a Farmer. Dilley Meme Team, a meme page that outspokenly supports Trump, made the video to leave an impact on the supporters of the Republican frontrunner for the POTUS 2024 race. \"Often shared by the man himself, and played at the rallies, we've been fighting fake narratives of the commies and fascists for years - BY ANY MEMES NECESSARY,\" the website of the page reads, as per Snopes. The clip was widely shared by Trump supporters but condemned by others for its biblical connotations. User @ZiffyKat wrote, \"This is what I replied to him under his post on Truth Social: “That’s so beautiful and every word is true. I have never doubted that God anointed you and appointed you for such a time as this. When you know, you know.\" Contradicting it, another user, @JohnFlyover opined, \"I don't like this. I am a Trump supporter, but God made everyone. We're electing a President, not a Pope.\" Prominent conservatives like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Laura Loomer also shared the video on X (formerly known as Twitter).","summary":"The AI voice narrated, &#34;And on June 14, 1946, God looked down on his planned paradise, and said, &#39;I need a caretaker.&#39; So God gave us Trump.&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/ex-prez-shared-outlandish-god-gave-us-trump-video-calling-himself-americas-caretaker","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/710971/uploads/aabebc60-5b9b-11ef-ad53-0dda0f9ea146_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 20:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.117}]}
