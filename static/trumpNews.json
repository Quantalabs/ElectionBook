And then the air show, she gave me a much bigger [one], and I didn’t ask her.”\n\n Toward the end of the Oct. 5 episode’s opening sketch, which featured Carvey’s Joe Biden enjoying some ice cream next to Rudolph’s Kamala Harris and Andy Samberg’s Doug Emhoff as they watched the vice presidential debate, Carvey smacks the ice cream into Rudolph’s face as she sits there seemingly surprised, trying to hold back a laugh.\n\n “I was right kinda gesturing,” Carvey recalled off the split-second decision. “I thought, ‘Here’s ice cream, big gob. Here’s Maya’s face.’ And I didn’t wanna hurt her, but I just — I thought of it, and did it within two seconds. So that’s to put to rest all the rumors and all the talk.”\n\n Later in the podcast, Carvey said he thinks there’s been a more “playful and fun” response to his Biden impression since the president dropped out of the 2024 presidential race against Donald Trump, whereas “it was a hot oven” when he was running for reelection.\n\n But overall, Carvey never wants to come across as disrespecting Biden. He views his impersonation as just exaggerating some of the president’s unique qualities. \n\n “The main thing is it’s making me laugh, and I’m definitely doing stuff that he doesn’t do,” the comedian added. “He doesn’t smash ice creams into faces. You know? He doesn’t say, ‘I can’t believe it’s not butter.’ I’m doing what I did to the first Bush.”\n\n Carvey was a castmember on SNL from 1986 to 1993, during which he played several politicians, including President George H.W. Bush. And now he’s back to play Biden during the NBC show’s 50th season.","summary":"The comedian is playing Joe Biden during the sketch comedy show's 50th season, alongside Rudolph's Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/snl-dana-carvey-smashing-ice-cream-maya-rudolph-face-unplanned-1236030912/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dana-Carvey-Maya-Rudolph-Jim-Gaffigan-SNL-publicity-H-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 23:51:52","author":"Carly Thomas","authors":["Carly Thomas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.205},{"id":259476020,"title":"Man who confidently claimed he would be found innocent of Jan. 6 accusations receives punishment","text":"A Montana resident and supporter of ex-President Donald Trump boasted about being acquitted of charges for participating in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots and even expected to be rewarded handsomely.

Salmond’s long career at heart of Scottish politics","text":"Alex Salmond was a colourful politician who never shied away from controversy over his long and storied career in Scottish politics.\n\nFrom falling out with former allies at the SNP to forming his own political party, his personality loomed large over the country’s political landscape.\n\nHere are some of the more controversial moments in the Alba leader’s career:\n\n– Harassment complaints\n\nIn 2018, the Scottish government set up a new procedure for investigating complaints against ministers and former ministers.\n\nTwo female staff made internal complaints against Mr Salmond.\n\nHowever, he immediately complained that the process was unfair and launched a judicial review in the courts.\n\nThe Court of Session ruled the Scottish Government’s investigation into the claims was “tainted with apparent bias” by the investigating officer’s prior contact with the complainants, with Mr Salmond receiving more than £500,000 in damages.\n\nThis would ultimately lead to a parliamentary inquiry, however, Mr Salmond’s troubles were not over.\n\n– Accusation of sexual assault\n\nMr Salmond was charged with a litany of sexual offences against nine women in January 2019.\n\nThe trial, which took place in March the following year, lasted 11 days.\n\nMr Salmond denied all the charges and giving evidence claimed some were “deliberate fabrications for a political purpose”\n\nThe jury, which took less than six hours to reach its decision, returned not guilty verdicts on 12 charges and returned a not proven verdict on a charge of sexual assault with intent to rape.\n\nDuring a procedural hearing of the case, reporting of which was banned until the end of the trial, Mr Salmond’s defence team claimed the Scottish Government and those working there turned to the criminal process to try to “discredit” him after he won a civil case into how the administration handled sexual harassment complaints against him.\n\nJudge Lady Dorrian rejected an application for this evidence to be led at the trial, saying the judicial review was “wholly irrelevant”.\n\n– End of relationship with SNP and launch of Alba party\n\nAs a result of his harassment and sexual assault cases, Mr Salmond’s relationship with his former colleagues at the SNP soured.\n\nA Holyrood inquiry into the handling of complaints against Mr Salmond called both the former first minister and Ms Sturgeon – who was still serving in the role at that point – to testify in two marathon sessions.\n\nMr Salmond accused those at the highest echelons of the Scottish Government of a plot against him, something Ms Sturgeon called “absurd”.\n\nIn 2021, Mr Salmond launched the Alba Party, which has spent much of its existence criticising the SNP – headed then by Ms Sturgeon and subsequently by two of her key allies in Humza Yousaf and John Swinney.\n\nHowever, the party has failed to make a sizeable impact on Scottish politics.\n\nIn the 2024 general election, it stood candidates in 19 constituencies across Scotland but won no seats, with all of its candidates losing their deposits.\n\n– Friendship and falling out with Donald Trump\n\nMr Salmond developed an unlikely friendship with the former US president after he helped back the development of Mr Trump’s Menie golf course in Aberdeenshire in 2007.\n\nHowever, the pair fell out in 2012 over plans to place wind turbines off the coast of the estate.\n\nAfter the real estate mogul’s attempt to block the construction of the wind farm was shot down by the Supreme Court, Mr Salmond branded his former friend “three times a loser”.\n\nSpeaking about their relationship later in 2018, he said he regretted befriending Mr Trump.","summary":"From falling out

with His Awkward Dance: \"He Has Only 2 Moves\"","text":"Donald Trump’s recent performance at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, left many attendees and social media users buzzing–but not for the reasons one might expect. While delivering his speech and later swaying to the patriotic tune of ‘God Bless the USA,’ Trump’s awkward dance moves took center stage, drawing reactions that ranged from amusement to ridicule. The former president has never been known for his rhythmic prowess, but this latest showing seems to have struck a chord. Videos of Trump stiffly swaying back and forth as he remained largely rooted to the spot were shared across social media platforms, with viewers offering both sarcastic praise and pointed mockery.\n\nAs per OK Magazine, one netizen made a humorous remark, and wrote, “Trump has two dance moves: 1. The double jerk 2. Whatever this is.” Others gave him funny names, like- “the dashboard hula girl” and “the Frankenstein shuffle.\" The comparisons didn’t stop there; some even likened Trump’s dance to a “drunk great aunt at the end of a wedding,” implying that his stage presence seemed as shaky as his steps. This isn’t the first time Trump’s dance skills (or lack thereof) have been a topic of discussion. At previous campaign rallies, Trump frequently performed his signature move–an awkward fist-pumping shuffle to the 70s hit Y.M.C.A. by the Village People.\n\nWhile it became somewhat of a staple among his supporters, it has also raised eyebrows. Most notably, critics slammed a dance he performed at a remembrance event in Florida earlier this month, accusing him of striking an inappropriate tone at an event meant to honor lives lost in the recent Hamas attacks. One Internet user tweeted, \"The Trump campaign turned a solemn remembrance into a disco party. Not one of them is well. It’s painful to watch.\" Another one remarked, \"I just got home from an October 7th remembrance event. We sang Hatikvah, said prayers, listened to the words of hostage family members, and chanted the Mourner's Kaddish. Oddly enough they weren't playing 70s disco music. #TrumpIsUnfitForOffice.\"\n\nIntriguingly, dance experts and political commentators have pointed out that Trump’s performances often feel stiff, forced, and devoid of joy. Brandon Chow, the founder of Hip Hop Dance Junkies, weighed in on Trump's dancing, giving it a harsh critique. On a scale of one to ten, Chow rated it a mere three, explaining, “...the arms are very stiff, though – they’re not really moving. It’s literally him with his fists tight and his arms at his side. I mean, there is no movement where he’s leaving his comfort zone or his space. He’s literally just stepping in place, side to side, hips swaying…It just seems very repetitive, like it’s a robot staying in place,” as noted by The Guardian.\n\nOn a political level, some observers believe Trump’s dancing reflects his broader persona. Talking about his dance moves, political scientist Marjorie Hershey said: “Goodness knows he’s not in control of his dancing, but the fact that he feels this is a sign he’s cool, and it’s something he feels perfectly at ease to demonstrate, shows how he thinks he’s in total control of the Republican party: and he’s right.”","summary":"One critic quipped, &#34;The Trump campaign turned a solemn remembrance into a disco party.

In the last two weeks, hectic activities were on in both Dhaka as well as in Washington DC and New York by all the contending parties- the chief adviser Dr. Yunus, the main opposition and the aspirant for heading the post election government BNP and the disgraced, now politically shunned ousted ruling party Awami League to explain their respective viewpoints on the Bangladesh developments to the US political establishment covering both the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Republicans.\n\nDr. Yunus did his lobbying\" 94357 target=\"_self\">lobbying at official level in New York during his visit to United Nations, from September 24 to September 27 mostly with the US administration including President Biden and the secretary of state Antony Blinken. He had no meeting with any important official of Trump camp. Dr. Yunus depended on his friends in the Democratic Party, especially the Clintons and he went back convinced that he had managed all the support that was needed from the U.S. Government.\n\nDr. Yunus’s main contender Awami League was not sitting idle. The AL, despite its ouster in Bangladesh and attacks by the present ruling establishment has the largest support base in overseas, especially in the USA and UK and its Bangladeshi diaspora with active AW supporters with high connections, were mobilized soon after Dr. Yunus’s return to Dhaka, to lobby with both the Democratic Party establishment as also the campaign committee of Donald Trump.. Sources say that the AL lobby did not get response from the Kamala Harris camp but they got very good response from the Trump’s advisers. It is not clear whether the AL people could hold a meeting with Trump himself, but certainly they were happy with the initial reaction of the advisers.\n\nThe narrative is this. Trump camp knows that Dr. Yunus is a protégé of Hillary Clinton and Trump hates Hillary the most. Even now, in private talks, he calls Hillary a witch and ‘that nasty woman’. The AL leaders harped on this and made the Trump advisers take an anti-Yunus position. . Things will move only after the elections results are out on November 5 night. The political observers of the Bangladesh politics based in Washington believe that if Trump wins, certainly, Dr. Yunus will be in trouble just because he is Hillary’s man but for no other reasons. The AL league wants that Trump should ensure the observance of free and fair elections with the participation of Awami League.\n\nThe present main political party in Bangladesh BNP has also lobbied both with the Biden administration and Trump campaign committee. They have sought for early elections in Bangladesh. They have contested the argument of Dr. Yunus that the elections can be held only after the implementation of reforms in tree key areas. They feel that the elections can be held while the reforms are on.\n\nAs regards India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a big political stake in the outcome of the presidential elections on November 5. The Modi government is not comfortable with some of the views of the Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris. She is a committed human rights lawyer and her friends in the Democratic Party are anti-Modi. Further BJP as a party is working for Trump presidency in 2024. In USA, the Overseas Friends of BJP is the party wing of its supporters.. Apart there are strong VHP units and Hindu organisations which have close ties with the BJP. PM Modi is a darling to them, many of whom are Gujaratis.\n\nAccording to a census published in 2023, the US’ 4.4 million Indians now outnumber the Chinese diaspora in the country. Moreover, they’re not just influential on the political scene. 25 of the 500 largest American companies are headed by Indians, including Microsoft, YouTube, Google and Adobe, compared with just 11 a decade ago. The rise of this diaspora is a recent development, coinciding with the arrival of Indian engineers in Silicon Valley from the 2000s onwards. In the US, Indians are the best-paid and most highly educated migrants.\n\nIn 2020 presidential elections, estimates made by Indian organisations show that 74 per cent of the Indian Americans voted for the Democratic Party despite high campaign by BJP dominated Indian diaspora with – ‘ Phir Ekbar Trump Sarkar’ in the podium at Houston in 2019. This time, in 2024 elections, the BJP government is feeling it more necessary for them for Trump to win. Accordingly all instructions have been given and the pro-BJP Indian organisations are campaigning for Trump though finally all BJP loyalists may not vote for Trump. Ram Madhav the RSS strongman is in charge of the BJP’s Indian diaspora activities in US.\n\nIn sum, Bangladesh politicians and the interim government will be anxiously waiting for the installation of the next President on January 21 , 2025.. If Kamala Harris is elected that does not mean that she will follow fully Biden and Clintons policies in supporting Dr. Yunus. Harris has her own mind. She can review policies also. Not just as President, as a human rights lawyer also, she will judge the situation in Bangladesh. As regards Trump occupying White House again, the only surety is Dr. Yunus will be bundled out but the next step is unpredictable.

Born and raised in the state, Harris previously served as California’s attorney general and remains widely popular there.\n\nIn the last presidential election, in 2020, Trump lost in California to Democrat Joe Biden by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nIn a statement announcing the event, Trump’s campaign said the stop will seek to underscore that, “under Kamala Harris and her dangerous Democrat allies like [running mate] Tim Walz, the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans”.\n\nThe visit to the state has widely been viewed as an effort to shore up wider Republican support. That is particularly needed in six key races for the House of Representatives in California.\n\nControl of both the House and the Senate — the two chambers of the US Congress — is up for grabs this election season. And certain congressional districts in California are tightly split between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nA victory in the six competitive House races could help Republicans retain their hold over the lower chamber.\n\nGoing to California gives Trump the “ability to swoop in and leverage this big population of Trump supporters”, Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign in Michigan and worked in the former president’s administrations, told the Associated Press news agency.\n\nHe’s “coming here and activating that”, Lineberger added.\n\nThe move may also be an effort to boost Trump’s final vote count. In the US, the victor in the presidential race is decided by the Electoral College, a weighted voting system in which states award electors to the candidates based on the state-level vote.\n\nNearly all states award all their electors in a winner-takes-all system: Even if a candidate wins by a small margin in a given state, they receive all the electors.\n\nThat means that a candidate can lose in the overall popular vote but win in the Electoral College system, as Trump did in 2016. In 2020, however, he lost in both measures to Biden.\n\nHaving never won the popular vote has remained a sore subject for the former Republican president. California, with its population of nearly 40 million, offers the possibility to turn out supporters who might not otherwise feel it is worthwhile to go to the polls.\n\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote,” Jim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, told the Associated Press.\n\nBattleground blitz\n\nTo be sure, Trump is sandwiching his California visit between a stop in Nevada on Saturday and a rally in Arizona on Sunday, two battleground states more typical for the final weeks of a presidential campaign.\n\nIn Nevada, Trump attended a roundtable with Latino voters, as his campaign sought to capitalise on signs that Latino men are increasingly turning away from Democrats.\n\nFor her part, Harris visited North Carolina, which was recently devastated by Hurricane Helene. She said her visit was “first and foremost to see how they’re doing in the wake of the hurricane”.\n\nHarris was also set to promote her plan for an “opportunity economy” and meet with Black community leaders. Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2020, but the eastern state has been trending towards Democrats in some recent polls, buoyed by its large college-educated and Black population.\n\nEarlier in the day, Harris released the results of a health exam. It said she has “the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency”.\n\nReleasing health exams has long been a norm for presidential candidates in the US, with Harris quickly underscoring that the 78-year-old Trump has so far not done so.\n\n“It is clear to me that he and his team do not want the American people to really see what it is that he is doing and whether or not he actually is fit to do the job of being president of the United States,” she told reporters.\n\nTrump’s campaign has maintained that the former president “has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician” and from the doctor who treated him after an assassination attempt in July.\n\n“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” his campaign spokesman said, while charging that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.","summary":"Trip to the Democratic stronghold likely underscores effort to shore up congressional Republicans, boost popular vote.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/12/trump-to-rally-in-solid-blue-california-in-unorthodox-campaign-move?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AP24286773879838-1728772368.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 23:22:13","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":259476296,"title":"The CIA, a Navy Seal and a $15M bounty. This alleged plot on Venezuela’s Maduro reads like a Hollywood script, for a reason","text":"(CNN) — It was the perfect feel-good story, just in time for Christmas.\n\nOn December 20 last year, the United States secured from Venezuela the release of 10 US citizens – six of them wrongfully detained – in exchange for a close ally of authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro and a commitment from Caracas that it would stop detaining Americans to use as negotiating pawns.\n\n“The administration has made abundantly clear the expectation that additional Americans are not detained, and has secured commitments along those lines,” a cheerful US official announced at the time.\n\nThat deal, which also included the extradition of a former military contractor known as “Fat Leonard” who orchestrated the largest corruption scandal in US Navy history, was hailed as a thawing of relations in the long-running standoff between the countries that has seen the US impose sanctions on Venezuela and accuse its leader of illegally usurping power, abusing human rights and trafficking drugs.\n\nBut fast-forward to nearly a year later and the vibe has turned more Halloween trick than Christmas treat.\n\nVenezuela recently announced it had detained at least four US citizens, along with a handful of other foreign nationals, alleging they were part of an international conspiracy masterminded by the CIA and Spanish intelligence to overthrow Maduro.\n\nThat claim has been strongly denied by both the US and Spanish governments.\n\nThe US State Department has said the claims are “categorically false” and intimated that the detentions are linked to American criticisms of Venezuela’s disputed presidential election, which Maduro claims to have won despite widespread skepticism. The United States “continues to support a democratic solution to the political crisis in Venezuela,” the State Department said, pointedly, when commenting on the allegations.\n\nSo, is there anything to Venezuela’s claims? And if not, what does Maduro hope to gain by returning to an old playbook?\n\nHollywood script and a convenient bogeyman\n\nThe details of the alleged plot read like the script of a Hollywood thriller. Maduro’s interior minister Diosdado Cabello claims the detained foreigners – who also included two Spaniards and a Czech – were part of a shadowy unit who traveled to Venezuela to kill Maduro, apparently motivated by the up to $15 million reward the US Justice Department offered in 2020 for information leading to his arrest or conviction.\n\nAccording to Cabello, the plot not only involved the CIA but was led by an active duty US Navy Seal, and involved a shipment of 400 (now seized) US-manufactured rifles and other firearms.\n\nTwo other US citizens, Cabello claims, were “hackers” intent on disrupting Venezuela’s chronically inefficient power service. (Not the first time Cabello has cried foul over blackouts; he alleged “terrorist actions” by the opposition were behind a late-August blackout that affected at least nine Venezuelan states and dozens of cities including the capital Caracas.)\n\nIntriguingly, White House spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that the man Caracas identified as the alleged ringleader – Wilbert Castañeda – is an active service member in the US Navy whom, Kirby said, went to Venezuela on “personal travel.” Other media have reported that Castañeda, who is a dual Mexican-US citizen, used to serve as a Navy Seal but was stripped of his status sometime in the past.\n\nGiven the nature of the allegations, Venezuela’s claims are almost impossible to independently verify.\n\nBut then skeptics might say that’s exactly the point – that for Maduro, the CIA is merely a convenient, tried-and-tested bogeyman.\n\nMaduro has in the past also alleged, without proof, that the US government and former US President Donald Trump were behind a 2018 assassination attempt in which an explosive-laden drone detonated mid-air during one of his speeches (an ‘attack’ prosecutors initially tried to pin on then-Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos). Maduro has also alleged, again without evidence, that the CIA and Washington in general were to blame for an insurrection in April 2019, and in September of the following year his government detained US citizen Matthew Heath on allegations of spying on oil refineries in the state of Falcon. Heath was later released in a prisoner exchange, and the US government has always denied involvement in any of the alleged schemes.\n\nAll that said, Maduro knows there is an audience receptive to such narratives, precisely because the CIA does have a well-documented history of meddling in the region. And it’s likely not lost on him that the US was aware of a plot to overthrow his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, weeks before a coup d’etat was attempted in 2002.\n\n‘Loose dogs’, or a threat from within?\n\nStill, even among those in the Venezuelan government who believe the security services have stumbled on some kind of plot, there are some who are skeptical of Cabello’s claims of CIA involvement.\n\n“I think these are more loose dogs than a real involvement from the US government, because everyone knows that removing Maduro by force would only escalate the conflict around Venezuela,” said a government source who, like other people consulted for this article, asked not to be named due to the confidential nature of the topic.\n\n“But you cannot underestimate the allure of the ($15 million Department of Justice) reward especially for crazy adventurers, or do you really believe a Navy Seal on active duty travelled to Venezuela for a summer romance?” the source said.\n\nOne scenario that doesn’t seem to be under consideration in Caracas’ corridors of power is whether a plot could have originated from within the country.\n\nThat may sound surprising, given Maduro has alienated vast swathes of the population with his election ‘victory’ and subsequent crackdown on the opposition. He has also likely alienated some of those within his own government with his habit of chopping and changing key personnel on a whim.\n\nBut while it’s not impossible to imagine former Chavistas plotting to bring Maduro down, a more likely explanation may simply be that the Venezuelan leader has cooked up the whole story for political leverage against his old foe, the US.\n\nIf so, what does Maduro think he has to gain?\n\nA negotiating tactic?\n\nThe obvious answer leads back to the election. In October last year, before the release of “Fat Leonard” and Co, Maduro had promised the US that Venezuela’s election would be free and fair. And as recently as six months ago, the economic community in Caracas was hoping it would be at least fair enough for the US to lift its remaining oil sanctions and bring Venezuela back into the fold of the world’s democracies.\n\nThe subsequent electoral farce, and Maduro’s desertion of his commitments to restore democracy, pulverized those hopes and made it clear that any further steps toward reconciliation would have to be painfully negotiated by diplomats.\n\nIt would seem Maduro sees the newly detained Americans as pawns to be used in those negotiations, with a view to quieting US criticisms of the election, and as leverage in any sanctions negotiations.\n\nIt’s an approach that sends a calculated message to US President Joe Biden, whose administration has prioritized the release of US citizens unjustly detained abroad – having reached similar deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the releases of WNBA star Brittney Griner and the Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich.\n\nBut beyond Biden, the detentions are also a message to the new Commander in Chief, be it Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.\n\nSince the disputed vote in Venezuela, the State Department has only minimally acted against the country, imposing personal sanctions on 16 individuals and calling for Venezuela to release the full voting ballots to clarify the result.\n\nWhile the US has imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela’s oil exports for years, a special authorization allowing oil company Chevron to operate in the country is still valid despite the international outcry this summer.\n\nWhoever wins the US election in November will have the fate of the detainees weighing on them when they are faced with deciding whether to continue that minimal approach or to turn the screw.\n\nAnd they can forget any hope that the detainees’ fate can be left to the courts.\n\n“You cannot even talk of a trial, to be honest,” said a lawyer who represented US citizens wrongfully detained in Venezuela in the past. “In most cases, there’s no file with the charges presented against your client, you don’t have access to the investigation, there are no witnesses, and you cannot present new evidence, all of those proceedings happen in a court, but they’re a farce.”\n\n“It’s frustrating, you basically go to court, and you know nothing ruled there will make any difference for your client,” said another lawyer, whose client was released after spending more than two years in jail without being sentenced.\n\nSo, what’s Maduro’s bottom line?\n\nEven for those convinced that Maduro has cooked up the plot to gain leverage with the US, there’s one mystery left: his preferred endgame.\n\nIn previous negotiations over prisoner exchanges, Maduro was able to obtain the release of his alleged money fixer, Alex Saab, and of two of his wife’s nephews who were serving time for trying to smuggle 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States.\n\nHe was also able to secure the withdrawal of some of the oil sanctions the US imposed on Caracas in recent years.\n\nThis time around, with none of his close associates in US hands, it’s unclear what Maduro could ask at the bargaining table other than legitimacy and further sanctions withdrawal.\n\nLikewise, it’s unclear how a new US administration would entertain the idea of giving in to – and being seen to give into – an authoritarian bully.\n\nHostage negotiation is an awkward topic for any government, none more so than the United States, which has in the past made a point of refusing to engage with kidnappers.\n\nOn the other hand, the US may decide the freedom of its citizens are worth whatever limited concessions Maduro is seeking.\n\nAs one of the people involved in last year’s negotiations put it: “Free societies decide that no innocent man should be in jail. When you accept that a criminal walks free but no detainee is innocent, that is real freedom.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\n“Assertions have been made that property is being confiscated. That’s simply not true. They’re saying people impacted by these storms will receive $750 in cash and no more. That’s simply not true,” Biden said on Wednesday. \n\n“They’re saying the money needed for this crisis is being diverted to migrants. What a ridiculous thing to say. It’s not true.”\n\nAlthough most of the false claims spread about the storms are related to relief and rescue efforts, one falsehood relates to how the storm actually formed. \n\nBiden also slammed the “even more bizarre” claims being promoted by Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right Republican who is known for her belief in outlandish conspiracy theories.\n\nTaylor Greene, a diehard suppoter of Donald Trump, was elected to Congress on the back of her promotion of conspiracies, most notably QAnon, which casts Trump as a saviour figure battling against evil forces in the “Deep State” in Washington.\n\nShe responded to the hurricanes by claiming that the US federal government was “literally controlling the weather”.\n\n Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris on a visit to North Carolina, 5 October. Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\n‘Geo-engineering’ falsehood\n\nTaylor Greene’s suggestion was that the US government created Hurricane Helene via geoengineering, something that is not physically possible. \n\nIn a post on X, she wrote: “Climate change is the new Covid. Ask your government if the weather is manipulated or controlled. Did you ever give permission to them to do it? Are you paying for it? Of course you are.”\n\nIt drew a common link between Covid and green policies that have become popular among conspiracy theorists in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nTheir belief is that both the virus and the storms are manmade weapons designed to reduce the world’s population, something that conspiracy theorists believe is an objective of world elites, or “globalists” (with a corollary that government efforts to minimise Covid, like vaccines, or introduce measures to reduce climate change are oppressive).\n\nNotably, professional conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is among those who have been promoting the claim. \n\nIn another post, Taylor Greene also shared a video of former CIA director John Brennan talking about the potential for geoengineering as a way to reduce global warming.\n\n“Yes they can control the weather,” she wrote. “Anyone who says they don’t, or makes fun of this, is lying to you. By the way, the people know it and hate all of you who try to cover it up.”\n\nThere have been numerous attempts made by scientists to control the weather through geoengineering in the past. \n\nThose attempts have sought to do the opposite of what Taylor Greene has suggested.\n\nRather than making weather systems more dangerous, they have sought to weaken storms and alleviate the impacts of climate change. \n\n An overturned car after Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina. Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\nUse of federal funds\n\nThe memory of 2005′s Hurricane Katrina casts a long shadow in the southern United States, and provides important context for claims about Helene and Milton.\n\nThe Bush Administration’s response to the storm, particularly in New Orleans, was the source of widespread outrage and anger, and was criticised as too slow and inadequate. \n\nAlthough the Biden administration’s response to the two storms is still in its early phases, it has come under attack and been tarred with outright lies.\n\nSome of the attacks have come in light of the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is underfunded, although there are reportedly enough resources to deal with the aftermath of Helene and Milton. \n\n“We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,” US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in early October.\n\n“FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.”\n\nTrump and some members of his Republican party have accused Biden and Kamala Harris of misappropriating FEMA funds and spending them on immigrants.\n\n“They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season,” Trump said in Michigan last week.\n\nIt’s a false claim that has been repeatedly debunked. Harris has described it as “extraordinarily irresponsible.”\n\nThe claims conflate FEMA’s disaster relief fund with a separate programme it administers that provides support to homeless immigrants.\n\nMoney assigned by Congress to the disaster relief fund must be used for that purpose; any other use is illegal.\n\n FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Teams with New Jersey Task Force 1 use chain saws to clear debris in the search for victims and survivors in Asheville, North Carolina. Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\nVirginia Congressman Ben Cline has made the claim too. In a post on X, he wrote: “The Biden-Harris Administration has diverted over $1 billion in FEMA funds meant for disaster relief to illegal immigrant services.”\n\nOhio congressman Jim Jordan has also posted the claim on X.\n\nBoth posts link to an article on The Federalist website, which has a history of publishing false information.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, it featured an article by a man described as a physician, whose medical license had expired, which argued for the hosting of parties to help spread the infection in the virus. \n\n“There’s a lot of mis- and disinformation being pushed out there by the former president about what is available, in particular, to the survivors of Helene,” Harris said.\n\n“No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None,” the White House has said.\n\nBiden has written a letter requesting a recall of Congress in order to allocate more funds for disaster relief, but House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, has said he has no plans for an early recall. \n\n“We’ll be back in session immediately after the election,” Johnson told Fox News.\n\n“That’s 30 days from now. The thing about these hurricanes and disasters of this magnitude is it takes a while to calculate the actual damages, and the states are going to need some time to do that,” he said.\n\nRumours hurting relief efforts\n\nThere has been a slew of other falsehoods and rumours about the federal response that FEMA’s chief has criticised as “dangerous” because they plant doubt in the minds of people who need help and lead to mistrust in the agency.\n\nDebunking the false claims has also been a distraction for FEMA officials.\n\nIn fact, there have been so many rumours and lies about FEMA’s response that the agency has set up a webpage dedicated to refuting them.\n\nThey range from accuastions that FEMA is stealing land to claims that the agency is preventing people from evacuating. \n\n“They’re being treated very badly in the Republican areas,” Trump told Fox News, referring to people affected by Helene. “They’re not getting water, they’re not getting anything.”\n\nTesla and X owner Elon Musk, who is a vocal supporter of Trump, has used his social media platform to accuse the Federal Aviation Administration of blocking the flights of private disaster relief groups headed to North Carolina.\n\nReplying directly to Musk, Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that no flights had been blocked. \n\n Members of the FEMA Massachusetts Task Force 1 conduct search and rescue in floodwaters caused by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina. Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\nRight-wing activists and fringe media sites have also spread claims that the government intends to bulldoze entire towns as part of a “land grab”, or that FEMA plans to take people’s homes from them.\n\nThis is playing on fears that did materialise in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, but in a more subtle way.\n\nMany social housing developments were demolished and replaced with private condominiums as land was snapped up by wealthy developers in a process the author Naomi Klein has called Disaster Capitalism. \n\nSpeaking about the rumours around the federal response in Republican states, FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell told MSNBC: “It’s frankly disappointing that we’re having to deal with this narrative.”\n\nCriswell said the fact that “there’s a few leaders that are having a hard time telling the difference between fact and fiction” has been impeding relief efforts.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, some of the conpiracy theories spread online have been of an antisemitic nature and could lead to federal aid workers being the targets of attacks.\n\nWith recovery efforts from Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene still in the early stages and likely to take months if not years, the topic looks set to remain a major political issue right up until US voters go to the polls on 5 November. \n\nWith reporting from AFP\n\n The Journal’s FactCheck is a signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network’s Code of Principles.

But price problems persist","text":"(CNN) — America’s inflation continued to slow in September, reaching a fresh three-and-a-half-year low and coming in at a pace that’s similar to what was seen in 2017 and 2018, according to data released Thursday.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes across commonly purchased goods and services, was 2.4% for the 12 months ended in September, slowing from a 2.5% annual rate in August, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report.\n\nThat’s less of a cooldown than economists were expecting – FactSet consensus estimates were for a 2.3% rise – however, inflation as measured by the CPI is at its slowest rate since February 2021.\n\nBut the latest snapshot also showed how challenging it is to rein in high inflation: Some price hikes remained stubborn, while other categories highlight how factors such as weather, disease and war could jolt costs higher — albeit likely temporarily.\n\nHigh inflation, rather, is “dying, but not dead,” noted Olu Sonola, Fitch Ratings’ head of US economic research.\n\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2%, in line with the advance in August but faster than economists’ projections of 0.1%.\n\nA jump in food prices — a sweeping bird flu has caused egg prices to spike — combined with ongoing, but easing, shelter-related inflation drove the overall CPI higher last month, despite falling gas prices, BLS said.\n\nStripping out food and energy costs, categories that are typically quite volatile, core CPI rose 0.3% in September, bringing the annual rate up to 3.3% after holding firm at 3.2% the past two months.\n\nSo that’s a mixed bag of data for the Federal Reserve to pore over as it considers whether to lower its interest rates again early next month.\n\n“September’s CPI report has good news and bad news for the Fed,” Eugenio Aleman, Raymond James’ chief economist, wrote in a note issued Thursday. “The good news is that shelter costs slowed down to 0.2%, month-on-month, and 4.9%, year-over-year. However, it also showed that there are still plenty of upside risks for inflation going forward.”\n\nStubbornly high housing inflation eases\n\nThe core CPI measurement was expected to be stubbornly high for the month, a reflection of persistent housing inflation and a handful of temporary lifts in prices for certain categories such as insurance, lodging costs and vehicle prices.\n\nStill, economists say that inflation is headed in the right direction, because the factors that pushed prices higher during the pandemic era have largely faded while demand has slowed to more normal levels.\n\nThe “shelter” category, which accounts for more than one-third of the overall CPI, has been the biggest obstacle to inflation’s descent. However, economists say it’s only a matter of time before that hurdle topples because of a lag in how rents and housing-related costs are tabulated.\n\nThursday’s report provided a glint of hope: Housing inflation slowed to its lowest annual rate since February 2022.\n\n“Shelter is the silver lining to all of this,” Tyler Schipper, associate professor of data analytics and economics at St. Thomas University in St. Paul, Minnesota. “It’s one data point, just like the pop up in food prices is a singular data point, but it’s at least a hopeful data point in terms of where [the Fed is] hoping shelter inflation goes. And that can be the main driver of what gets inflation actually back down in your 2% goal.”\n\nWhile it’s a waiting game for shelter inflation’s data mechanics to come back in line with what’s happening on the ground, Thursday’s CPI report showed that price pressures still sting for consumers in certain areas. And it also gave a hint of how large-scale events could cause short-term spikes in certain prices.\n\nNotably, egg prices jumped higher last month, this time by 8.4% as a deadly bird flu cripples supply. Annually, eggs are up 39.6%.\n\nHowever, overall grocery prices are running well below overall inflation and are up 1.3% for the year ended in September.\n\nRisks continue to persist\n\nStill, the outlook for overall inflation is much improved from where it was two weeks ago, when a massive dockworkers strike threatened to choke off supply at more than 30 US ports. That can was kicked down the road until at least mid-January as negotiations continue.\n\nStill, the aftershocks of devastating hurricanes, wars, geopolitical flare-ups, and even US policy actions could present risks to the current disinflationary path, economists say.\n\nIn the coming months, the category facing some of the greatest pressure could be energy prices, Satyam Panday, chief economist for S&P Global Ratings, told CNN.\n\n“Energy price is a key risk to our own baseline narrative of this disinflation,” he said. “So, it may not be a straight line of disinflation; it’s going to be a bumpy path to more normal.”\n\nThe biggest inflationary risk could come if Donald Trump is elected president and he is able to impose his plan of immense tariffs, Oliver Allen senior US economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNN.\n\nBut for now, the inflation outlook is looking positive, Allen said.\n\n“The vast majority of forces that pushed up inflation (commodity prices, strong labor market of wages and rehiring, rent spikes, consumer spending, large margins, loose monetary policy, and fiscal policies of the Trump and Biden administrations), they’ve all pretty much faded or are falling quite rapidly,” Allen said. “Although, you can’t rule out the effect you might see from some idiosyncratic price risk here or there.”\n\nOn deck: More data. And an election\n\nWith less than four weeks until Election Day, easing inflation pressure has also changed the conversation on the campaign trail.\n\nIn September, an estimated 79% of campaign ads for former President Donald Trump highlighted inflation, according to data from AdImpact. In the first week of October, just 10.5% of ads for Trump, the Republican candidate, mentioned inflation.\n\nBut for Vice President Kamala Harris, who served in an administration during which the cost of living rose the most in decades, the issue is still top of mind. On the eve of the new data, Harris unveiled a new ad outlining policies she’d pursue to keep bringing inflation down.\n\nThursday’s report was the last CPI to land before both the November presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s next policymaking meeting.\n\nOther key inflation data will follow: The latest read on wholesale inflation will land Friday; while the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the most comprehensive look (and the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge), will publish at the end of the month.\n\nThose likely will take a backseat to the October jobs report, which is due out November 1. With inflation mostly tamed and moving in the right direction, Fed officials have zeroed in on the health of the labor market.\n\nA robust jobs report for September helped ease fears that the US employment landscape was crumbling.\n\nThe October jobs report, although immensely critical, also will be quite noisy: The month’s employment numbers are likely to be depressed by an ongoing Boeing strike as well as the ripple effects from Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\nOn Thursday, a separate report from the Labor Department showed some hints of what’s to come: First-time claims for unemployment benefits spiked last week to their highest level since August 2023, a reflection of strike- and hurricane-related effects.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Donald Trump would put that at risk.”\n\nThe video led to outrage from various Catholic groups who saw it as mocking the Holy Communion, where bread and wine are given to represent the body and blood of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn a post on X, the right-leaning Catholic advocacy group CatholicVote questioned how the video could “be interpreted other than mockery of Catholics and the sacrament of Holy Communion,” and said it is “the latest example of the gross anti-Catholic bigotry festering inside the Democratic Party.”\n\nThe group later called for an apology from Whitmer.\n\n“Any slight mockery of another faith would be met with outrage, and an immediate apology would be issued,” the group said. “Why hasn’t she done that yet?”\n\nAnother group, the Catholic League, called the video “anti-Catholic bigotry.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n“What Whitmer did was to deride Holy Communion,” Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said in a statement. “There is no wiggle room for her to deny the obvious. … What Whitmer did is political suicide.”\n\nWhitmer was on an episode of Chip Chat called “Gretchen Whitmer Wants To Meet Her Kidnappers” with Plank on her YouTube channel. At the beginning of the episode, Plank jokingly asked Whitmer whether she wants a “post-birth abortion” since her daughters leave their cups lying around, to which Whitmer laughed, saying, “There is no such thing.”","summary":"Gov.

Thursday, Trump campaigned in Detroit, Michigan, where when he wasn’t busy insulting the city itself, he was tossing out a previously unannounced plan to make the interest on car loans tax-deductible. \n\nThis, of course, is nothing but pandering on Trump’s part, his lizard brain scrambling for something that would appeal to auto workers in a key swing state. \n\nIt’s telling that Trump didn’t propose anything that would directly change those workers’ lives for the better, such as improved safety protections or supporting strong unions as a bulwark against management. Instead, Trump, the man of the people, knows what auto workers crave: a tax break that would benefit rich people who buy expensive vehicles and would somehow magically trickle down to the workers who make those vehicles. \n\nIf this sort of thing sounds familiar, that’s because it is. When it comes to economic plans, Trump really has only one trick up his sleeve: tax relief. Well, he does have the whole “deporting millions will increase housing stock and therefore lower prices” idea, one that, besides being viciously racist, would tank the economy. Aside from that, all he’s got are vague ideas that tax credits and the like will somehow carry the election and save the economy. \n\nIt would be generous to call Trump’s car loan interest notion any more than a concept of a plan, but Trump is touting that it would “stimulate massive domestic auto production and make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.” As one tax expert pointed out, this won’t help most people, as most Americans don’t itemize deductions as doing so isn’t typically greater than the standard deduction. \n\nBut you know who does itemize deductions? Rich people. \n\nUltimately, Trump’s idea is this: people will have so much spare cash from deducting car loan interest that they’ll buy new cars in droves, ushering in a renaissance of American car manufacturing. Since Trump has released no specifics on the plan, it’s anyone’s guess how this would happen.\n\nTrump’s plan to fix the staggering cost of long-term home health care is similarly light on details. Trump was forced to come up with something in response to Vice President Kamala Harris’ plan to expand Medicare to cover home health care costs. Costs for in-home health care are currently beyond the reach of many. Having an aide come in 40 hours per week costs almost $69,000 per year, and round-the-clock services can exceed $288,000. \n\nHome health care support would allow older adults to remain in their homes longer without resorting to a patchwork of unpaid care from family caregivers, many of whom have to quit their jobs to provide full-time care. The AARP estimates that caregivers provide $600 billion in unpaid care annually. A plan to cover these costs would be a game changer for millions. \n\nSo what would Trump do? Besides a substance-free statement that he would “take care of our seniors by shifting resources back to at-home senior care,” he would support “unpaid family caregivers through tax credits and reduced red tape.” \n\nSo, all the people who are currently trying to juggle their caregiving duties while also holding down a job and those who have had to quit a job to provide care will still have to do those things, but if they can white-knuckle it through another year, they’ll get to lower their tax bill. \n\nTrump’s other economic proposals, which are less proposals and more a product of Trump pandering to whatever audience he is in front of, are similarly tied to his love of tax cuts. He’s proposed eliminating taxes on Americans who live abroad, but given that overseas workers who make less than $126,500 already don’t have to pay, this is just another gift to rich people. \n\nHe’s also proposed getting rid of taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security. Even if one pretends he’s sincere about that, those moves would blow a hole in the federal budget. Estimates for the cost of Trump’s tax giveaways range from $8.5 trillion to $9.75 trillion over the next ten years. Trump would fund these cuts by imposing massive tariffs. \n\nEven if one takes seriously the idea that the best plan for America is making consumer goods cost much more, the overall effects of this proposal benefit, of course, the rich. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that taxes would increase for all but the top 5% under Trump’s plan. \n\nNo one should be surprised that Trump, who managed to pay only $750 in income tax in 2017, despite reporting income of over $14 million that year, would fixate on tax abatement as What the People Really Want. However, regular folks can’t take advantage of the pro-business tax breaks that allow Trump to offset his considerable income with tax credits for his even more considerable business losses. \n\nNor did regular folks benefit from Trump’s massive 2017 tax cut, which made the extremely wealthy even more extremely wealthy but didn’t help the rest of us. A Harris presidency would instead focus on relief on issues affecting everyday Americans. In stark contrast, all a second Trump term guarantees is that the rich will get much, much richer.","summary":"Another day, another profoundly unserious economic proposal from Donald Trump.

During a recent Instagram Live session, Alabama, who recently turned 18, explained that she doesn’t feel educated on the candidates and, therefore, doesn't believe it's right to vote. She said, “It’s kinda immature if I talk about it and I’m not fully educated, but I do have an opinion, and I’ll keep it to myself. Not voting isn’t crazy, in my opinion, at all, because if I don’t feel like I have the exact education for what I’m voting for, how is it right for me to vote for something I’m not completely educated on?”\n\nAs per The Independent, she added that while she could educate herself on candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, she sees no point in doing so since she doesn’t have a strong interest in politics. In a futile attempt, she explained, “Why am I doing that if I genuinely really don’t care? I’m just honest. I don’t care to vote if I don’t know exactly what’s going on. I don’t think that’s wrong…I have an opinion on what I feel is right because of what I’ve been seeing. And just, like, I feel like one of the voters is just a mess. I mean, one of the – sorry – one of the people, the runners, candidates. See? I’m telling you, I’m not educated. I’m a little bit stupid.”\n\nAlabama's stance came as a shocker as the Kardashian family has always urged folks to vote, particularly during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Khloé Kardashian, for instance, took to social media to dispute claims that her family hadn’t done enough to encourage voter participation. When a Twitter user suggested that Khloé and her family hadn’t used their massive influence to push for voter turnout, the reality star was quick to argue, \"My family and I have encouraged the importance of voting, registering to vote, and using your platforms. We have been posting for weeks...where people can register. Where people can vote. We have made it super simplistic/easy. Please be fully informed before you make untrue claims.\"\n\nIndeed, during the 2020 election, members of the Kardashian-Jenner family made significant efforts to urge their millions of followers to vote. Kim Kardashian posted, \"I VOTED!!!! Did you? If you are in line when the hours of operation close at the polls, they are required to stay open and allow you to vote, so do not get out of line!\" as reported by the E! News.\n\nMoreover, Khloé tweeted, \"I am seeing that so many people were unable to sleep because of the elections. Even people not from this country. Many are riddled with nerves. Try to take care of yourselves today. 30 minutes of praying or meditation may help. We will all get through this together. We have to.\"","summary":"Barker said, “I have an opinion on what I feel is right because of what I’ve been seeing...I’m telling you, I’m not educated.

Bodies littered the corridors and pavements as if hostile troops had just swept through. Elected council chairmen have elected to stay away from their offices creating an impasse of governance. As ungovernability and a breakdown of law and order loom, the dreaded phrase, “state of emergence” has crept into the lexicon of dominant discourse all over again. The fear of the main gladiators is not about the fate of democracy in the greatest conglomeration of black people but a change in the sitting arrangement at dinner and the positioning of apex predators at the buffet queue.\n\n Unfortunately, the wager is that this will not be the last eruption in Rivers State. There are many rivers to cross in Rivers and for a “more perfect” democratic process in Nigeria, potentially and arguably the greatest Black nation on earth, a tribute to the subversive imaginary of the colonialists and capacity for inventive self-undermining. It has been said that if Nigeria does not exist, a commodious and expansive nation like this will have to be willed into existence by visionary African emancipators to represent the Black person and his interest in the final working out of the occidental dominance of the universe.\n\n Readers should note that this column has not mentioned democracy but “the democratic process”. Given the recrudescence of military coups in many African countries, the authoritarian populist backlash against democracy in many European, Asian and Latin American countries and the threat of Donald Trump to turn America into an anti-democratic, authoritarian conglomeration of ethnic deadwood and underachieving racist bigots, the plight of democracy these days remind one of a quote often misattributed to Herman Goering, the late NAZI chieftain who transformed from an aviator hero of the German people during the First World War to a dope-crazed sybaritic punk as Hitler’s deputy. Goering was said to have famously exploded that whenever he heard the word culture, he always reached for his gun. It is to be hoped that the same fate does not overtake democracy.\n\n There is as yet no ideal democratic society anywhere in the world. At best, democracy remains a permanent work in progress. Dating back to the time of the Greek utopianists, the idea of people’s power(Demos and cratos) is an appealing and winning combination indeed, targeting the subliminal yearnings of all humanity for freedom. No human system has been put together, not even the Chinese authoritarian populism, that is superior to democracy in terms of its capacity for the egalitarian redistribution of societal privileges. It is left for each society to fashion out which mode of democracy is best suited to the pressing and urgent needs of their people based on the correct political architecture of the nation. A society engaged in a quest for democracy in the face of dire structural misconfiguration of the nation is engaged in a forlorn Sisyphean quest. Rapid economic transformation may blunt the rough edges for some time and lure the people into the quietude of self-sufficiency but they will rear their head again once acute scarcity due to political de-formation reappears.\n\n Why is it that Rivers State, the colonial jewel in Nigeria’s crown with its storied Garden City and glittering pearl of its postcolonial petrodollar possibilities, ever a recurring decimal of political violence and destabilization in Nigeria’s post-military Fourth Republic? Is there something about this unflattering development that is symptomatic of the democratic hiatus in Nigeria’s post-military dispensation? To be sure, gladiators on both sides of the political divide in Rivers State have cast themselves in heroic and iconic garbs. On the one side are those who believe they are acting as liberators of their people from the clutches of ethnic domination and tyranny. On the other side are those who purport to defend the rule of law and democratic order. Both are false garbs and nothing can be further from the truth. Political battles are often fought under certain occlusions which preclude actors from seeing themselves the way they truly are. The hard truth is that what is going on in the Rivers state is the struggle for the allocation of resources and who gets what and at what time. As it often occurs in politics, the end-result may manifest some of the stated ideals but only as by-products of the real contestation.\n\nRead Also: Rivers LG polls: Observers blame non-state actors for post-election violence\n\n As our readers will attest, this column does not dwell on individuals or personalities. Individuals are important only to the extent that they illuminate the political and historical process. The classic summation of the materialist reading of historical developments is that people make history but not under the circumstances of their choice. In our commentary so far about the crisis in the Rivers State as it unfolded, we had cautioned the minister of the Federal Capital Territory to exercise some restraint and rectitude over his occasionally intemperate outbursts and barely disguised attempt to exercise political overlordship in a state whose reins of power he had willingly ceded to his political godson and self-designated successor, Siminilayi Fubara. If the optics of Wike’s political one-upmanship didn’t look too good then, the auguries have gone dire with the latest development. Please permit us to quote this column at some length.\n\n“It is not known whether Nyesom Wike, the current minister of the Federal Capital Authority, immediate past governor of Rivers State and –as some would insist—the de facto third term governor of the state, is trained to read political signboards or savvy enough to decode horoscopes of impending disaster. One thing is clear. The fascination of a moth with fireballs always leads to self-immolation” 9/4/2023. One line from that piece that continues to haunt even the writer in its prescience and premonition is this: “Despite his official protestations of peace and harmony, it is only a question of time before Fubara pulls the trigger”. \n\n Fubara duly pulled the trigger last week in what appeared to be a seamlessly choreographed political demolition of his former master and presumptive patron. He had managed to organize local government elections while his old boss was waiting for the law and the rule of law to come to his aid. In the light of the overwhelming popular acceptance which seems to confer a solid legitimacy on the polls, the recourse to legalistic obscurantism may well be akin to pursuing historical chimeras. In the strange feudalization of politics in the post-military dominion, it is becoming an established tradition that the king must die for his successor to thrive, whereas in more traditional societies, a possible successor must be out of the sights of the reigning king or he will come to grievous harm. As Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the founding father of Ivory Coast, famously retorted: A Baole Chief does not know his successor. And he never did until he breathed his last, plunging his nation into a monumental crisis of succession which eventually led to civil war and a brief partitioning of the country.\n\n In Rivers State since the advent of civil rule and increasingly in the rest of the country, the successor must not know the former king. He must be killed off politically or perish in less amenable circumstances. Thus in the beginning, Peter Odili begat Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi his former PA and office boy who threw him off the cliff. Rotimi Amaechi begat Nyesom Wike who tomahawked him in the manner of Red Indian head-hunters. And now Wike begat Sim Fubara who ran him out of town wailing and gnashing his teeth with a carving knife sticking out. Having been demystified in his home base, no matter the outcome of the court case, Wike for now should avoid lending a helping hand to his numerous political adversaries.\n\n It will be extremely politically naïve and utterly presumptuous of the former governor of Rivers State to imagine that he can second-guess his current patron or corral him into underwriting his political misadventure. The former governor of Lagos State is an extremely dexterous and multi-dimensional political poker player who can deal several apparently countervailing cards at the same time. As the male servant in The Labyrinth of the General will put it: “ Only my master knows what my master is thinking about”. It is possible, just possible, that while Wike is completely obsessed and consumed by his political offensive against Fubara and his core supporters, his boss may be looking ahead to reaching political accommodation with the fourth largest ethnic nationality in the nation. The Ijaw people did not obstruct his path to the presidency. They looked the other way while controversial presidential election took place in the state. With the South East already on a virtual war footing, alienating such an important ethnic bloc with its volatile and combustible personalities will amount to a costly strategic error in the rocky days ahead.\n\nWe can now end by speculating on just what type of national legacy brings about the type of politics on display in Rivers State which is as mean-spirited just as it is murky and murderous. Needless to add that it is also generally symptomatic of political developments in post-military Nigeria. Like a virus that has infected the entire society, the type of guardroom and garrison politics bequeathed to the nation by the protracted stretch of military rule takes time to work out of the body politic. One of the outstanding deficiencies is the decline and death of ideology. Ideology, or fanatical attachment and devotion to a set of ideas, is the glue that binds politicians of different and contrasting personality-types together in the name of an ideal that transcends individual peculiarities.\n\n Ideology is the secret weapon of the modern party. A rational human being just must believe in something and have a vision of the society they want. Parties without ideologies are nothing but elite conspiracies to appropriate power for the purpose of unfettered access to state resources. Up to a point, ideologies worked in the First and Second Republics in ensuring party cohesion and internal order. This was particularly true of the Action Group and the Unity Party of Nigeria. Until it was sundered by external pressures and the resurgence of personality differences, the Action Group was a modern wonder of cohesion, internal discipline and organizational acumen.\n\n Unfortunately, the inauspicious corollary of the collapse of ideology in Nigeria’s post-military polity is the sheer indifference and lethargic apathy to party cadre recruitment and rigorous leadership selection. Since nature abhors a vacuum, the yawning gap is filled by an ethnic revanchism of the most violent and virulent type and a growing cult of personality at all levels which conduce to a further problematization of the intractable National Question. In such circumstances, it is almost impossible to produce a transcendental leadership except by miraculous default which cannot be discounted given Nigeria’s legendary capacity to soar above the flames of its own self-immolation. Taken together, it can now be seen why there are still many perilous rivers to cross both in Rivers State and the rest of the nation.","summary":"Once again, Rivers State has erupted in huge fireballs as anarchy and mayhem swept across many of its councils.

The rule of law versus Donald Trump's lawlessness, kindness versus cruelty. If you are concerned about those things and are worried Harris could very well lose, well, do something,\" Brzezinski begged voters.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI, 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOST: My attitude, if you will. So that's the thing, is this morning and also all week, we've been talking about the frustration among a lot of Democrats that maybe the message isn't breaking through to key voters. I mean, the polls seem so close every time a new one comes out, neck and neck.\n\nAnd there's this fear that Donald Trump is poised for victory. I think it's fair for Democrats to be incredibly depressed. I think it's fair for them to be discouraged.\n\nI think it's fair for them to explore whether Kamala Harris should be doing more. Feel free to do that. These things are all legitimate.\n\nI don't know what more she can do, especially given what happened, though, in 2016, because that was a trauma for anybody who loves this country and a trauma that didn't end that day. Obviously, Democrats want to make up for lost time as Kamala Harris has just days left to truly introduce herself to the American people. At the same time, it could be argued she's doing everything possible.\n\nRallies with tens of thousands of people, talk shows, radio, late night TV, podcasts, town halls are next. You can't claim she's not doing town halls. She wants to debate.\n\nShe's hitting the battleground states multiple times. She's sending her top surrogates out on the road for a four week blitz through swing states, including former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, encouraging and winning over Republicans, including Liz Cheney, top military brass, top economic leaders, even members of Trump's own administration, trying to tell Americans that she is for them. The rule of law, the Constitution, that she's not a felon like her opponent, that she's not a con artist like her opponent, that she's not an adjudicated sexual abuser like her opponent, that she's not a person who devalues the truth like her opponent, that she's an honest broker who will do her best at this time of peril for the country.\n\nObviously, Democrats want to leave no stone unturned, and the Democratic National Committee even has this new ad about the danger of the undervote or those who may vote for Jill Stein. Just three percent of the vote. Take a look.\n\nAD: Jill Stein, Green Party candidate for president. So why are Trump's close allies helping her? Stein was key to Trump's 2016 wins in battleground states. She's not sorry she helped Trump win. That's why a vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump. Jill Stein, I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100 percent from them. I'm Kamala Harris, and I approve this message.\n\nSo sure, offer up all the ideas of what more Harris could be doing in these few remaining days before the election. At the same time, it's actually you, the American voter, who needs to step up.\n\nTruly look at the choice before us. Listen to Donald Trump's speeches. Truth over lies, democracy versus fascism or something like that looks like it.\n\nYour interests rather than revenge for Donald Trump's ego. The rule of law versus Donald Trump's lawlessness, kindness versus cruelty. If you are concerned about those things and are worried Harris could very well lose, well, do something.\n\nGet to work. As Barack Obama said in Pittsburgh last night, don't just sit back and hope for the best. Vote and help get out the vote.\n\nIf we care about this experiment called America, the search for a more perfect union that has the possibility of being ever more perfect every day. Don't despair. Don't be discouraged.\n\nI mean, you can be, but don't just be. Don't just criticize. And women, I'm talking to you because this is about getting back our 50 years of rights so our daughters can be safe at the doctor.\n\nWe know better. We know better than to wait for someone else to get this job done. We're women.\n\nWe always come through for each other. So let's not miss this opportunity to step up for women, for families across the United States of America. And if you're frightened by the option of Donald Trump, don't just talk about all the things you think the Harris camp is doing wrong.\n\nGet to work. I know women will.

These yellow states are the toss-up states that we've talked about, and as we stand in this what-if scenario, 225 to 219 here.\n\nNow, if you take the Real Clear Politics average of the recent polls as of tonight, now understanding that some of them are one point, less than one point, a couple points within the margin of error, but if you said tonight was the election, Kamala Harris would win in Nevada, she would win in Wisconsin, she would win Nebraska's district there, 242 to 219. As of tonight, however, Donald Trump would win Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, and he would win in Pennsylvania. 296 to 242, and he would be the 47th president of the United States.\n\nWhen you see these articles, Democrats are very concerned about where the trend is going. This is one of the reasons, because they look at the possibility of that sweep of the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt. But that sweep could favor the former president even more.\n\nA new Wall Street Journal survey out today shows him leading Harris in Nevada by six points. That would give the former president a razor-thin edge in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. In our what-if scenario tonight, we would award him Nevada's six electoral votes, making the new outcome 302 for Trump, 236 for Harris, and increasing Democratic jitters.\n\nRelated Topics: BRET BAIER, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris\n\n Show comments\n Hide Comments \n\n Send Tips\n\n Follow Us\n\n Latest Political Videos","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/10/12/bret_baier_the_path_to_the_presidency_current_what-if_scenario_shows_trump_winning_302-236.html","image":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/66/666127_5_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 22:47:34","author":"Bret Baier,Ian Schwartz,Special Report","authors":["Bret Baier","Ian Schwartz","Special Report"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":259474170,"title":"America First Policy Institute, a group advising Trump, says its systems were breached","text":"A group helping to lay the groundwork for a future Donald Trump administration said its computer systems were breached, marking the second known instance that people supporting the former president have been the target of a cyberattack.\n\nThe America First Policy Institute discovered the breach last week.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, set the record straight on how former President Donald Trump's and Vice President Kamala Harris' leadership styles for America's veterans differ during a campaign stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. The Republican vice presidential nominee's rally was held at JWF Industries, which supplies \"Department of Defense prime contractors with reliable, on-time fabrications and sub-assemblies,\" according to its site. Vance, himself a Marine veteran, asked the crowd, \"When our own citizens suffer and our veterans are at the top of that list, [do] you know what a big difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris [is]?\" 'WE BELIEVE IN DONALD TRUMP': MORE THAN A DOZEN MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS ENDORSE FORMER PRESIDENT \"Donald Trump wants to put American citizens and American veterans first. He thinks the government of this country exists to serve the people of this country, not people who shouldn't be here in the first place,\" said Vance. \"That is one of the biggest differences between the leadership of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\" Vance's comments came on the heels of a question from a reporter asking how the Trump-Vance ticket would prioritize ending veteran homelessness in America, as Pennsylvania has the fourth-highest rate of veteran homelessness in the country. In late August, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it would award over $800 million nationwide in grants through the Supportive Services for Veteran Families and Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem programs, with $17 million of the overall grant going to Pennsylvania. According to nonprofit Mission Roll Call, an average of 35,574 veterans experienced homelessness per diem in 2023. Veteran homelessness increased 7.4% from 2022 to 2023 during the Biden administration, according to the VA. TRUMP CAMPAIGN SEEKS INCREASED SECURITY AS ELECTION DRAWS NEAR, INCLUDING MILITARY AIRCRAFT AMID IRAN THREATS \"Let's be honest here, $17 million,\" Vance said. \"While it will help, it is not nearly enough to meet the challenge of the homeless veteran population in this country. \"These guys went off to war. Some of them came back with wounds, some of them with wounds you cannot see. But all of them came back with the pride that they served their country and did what our country asked them to do,\" he added. \"How disgraceful is it that millions of our veterans are getting left behind in some form or another, and thousands of them are homeless? When we're housing illegal aliens in first-class hotels, it's a disgrace.\" In New York City alone, 119 migrant shelters contracted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are hotels and motels. An additional 38 hotels are contracted through different agencies. Veterans 4 America First Institute (V4AF), a self-described grassroots policy organization and nonprofit, responded to Vance's comments on Trump and Harris' differing approaches toward veterans. \"Senator Vance is 100% correct, more needs to be done for our homeless veterans, especially at a time under VP Harris when the Department of Veterans Affairs dropped the ball as veteran homelessness went up over 7% last year,\" Darin Selnick, V4AF founder and Air Force veteran, told Fox News Digital. \"Meanwhile, the VA gives special treatment to illegal immigrants by processing and paying their ICE medical claims and to special interests over veterans, such as what is happening at the West L.A. campus where VA has turned its back on homeless veterans while giving illegal leases to UCLA, Brentwood School and an oil company,\" continued Selnick. The VA was recently ruled against during a case in Los Angeles after it had been discovered that the organization had \"quietly sold off\" land deeded in 1888 as an Old Soldiers' Home to private interests instead of building housing units for veterans. U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., introduced a bill last December that would block VA funding for illegal immigrants nationwide called the \"No VA Resources for Illegal Aliens Act\" after reports came out of the DHS using VA funding for illegal migrants in ICE detention. Selnick added: \"It is time for VP Harris to walk the walk instead of just talking, and to do what is right for veterans instead of using veterans as a political prop.\" The Republican National Committee's official platform for 2024 includes a subsection titled \"Take Care of Our Veterans,\" saying, \"Republicans will end luxury housing and Taxpayer benefits for Illegal Immigrants and use those savings to shelter and treat homeless Veterans.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We will restore Trump Administration reforms to expand Veterans' Healthcare Choices, protect Whistleblowers, and hold accountable poorly performing employees not giving our Veterans the care they deserve,\" the document continued.

Taking to Instagram, Guilfoyle shared a carousel of photos from Ronan’s formal events. However, the images prominently featured heavily edited shots of Guilfoyle and Ronan. As soon as the pictures were dropped, many Internet users called her out for the over-edited pictures. \n\nGuilfoyle's caption did attempt to center the celebration on Ronan, reading, \"Happy 18th Birthday, Ronan! Watching you grow into the incredible young man you are today has been my greatest joy. Love you to the moon and back.\" However, the overall presentation of the post left some questioning whether Ronan’s milestone was truly the focus. \n\nOne person took to the comments section and wrote, \"Isn't this more of a fashion show for Kimberly?\" Sharing the edited photos, one person wrote, \"Good grief. Even photoshopping doesn’t help. I almost feel sorry for her. Sad.\" Another replied, \"Why have they tried to photoshop themselves into live-action 'Simpsons' characters?\" Another one commented, \"She’d look better if she wiped off the Elvira makeup.\"\n\nGuilfoyle has been critiqued for her over-the-top photoshopped posts several times in the past, according to Nicki Swift. In October 2022, Guilfoyle posted a birthday post for Ronan's 16th, where the over-the-top photoshop left her looking unrecognizable with flawless skin and cat-like eyes, while Ronan's skin took on an unnatural orangey hue. One netizen asked, \"OMG... What did you do to your face???\"\n\nSimilarly, in December 2023, during an Impact Wealth Magazine shoot, Guilfoyle shared an overly edited photo with Donald Trump, which gave both figures a waxwork-like appearance, with Trump looking years younger than his actual age. The bizarre look led to comments such as, \"This is obviously photoshopped since he is about 100 lbs heavier these days.\"\n\nAdding to the controversy, her son’s birthday post also became a platform for political commentary. Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., saw the comments section flooded with messages encouraging Ronan to vote for Trump in the upcoming election, reported Meaww. One Instagram user commented, \"Now we need Trump back in the White House.\" Another penned, \"Happy 18th Birthday, Ronan! You get to vote! VOTE TRUMP!\" \n\nGuilfoyle often posts photos with Ronan. Earlier this year on National Son's Day, she shared- a series of photos with him and captioned it, \"Happy National Son's Day to my best boy. You are everything a mother could dream of in a lifetime.\" She continued, \"Thank you for always being such a good person. You are loving, kind, hardworking, patient, and filled with joy. Time has flown by; can't wait for you to turn 15 on October 4th.\" \n\nOn Mother's Day, Guilfoyle shared pictures of the two enjoying a meal together. She captioned the photos, \"Such a special Mother's Day with my beautiful son, Ronan. Hope everyone had a great Mother's Day & spent quality time with their loved ones.

But while the storm was “significant”, he said, “thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario.” \n\nIn a White House briefing, US President Joe Biden said experts estimated the cost of storm damage at USD50 billion. \n\nThe federal response to the huge storm – and to Hurricane Helene, which devastated parts of the US southeast just two weeks earlier – has taken on an increasingly political edge, and Biden said he would be visiting Florida.\n\nAmid questions as to whether the federal response is adequately funded, the president called on Congress to “step up” its efforts, particularly to shore up hard-hit small businesses. The agency that lends to them and families said on Friday it is overwhelmed by this disaster and others and is running out of money. \n\nFormer president Donald Trump has falsely claimed that the Biden-Harris administration has diverted hurricane response funds to care for migrants, drawing pushback even from some Republican officials. Asked whether Trump was singularly to blame for a dangerous swirl of misinformation, Biden replied, “No… but he has the biggest mouth.” \n\nOn Siesta Key, a beautiful barrier island near Sarasota where the storm made landfall, Milton left a desolate landscape. Some streets were still flooded on Friday. Fallen trees and debris – sofas, beds, chairs and appliances, much of it left behind by Helene – were strewn haphazardly on roadsides. \n\n“It’s just terrible,” John Maloney, 61, who owns a home remodeling company, said as he removed tree limbs from a seaside house he was working on. “But I think we’ll rebuild again.” Tornadoes, not floodwaters, were behind many of the storm’s deaths. At least six people were killed in St Lucie County, four in Volusia County, two in Pinellas County, and one each in Hillsborough, Polk, Orange and Citrus counties, officials said. The storm downed power lines, shredded the roof of the Tampa baseball stadium and inundated homes. \n\nA boat moves in deep floodwaters after Hurricane Milton in Florida, United States.

The upper chamber is currently controlled by the Democrats, who hold a narrow majority of 51 seats as four independents caucus with the party, while Republicans hold 49 seats.McCormick is a businessman, veteran, and politician who previously served as chief executive officer of Bridgewater Associates, a large hedge fund, and Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs during the George W. Bush administration. This is his second senatorial campaign, the first was back in 2022. He is running to unseat Casey, who has represented the state in the Senate since 2007 and serves as the chair of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.A New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College poll of 857 likely voters that was conducted between October 7 and 10 found that 48 percent of Pennsylvanian voters support the incumbent, 44 percent back McCormick, and 8 percent are undecided or declined to answer.Casey's 4-percentage point lead is just beyond the poll's margin of error of 3.8 percentage points.The poll's crosstabs show Casey leading among women voters, 54 percent to McCormick's 37 percent, while McCormick holds an edge among men, 52 percent to Casey's 41 percent.McCormick polls worst among voters age 30-44, earning 37 percent compared to Casey's 53 percent. On the other hand, Casey performs worst among younger voters, aged 18-29 years old, though he still leads with 44 percent to McCormick's 42 percent.Newsweek has reached out to Casey's and McCormick's campaigns for comment via email on Saturday evening.Saturday's poll also asked voters their preference for control of the U.S. Senate, with 48 percent favoring Democratic control, 46 percent supporting Republican control, and 6 percent undecided or declining to answer.This latest poll finds that Casey's lead has nearly halved, as a New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College poll of 1,082 likely voters from September 11 to 16, found Casey with a 9-point lead, 49 percent to McCormick's 40 percent.The Cook Political Report labels the Pennsylvania Senate race as \"Leans Democratic,\" alongside two other battleground states, Arizona and Nevada, with Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio's Senate seats classified as \"Toss Up.\"Up the ticket, Pennsylvania is one of the closest swing state races for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, respectively.Saturday's Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College poll found Harris leading Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, within the poll's margin of error. Other recent polls in the battleground state show a near deadlock between the two nominees, with any lead falling within the margin of error.The Times' Pennsylvania aggregate poll has Harris ahead of Trump, 49 to 48 percent. Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight shows a closer race, with Harris at 47.9 percent and Trump at 47.5 percent.

Blood and Meg Kinnard | Associated Press\n\nCOACHELLA, Calif — With the presidency on the line in battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, why would Donald Trump venture into California, one of the most solidly Democratic states, just weeks before Election Day?\n\nTrump is almost certain to lose California, and that won’t change after his scheduled Saturday stop in Coachella, a desert city east of Los Angeles best known for the annual music festival bearing its name. Still, there are practical reasons for him to visit, despite the Republican nominee’s prospects Nov. 5 in the most populous state.\n\nThe former president lost California in a landslide in 2020. He did get 6 million-plus votes, more than any GOP presidential candidate before, and his margins topped 70% in some rural counties that typically favor conservatives on the ballot.\n\nThat’s an enormous pool of potential volunteers to work on state races and participate in phone banks into the most contested states. And Trump is likely to draw extensive media coverage in the Los Angeles market, the second-largest in the country.\n\nTrump is visiting Coachella in between stops in Nevada, at a roundtable in Las Vegas for Latinos earlier Saturday — where he praised Hispanics as having “such energy” — and Arizona, for a rally Sunday in Prescott Valley. He narrowly lost those two swing states to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAttendees waiting in broiling temperatures that approached 100 degrees Saturday said they didn’t expect Trump to win their state but were thrilled to see him.\n\n“It’s like a convention of like-minded people,” Tom Gibbons of Palm Desert, who’s backed Trump since 2016 but been unable to see him in person until Saturday, said as he stood in line at a food truck on the polo fields that will house the crowd at the Coachella event. “Everybody understands the heartbeat of America, the plight of the working man. … It’s reassuring.”\n\nGoing to California gives Trump the “ability to swoop in and leverage this big population of Trump supporters,” said Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign in Michigan and also worked in the former president’s administration. He’s “coming here and activating that.”\n\nLineberger recalled Californians making calls to Michigan voters in 2016 on Trump’s behalf and said the campaign’s decision to go into safe, Democratic turf at this point was “an aggressive, offensive play.”\n\nCalifornia is also a fountain of campaign cash for both parties, and Trump will be fundraising. Photos with the former president in Coachella were priced at $25,000, which comes with special seating for two. A “VIP Experience” was priced at $5,000.\n\nWith congressional races in California in play that could determine which party controls the House, the Coachella rally “is a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energizes Republicans in California, when they are not as close to what is going on in the national campaign,” Republican consultant Tim Rosales said.\n\nRosales also said to look for Trump to continue his long-running spat with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nFor Republicans, “It’s motivating when you can pick at California a little bit and the governor … will take the bait,” Rosales said.\n\nNewsom on Wednesday predicted Trump would be denigrating the state at the rally, overlooking its strengths as the world’s fifth-largest economy. The governor said that for the first time in a decade, California has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.\n\n“You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” he predicted.\n\nJim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, said he thinks Trump is angling for something that has eluded him in previous campaigns: winning more total votes than his Democratic opponent.\n\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote. There are more registered voters in California than there are residents in 46 of the other 49 states,” Brulte said.\n\nThe Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles sits on the Pacific Coast, south of the city. But Trump has long had a conflicted relationship with California, where a Republican has not carried the state since 1988 and Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by about 2-to-1.\n\nCalifornia was home to the so-called Trump resistance during his time in office, and Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. As president, he called the homeless crises in Los Angeles and San Francisco disgraceful and threatened to intercede.\n\nHe is likely to spend time on Saturday linking California’s problems to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee and a San Francisco Bay Area native who was California’s attorney general and represented the state in the Senate.\n\nHis campaign issued a statement alleging that under Harris, “the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans.”\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the state GOP, said she looked forward to hearing Trump contrast his agenda with a Democratic White House that “has left Californians less safe and with less money in their pockets.”\n\nRepublicans, she promised, “will do our part to secure a House majority.”\n\nTom Beaumont in Las Vegas contributed to this report.","summary":"With the presidency on the line in battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, why would Donald Trump venture into California, one of the most solidly Democratic states, just weeks before Election Day?","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/12/why-is-donald-trump-campaigning-in-california-a-state-hes-almost-certain-to-lose/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Election_2024_Trump_75640.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 22:02:40","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.017},{"id":259471920,"title":"JD Vance refuses to say he’s ‘OK’ with people traveling to other states for abortions","text":"Senator JD Vance has made headlines for espousing anti-abortion rhetoric but in an interview published on Saturday, he said he accepts, that as a consequence of states regulating abortion, people will travel to obtain one – but stopped short of giving his approval.\n\nVance has made it abundantly clear through his comments he, personally, disagrees with abortion. Democrats have seized on that, claiming Vance would push his personal views of abortion to obtain a federal ban or federal regulation of some sort.\n\nVance and his running mate, Donald Trump, have disputed that. In his interview with the New York Times, Vance reiterated that he fully accepts each state will create their own rules which in turn will make those seeking abortions in restrictive states travel to non-restrictive states.\n\n“In fact, I accept that as the reality of the state-level, state-focused regime that President Trump and I are encouraging people to take, Vance said. “Am I OK with it? I don’t think that’s the right way to look at it.”\n\n“I’m OK with the states making these decisions, even if they make decisions that JD Vance or Donald Trump might not make,” he added.\n\nAt the same time Vance sought to assure people he would “accept that as the reality”, he also condemned those who choose not to have children because of climate change, calling it “a very deranged idea.”\n\nThe Ohio Senator shared conflicting views of reproductive freedoms in his New York Times interview, both denouncing people who choose not to have children because of “political ideas” and saying he was not criticizing those who simply choose not to have children.\n\nVance said the movement to overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to enact abortion restrictions was not taking “options away from women” but instead making it “easier” for young women to “choose life”.\n\nThirteen states have near-total abortion bans that force those seeking an abortion to travel, sometimes hundreds of miles, to seek the necessary medical care.\n\nAt least two women have died because of a state’s restrictive abortion laws. Hundreds of others have come forward sharing harrowing stories of physical, mental and emotional trauma as a result of being denied reproductive medical care.\n\nBut rather than focus on the negative consequences of the Supreme Court overturning Roe which allows states to outright ban or severely restrict abortion, Vance portrayed it as a positive development that will promote family – something he believes the U.S. has become anti.\n\nThe Ohio Senator even claimed his constituents’ choice to amend the Ohio Constitution to include a right to abortion was made as a result of “mistrust”. That amendment passed in 2023 with a 57 percent vote in favor of codifying abortion rights.","summary":"Donald Trump’s running mate has created controversy for the campaign when it comes to abortion","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-abortion-travel-interview-b2628360.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/12/22/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VdfKUStd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-12 22:02:10","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":259471624,"title":"Walz tramps through tall grass on pheasant hunting season opener but bags no birds","text":"MINNEAPOLIS -- Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz spent Saturday morning tramping through tall grass on the opening day of Minnesota's pheasant hunting season, giving the campaign a chance to highlight the governor's rural roots and love of outdoor sports. \n\nNeither Walz nor Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan managed to bag any pheasants as they hunted near Sleepy Eye, a town about 90 miles (145 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis. But others in their parties shot six birds on a beautiful fall day, the governor's office said. \n\n“They can hide, they can get under the grass,” Walz could be heard saying as they searched for one downed bird.\n\nThe campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris has been openly confronting the question of whether some men are reluctant to vote for her because she’s a woman. Key supporters are starting to make more direct appeals to male voters, hoping to overcome sexism — and apathy — as Election Day approaches. Harris disclosed during her debate with former President Donald Trump last month that she's a gun owner.\n\nOn Friday, the Democratic ticket announced the launch of Hunters and Anglers for Harris-Walz, a national organizing program to engage sportspeople, conservationists and rural voters in key states.\n\nThe Trump campaign mocked the outing, accusing Walz of “desperately attempting to make up ground with male voters.” The campaign's statement also falsely said there were no guns in sight during the hunt, calling it “a sign of the future under a Harris-Walz administration.”\n\nWhile it's true that a 36-second video clip from MSNBC tweeted by the Trump campaign didn't show any guns, it was recorded before Walz and his party had donned their blaze orange safety vests and hats and and headed into the field after a safety briefing from a conservation officer. They held their shotguns raised to avoid endangering the energetic pointers and Labradors that tried to sniff out birds for the hunters.\n\nWhile Walz had a top rating from the National Rifle Association during his 12 years in Congress, he changed his positions on gun issues after a series of school shootings. As governor, he signed legislation in 2023 expanding background checks for gun transfers and a “red flag law” allowing courts to temporarily take firearms away from people judged to be in imminent risk of harming themselves or others. His wife, Gwen, has been a champion of gun safety legislation.\n\n“Sorry Tim, men aren’t voting for a gun grabber,” the Trump campaign tweeted from an official account.\n\nThe Minnesota Governor’s Pheasant Hunting Opener has been a tradition since 2011, patterned after the state’s older fishing and deer season opener celebrations. It rotates through host communities in the pheasant country of southern and western Minnesota. \n\nWalz went hunting the morning after attending a football game in Mankato, where he was once was an assistant coach.","summary":"The campaign is highlighting the governor's rural roots and love of outdoors.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/walz-tramps-tall-grass-minnesotas-pheasant-hunting-season-114752262","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5c41c8e7-fd05-42a5-b234-73bea8e840f0/wirestory_6fcaf239867c20743efcaedfcd98029f_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:58:26","author":"Steve Karnowski Associated Press","authors":["Steve Karnowski Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":259471668,"title":"Kamala Harris' Doctor Releases Her 'Excellent' Health Summary as Donald Trump Declines to Share Recent Medical Report","text":"Kamala Harris’ doctor deemed her overall health “excellent” as her campaign aims to provide contrast to the limited medical information Donald Trump has shared throughout the years.\n\n On Saturday, Oct. 12, the White House published a medical report penned by the vice president’s physician, Dr. Joshua Simmons. \n\n In the two-page letter — which covers her entire medical history as well as specific figures from her most recent physical exam in April 2024 – Simmons stated that Harris, 59, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.”\n\n The vice president “maintains a healthy, active lifestyle, despite her busy schedule,” Simmons wrote.

Trump recently referred to his Democratic presidential nominee opponent Kamala Harris as “retarded,” according to The New York Times.\n\n Trump has been apparently becoming more frustrated as the election draws closer, and any semblance of decorum seems to be fading. This should be no surprise to anyone paying attention to the dude this country elected back in 2016 who has shown from the beginning that he has little respect for women, having been caught on tape back in 2005 saying as a celebrity he could “grab them by the pussy,” yet, SURPRISE, here we are.\n\n Per The Times, back in September the Republican presidential nominee had a dinner meeting at New York’s Trump Tower with donors that included some big wigs — billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer who finances Republican campaigns and pro-Israel causes, billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens, and billionaire Joe Ricketts and his son Todd among them. Rather than charming them, however, he berated them for not doing enough and disparaged his competition to boot, calling Harris “retarded” and whining about how many Jews were backing her, an apparent affront when he believes he’s done so much for the state of Israel.\n\n He also touted how much he’d done for those in the room, according to seven anonymous people The Times spoke to who had knowledge of the meal, noting he’d been great for the taxes of those in attendance, despite that not being the case for all. His financial stress has fed into his behavior: Harris has raised $1 billion in the less than three months she’s been a candidate — more than Trump has finagled in a year of campaigning.\n\n Trump has had to spend more time cow-towing to donors over rallying, according to the report due to security concerns, although he seems to be doing plenty of rallying with two rallies this weekend, and not spending as much time on the golf course. Still, his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told the outlet money wasn’t a concern. “Kamala Harris has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and is still performing worse than any Democrat who has ever ran against President Trump. Meanwhile, President Trump is in a better financial position than ever before, and he’s leading in the polls,” she said.\n\n In late September, Trump also called Harris “mentally disabled” during one of his anti-migrant rally rants in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.\n\n It’s not the first time he’s been publicly called out for referring to a woman as “retarded.” He had previously referred to Academy Award-winning actress Marlee Matlin as “retarded” while she was a contestant on his show The Apprentice in 2011, according to The Daily Beast’s 2016 report, where three anonymous longtime staffers said Trump “would regularly disrespect the actress and would even treat her as if she were mentally disabled.”\n\n He would, according to the report, insult her behind her back and also to her face. In one instance, he had written on a note one of the staffers found: “Marlee, is she retarded??” Another said he mocked her voice, and a different source outlined a time Trump was “insensitive” directly to Matlin, when he made a comment about her deafness while filming an episode.","summary":"There appears to be no bottom to the Republican presidential nominee's demeaning behavior toward women","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-calls-kamala-harris-retarded-donor-dinner-report-1235132681/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrumpinVegas-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:51:59","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.567},{"id":259471174,"title":"Kamala Harris' Chances of Winning North Carolina as She Campaigns in State","text":"Polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, are neck-and-neck in the key swing state of North Carolina as Harris prepares to hold a campaign rally in the state on Sunday.As Harris prepares to visit the Tarheel State, FiveThirtyEight's poll tracker shows that as of Saturday afternoon Trump is narrowly ahead of Harris by just 0.9 points, with 48.2 percent support compared to her 47.3 percent.Harris will spend Saturday meeting with local Black elected, faith and community leaders at a restaurant in Raleigh, one of the state's largest cities. According to her campaign, she is also slated on Sunday to attend church in Greenville, a key part of a \"Souls to the Polls\" initiative designed to energize voter turnout before holding a campaign rally.The visit is part of a broader strategy to win over the state's diverse voter base, which includes Black and college-educated voters, as well as women who are concerned about the rollback of abortion protections.In addition, Harris' weekend rally will focus on the economy, a central issue in this year's election, as well as the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which has become a political flashpoint with Trump and his allies condemning the Biden administration's response to the natural disaster.This weekend is Harris' second time in the battleground state after it was struck by Helene, which left hundreds dead and dealt massive damage to infrastructure when it ripped through the Southeast late last month.During a visit to the state last weekend, the vice president pledged ongoing federal support in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene as she has also been outspoken about ensuring that relief efforts are equitable and free from corporate price gouging.\"To any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring and there will be a consequence,\" the vice president said at yesterday's briefing.Newsweek has reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaign via email for comment.While the state has a history of backing the Republican candidate for president, including narrowly voting for Trump in 2020, it has elected a Democratic governor in six of the last seven races and is now considered a key battleground state.Battleground states, including North Carolina, will play a key role in determining the result of this year's election due to the Electoral College, which awards each state a certain number of electoral votes based on population. A presidential candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes for victory, and winning the national popular vote does not guarantee success. Surveys from battleground states may be more telling than those of national polls.The latest independent polls in North Carolina show Trump with a narrow lead. An Emerson College poll, which surveyed 1,000 likely voters from October 5 to 8, showed Trump up 1 point in the state (50 to 49 percent).A Wall Street Journal survey of 600 registered voters in each of the main swing states conducted between September 28 and October 8 shows that Trump is narrowly ahead in North Carolina (46 to 45 percent). In addition, he is narrowly ahead in Pennsylvania (46 to 45 percent).However, in that same poll Harris has a slight lead over Trump in four of the seven election battleground states including Arizona (47 percent to 45), Michigan (47 percent to 45), Wisconsin (46 percent to 45) and Georgia (46 percent to 45).It is thought that Harris' clearest path to victory in November would be to win the three blue wall battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Trump's most efficient path to 270 Electoral College votes would be to win the Sun Belt swing states of North Carolina and Georgia and flip Pennsylvania.","summary":"The vice president will hold a campaign rally in the swing state on Sunday amid Donald Trump narrowly polling ahead of her there.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-chances-winning-north-carolina-holds-rally-1968153","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2494096/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:47:23","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":259470844,"title":"“Residents of Aurora, Colorado Share Impact of Venezuelan Gangs on Their Community”","text":"Migrant gang activity in Aurora, Colorado, is making residents feel threatened and some are avoiding the town all together because of it, locals told DailyMail.com. \n\nSpeaking to a crowd of thousands on Friday in Aurora, Colorado, Donald Trump hammered Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s immigration policies, blaming them for local migrant gang activity.\n\nReports of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua (TDA) operating in Aurora went viral in August after a video showed men with rifles and handguns threatening apartment residents before a 25-year-old man was shot and killed. \n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, however, has said TDA’s presence in the area does not surmount to a takeover or the ‘war zone’ Trump has described.\n\nBut the MAGA faithful who showed up to Trump’s rally Friday were adamant that safety in Aurora is worse off because of the gang activity. \n\nRecon, a Marine Corps veteran and Aurora resident, told DailyMail.com that the media has not been following the TDA gang activity close enough. \n\n‘I’m from Aurora Colorado, born and raised Denver Aurora. I went to the Marine Corps for eight years, and I came back home. As far as the migrant situation is concerned, I’m gonna be honest with you, the news and the media and Democrats are covering it up, because it’s bad for politics.’\n\nHe said the TDA gang activity is real and ‘it’s just spreading across the communities that they’re picking,’ noting how the gang activity is not happening in nicer areas. \n\n‘They’re not sending them to Highlands Ranch. They’re not sending them to Cherry Hills village. They’re not sending them to Boulder they’re not sending them to Fort Collins,’ Recon continued. \n\n‘So the facts of the matter is, they’re sending them to the black communities, which which is a conflict of interest considering that since the cost of inflation has went up, everything has gotten more expensive, and people can’t even pay for childcare.’\n\nCortney, another Aurora resident who lives 20 minutes from the apartment where the migrant gang activity was filmed, admitted ‘all of Aurora has just gone downhill.’\n\nShe said the national spotlight on the local issue has been a positive development as the gang activity has been occurring for a while\n\nBut said the problem is not specific just in her town.\n\n‘The majority of Colorado has been overrun between the homeless and the drugs and the illegal aliens,’ she added.\n\nWhen pressed on whether she has seen anything suspicious, Cortney said she had not seen anything firsthand but has been reading a lot about it on social media. \n\nAnother Colorado resident, Jen, told DailyMail.com: ‘Well, I have heard that they are taking over parts of Aurora. Oh, they’re also down in Denver, but I hear that they’re financing themselves through breaking into the gun stores and the jewelry stores.’\n\nThe Aurora Police Department has confirmed in recent weeks a sporting goods store was robbed by ‘four teen-aged Latino males,’ though the announcement did not specify whether or not they were migrants or involved with TDA. \n\nFurther, several Venezuelan migrants, one a suspected TDA member, robbed a Denver jewelry store at gun-point over the summer, according to the Justice Department.\n\n‘During the robbery, suspects pointed weapons at employees, struck several employees with their weapons, and took a large amount of gold and jewelry. The suspects were later located in the El Paso, Texas area,’ the DOJ memo said.\n\n‘They are definitely taking over the apartment buildings,’ one lifelong Colorado resident, Mark, told DailyMail.com, citing the now-viral video as evidence. \n\nHe lives in Bennett, Colorado, and he revealed that people in his town have been afraid to go Aurora because of the reports. \n\n‘Everybody talks about it. They won’t go in that area, you know? I mean, they’re afraid to go there.’\n\n‘The less I have to come into town, better off I am,’ he said. \n\nFrederick of Windsor, Colorado said the claims have been largely confirmed. \n\n‘There were migrants, there were people from Venezuelans in the apartments, we all saw the video,’ he told DailyMail.com ‘Whether they are gang members or not who knows, but they are guys with long guns walking around intimidating residents.’\n\n‘The gang members were asking for keys to be copied and for [residents] to pay them instead of paying it to the landlords,’ he continued. \n\nHe was not sure how many TDA members were involved but, he was convinced at least a few were a part of the group. \n\n‘It’s not really a mystery. And so whether their apartments are taken over, I don’t know what it is, but that there’s people that are scared that they shouldn’t be.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMigrant gang activity in Aurora, Colorado, is making residents feel threatened and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Residents of Aurora, Colorado Share Impact of Venezuelan Gangs on Their Community&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/residents-of-aurora-colorado-share-impact-of-venezuelan-gangs-on-their-community/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Aurora-Colorado-residents-describe-how-the-Venezuelan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:45:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":259471558,"title":"Why is Donald Trump campaigning in California, a state he’s almost sure to lose?","text":"With the US presidency on the line in battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, why would Donald Trump venture into California, one of the most solidly Democratic states, just weeks before Election Day?\nTrump is almost certain to lose California, and that will not change after his scheduled Saturday stop in Coachella, a desert city east of Los Angeles best known for the annual music festival bearing its name. Still, there are practical reasons for him to visit, despite the Republican nominee’s prospects November 5 in the most populous state.\nThe former president lost California in a landslide in 2020. He did get 6 million-plus votes, more than any Republican presidential candidate before, and his margins topped 70 per cent in some rural counties that typically favour conservatives on the ballot.\nThat’s an enormous pool of potential volunteers to work on state races and participate in phone banks into the most contested states. And Trump is likely to draw extensive media coverage in the Los Angeles market, the second-largest in the country.\nTrump is visiting Coachella in between stops in Nevada, at a round table in Las Vegas for Latinos earlier on Saturday – where he praised Hispanics as having “such energy” – and Arizona, for a rally Sunday in Prescott Valley. He narrowly lost those two swing states to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAttendees waiting in broiling temperatures that approached 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday said they didn’t expect Trump to win their state but were thrilled to see him.\n“It’s like a convention of like-minded people,” Tom Gibbons of Palm Desert, who’s backed Trump since 2016 but been unable to see him in person until Saturday, said as he stood in line at a food truck on the polo fields that will house the crowd at the Coachella event. “Everybody understands the heartbeat of America, the plight of the working man … It’s reassuring.”\nGoing to California gives Trump the “ability to swoop in and leverage this big population of Trump supporters”, said Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign in Michigan and also worked in the former president’s administration. He’s “coming here and activating that”.\nLineberger recalled Californians making calls to Michigan voters in 2016 on Trump’s behalf and said the campaign’s decision to go into safe, Democratic turf at this point was “an aggressive, offensive play”.\nCalifornia is also a fountain of campaign cash for both parties, and Trump will be fundraising. Photos with the former president in Coachella were priced at US$25,000, which comes with special seating for two. A “VIP Experience” was priced at US$5,000.\nWith congressional races in California in play that could determine which party controls the House, the Coachella rally “is a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energises Republicans in California, when they are not as close to what is going on in the national campaign”, Republican consultant Tim Rosales said.\n\nRosales also said to look for Trump to continue his long-running spat with Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom.\nFor Republicans, “It’s motivating when you can pick at California a little bit and the governor … will take the bait,” Rosales said.\nNewsom on Wednesday predicted Trump would be denigrating the state at the rally, overlooking its strengths as the world’s fifth-largest economy. The governor said that for the first time in a decade, California has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.\n“You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” he predicted.\nJim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, said he thinks Trump is angling for something that has eluded him in previous campaigns: winning more total votes than his Democratic opponent.\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote. There are more registered voters in California than there are residents in 46 of the other 49 states,” Brulte said.\n\nThe Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles sits on the Pacific Coast, south of the city. But Trump has long had a conflicted relationship with California, where a Republican has not carried the state since 1988 and Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by about two to one.\nCalifornia was home to the so-called Trump resistance during his time in office, and Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. As president, he called the homeless crises in Los Angeles and San Francisco disgraceful and threatened to intercede.\nHe is likely to spend time on Saturday linking California’s problems to US Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee and a San Francisco Bay Area native who was California’s attorney general and represented the state in the Senate.\nHis campaign issued a statement alleging that under Harris, “the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans”.\nJessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the state Republican Party, said she looked forward to hearing Trump contrast his agenda with a Democratic White House that “has left Californians less safe and with less money in their pockets”.\nRepublicans, she promised, “will do our part to secure a House majority”.","summary":"The Republican US presidential candidate is taking a detour from swing states to launch an aggressive play on Democratic turf.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3282147/why-donald-trump-campaigning-california-state-hes-almost-sure-lose","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/13/ecb43f14-980f-4236-a78f-1131e69fa20b_bdc2c0b4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:45:31","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.132},{"id":259470778,"title":"DJ Jackmaster dies at 38: Scottish musician Jack Revill suffered 'accidental head injury'","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Oct 12th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: Alex Salmond collapsed after suffering 'heart attack' during lunch at conference in Macedonia - before witnesses desperately tried to revive him\n\nColeen Rooney signs huge I'm A Celebrity deal 'worth more than £1.5MILLION' - the biggest in the show's history... so will she spill the secrets on Wagatha Christie?\n\nKing Charles and Keir Starmer face demands to pay astonishing £200bn in reparations over UK's role in the slave trade\n\nKanye West accused of drugging and raping ex-assistant at Diddy party in bombshell lawsuit\n\nPETER HITCHENS: Stop worshipping MI5 - it's just a Blairite secret police force with a budget to boost\n\nHow Dele Alli is plotting one of football's greatest comebacks after two years on the sidelines with free agent's sights set on 2026 World Cup\n\nAs much-missed Dr Michael Mosley makes his final TV appearance, here are some simple, science-based tips from his bestselling book Just One Thing that could improve your life\n\nThe week Kamala's campaign collapsed!

Schiff is accused by his opponents of being a one-issue candidate, obsessed with his opposition to Trump.\n\nThat’s because his opponents don’t know him. They haven’t been a constituent of his, as I have, during his 24 years in Congress and prior to that his four years in the California state Senate.\n\nIn the Legislature, Schiff — Stanford grad, Harvard Law, federal prosecutor famous for successfully sending to the Big House an FBI agent who was spying for the Soviet Union — was beloved in his San Gabriel Valley district for crafting an extraordinarily complex last-minute deal that saved the Gold Line light rail from never being built.\n\nIn the House, he has been known for leading on Armenian-American issues, key to many of his constituents. He fought against pervasive police (and TV news, and tourist) helicopter noise. He emphasized the need for unfettered journalism, forming the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Caucus for the Freedom of the Press aimed at advancing press freedom around the world. His Rim of the Valley legislation kept hiking trails in the Verdugos and the San Fernando Valley open space in perpetuity. He has a crackerjack staff always ready to provide constituent service.\n\nThat’s why, folks who don’t know him, he was elected 12 times to Congress in a district that until he first won was a lock for Republicans for generations. Two years ago, that re-election came with an overwhelming 71% of the vote. That’s not the kind of support that goes to a one-issue, do-nothing congressman.\n\nAnd, yes, he became famous to the rest of the state and the nation by prosecuting Donald Trump.\n\nBack to my favorite debate moment, a huge win for Schiff: “Mr. Garvey, I stood up to a corrupt president, and, yes, I investigated him, I impeached him, I led the trial in the Senate, and when he incited a violent attack on the Capitol — and I was there that day, Mr. Garvey, I was there on Jan. 6, as those insurrectionists were breaking down the doors and windows. The fact that you think that’s perfectly OK, that you still want to support the guy who incited that violent attack …”\n\nThe moderator offered Garvey 30 seconds to respond.\n\nThe former first baseman contorted his face, looked down at the podium, waited a beat, and then another — and then it was Schiff’s term to interrupt, though he was only interrupting silence: “I’ve left him speechless,” he joked, with a smile.\n\nAfter a little bit, Garvey, the wonderful ballplayer turned terrible businessman with hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes and no plan to pay them, gave a weak smile and regained his voice: “I’m trying to think of all the things that you’ve lost” by impeaching a maniacal president bent on stealing an election.\n\nAdam Schiff is going to be an excellent senator for California for decades.\n\nLarry Wilson is on the Southern California News Group editorial board. lwilson@scng.com","summary":"The prosecutor strikes out the ballplayer","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/10/12/larry-wilson-garvey-goes-down-swinging-in-debate-with-schiff/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LDN-L-ELX-SENATE-DEBATE-1009-DC-13-1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:35:42","author":"Larry Wilson","authors":["Larry Wilson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.059},{"id":259471964,"title":"Musk is going all in to elect Trump","text":"In the final weeks of the presidential campaign, the richest man in the world has involved himself in the U.S. election in a manner unparalleled in modern history.\n\nElon Musk, seen over the weekend jumping for joy alongside former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, is now talking to the Republican candidate multiple times a week.\n\nHe has effectively moved his base of operations to Pennsylvania, the place he has recently told confidants he believes is the linchpin to Trump’s reelection.\n\nHe has relentlessly promoted Trump’s candidacy to his 201 million followers on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter that he bought for $44 billion and has used to spread conspiracy theories about the Democratic Party and to insult its candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbove all, he is personally steering the actions of a super political action committee he has funded with tens of millions of dollars to turn out the vote for Trump, not just in Pennsylvania but across the country. He has even proposed taking a campaign bus tour across Pennsylvania and knocking on doors himself, in part to see how his money is being used.\n\nTaken together, a clear picture has emerged of Musk’s battle plan as he directs his efforts to elect Trump with the same frenetic energy and exacting demands that he has honed at his companies SpaceX, Tesla and X.\n\nAs early as February, Musk was speaking apocalyptically, in private, about what he considered the crucial need to defeat President Joe Biden. But even as he was meeting with advisers in Austin, Texas, in April to plot his super PAC, Musk sounded as if he considered Trump merely the lesser of two evils. He told friends in the spring that he wasn’t sure he even wanted to explicitly endorse Trump.\n\nThese days, in private conversations, Musk is obsessive, almost manic, about the stakes of the election and the need for Trump to win. He praises Trump’s courage under fire — he endorsed him on the night of the assassination attempt in Butler — and talks about how funny he is. One person who spoke recently to Musk recalled him saying, without any hint of irony, “I love Trump.”\n\nMusk’s frenzied engagement reflects his view of this moment in U.S. history. On X, he has warned in dire terms about the effects of progressive policies and censorship. He has claimed, without basis, that Democrats are trying to fill the country with immigrants in the country illegally who would reward them with permanent power, warning that the 2024 race could be the last free election in the U.S.\n\nIt may be impossible to capture the financial value of all the support Musk is providing to Trump. This is in part because of his role on X, where he amplifies so much of the former president’s message. Trump has privately used grand — and unverified — terms to describe what Musk is donating to the super PAC, telling one associate recently that the figure is $500 million.\n\nBut friends and colleagues say Musk is adopting the same strategy he has used during other crises he has considered existential. Just as Musk worked late into the night as his companies teetered on the verge of catastrophe, tinkering with rocket designs at SpaceX, sleeping on a couch in the Tesla factory or making staff cuts at Twitter, Musk has deemed this an all-hands-on-deck moment.\n\nAnd so, just as he recruited friends, family and trusted lieutenants to Twitter after he bought the company, Musk has done the same at America PAC, which he founded to help Trump. Most recently, Musk added Steve Davis, a former SpaceX engineer and the head of his tunneling company, to the group, with Davis reprising a sidekick role that he played after Musk’s takeover of Twitter.\n\nEnsconced in a war room in Pittsburgh with a team of lawyers, public-relations professionals, canvassing experts and longtime friends, Musk is trying to apply strategies and entrepreneurial lessons from his businesses to a grind-it-out political mission with just weeks to go until Election Day. This article is based on interviews with 17 people familiar with Musk’s thinking and operations as Election Day approaches.\n\n“I’m not sure there is a precedent in modern history to how Musk has inserted himself into the presidential race,” said Benjamin Soskis, a historian of the ultrarich.\n\nThe relationship between Trump and Musk has evolved over time.\n\nMusk, who once privately called Trump a “stone-cold loser,” possesses in abundance the things Trump values most: wealth, fame and a massive platform.\n\nMusk initially supported Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for president and suggested that Trump should “sail into the sunset.” Trump replied that Musk begged on his knees for government subsidies. Still, Trump has remained fascinated by Musk.\n\nAmerica PAC declined to comment, and the Trump team declined to provide a comment for this story. Musk did not return a request for comment.\n\n Secret Support, at First \n\nThe idea for the super PAC was born out of two exclusive dinners. After DeSantis flamed out of the Republican primary, Musk began to tell friends that he wanted to find a way to support Trump — secretly.\n\nAt one dinner this year with a group of Trump-friendly billionaires including Nelson Peltz and John Paulson, Musk voiced an earnest, if naive, belief in the way that politics should work. He dismissed the power of television advertising and spoke sweepingly of an organic movement to elect Trump, with supporters persuading others to join the cause. Two voters by two voters — that was how Trump would win, he said.\n\nIn April, Musk arranged for a dinner to be held at the Los Angeles home of venture capitalist David Sacks. There, Musk and a phalanx of some of the world’s wealthiest people — including Rupert Murdoch, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and onetime Trump supporter Peter Thiel — said that 10 by 10 voters was how Trump would win. Musk told about a dozen dinner companions that supporting Trump would be politically safe if they did it in large numbers — and so it was important for the businesspeople to organize their peers.\n\nTrump has made clear that he appreciates the help, promising to appoint Musk to oversee a government-efficiency team if he is reelected. At a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday night, Trump appeared preoccupied with Musk, telling stories about his talks with Musk in three unrelated tangents and celebrating the “dark MAGA” hat that some attendees said they had bought because Musk wore it in Butler.\n\nThe relationship has proved significant in other ways. After a reporter’s publication of hacked Trump campaign information last month, the campaign connected with X to prevent the circulation of links to the material on the platform, according to two people with knowledge of the events. X eventually blocked links to the material and suspended the reporter’s account.\n\n 1 million voters \n\nAt the core of Musk’s project is America PAC, an organization that the Trump campaign is relying on for significant help in knocking on doors in battleground states and encouraging 800,000 to 1 million voters to cast ballots for the former president.\n\nThe group has spent about $80 million to help Trump, according to federal records, primarily on its canvassing program. Musk’s advisers have told donors that the group has about 2,500 organizers in the field, and the group has effectively acquired the Wisconsin assets of another group, Turning Point USA, taking on about 200 new canvassers in the state. Some canvassers, during training, have been shown Musk’s social media posts about the group, as a way to encourage them.\n\nThe scale of Musk’s personal financial commitment will not be made public until the middle of the month. Initially, Musk and his friends in the group had spoken of a budget totaling from $140 million to $180 million, almost all it from Musk himself. The group has told other prospective donors in recent weeks that it is fully funded.\n\nThe Trump campaign is conducting something of an experiment by outsourcing portions of its voter contact operation to America PAC and other groups. That is possible because of new federal election guidance that allows political campaigns to coordinate their activities more closely with outside organizations.\n\nThe campaign signed a data-sharing agreement with America PAC and several others, and it works closely with them to assess which voters are most important to speak to at their homes.\n\nStill, some people in Trump’s orbit are uncertain about how effective the outside efforts will be. Some donors to the super PAC have groused that Musk is relying on the same team that formed the core of DeSantis’ advisers when he attempted a similar effort in the Republican primaries, to no avail.\n\nVeterans of past campaigns argue that canvassing operations generally take months or even years to become effective machines. There is little precedent for successfully standing up a group of this scale just months before a presidential election.\n\nAnd turmoil has plagued America PAC at times, as Musk has repeatedly jettisoned advisers and vendors that were supplying canvassers and replaced them, at one point stranding hundreds of paid door-knockers across the country.\n\nA senior Trump campaign official, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal views about America PAC, said the team was not “relying” on the group but did consider it a “key” partner, along with many other outside groups, as “added firepower.”\n\n Spreading Misinformation \n\nIf America PAC is the most ambitious and costly manifestation of Musk’s support for Trump, nowhere has his cheerleading been more evident than on X.\n\nSince publicly endorsing the former president in July, he has posted at least 109 times about Trump and the election. And while he has said in the past that the platform should be “politically neutral,” he has used it to advance election misinformation and the baseless claim that Democrats are engaging in “deliberate voter importation” and “fast-tracking” immigrants to citizenship to gain control over the electorate.\n\nOne post with that claim this month has garnered nearly 34 million views, according to X’s own metrics, underscoring the scale of attention that Musk, owner of the platform’s most-followed account, can command.\n\n“Unless Trump wins and we get rid of the mountain of smothering regulations (that have nothing to do with safety!), humanity will never reach Mars,” Musk wrote this month in a post that has gained nearly 18 million views. “This is existential.”\n\nOnline, Musk has painted a dark picture of what would happen if Trump lost, a circumstance that could hurt Musk personally. In an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, he acknowledged “trashing Kamala nonstop” and being all in for Trump.\n\nIf Trump loses, he joked, “how long do you think my prison sentence is going to be?”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"In the final weeks of the presidential campaign, the richest man in the world has involved himself in the U.S. election in a manner unparalleled in modern history.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/10/12/breaking-news/musk-is-going-all-in-to-elect-trump/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/web1_20241012_brk_msk01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:30:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.012},{"id":259471090,"title":"From Tim Walz to Will Rollins to Kipp Mueller, Democrats can’t help but inflate their resumes","text":"In a perfect world voters would evaluate candidates for office based on their credentials and comprehension of the subject matter that is impacted by the office they’re seeking.\n\nIn theory, candidates for water board should know something about water, school board aspirants should be well versed in public education, and wannabe insurance commissioners should be very familiar with that industry.\n\nSadly, more often than not, the opposite is true.\n\nIn times of hyper-partisanship, voters assume you are competent if your belief system aligns with theirs.\n\nCredentials be damned.\n\nIn fact, modern social science research backs this claim up.\n\nIn the Journal of Electoral Studies, political scientist Frederico Vegetti pooled a data set of European Election Studies from 1994 to 2009 and found that partisans are more likely to view their preferred party as the most competent and ideologically close when the environment is polarized.\n\nVegetti concluded, “as polarization increases, so does the collinearity between ideological and competence assessments.”\n\nIt’s a heck of a way to choose your government, but that’s what voters want.\n\nAnd that’s why it’s so strange that candidates keep lying about their portfolios.\n\nPoliticians running for office are like guys on a bad first date: “Yeah, I finished first in my class at Harvard Law School…my family is really rich…I’m a combat veteran…I speak seven languages…I invented Spanxx.”\n\nYou know who should really run for office? That talented Mr. Ripley guy.\n\nDemocratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz stepped on this rake almost immediately after being selected by Vice President Kamala Harris to be her running mate, related to claims that he “served in war.”\n\nIn a 2018 video circulated by the Harris campaign in August, Walz referred to weapons “that I carried in war” while explaining his support for an assault weapons ban.\n\n“We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,” Walz said in the video.\n\nProblem is, that never happened.\n\nLauren Hitt, a Harris campaign spokesperson, said in a statement the governor “misspoke” in the clip.\n\n“Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way…In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the governor misspoke,” Hitt said.\n\nSure. First Walz said he “misspoke” about his make-believe war experiences, then he said it was all a grammatical error. In other words, he’s lying about his lying.\n\nWill Rollins, a Democratic candidate for congress in the Corona and Palm Springs-based 41st congressional district is another liar-liar-pants-on-fire. He got caught lying about his occupation.\n\nRollins claimed to be a “counter-terrorism attorney,” as opposed to a regular, terrorist attorney.\n\nOr as I call them, a “car-bomb chaser.”\n\nUltimately, a court ruled that the Western Riverside County Walter Mitty did not truthfully describe what he does for a living.\n\n“There is no evidence before the Court that Rollins’ current principal profession can be accurately described as ‘counterterrorism attorney’” and that “the designation of ‘counterterrorism attorney’ and ‘counterterrorism advisor’ would be confusing or misleading to the voters, and therefore are not permissible ballot designations pursuant to Elections Code section 13107.”\n\nRollins was subsequently forced to change his ballot designation.\n\nThen there’s the Santa Clarita-based 23rd state senate district, where Democratic candidate Kipp Mueller claimed on his campaign website that he “served in President Obama’s Department of Justice in the Consumer Protection Branch, and joined the Santa Clara District Attorney’s Office to protect the community from sexual predators and fraudsters.”\n\nMuller reiterated these claims, and expanded on the details, in various public forums.\n\nAs it turns out, Mueller’s claim that he prosecuted fraudsters turned out to be fraudulent.\n\nHey, don’t they teach irony in law schools anymore?\n\nAs a result, the editorial board of this newspaper concluded Mueller’s false claims were “not a good look for someone asking the public to trust him to represent them. It casts real doubt about his judgment and his ability to be honest with the public.”\n\nHere’s a memo to current and aspiring politicians: Stop lying about your credentials! You’re likely to get caught, and nobody cares anyway.\n\nAs much as I hate the Internet sometimes, it’s made it a lot harder for charlatans to fabricate phony life stories.\n\nSo thanks, Al Gore!\n\nI would also note that we live in a time when RFK, Jr. endorsed Donald Trump and Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala Harris. So maybe old-school partisanship is on the way out.\n\nIncidentally, whichever of those two guys you used to hate you love now, and whichever one you loved you now hate.

Still, there are practical reasons for him to visit, despite the Republican nominee’s prospects Nov. 5 in the most populous state.\n\nThe former president lost California in a landslide in 2020. He did get 6 million-plus votes, more than any GOP presidential candidate before, and his margins topped 70% in some rural counties that typically favor conservatives on the ballot.\n\nThat’s an enormous pool of potential volunteers to work on state races and participate in phone banks into the most contested states. And Trump is likely to draw extensive media coverage in the Los Angeles market, the second-largest in the country.\n\nTrump is visiting Coachella in between stops in Nevada, at a roundtable in Las Vegas for Latinos earlier Saturday — where he praised Hispanics as having “such energy” — and Arizona, for a rally Sunday in Prescott Valley. He narrowly lost those two swing states to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAttendees waiting in broiling temperatures that approached 100 degrees Saturday said they didn’t expect Trump to win their state but were thrilled to see him.\n\n“It’s like a convention of like-minded people,” Tom Gibbons of Palm Desert, who’s backed Trump since 2016 but been unable to see him in person until Saturday, said as he stood in line at a food truck on the polo fields that will house the crowd at the Coachella event. “Everybody understands the heartbeat of America, the plight of the working man. … It’s reassuring.”\n\nGoing to California gives Trump the “ability to swoop in and leverage this big population of Trump supporters,” said Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign in Michigan and also worked in the former president’s administration. He’s “coming here and activating that.”\n\nLineberger recalled Californians making calls to Michigan voters in 2016 on Trump’s behalf and said the campaign’s decision to go into safe, Democratic turf at this point was “an aggressive, offensive play.”\n\nCalifornia is also a fountain of campaign cash for both parties, and Trump will be fundraising. Photos with the former president in Coachella were priced at $25,000, which comes with special seating for two. A “VIP Experience” was priced at $5,000.\n\nWith congressional races in California in play that could determine which party controls the House, the Coachella rally “is a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energizes Republicans in California, when they are not as close to what is going on in the national campaign,” Republican consultant Tim Rosales said.\n\nRosales also said to look for Trump to continue his long-running spat with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nFor Republicans, “It’s motivating when you can pick at California a little bit and the governor … will take the bait,” Rosales said.\n\nNewsom on Wednesday predicted Trump would be denigrating the state at the rally, overlooking its strengths as the world’s fifth-largest economy. The governor said that for the first time in a decade, California has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.\n\n“You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” he predicted.\n\nJim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, said he thinks Trump is angling for something that has eluded him in previous campaigns: winning more total votes than his Democratic opponent.\n\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote.

So, can you trust the government? Not in everything. You need to be vigilant.”\n\nThe former first lady did not go into detail about her skepticism with the US government – the government that her husband Donald Trump once spearheaded and hopes to yet again come January.\n\nHowever, Melania has previously amplified conspiracies that there was something suspicious about the first assassination attempt on her husband at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.\n\nWhen asked further as to whether her “trust flag” would go up for some foreign leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Melania confirmed that it would.\n\n“Yes, of course,” she said.\n\nHer husband, meanwhile, has faced mounting scrutiny over his relationship with Putin.\n\nAccording to Bob Woodward’s new book War,Trump has spoken with Putin seven times in the years since he left the White House. \n\nHe also sent Putin medical equipment at the start of the Covid pandemic, the book reveals.

Still, there are practical reasons for him to visit, despite the Republican nominee's prospects Nov. 5 in the most populous state.\n\nThe former president lost California in a landslide in 2020. He did get 6 million-plus votes, more than any GOP presidential candidate before, and his margins topped 70% in some rural counties that typically favor conservatives on the ballot.\n\nThat’s an enormous pool of potential volunteers to work on state races and participate in phone banks into the most contested states. And Trump is likely to draw extensive media coverage in the Los Angeles market, the second-largest in the country. \n\nTrump is visiting Coachella in between stops in Nevada, at a roundtable in Las Vegas for Latinos earlier Saturday, and Arizona, for a rally Sunday in Prescott Valley.

Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who, before he was elected to Congress, was Trump's physician at the White House. Jackson also treated Trump after the assassination attempt.\n\n“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung said in a statement. The campaign press office provided links to some of Trump's past medical reports. They included: https://tinyurl.com/yckc495b and https://tinyurl.com/4z27pk2f\n\nIf Trump, who is 78, were to be elected next month, he would be the oldest president in U.S. history by the time his term ends in 2029.\n\nSimmons, who said he has been Harris’ primary care physician for the past 3 1/2 years, said the vice president has a history of seasonal allergies and urticaria, or hives. She has been able to “dramatically” improve her symptoms over the past three years with an immunotherapy medication that helps the body become less sensitive to allergens.\n\nSimmons said Harris’ latest blood work and other test results were “unremarkable.” Her blood pressure is not worryingly high and she is at low risk for heart disease.\n\nAccording to the summary of an exam conducted six months ago, Harris' vital signs showed a blood pressure of 128 over 74, a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, pulse oximetry of 100% on room air with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a temperature of 98.7 degrees. Pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in a person's blood.\n\nSimmons reported that Harris' head, eyes, ears, nose and pharynx are normal.\n\nAlso in the report: Harris wears contact lenses for mild nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; she is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a colonoscopy and annual mammograms, as well as routine immunizations.\n\nHarris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was 70 when she died of colon cancer in February 2009.\n\nThe vice president “maintains a healthy, active lifestyle, despite her busy schedule,” including “vigorous daily aerobic exercise and core strength training,\" Simmons reported. She eats a healthy diet, does not use tobacco products and drinks alcohol “only occasionally and in moderation,” he wrote.\n\nAs Harris' office released the medical report, her campaign highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Trump's health and mental acuity and his reluctance to provide detailed information about the state of his health and medical history.\n\nTrump eagerly questioned President Joe Biden's physical and mental fitness when the 81-year-old sought reelection. Since Biden dropped out of the race and was replaced by Harris on the Democratic ticket, Trump's health has drawn more attention.\n\nLast November, Trump marked Biden's birthday by releasing a letter from his physician that reported the former president was in “excellent” physical and mental health. The letter posted on Trump’s social media platform contained no details about his weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any tests to support its claims.\n\nAssociated Press writer Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

West faces accusations of drugging and sexually assaulting former assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, at a Diddy event in a shocking legal case.","text":"Kayne West drugged and raped his former assistant at a party with Diddy, she claims in a horrifying new lawsuit against the disgraced rapper.\n\nInfluencer and former OnlyFans star Lauren Pisciotta sued West in June for allegedly sexually harassing and stalking her while she worked for him in 2021-22.\n\nNow, a new 88-page updated lawsuit filed on Friday night and obtained by DailyMail.com makes dozens of new disturbing claims.\n\nPisciotta detailed West’s alleged sick sexual obsessions, and his fetish for also wanting to sleep with his targets’ mothers – including his wife Bianca Censori’s family.\n\nThe lawsuit delves into his allegedly infamous sex parties and the full horror of his neo-Nazi views that included hate-filled rants and forcing staff to draw swastikas.\n\nShe also claimed West promised to pay her a $4 million a year salary, bragged about it to Jay-Z, then wrongfully fired her and reneged on a $3 million severance payout.\n\nWest denied the claims in her original lawsuit, calling them ‘baseless’ and accused her of ‘blackmail and extortion’, but has yet to file a defense.\n\n‘Drugged and raped’ future assistant \n\nBut her most serious claim was that years before she worked for him, he drugged and raped her – only allegedly confessing in his last weeks as her boss.\n\nPisciotta claimed she met West when he invited her client, a musician, to a studio session and party he co-hosted with his friend Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs.\n\nWest announced that everyone at the event at the Santa Monica studio had to drink if they wanted to stay, and she was handed a beverage by West himself.\n\nPisciotta after a few sips ‘suddenly started to feel disorientated and… began to slip into an altered and highly impaired state’, the lawsuit read.\n\n‘She felt less in control of her body and speech and that is where [her] memories of the night escape her,’ it claimed.\n\nThe next day, she felt ‘ashamed and embarrassed’ that she couldn’t remember the evening and her musician client refused to discuss what happened.\n\nPisciotta claimed she only learned years later why her client ‘was too traumatized and disturbed to speak about that night’.\n\nAfter years of believing she was drugged by a studio assistant but escaped without being molested, she allegedly learned the truth from West.\n\nShe claimed that not long before he fired her in November 2022, he was enraged about a comment his ex-wife made about him and Pisciotta having an affair while he was still married.\n\nThe ex-wife’s name was withheld in the lawsuit, but West’s only wife besides Censori was Kim Kardashian, who divorced him earlier in 2022.\n\nPisciotta told West she wanted to send Kardashian a text to clear things up with her, as it ‘appeared she was under the wrong impression’ about them.\n\nHowever, she claimed West told her she couldn’t send a message denying they were ever intimate, due to what happened at the Santa Monica party.\n\n‘We did kind of hook up a little one time,’ the lawsuit claimed West told her. \n\n‘[West] then immediately proceeded to reminisce about the time he was referring to… where he “hooked up” with [Pisciotta] after she had been drugged,’ the lawsuit claimed.\n\nPisciotta claimed West had told Kardashian they ‘hooked up’ but ‘left out the true nature and severity of what he did to [her]’.\n\nHad Kardashian ‘been told the truth and known [Pisciotta] was in fact drugged and sexually assaulted by Kanye West’ she would never have made the comment, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nA shocked Pisciotta claimed she told West she had no memory of the night, and he laughed, saying ‘women love to say they don’t remember’, then changed the subject.\n\nDepraved West ‘told Bianca Censori he wanted sex with her mother’\n\nPisciotta’s lawsuit claimed West’s true nature was ‘predatory, aggressive, compulsive, vulgar, perverse, and frighteningly calculative’.\n\nIt called him a ‘premeditative and sadistic groomer’ who used his fame and position to feed his ‘insatiable sexual gratification’ and ‘animalistic desires’ that have ‘little boundaries’.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed he often had sex with employees and a ‘rotating list of guests’ in his Yeezy company’s offices. \n\nEmployees were ordered to construct makeshift bedrooms consisting of a mattress on the floor, pillows and a blanket in a room or even just a closet. \n\nHe also used the staff bathrooms and changing rooms, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nWest had a ‘kink’ for wanting to have sex with mothers of his sexual targets, as well as them, which he frequently talked about, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nHe allegedly sent Pisciotta a screenshot on September 28, 2022, of a text conversation between him and Censori about wanting to have sex with her mother.\n\n‘i wanna f**k your mum. Before she leaves,’ he wrote, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nAccording to the filing, he asked Pisciotta: ‘Should I add I meant I want you to watch me f**k your mom’.\n\nAnother time, he allegedly texted Pisciotta on September 13, 2022, about an ‘A-list fashion model’ he was ‘determined’ to have sex with, and requested she model for his sunglasses campaign.\n\n‘Is [young A-list fashion model] better for me than [different A-list fashion model]? How do I tell her I need to f**k her mom baaad’.\n\nAnother time on June 14, 2022, he allegedly texted her about a sexual encounter with a model. \n\n‘I feel like you could be a spectator… I just feel like she needs an audience. A beautiful audience lol,’ he wrote in a text, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nOne time, Pisciotta informed him of a delay with Japanese work visas, and she claimed he replied with a bizarre string of texts.\n\n‘So I’ll come back to LA. I do wanna see my kids,’ he wrote, before reverting to type.\n\n‘Aaaaaaaaand there’s soooo much p***y in LA I may rent a room, take the honey pack, drink some tequila and just take appointments,’ he allegedly added.\n\n‘I’m a great guy and dad. But I love bad b***hes and I love to f**k the s**t outa bad b***hes and make them fall in love too.’\n\n‘Sex trafficking’ girls from around the world and wild sex parties\n\nPisciotta claimed Kanye used his connections at companies like Adidas and Gap to get work visas to traffic women into the US for sex. \n\nThey were given ‘obscure job titles’ at his companies and had them sign NDAs about their experiences.\n\nBut he was ‘brazenly open’ with Pisciotta and other staff about it, giving them ‘grotesque details’ and always filmed it so they could ‘get the full picture’, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed West often ‘offered up’ his sexual partners, employees, and women he trafficked as ‘gifts’ to his friends and colleagues, both to ‘make himself look and feel cool’ and to gain an upper hand in business negotiations. \n\nOne was called a ‘gift straight from Russia’. \n\nPisciotta claimed he tried to ‘gift’ her too, but without success – including one time that the man he offered her to, an A-list celebrity, warned her about it.\n\nThe lawsuit detailed how West frequently hosted sex parties at hotels like the Nobu Ryokan Malibu hotel, Beverly Hills Waldorf Astoria and San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California. \n\nShe claimed he made up elaborate schemes to lure her and other women there, usually claiming he needed something. \n\nOften it was ‘sex honey’, a sexual enhancement product he allegedly took and required Pisciotta to always have ample supply on hand. \n\nShe claimed he once openly admitted his plan was for her to bring him some so he could involve her in one of the parties.\n\nHe texted her, ‘Aaaaaand yeah I wanted you to bring honey and stay but it didn’t work lol. What you want for your bday’, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed West had ‘ever changing moods’ that meant he would either respond to her shutting down his advances and invitations to sex parties with offers of luxurious gifts, or ‘intense anger and frustration’ and assignments that were difficult or impossible, just to punish her.\n\nWest was an ‘anti-Semitic bully’\n\nWest’s career infamously went into freefall when he began spouting anti-Semitic hate speech and self-identified as a neo-Nazi.\n\nThis began on October 8, 2022, when he tweeted: ‘I’m a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I’m going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.’\n\nHe added: ‘The funny thing is I actually can’t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also. You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.’ \n\nPisciotta’s lawsuit revealed what she claimed were the events leading up to this outburst, and how it began his escalating bigotry toward Jews.\n\nWest had demanded ‘the biggest hotel suite in LA’ but none of the places she knew he liked were available.\n\nPisciotta called their real estate adviser, who called in a favor to secure a last-minute five-star penthouse in West Hollywood. \n\nBut just 10 minutes after arriving, Kanye stormed out of the hotel calling Pisciotta in a rage, claiming the room was ‘trash’.\n\n‘Of course [real estate adviser] got him that trash hotel room with light blue walls, because that is something a Jew would do,’ the lawsuit claimed he told her.\n\nWest then called her again, from the car, to go on a vile anti-Jewish rant, the lawsuit claimed. Later that night he sent the infamous anti-Semitic tweet.\n\nAfterwards, he called Pisciotta and got her to read the tweet back to him, because it turned him on, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nWest sent her numerous other anti-Semitic texts detailed in the lawsuit, many extremely vile and disturbing.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed West’s bigotry got even worse after he abruptly ended his partnership with Gap and left the shared office.\n\nHe move Yeezy into one upstairs from an American Apparel factory in South Central LA at the behest of his good friend, the company’s founder.\n\nThe lawsuit didn’t name him but explained he was forced to step down from his former company and was ‘serially accused of sexual harassment and misconduct’. \n\nThey ‘shared a passion for sex’ and promptly set up Kanye’s office sex bedrooms,’ the lawsuit claimed.\n\nAs soon as the company moved in, West gathered all the staff, and ‘gave a long-winded, anti-Semitic, racially charged, threatening hate-speech’.\n\n‘He took heavy breaths and aggressively expressed his love and admiration for the “genius” Adolf Hitler,’ the lawsuit claimed.\n\n‘Kayne West went on to announce his infatuation with Nazis and the holocaust, as well as his utter hatred for very specific Jewish people, especially the Jewish people who were currently in power in the music industry, among many other things.’ \n\nHe concluded his rant by declaring he was ‘at war with Jews’.\n\nImmediately after the speech he berated a young, newly hired graphic designer to draw a swastika, which he declined – but West insisted and bullied him, saying it was a ‘test’ and asked if he was Jewish,’ the lawsuit claimed.\n\nThe designer stood up to West and said he’d read about the Holocaust and couldn’t accept the request. \n\nWest allegedly demanded he draw it or he would be fired on the spot, and eventually the designer gave in, as West stood over him and watched. \n\nWest then instructed him to begin rendering a new Yeezy logo that ‘he desired to be inspired by and incorporate Hitler and the swastika symbol, according to the lawsuit.\n\nHe then moved on to passing around his phone to show everyone ‘the most offensive, disgusting, and vile sexual messages’ he sent to the editor-in-chief of the ‘most famous fashion publication in the world’.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed West often yelled ‘Heil Hitler!’ and performed Nazi salutes around the office. \n\nHe regularly compared himself to Hitler and a Nazi, the filing alleges. He ‘would ask employees and guests to reveal their practicing religion and, depending on their answer, they could be terminated or asked to leave for a specific amount of time’. \n\n‘If anyone voiced their true concerns or verbally disagreed with [West] in any way, they would risk being humiliated and immediately “banned” and blacklisted.’\n\nWest spread hundreds of pieces of clothing across the floor of a large open space in the office, and had clothing designers draw swastikas on them, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nHe said his staff were ‘his army’ and ‘he was Hitler’.\n\nWest’s bipolar mood swings\n\nWest was diagnosed as bipolar, according to sources close to his family, which contributed to his mood swings and bizarre behavior.\n\nPisciotta’s lawsuit detailed how occasionally after one too many sex parties, he would ‘very briefly take stock of his disgraceful and illegal behavior and lifestyle, spend some time thinking about his family and his children and want to repent in some way’. \n\nWhat followed were his ‘God like’ phases. He demanded there be no cursing, no alcohol, no sex, and all women around him be covered form head to toe so they wouldn’t ‘tempt’ him. \n\nThey never lasted long and his vices would return ‘with a vengeance’.\n\nDuring one of these phases in August, Pisciotta’s lawsuit claimed he wanted her to delete her OnlyFans account as he felt it would make her ‘God like’ and he was also worried it would interfere with his campaign for US president. \n\nHe then began to obsessively compare her to members of Donald Trump’s staff and told her she needed to be more like them, and told her to contact one of them to ‘give her tips’. \n\nHe said her OnlyFans ‘could be a reason he would not get elected’, but he admitted another reason was that it caused him too much temptation.\n\nPisciotta claimed she deleted it after he promised her an extra $1 million.\n\nThis was in contrast to when he would often brag about her OnlyFans account to professional business meetings when she entered.\n\nPisciotta claimed he said that she was not only ‘the smartest and hottest assistant of all time’ but also ‘a millionaire’ and ‘OnlyFans superstar’. \n\nShe claimed her social media and ‘tasteful’ OnlyFans earned her $1 million a year by themselves.\n\nPromoted to chief of staff with $4 million salary \n\nCentral to the unfair dismissal part of Pisciotta’s lawsuit is her claim that West promoted her to his chief of staff with a $4 million salary.\n\nHer lawsuit claimed this happened on September 13, 2022, and was so pleased he shared the news with many associates including his ‘good friend’ Jay-Z. \n\nHe sent Pisciotta a screenshot of the exchange, the lawsuit claimed.\n\n‘Checking in. Pray all is well. I made Lauren Pisciotta chief of staff and I would like for [name withheld] to meet with her because I know she would relate,’ he wrote to Jay-Z, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nJay-Z replied: ‘Peace!!! All is well, wishing the same for you and yours!! Yeah thanks for that nod, that makes me smile!! Congrats!!!!’\n\nThe same day, Pisciotta claimed West he sent her a text confirming her salary: ‘I’m giving you a 3 million dollar raise… you are now my official chief of staff’.\n\nHowever, even before this promotion, her salary came with a cost, both in workload and constant sexual harassment, she claimed.\n\nShe was to be available 24/7 and had to request time off to do literally anything including to sleep shower, or go to the doctor, and give him exhausting details about why.\n\nOne time, she asked to go to a Pilates class and he ‘was in a good mood’ so he said yes – but with an allegedly disgusting text. \n\nHe called Pisciotta his ‘therapist’ and often had her sit in silence while he ranted for hours on end. \n\nWest refused to carry a wallet, money, credit cards or even ID, so she had to make sure everything was paid everywhere he went.\n\nAnother time, West was so turned on by the leggings she once wore to work that he called them her ‘super pants’ and got her to buy them for women he wanted to sleep with.\n\nConstant sexual harassment \n\nPisciotta detailed how West was allegedly obsessed with having sex with her, and tried many ruses and manipulations to woo her.\n\nNot getting her frustrated him, but also thrilled and excited him – it became a game to him, she claimed. \n\nWest on June 15, 2022, complained in a text to Pisciotta: ‘I always get money. I never get Lauren’.\n\nOn her birthday on August 17, 2022, he insisted she personally bring his passport to him at the Aman Hotel in New York City. \n\nShe claimed this was done because he only wanted her to spend her birthday with him, and he wanted a ‘hug’.\n\nMany other sick texts and disturbing alleged incidents were described in her original lawsuit.\n\nWest was also sent ‘spinning into a hateful and frightening rage’ by as little as an employee wearing the wrong color, or an exclamation mark in a text message,’ the lawsuit claimed.\n\n‘Ye is no stranger to bullying, harassment, public humiliation, tantrums, and other scare tactics,’ the lawsuit claimed.\n\n‘He regularly, both publicly and privately, used/uses these tactics when interacting with Pisciotta, his family members, A-list celebrity female musicians, high-level public figures and executives, Chase Bank presidents and board members, people of the Jewish religion’ and former and current staff and executives at his companies and those of Adidas and Gap ‘to get what he wants’.\n\nPisciotta claimed A-list singers and rappers, along with Kanye’s friends and executives, were so concerned by seeing his behavior toward her that they asked if she was OK or needed help.\n\nThere were small windows where West wasn’t being abusive, or aggressively trying to woo her, that he appeared to give genuine praise.\n\nPisciotta used various examples as evidence that he valued her work enough to promote her to chief of staff with an enormous salary. \n\nShe claimed West referred to her as the ‘inspiration for Yeezy season 1’ in high-level business meetings.\n\nOne time, when a model he was relentlessly pursuing finally agreed to have dinner with him, he showed his appreciation – if in a disturbing way.\n\n‘Hitting the restaurant with [model]. Thank you for always believing in me. I think you. My d**k thanks you. My brand thanks you,’ the lawsuit claimed he wrote.\n\nAn attorney for West did not immediately respond to the DailyMail.com’s request for comment regarding the recent filing.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKayne West drugged and raped his former assistant at a party with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kanye West faces accusations of drugging and sexually assaulting former assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, at a Diddy event in a shocking legal case. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kanye-west-faces-accusations-of-drugging-and-sexually-assaulting-former-assistant-lauren-pisciotta-at-a-diddy-event-in-a-shocking-legal-case/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Kanye-West-accused-of-drugging-and-raping.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:14:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":259467848,"title":"Trump poised to flip two Biden swing states by taking his voters back from Harris","text":"Two swing states Donald Trump carried in 2016 and lost in 2020 may be coming back into his column in 2024.\n\nAnd if the numbers from Redfield & Wilton’s survey of Georgia and Pennsylvania voters hold up when votes are counted in a little more than three weeks, Kamala Harris’ path to the White House could narrow considerably.\n\nIn 2020, the former president lost to Joe Biden by 0.23 points in Georgia and 1.2 in Pennsylvania.\n\nThis sampling shows Trump up by 1 point in Georgia, 48% to 47%. And he’s up 2 points in Pennsylvania, 48% to 46%.\n\nIn both cases, the former president has leads where he didn’t last time these pollsters were in the field: Georgia was tied, and Harris led in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe shift in momentum is significant, given these states have a combined 35 electoral votes. If Trump takes these and the states he’s expected to win otherwise, he’s got 254 of the 270 needed, opening multiple paths to victory.\n\nThe simplest solution?\n\nWinning North Carolina’s 16 electoral votes would be enough to push the ex-prez over the threshold.\n\nAlternatively, winning any two of the remaining battlegrounds — Arizona (11 votes), Michigan (15 votes), Nevada (6 votes) and Wisconsin (10 votes) — would suffice to give Trump an Electoral College win.\n\nTrump’s success in the two states surveyed here comes down to a pair of relative phenomena.\n\nHe’s doing a better job flipping people who voted for Biden in 2020 than Harris is in attracting last cycle’s Trump voters.

With only weeks until Election Day, Harris’ campaign will no doubt try to contrast the release of her medical information with Trump’s refusal to do so.\n\nIn his letter, Simmons described Harris as “a healthy 59-year-old female” who suffers from hay fever, allergies triggered by seasonal pollen and skin hives. She takes Allegra, a common medication, along with eye drops and nasal sprays to address both, Simmons wrote.\n\nWhile the letter did not reveal her height or weight, it is “pretty complete,” said Dr. Gordon Guyatt, a specialist in internal medicine at McMaster University in Canada.

The couple lived in Strichen, Aberdeenshire. It is believed Mrs Salmond was at home when her husband died.\n\nAs his sudden death was shared with the world, friends, family, and politicians paid tribute and shared their memories of him.\n\nMr Salmond was described by former colleagues as ‘one of the most talented politicians of his generation’ and ‘the finest First Minister our country has had’.\n\nThe pro-independence leader headed up the party as it went from opposition in the Scottish Parliament to government in 2007, where his party battled for the right to hold a referendum on independence.\n\nAn SNP majority in the Scottish parliament in 2011, the only time such a feat has been achieved in 25 years of devolution, proved Mr Salmond’s widespread popularity. \n\nOn the coattails of that election success, the SNP launched a campaign of a lifetime culminating in Mr Salmond securing a referendum from then Tory Prime Minister David Cameron for 2014. \n\nHe later split with the SNP to form the Alba Party following allegations of sexual harassment. He was cleared of 13 charges, including one of attempted rape, and later took successful legal action against his former party. \n\nSalmond’s posted on social media just three hours before the news was broken, characteristically lauding independence as he urged the First Minister John Swinney to think ‘independently, not subserviently’.\n\nHis final words in the message were: ‘Scotland is a country not a county.’\n\nOn Friday, Mr Salmond had delivered a speech at the second edition of the Forum for Cultural Diplomacy, an event co-organized by the office of former North Macedonian President Ivanov, the International Center ‘Alliance of Civilizations,’ and the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy from Berlin. \n\nA photo from the event showed him smiling cheerfully in the center of a crowd of dignitaries in what is believed to be his last photo, alongside his Alba Party chair Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, who is wearing a tartan dress.\n\nThe King lead tributes to the Scottish politician said he and the Queen are ‘greatly saddened to hear of the sudden death of Alex Salmond’, adding: ‘His devotion to Scotland drove his decades of public service.’ \n\nFormer SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who described his decades-old friend as a ‘cheeky chappie’, who possessed a large dose of ‘bonhomie’, said that Mr Salmond ‘shaped’ the modern Scottish National Party.\n\nHe said: ‘I am so utterly shocked and saddened to hear of the passing of Alex Salmond, my thoughts and prayers are with Moira at this devastating news for her and his loved ones.\n\n‘Alex led the SNP and the Scottish Government, taking Scotland close to achieving its Independence in 2014. Alex’s talents were extraordinary in leading people, leading a Government and in leading a country.’\n\nDaily Mail columnist Andrew Neil, fondly remembered having lunch with him in London just three weeks ago, saying ‘he was in fine form’.\n\nMr Neil continued: ‘Full of plans and plots. He even paid! His upbeat mood then make this all the more surprising and sad.\n\n‘He and I could not have been more different in terms of Scotland’s position in the UK but we had a mutual respect and he knew I always regarded him as the most accomplished and significant Scottish politician of modern times.’\n\nMr Neil added: ‘He was also the best of company. To be with him was always a joy. I will miss him hugely. So will Scotland. My condolences to his wonderful wife.’\n\nFellow former First Minister Lord Jack McConnell also reflected fondly on his former sparring partner last night, saying: ‘You certainly had to be on your toes, debating with Alex Salmond. \n\n‘We had many ups and downs over the years, but I always respected his skill as a debater and as a proponent of his point of view, his energy and his campaigning pizzazz. \n\n‘I think tonight, not only do we think about his wife, Moira, but we also remember somebody who loved the country, who made a significant impact in UK politics, not just in Scottish politics, over these 30 years and more, and who was a formidable opponent, and always somebody who you really had to match if you were going to be even just in the game.’\n\nHis admirers and detractors alike last night told how he managed to bring the party from the fringes, into the mainstream.\n\nSir Keir Starmer lead tributes to the political titan, calling him a ‘monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics’ who ‘leaves behind a lasting legacy’. \n\nThe Prime Minister said: ‘For more than 30 years, Alex Salmond was a monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics. He leaves behind a lasting legacy.\n\n‘As First Minister of Scotland he cared deeply about Scotland’s heritage, history and culture, as well as the communities he represented as MP and MSP over many years of service.\n\n‘My thoughts are with those who knew him, his family and his loved ones. On behalf of the UK government, I offer them our condolences today.’\n\nNicola Sturgeon, who was mentored as Salmond’s deputy between 2007 and 2014, said he was an ‘incredibly significant figure in my life’.\n\nThe pair’s relationship broke down irreconcilably as he faced allegations of sexual impropriety in 2018.\n\nIn an interview last month he said that he ‘seriously doubted’ he would ever talk to his successor again. \n\nThe former first minister said: ‘Obviously, I cannot pretend that the events of the past few years which led to the breakdown of our relationship did not happen, and it would not be right for me to try.\n\n‘However, it remains the fact that for many years Alex was an incredibly significant figure in my life. He was my mentor, and for more than a decade we formed one of the most successful partnerships in UK politics.\n\n‘Alex modernised the SNP and led us into government for the first time, becoming Scotland’s fourth First Minister and paving the way for the 2014 referendum which took Scotland to the brink of independence.\n\n‘He will be remembered for all of that. My thoughts are with Moira, his wider family and his friends.’\n\nFormer Prime Minister Rishi Sunak added that the late politician was a ‘huge figure in our politics’.\n\nHe said: ‘Alex Salmond was a huge figure in our politics. While I disagreed with him on the constitutional question, there was no denying his skill in debate or his passion for politics. May he rest in peace.’\n\nAnd former First Minister Humza Yousaf added: ‘Alex and I obviously had our differences in the last few years, but there’s no doubt about the enormous contribution he made to Scottish & UK politics. \n\n‘As well as helping to transform the SNP into the dominant political force it is today. My condolences to his family and friends.’\n\nScottish First Minister John Swinney also shared his condolences, paying tribute to Salmond for having ‘worked tirelessly and fought fearlessly for the country that he loved’.\n\nHe said: ‘I am deeply shocked and saddened at the untimely death of the former First Minister Alex Salmond and I extend my deepest condolences to Alex’s wife Moira and to his family.\n\n‘Alex worked tirelessly and fought fearlessly for the country that he loved and for her Independence. He took the Scottish National Party from the fringes of Scottish politics into Government and led Scotland so close to becoming an Independent country.\n\n‘There will be much more opportunity to reflect in the coming days, but today all of our thoughts are with Alex’s family, and his many friends and right across the political spectrum.’ \n\nThe politician was a prominent figure in the country’s fight for nationalism, and lead the referendum on Scottish independence in 2014.\n\nHe resigned after the ‘Yes Scotland’ campaign was defeated, forming the Alba party in 2021.\n\nSalmond, the first SNP politician to serve as First Minister, was elected in 2007 on a minority government before winning the only Holyrood majority in 2011. \n\nOver the course of his career he took the SNP from the fringes of Scottish politics in the 1980s to the most dominant party in the country. \n\nPaying tribute to their former leader today, the party said: ‘His leadership brought the SNP into the mainstream and the Scottish Government. He was a titan of the independence movement. Our thoughts are with Moira and his family.’ \n\nActor and director Alan Cumming, a vocal supporter of Salmond’s independence campaign, reposted the announcement of his death by the SNP.\n\nIn a statement, leader of Scottish Labour Anas Sarwar spoke about his former political opponent, calling him ‘a towering figure’.\n\nHe said: ‘The sad news of Alex Salmond’s passing today will come as a shock to all who knew him in Scotland, across the UK and beyond.\n\n‘Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time and on behalf of Scottish Labour I offer our sincere condolences to all who will be mourning his loss.\n\n‘Alex was a central figure in politics for over three decades and his contribution to the Scottish political landscape can not be overstated.\n\n‘It is right that we recognise Alex’s service to our country as First Minister and to the communities he represented as both MP and MSP. A towering figure.’\n\nFormer leader of the Scottish Conservatives Douglas Ross added: ‘While we had opposing political views, he was a towering figure in Scottish politics which he dominated for many years.\n\n‘My thoughts are with Moira and his family and friends at this difficult time.’\n\nFormer leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson added that while they ‘disagreed on almost everything… I always respected his intellect and political nous.’\n\nThey have been followed by an emotional outpouring of grief for the former SNP leader, with Perth and Kinross-shire MP saying he ‘can’t believe that Alex will no longer be with us’, while SNP MSP for Aberdeenshire East Gillian Martin added that he was ‘an ever present figure in Scottish politics who made a huge difference.’ \n\nAsh Regan, Edinburgh Eastern MSP and Alba leader at Holyrood, posted on X: ‘A tour de force in politics, who took us close to independence. Alex had the nation believe in itself. My thoughts to his family, friends and all those who he inspired to dream.’\n\nAlexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was born in Linlithgow on Hogmanay in 1954, the second of four children to Robert Fyfe Findlay Salmond and Mary Stewart Salmond.\n\nHis parents were civil servants, and have been described as ‘small n’ nationalists: people who were proud of Scotland, its history and traditions, but did not necessarily support independence.\n\nAs a schoolboy he stood for classroom election – campaigning to replace the school milk with ice cream.\n\nHe also realised he had a knack for public performance when he became a boy soprano.\n\nIn 2011 he told Desert Island Discs he ‘never suffered nerves as a boy’ and said: ‘If you can sing in front of thousands of people when you’re ten or 11 then being Scottish First Minister is nothing in comparison.’\n\nAfter school Salmond studied a joint degree in economics and history at the University of St Andrews.\n\nAt university in 1973 he had a row with his English girlfriend who was the secretary of the St Andrews University Labour Club over the party’s commitment to Scotland.\n\nShe reportedly told him: ‘If you feel like that, go and join the bloody SNP.’\n\nSalmond quickly did.\n\nAfter graduation he followed his parents into the civil service and became an assistant economist in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland in 1978.\n\nIn 1980, he began his seven-year career with the Royal Bank of Scotland as an assistant economist before being appointed oil economist in 1982 and royal bank economist in 1985.\n\nWhile there his boss was Moira McGlashan who was from a traditionally conservative background. Although she was 17 years his senior at 43, the couple were married in 1981.\n\nA few years after joining the SNP he played a prominent role in the breakaway ’79 Group which took a republican left-wing stance and criticised the SNP leadership.\n\nThe move earned Salmond a brief expulsion from the party in 1982, something he later put down to being a ‘brash young man’.\n\nDespite this the rising star won the Westminster seat of Banff and Buchan in 1987.\n\nHe quickly made a name for himself after getting banned from the Commons chamber for a week after interrupting the Chancellor’s Budget speech to protest against the poll tax.\n\nWithin just three years, he became the SNP’s leader, defeating the favourite Margaret Ewing.\n\nThroughout the 1990s Salmond’s leadership transformed the SNP into a modern, social democratic party with a Scottish nationalistic flavour.\n\nHe eventually stood down in 2000 after a series of fall-outs with other party leaders, but took charge again in 2004 with the relatively unknown Nicola Sturgeon as his deputy.\n\nThe SNP narrowly won the 2007 Holyrood election and formed a minority government.\n\nDuring his years as First Minister Salmond became a powerful force throughout Scotland and a household name across the UK.\n\nHe was also pragmatic, building close relationships with leaders of big business such as Stagecoach boss Brian Souter, golf developer Donald Trump and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nBBC political editor Nick Robinson described him as ‘the canniest political operator in these isles’.\n\nBut his political demeanor was sometimes arrogant and combative, which some analysts believe was the reason for his poor polling among female voters.\n\nThroughout his premiership he would do little detailed policy work and was attacked by his opponents for being ‘presidential’.\n\nHowever Salmond remained popular and was able to connect with the electorate through a fatherly charm and charisma on the campaign trail.\n\nOutside of politics Salmond enjoyed horse racing, and would even offer his punditry to TV shows and newspapers occasionally.\n\nHe was also a keen golfer, telling Desert Island Discs his luxury item would be a sand wedge and endless golf balls.\n\nHis football team was the Edinburgh-based Heart of Midlothian FC, and he was a keen reader and admirer of the works of Scottish national poet Robert Burns.\n\nSalmond was known for loving a drink – especially wine and spirits – and eating curries. He had a selection of favourite restaurants and hotels throughout Scotland and was renowned for being a fun dinner guest.\n\nThroughout Salmond’s time as First Minister his protégé Sturgeon praised his political example.\n\nThe pair’s relationship irreversibly broke down in 2018 when he faced 13 charges including attempted rape and a series of sexual assaults, including one with intent to rape.\n\nHe was cleared of all criminal charges following a trial in 2020, yet the bitter rift that developed between him and his protégé Nicola Sturgeon was enduring. The ordeal led to several inquiries into the handling of the complaints which further divided him and Ms Sturgeon.\n\nDespite the controversy Mr Salmond went on to form the Alba Party, which he led until his untimely passing on Saturday.\n\nAs Scotland marks the death of one of its most influential political leaders, questions remain about outstanding legal challenges and projects that Mr Salmond was committed to.\n\nIn November last year, Mr Salmond launched a legal case against the Scottish government alleging misfeasance by civil servants amid the botched handling of an investigation into harassment claims made against him.\n\nIt is understood he was seeking around £3 million due to the reputational damage he suffered. It would have been the second time he took the government to court after winning a case in 2019 where he was paid out more than £500,000 in legal expenses.\n\nHe was also supporting a couple in their 70s, Peter and Florence Fanning from Coatbridge, who are taking a challenge to the Court of Session over Labour’s decision to restrict access to the winter fuel payment.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Salmond had delivered a speech at the second edition of the Forum for Cultural Diplomacy, an event co-organized by the office of former North Macedonian President Ivanov, the International Center ‘Alliance of Civilizations,’ and the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy from Berlin.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

That year, Obama's diverse voting coalition was headlined by overwhelming support from Black and young voters, two groups that Harris needs to win in November.But Obama's remarks while in Pittsburgh on Thursday sparked a major debate about Black voters and their loyalty to the Democratic Party and former President Donald Trump's push to make inroads with the key group.\"You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses,\" Obama said of Black male voters. \"I've got a problem with that.\"He continued: \"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"With Harris working to build her own voting coalition in what's expected to be a tight race, every vote will matter. Here's why Obama's remarks on Harris' presidential candidacy are so significant.In virtually every national poll, Harris boasts significant leads with female voters, buoyed by her strength on issues like reproductive rights and healthcare. Harris has recently cut into Trump's long-standing advantage on economic issues, which could be pivotal in battleground states like Arizona and North Carolina.Meanwhile, Trump continues to poll well with male voters, particularly among white men who didn't attend college.In the latest New York Times/Siena College national poll, Harris led Trump 49% to 46% among likely voters. While Harris had a 16-point lead with women, Trump had an 11-point edge with men.Obama's remarks reflected concerns among many Democrats that Black men — particularly young Black men — are gravitating toward Trump and could cost Harris the election.But some Democrats have called out the former president for his remarks, arguing that his admonishment of Black men put off by Harris' gender was misplaced.\"Why are Black men being lectured to? Why are Black men being belittled in ways that no other group [is]?\" former Ohio state senator and ex-Democratic congressional candidate Nina Turner told CNN on Thursday.Black men and Black women do not vote much differently, it’s wrong to single out Black men when Black men are the most loyal male voting block for Democrats.It’s patronizing and wrong. pic.twitter.com/2OXmq9q1TW\"Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out Black men is wrong,\" she continued. \"Some of the Black men that I have talked to have their reasons why they want to vote a different way, and even if some of us may not like that, we have to respect it.\"Turner and some other Democrats have noted that Black men remain among the most reliable supporters of the party.In the 2016 presidential election, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won 94% of Black female voters, compared to 82% among Black men, according to exit polling. The results reflected the long-standing loyalty that Black voters have had with Democrats.That year, Trump won 4% of Black women votes while taking 13% of Black male votes. (Latino voters strongly backed Clinton, but both white men and white women overall supported Trump.)In 2020, now-President Joe Biden won 92% of Black voters, compared to 8% for Trump, according to the Pew Research Center.But Obama and other Democrats are hoping to get ahead of what they see as Trump's potential to win over more Black voters — and especially Black men — this time around.The newly released New York Times/Siena College poll showed that 78% of Black likely voters supported Harris, while Trump pulled in 15% support among Black likely voters. Such a result — if it stands in November — could be a boost for Trump in swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania.Black men in the Times/Siena survey backed Harris 70% to 20%, still a sizable advantage for the vice president, but indicative of erosion among this group toward the GOP. However, Black women remained strongly in Harris' corner, backing her by an 83% to 12% margin.While Obama's pitch may have rubbed some people the wrong way, Democrats know they need robust Black support to win in November.And the Times/Siena survey showed the work that lies ahead for Harris as she campaigns to succeed Biden in the White House.","summary":"Former President Obama wants to ward off GOP efforts to make inroads with disillusioned Black male voters. But his approach is raising some eyebrows.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-harris-black-male-voters-democrats-trump-election-2024-10","image":"https://i.insider.com/670ada846ac7b701e7cab66b?width=911&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 20:46:45","author":"John L.
