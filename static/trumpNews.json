Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 3.5% growth.\n\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, Singapore's GDP grew by 1.4%, a turnaround from the 0.5% contraction last quarter.The GDP growth was led by the manufacturing sector, which expanded 5.5% year over year, up from 4.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The sector makes up about 17% of the country's economy.\n\nDespite the GDP beat, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said in its release that \"there remains significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy in the second half of 2025 given the lack of clarity over the tariff policies of the U.S.\"\n\nBack in April, MTI had downgraded the country's GDP growth to 0%-2%, down from its previous forecast of 1%-3%. Singapore recorded a full-year GDP growth figure of 4.4% in 2024.\n\nUnlike other countries in Southeast Asia that have been hit with \"tariff letters,\" Singapore has not received such a \"letter\" from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, Singapore still faces the baseline 10% tariff from the U.S., despite running a trade deficit with the U.S. and having a free trade agreement since 2004.Singapore's economic resilience task force, set up in April in response to the U.S. tariffs, announced last week that it will roll out grants to help businesses cope with the impact of global trade tensions.\n\nThe GDP release also comes ahead of a monetary policy decision by the country's central bank later in July.\n\nIn its May meeting, the Monetary Authority of Singapore loosened its policy for a second straight time, saying that \"there are downside risks to Singapore's economic outlook stemming from episodes of financial market volatility and a sharper-than-expected fall in final demand abroad.\"\n\nThe MAS also warned that a more abrupt or persistent weakening in global trade will have a significant impact on Singapore's trade-related sectors and, in turn, the broader economy.\n\nNonetheless, the country's inflation numbers are supportive of a rate cut.\n\nSingapore's headline inflation rate fell to 0.8% in May, its lowest level since February 2021, while core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport, came in at 0.6% in May, compared to 0.7% the month before.","summary":"The advance figure was higher than the 3.5% forecasted by economists polled by Reuters.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/singapore-second-quarter-q2-gdp-growth-2025-tariff-trade-mti-mas-singstat-economy.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108170612-1752216354343-gettyimages-2221543369-AFP_63YW82R.jpeg?v=1752216378","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 01:23:52","author":"Lim Hui Jie","authors":["Lim Hui Jie"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":341276916,"title":"Elon Musk On Warpath With Trump, But Tesla And Starlink To Make Big Bang Indian Debut","text":"Elon Musk may now be on the warpath with US President Donald Trump, but his two major companies – Tesla and Starlink – are on the cusp of entering India. This means cutting-edge electric vehicle technology coming to India, along with the fastest satellite connectivity.\nThis week, on Tuesday (July 15), Tesla’s first showroom will open in India at Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex. Tesla announced its entry into India with a new X handle. The company is calling its showroom as an “experience centre” and five Model Y vehicles are said to have landed in the city ahead of the launch.\nDelhi’s Aerocity could have the second showroom by the end of this month. And, when can you book and get a Tesla? August or September. But be prepared to cough up a bomb – almost Rs 65 lakh to Rs 70 lakh, which is double of what the Model Y costs in the United States.\nWell, the reason is that Tesla cars are being directly imported so far and, hence, cannot escape the 70 percent import duty that India charges. Then there are other surcharges and registration costs. The import duty would have been 110 percent, but India reduced it to 70 percent earlier this year to enable Tesla’s entry.\nTesla, so far, has no plans to manufacture its EV in India – something that the Narendra Modi-led government wants Musk to do so that the cars can become affordable for Indians and also create jobs here.\nTesla for now will be importing the cars. India could be the biggest EV maker in the years to come – and Tesla no longer wants to miss out on the early mover advantage.\nBut at a price tag of Rs 65 lakh to Rs 70 lakh, Tesla is not challenging the big players in India’s EV market – from Mahindra to Tata, which have far more affordable offerings. Even BYD is competitively priced.\nTesla is clearly going to test the waters first. It has a challenging task to set up charging infrastructure and ensure its imported cars adjust to vastly different Indian road conditions.\nSTARLINK COULD REVOLUTIONISE INTERNET\nMusk’s other big offering – Starlink – is also set for an Indian debut in the next few days. India officially opened its doors to Starlink last week to launch internet services.\nThe Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre granted a nod to Starlink Satellite Communications, signalling the country’s growing embrace of private space and communication technology.\nThis will enable provisioning of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, namely Starlink Gen1, and the private company can provide satellite communication services in India for the next five years.\nThe Starlink Gen1 Constellation is a global constellation with 4,408 satellites orbiting Earth at altitudes varying between 540 km and 570 km, capable of providing ~600 Gbps throughput over India. Again, the Starlink service will come at a higher cost than your regular broadband or WiFi service but will be much faster.\nMinister for Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia recently told News18 that India will be the biggest market for Satcom in the coming years.\n“This (Starlink) is the third (satcom) licence being given out in India, and there are others also in queue. India is ready as a vibrant market to welcome every player into our country if they check all the boxes. Licence will be given, spectrum will be given on an administratively assigned system, price of which will be determined by regulatory authority. The market is wide open to come and service our customers,” Scindia had said.","summary":"Elon Musk's Tesla and Starlink are both entering India this week.

The House of Lords, however, will be sitting.\n\nIn February this year, Sir Keir Starmer presented the US president with a letter from the King as he invited him for the visit during a meeting at the White House.\n\nAs the pair sat next to each other in the Oval Office, Sir Keir handed the president the personal invitation, later saying, “this is truly historic and unprecedented”.\n\nAfter reading it, Mr Trump said it was a “great, great honour”, adding “and that says at Windsor – that’s really something”.\n\nIn the letter, Charles suggested that he and the president might meet at Balmoral or Dumfries House in Scotland first before the much grander state visit.\n\nHowever, it is understood that, although all options were explored, there were logistical challenges surrounding an informal visit, with complexities in both the King and Mr Trump’s diaries meaning a private meeting was not possible over the course of the summer months.\n\nPrecedent for second-term US presidents who have already made a state visit is usually tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle, as was the case for George W Bush and Barack Obama.

The interview with the New York Times was centered around his use of an autopen during the last pardons that he made during the end of his administration. In his final weeks in office, Biden granted clemency and pardoned more than 1,500 individuals, in what the White House described at the time as the largest single-day act of clemency by a U.S. president. Speaking to the Times on Thursday, Biden said that he \"made every decision\" on his own. HERE ARE BIDEN'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL PARDONS, WITH MOST SIGNED USING AUTOPEN \"We’re talking about [granting clemency to] a whole lot of people,\" the Democrat said. However, the Times reported that Biden \"did not individually approve each name for the categorical pardons that applied to large numbers of people,\" according to the former president and his aides. \"Rather, after extensive discussion of different possible criteria, [Biden] signed off on the standards he wanted to be used to determine which convicts would qualify for a reduction in sentence,\" the Times's report read. Instead of repeatedly asking the president to resign updated versions of official documents, his staff used an autopen to put Biden's signature on the final version. Biden's comments came as Republicans attacked him for his autopen use on a massive number of official documents. In June, President Donald Trump sent a memo to the Department of Justice directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the autopen use, and to determine whether it was related to a decline in Biden's mental state. BIDEN ONLY HAND-SIGNED ONE PARDON DURING FINAL SPREE, AND IT WAS HIS MOST CONTROVERSIAL ONE \"In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority,\" Trump wrote. \"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden's signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\" Also in June, Trump told reporters that he thought it was \"inappropriate\" to use an autopen at all, though past presidents have used them. \"Usually, when they put documents in front of you, they're important,\" Trump said. \"Even if you're signing ambassadorships or – and I consider that important, I think it's inappropriate.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"You have somebody that's devoting four years of their life or more to being an ambassador.

But you can’t politicize the truth. Superman has been an ‘illegal alien’ for 87 years—a fact we helped America remember when we launched our 2013 campaign, Superman Is an Immigrant,\" the column, written by Andrew Slack and Jose Antonio Vargas, claimed. Vargas was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2008 for his coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings in the Washington Post. ORIGINAL 'SUPERMAN' ACTOR SAYS CHARACTER SHOULD BE USED TO 'BRING BACK THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE' ‘Superman’ director James Gunn made headlines last week when he proclaimed that the figure was an \"immigrant who came from other places,\" and that the movie would be political. Superman was created in 1938 by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster in Cleveland, Ohio, and depicts the story of Kal-El, the last son of the dying planet Krypton, whose parents save him from his planet’s destruction by launching him in a spaceship that ultimately lands in Kansas. Kal El, an orphan, is given the name Clark Kent by his adoptive parents and ultimately grows up to become Superman. \"Superman is the story of America, an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me, it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost,\" Gunn told The Sunday Times. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Slack and Vargas defended Gunn by claiming that Superman has always been political, and pointed to past comics and radio plays in which Superman took on Hitler, the Ku Klux Klan, xenophobia and defended Ferguson protesters from riot police. The column also claimed that Superman could not exist without birthright citizenship, a policy that the Trump administration has targeted in its push to reign in America’s dysfunctional immigration system. Birthright citizenship guarantees anyone born in the United States citizenship, and was adopted with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. \"Today, that outsider would be deported. In fact, without birthright citizenship, Superman would never have existed at all. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, born in Cleveland to Jewish immigrant parents, would have been stripped of citizenship and deported to Nazi-controlled Europe—to face certain death in countries they’d never known. No Jerry and Joe means no Superman. No Superman means no superhero genre,\" the column stated. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Supreme Court issued a ruling restricting lower courts’ ability to block Trump’s executive order targeting birthright citizenship, but a federal court went on to file an injunction against the order – which would have deprived citizenship to some babies born on U.S. soil — shortly after. The Hollywood Reporter columnists, who previously launched the \"Superman is an Immigrant\" campaign in 2013, likened the president to a supervillain and claimed he was the basis for DC comics' portrayal of Lex Luthor in the '80’s. \"Of course, we couldn’t have predicted Donald Trump—the man DC Comics literally used as their model to reboot Lex Luthor in 1986—waging war on the very immigrants Superman represents. In 2000, Luthor became president in the comics, complete with an anti-alien agenda. No one imagined the real President Trump would follow the same playbook,\" the column said. \"Superman is America’s conscience wearing a cape—and that terrifies critics because they’re supporting a real-life supervillain.\"","summary":"James Gunn faces criticism for calling Superman an immigrant story, while columnists argue the character has always been political throughout its 87-year history","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/pulitzer-prize-wining-journalist-compares-trump-superman-supervillain-because-his-immigration-policies","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/931/523/superman-poster-premiere.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 01:00:03","author":"David Spector","authors":["David Spector"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.081},{"id":341277542,"title":"FIFA Club World Cup players brawl moments before Trump hands out awards","text":"Chelsea's 3-0 FIFA Club World Cup victory over Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday, with President Donald Trump in attendance, was marred by a postgame brawl.

They announced their split in July 2022 after 11 years of marriage. \n\nChristine McGuinness, 37, reportedly had a 'fun fling' with a leading soap actress at an awards ceremony back in 2023, following her split from ex-husband Paddy, 51\n\nThe woman, whose identity has not been revealed, has previously been in relationships with men (Christine's ex Paddy pictured in January)\nMailOnline has contacted Christine's representatives for comment. \nThe former couple share three children, including 11-year-old twins Penelope and Leo and seven-year-old Felicity. \nChristine was previously linked to former footballer Chelcee Grimes, 33, after they were pictured passionately kissing.\nDespite their fondness for each other after meeting on ITV's The Games, Chelcee and Christine are reportedly no longer friends following an 'explosive row' over the nature of their relationship. \nChelcee, who has also previously romanced former Love Island star Megan Barton Hanson, grew close to Christine following the TV star's split from husband Paddy.\nThe pair met on ITV show The Games in 2022 and grew close the following year, which saw them kiss while on holiday in Ibiza.\nChristine, whose three children are all autistic, also attended Winter Wonderland with Chelcee and they were seen kissing in a picture shared to Snapchat.\nChelcee and Christine have enjoyed several holidays together in recent years, having jetted off to the likes of Santorini, Croatia and Greece on girls' trips with friends.\n\nShe and Christine allegedly 'exchanged messages in the days after they met' after 'partying hard' together (Christine pictured at the Pride Of Britain Awards in 2023)\n\nChristine was previously linked to former footballer Chelcee Grimes, 33, after they were pictured passionately kissing (pictured together) \n\nIt has been reported that Chelcee and Christine fell out following a heated row over the nature of their relationship\n\nThe pair met on ITV show The Games in 2022 and grew close the following year, which saw them kiss while on holiday in Ibiza\n\n Christine McGuinness, 37, reveals she has dated women since she was a teenager as she opens up about her sexuality and divorce from ex Paddy \nSources close to the pair said Chelcee was there for Christine following her divorce to Paddy, which the glamour model described as one of the worst times in her life.\nTheir close friendship reportedly ended, with the pair unfollowing each other on Instagram, and Christine recently went onto appear on the upcoming series of Celebs Go Dating, which she filmed for two weeks before quitting.\nIn June, Christine explained to Elizabeth Day on her podcast, that Paddy and family have known about her sexuality since she was little and it was 'never a secret'.\nShe opened up about how she was dating women, including one two-year 'situationship', before she met Paddy, and admits she wants a connection for herself and not a step-parent for her children.\nShe told the broadcaster: 'It shouldn't matter somebody's gender. It never mattered to me, which was why once me and my ex-husband were separated and I met people, I didn't properly date.\n'It was more like blurred the lines of friendships for me, that was normal. It felt comfortable because I'd done that as a teenager and I, as a teenager, I dated both men and women. My ex-husband knew. My family knew. It was never a secret for me.'\nWhen asked if she has a label for her sexuality, Christine said she has thought about it but would consider herself more of a 'free spirit'.\nWhen asked about labels, Christine explained: 'No and again, I've thought about it. A lot of people always ask me, are you a lesbian? Are you bisexual? Are you what? Is this a phase?\n\nShe and Paddy separated in 2022 after 11 years of marriage, but continued to live together in their shared home for the sake of their three children - twins Leo and Penelope, and Felicity\n'I've always been quite a free spirit. I think that's the only word I would put on it. When I was a teenager, I'd dated boys and girls. 14/15 was probably when I had my first kisses with, with both, and I never felt it was anything different or a big deal.\n'Then I think where I grew up, everyone was kind of just there for a good time.'\nChristine explained that before Paddy she did date women and her longest relationship latest around two years. \n'My longest was two years before I met my ex-husband and then I've had really, really lovely long situation shifts where we purposely haven't put a label on anything', she added. \n'But my experiences with women have been lovely and It's not like women are better or worse. It's simply that the connection for me is different. I need a connection now. I need something different. \n'I really, really, honestly, I love my family and Patrick is part of my family and he always, always will be. But now for my next relationship, I know what I want and I want someone for me. \n'I want someone that I like spending time with, we can do stuff together that we both enjoy. I want that emotional connection where I can be open and I can talk and I can be vulnerable and I can ask for help, but I can also have a laugh and just have a good time. \n'It's not like I'm trying to find a new family unit or someone to come in and be a stepparent. I want my next relationship to be for me.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nChristine McGuinness 'had fun fling with leading soap actress after meeting at awards ceremony' following split from Paddy\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

bombshell ICE memo exposes chilling new 'third country' detail","text":"Illegal immigrants could be given as little as six hours notice before they are deported to a country other than their homeland, according to a new memo.\n\nTodd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a top Trump administration lieutenant, issued a directive to agency staff on Wednesday, July 9, outlining the direction of deportations moving forward.\n\nHe said migrants could be deported to a 'third country' with as little as six hours notice 'in exigent circumstances' – so long as the person had been given an opportunity to speak with an attorney.\n\nGenerally, an immigrant will be given 24 hours notice before they are sent to a country other than their homeland. \n\nThe memo states that migrants could be sent to nations that have pledged not to persecute or torture them 'without the need for further procedures.'\n\nThe United States has sent hundreds of migrants to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama, while South Sudan recently accepted eight third–country deportees.\n\nThese deportees were from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam. \n\nRwanda is reportedly in talks to begin accepting third–country deportees, but human rights advocates have raised concerns over sending migrants to countries where they have no ties or that may have a history of rights violations.\n\nThe administration last week urged officials from five African nations – Liberia, Senegal, Guinea–Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon – to accept deportees. \n\nThe Supreme Court in June lifted a lower court's order limiting such deportations without a screening for fear of persecution in the destination country.\n\nThe administration argues the third country deportations will help swiftly remove migrants who should not be in the US, including those with criminal convictions.\n\nTrina Realmuto, a lawyer for a group of migrants pursuing a class action lawsuit against rapid third–county deportations, said the policy 'falls far short of providing the statutory and due process protections that the law requires.'\n\nDuring Trump's 2017–2021 presidency, his administration deported small numbers of people from El Salvador and Honduras to Guatemala.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden similarly struck a deal with Mexico to take thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, since it was difficult to deport migrants to those nations.\n\nTwo months ago, a Venezuelan woman broke her silence about being stranded in Mexico after she was arrested by ICE agents outside of her home in Florida.\n\nThe woman,who asked not to be named to avoid more legal trouble, said she and others in her position were lied to by American and Mexican authorities, who both refused to give the migrants back their passports from their countries of origin. \n\nShe said men, women and children were dumped onto the streets of cartel–controlled cities without money, IDs and even cell phones. \n\n'We were terrified after we were told we could be kidnapped or forced into working for them,' she said. \n\nThe South American mother lived in Florida for the last 20 years with her husband and three sons – two of which are US citizens. \n\nIn 2013, she lost her legal case in immigration court and was ordered out of America. \n\nShe remained in the US, despite the final deportation – which means she had exhausted all legal pathways. \n\n'When Donald Trump won the presidency, I did begin to get nervous, knowing I had a deportation order, but I never thought I'd end up in Mexico,' she told DailyMail.com in a phone interview from Mexico City. \n\nIn March, less than two months after Trump returned to office, ICE tracked her down after seven years of evading authorities.\n\n'I was leaving my house one morning with my husband. They were parked next to me on the street, in an unmarked car, no sign it was them,' she said.\n\n'They said come with us. You're under arrest.' \n\nShe was held in federal immigration detentions centers in Florida for about a week, and was told at the time she would be sent to Mexico. \n\nThe migrant said she contacted her lawyer, but was told there was nothing that could be done.\n\nTrump's border czar Tom Homan said Friday that the administration hopes to forge deals with 'many countries' to accept deported migrants.\n\n'If there is a significant public threat or national security threat - there's one thing for sure - they're not walking the streets of this country,' he said.\n\n'We'll find a third, safe nation to send them to, and we're doing it.","summary":"Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been given a new directive which outlines the direction of deportations moving forward, specifically 'third country' removals.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14902203/migrants-deported-country-six-hours.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/14/00/100278161-0-image-a-42_1752450583016.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:51:22","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":341274384,"title":"Trump to wield ‘sledgehammer’ against Russia – Lindsey Graham","text":"The sanctions bill currently in the Senate would give US President Donald Trump a “sledgehammer” to use against Russia and its trading partners, hawkish Senator Lindsey Graham has said.\n\nTrump previously said he may impose additional sanctions on Moscow if Russian-Ukrainian negotiations fail to produce a ceasefire. He also accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of stalling the talks.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News aired on Sunday, Graham, who co-authored the legislation with Democrat Richard Blumenthal, said Trump had “left the door open regarding Russia,” despite taking a hard line on other nations. “That door is about to close,” he warned.\n\n“Dick and I have got 85 co-sponsors in the United States Senate for congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer available to President Trump to go after Putin’s economy, and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine,” Graham said.\n\nThe legislation would authorize Trump to impose up to 500% tariffs on nations that continue trading with Russia, with Graham singling out China, India, and Brazil. He emphasized that Trump would have “maximum flexibility” in enforcing the measures.\n\nGraham also claimed the administration is preparing to ramp up arms deliveries to Kiev “at a record level,” and signaled a forthcoming plan to redirect frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.\n\n“I expect, in the coming days, that there will be tariffs and sanctions available to President Trump he has never had before,” he said.\n\nMoscow has condemned the sanctions as illegal and argued that the West is using the Ukraine conflict to try to contain Russia’s development. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said the proposed secondary tariffs “will not radically change the situation,” and that Russia will continue on its “independent, sovereign and sustained path.”\n\nPutin has argued the sanctions have backfired, making Russia more self-sufficient and less dependent on foreign markets.","summary":"The new sanctions bill will allow Trump to apply more pressure on Russia if adopted, Senator Lindsey Graham has said \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/621432-trump-wield-sledgehammer-against-russia/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.07/article/687452dd2030274f6d6f0f5a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:46:08","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":341276286,"title":"French President Emmanuel Macron says Europe's freedom is under its greatest threat since 1945","text":"President Emmanuel Macron has declared Europe's freedom to be under its greatest threat since 1945 in a speech condemning Russia and terrorists.\n\nThe French leader yesterday announced 6.5 billion euros (5.6 billion pounds) worth of extra military spending for the next two years.\n\nCiting 'new and unprecedented threats' in his traditional speech to the military on the eve of the Bastille Day national holiday, Mr Macron proclaimed: 'Since 1945, freedom has never been so threatened, and never so seriously.'\n\nHe added: 'We are experiencing a return to the fact of a nuclear threat, and a proliferation of major conflicts.\n\n'To be free in this world, we must be feared. To be feared, we must be powerful.'\n\nThe president laid out his spending plans as he called for intensified efforts to protect Europe and support Ukraine against Russia.\n\nHe said France would aim to dish out 64 billion euros (55 billion pounds) in annual defence spending in 2027, the last year of his second term.\n\nThis would amount to double the 32 billion euros in annual spending when he became president in 2017.\n\nMr Macron insisted France could find the money to spend more on the military even as the country tried to bring down massive national debts. \n\nIt comes as right-leaning parties have supported greater defence spending while left-wing parties accuse the government of sacrificing social welfare benefits in exchange.\n\nMr Macron concluded Europe is in danger because of Russia's war in Ukraine and wars in the Middle East, and because 'the United States has added a form of uncertainty'.\n\nOther dangers mentioned included online disinformation campaigns by unnamed foreign governments and propaganda operations targeting children, in 'the screen era.'\n\nMr Macron also ordered France's top military and defence officials to start a 'strategic dialogue' with European partners about the role that the French nuclear arsenal could play in protecting Europe. \n\nIn an exceptional move, France and Britain have agreed in recent days to cooperate on nuclear defense issues.\n\nMr Macron's speech came as U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make an announcement about Russia on Monday, and the head of NATO is travelling to Washington for two days of talks. \n\nMr Trump last week announced plans to sell NATO allies weaponry they can then pass on to Ukraine, which has been struggling to repel massive and complex Russian air assaults.\n\nThe French President recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in three years, but remains a target of widespread criticism in Russia for his vocal support for Ukraine. \n\nMr Putin argues the Ukraine conflict is a consequence of Western countries' decision to ignore Russia's security interests.\n\nThe head of the French military, Gen. Thierry Burkhard, laid out risks emanating from Russia that stretch beyond Ukraine.\n\nRussia is disrupting trajectories of satellites to jam them or spy on them, is involved in undersea infrastructure sabotage, and leads disinformation campaigns in France and Africa, Mr Burkhard said on Friday. \n\nHe added Russian attack submarines penetrate into the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and Russian military planes interact frequently with other aircraft over the Black Sea, Syria, the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic.\n\nFrench Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu, in an interview published Sunday in La Tribune Dimanche, urged more French spending on defense technology and better training of engineers and technicians.\n\nHe said: 'Big powers and certain proliferating countries are working secretly on quantum computers ... that will be capable tomorrow of revolutionizing the battlefield.

The dollar added 0.1 per cent on the yen to 147.53 and a similar amount on its currency index to 98.008.\n\nThe dollar also gained 0.3 per cent on the Mexican peso to 18.6900 , with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confident a trade deal could be reached before the August deadline.\n\nIn commodity markets, gold picked up a modest safe-haven bid and rose 0.3 per cent to $US3,366 ($A5,123) an ounce.\n\nOil prices edged higher on speculation Trump could announce stiffer sanctions on Russia later on Monday, including levies on major customers buying Russian oil.\n\nBrent edged up 0.1 per cent to $US70.45 ($A107.23) a barrel, while US crude firmed slightly to $US68.50 ($A104.26) per barrel.","summary":"The S&P 500 futures have eased, the Nikkei is down modestly, while the euro dips after Donald Trump threatens 30 per cent levies on the EU.","url":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/business/markets/wall-st-asian-stocks-slip-as-us-trade-policy-confounds-c-19347587","image":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-19347587/516b1bda2796cfeb2c0991a2dbe6261775e76fef-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:45:12","author":"Wayne Cole,Wayne Colereuters","authors":["Wayne Cole","Wayne Colereuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":341274708,"title":"Tori Spelling writes heartbreaking tribute to 90210 co-star Shannen Doherty on first anniversary of her death","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jul 14th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonald Trump bizarrely gatecrashes Chelsea's Club World Cup trophy lift to leave unimpressed Cole Palmer appearing to utter a three-word response\n\nSouthend Airport plane crash: Witnesses tell of moment jet 'violently' smashed to the ground and erupted into a ball of flames - after 'pilots waved to children'\n\nHarry and Meghan 'frustrated' after details of secret 'peace summit' between Sussexes' spokesperson and King's aide is caught on camera\n\nSARAH VINE: Harry is a selfish brat with a pushy wife - and he can't be trusted.

Some people will sit in the uncomfortableness of the brightness while others will be empowered by my flame.'\n\n Shannen Doherty's friends remember actress on first anniversary of her death \nSpelling said she has used that knowledge revealing, 'This year, I’ve tried hard to be the power you believed I could be.'\n'I’m not afraid to say while I made progress in many ways I failed in others.

Rogan also adopted Ditzel's daughter from a previous relationship, Kayja Rose, 28. Kayja Rose was not seen with the family.\n\nThe massive 2014-vintage yacht (and its' 16-member crew) costs between $561,000 to $642,000 a week to charter.\n\nThe opulent OKTO boasts a huge infinity pool on the main deck, a jacuzzi, cinema, gym, helipad and five staterooms for 10 guests. \n\nIndeed, Rogan is known to keep his personal life private - and is entire family is seldom seen together. He and his wife were last photographed together at a gala to celebrate Donald Trump's second inauguration on January 20 with Rogan even wearing a tuxedo.\n\nRogan threw his massive influence behind Trump during the 2024 election campaign, endorsing him to his 14.5 million-person podcast audience after a three-hour interview.\n\nThough, while Rogan continues to be sharply critical of Democrats and liberals in general, but has also broken with Trump on several issues in recent weeks.\n\nRogan defended critics of Trump's decison to bomb Iran's nuclear enrichmment facilities in June, saying the foreign intervention went against Trump's campaign trail pledge to keep the United States out of new wars.\n\nAnd, as far back as April, Rogan has expressed unease with the ferocity of Trump mass deportation immigration policy.\n\nThe self-declared liberal podcaster also reportedly dined privately with Trump and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White on June 30 - just three days before Rogan criticized recent ICE raids on his show.\n\n'There's two things that are insane. One is the targeting of migrant workers. Not cartel members, not gang members, not drug dealers,' Rogan said last week. 'Just construction workers. Showing up in construction sites, raiding them. Gardeners. Like, really?'\n\nRogan has also been unhappy with university students being detained for expressing pro-Palestinian views and participating in campus protests.\n\n'That's enough to get you kicked out of the country?' he remarked to one guest. \n\nRogan's most recent criticism focused on the Trump's administration failure to release the so-called 'client list' of convicted pedophile and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly killed himself in a Manhattan detention center in 2019.\n\nHe went so far as to accuse the Trump admministration of a 'cover-up' after the FBI and Department of Justice released a report concluding the Epstein was not blackmailing influential people, did not keep a list of associates and, indeed, killed himself in prison.\n\nIt appears Rogan may not be returning from vacation in time to take his regular spot on the commentary team for UFC 318 at the New Orleans Arena on Saturday, July 19.\n\nRogan has for years skipped UFC events hosted overseas - even in Canada - but he hasn't missed one in the US since a scheduling conflict kept him away from UFC 271 in Houston in February 2022.\n\nThere has been speculation in recent days that Rogan could be stepping back from the UFC, perhaps, due to his out criticism of Trump, who was also endorsed by UFC CEO Dana White.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a better explanation. Rogan's wife Ditzel will celebrate her 50th birthday on Friday, July 18, just a day before the event.","summary":"While Rogan continues to be sharply critical of Democrats and liberals in general, but has also broken with Trump on several issues in recent weeks.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14901959/Joe-Rogan-family-holiday-venice-mediterranean-yacht-wife-jessica-ditzel-ufc-donald-trump-criticism.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/14/00/100275789-0-image-m-51_1752449653403.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:41:30","author":"Editor,Nic White","authors":["Editor","Nic White"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.298},{"id":341273982,"title":"Donald Trump Unexpectedly Interrupts Chelsea’s Club World Cup Trophy Celebration, Leaving Cole Palmer Seemingly Reacting with a Three-Word Remark","text":"Chelsea hero Cole Palmer was left bemused as Donald Trump bizarrely gatecrashed the Blues’ Club World Cup trophy lift.\n\nThe US President, greeted by cheers at MetLife Stadium, observed Chelsea’s unexpected 3-0 victory over PSG, with Palmer scoring twice and Joao Pedro adding to the tally. \n\nAround 35 minutes before the game began, Trump and his wife Melania arrived at nearby Teterboro Airport via the presidential Marine One helicopter from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \n\nBut Trump’s crowning moment came after the final whistle when he took centre stage as the trophy was given to Chelsea.\n\nIt was expected that the Commander-in-Chief would step aside after presenting the trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James, as is customary. However, to the surprise of many Chelsea players, Trump remained on stage for the entire trophy presentation.\n\nEngland hero Palmer looked especially confused by Trump’s actions and appeared to utter the words: ‘What’s he doing?’\n\nTrump had earlier presented Palmer with the golden ball award with the 23-year-old midfielder looking as equally baffled during that presentation. \n\nAfter presenting medals to both the victors and losers, the Commander-in-Chief was spotted front and center as the Blues hoisted the trophy. \n\nFollowing his presentation of the trophy to Chelsea, he was asked to leave the stage by Infantino but bizarrely chose to stay put. \n\nAnd fans on social media shared Palmer’s confusion as some even compared Trump to Chelsea legend John Terry. \n\nTerry infamously wore a full kit as he celebrated Chelsea winning the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in 2012 despite the fact that he didn’t play in the game due to suspension. \n\nOne fan on X couldn’t resist making a comparison with Terry as they wrote: ‘Trump gone all John Terry’.\n\nMeanwhile, another supporter wrote: ‘Trump ruined the Chelsea celebration photo’.\n\nFurthermore, another added: ‘Donald trump just stood there waiting for the celebration’. \n\nAnother stated: ‘Trump standing clueless in the middle of Chelsea’s celebration photos lifting the trophy is brilliant lmao’. \n\nAnother supporter remarked: ‘Chelsea laughing their heads off at Trump joining them for celebration. Good stuff.’ \n\nAfter being spotted touching down near MetLife, Trump surfaced inside the stadium loud cheers could be heard from the 80,000 in attendance.\n\nTrump’s son, Donald Jr . and his girlfriend Bettina Anderson were also seen headed to the game, and they shared a kiss on the runway as they waited for the president to arrive.\n\nThe outing falls on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt Trump survived in Butler, Pennsylvania last year, and significant security measures were put in place for his arrival.\n\nAs detailed in The Athletic , secret service officials worked with organizers to put together a travel route to the venue, and it was believed he would be behind a pane of bulletproof glass at the game. \n\nThe president was put on screen at MetLife during the singing of the national anthem prior to the game, and reports emerged from the stadium that he was booed before the stadium camera cut away from him.\n\nMetLife Stadium later echoed with more boos when Trump, joined by Infantino, made his way out onto the field to present the champions with the trophy.\n\nThe president’s involvement in the trophy presentation after the game, which further complicates the required security around the American Commander-in-Chief.\n\n‘When you do the threat and risk assessment, you cover anything that could go wrong: if they were at a mass gathering, what if the stage collapsed?’ Nigel Thomas, a former British Special Air Service (SAS) soldier and founder of security training firm, Blue Mountain Group, told The Athletic.\n\n‘We will have a standard operating procedure for that, for example. You need to be prepared for it, and that takes communication with stadium security and emergency services.’\n\nDespite the security risk, Trump didn’t shy away from the limelight when he bizarrely inserted himself into Chelsea’s celebrations.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nChelsea hero Cole Palmer was left bemused as Donald Trump bizarrely gatecrashed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump Unexpectedly Interrupts Chelsea&#8217;s Club World Cup Trophy Celebration, Leaving Cole Palmer Seemingly Reacting with a Three-Word Remark first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/sport/donald-trump-unexpectedly-interrupts-chelseas-club-world-cup-trophy-celebration-leaving-cole-palmer-seemingly-reacting-with-a-three-word-remark/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Donald-Trump-bizarrely-gatecrashes-Chelsea039s-Club-World-Cup-trophy-lift.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:36:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.077},{"id":341276648,"title":"Trump's $100 million crypto mystery man","text":"Of all the riddles wrapped in the digital wallets sending funds to U.S. President Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto business, a little-known entity last month became the biggest.A venture calling itself Aqua 1 Foundation and saying it is based in the United Arab Emirates announced in late June it had bought $100 million worth of World Liberty’s crypto tokens, becoming the largest publicly known investor in the business.

Mr. Trump previously enjoyed the pomp and pageantry of the state visit in 2019 during his first term when he was hosted by Charles' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe invitation for the second state visit from the king was hand-delivered by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February during a meeting at the White House.\n\nAfter reading it, Mr. Trump said it was a “great, great honor” and appeared particularly pleased by the fact he will be staying at Windsor Castle, to the west of the capital. “That's really something,” he said.\n\nPrecedent for second-term U.S. Presidents who have already made a state visit is usually tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle, as was the case for George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nState visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals. While the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, he does so on the advice of the elected government.\n\nThe visit is seen as part of Starmer's effort to keep Mr. Trump close and lessen the impact of some of his polices on the U.K. The relationship between the two appears amicable, and has helped the U.K. from facing the sort of hefty U.S. tariffs that other nations are seeing.\n\nBut like Mr. Trump's previous visit, it's unlikely he will be welcomed by all. Last time, a day of protests saw the flying of a giant blimp depicting Mr. Trump as an angry orange baby from outside Parliament.\n\nLawmakers from Starmer's Labour Party have also questioned whether the honor should be extended to Mr. Trump at a time that he is supporting Israel's war in Gaza and threatening the sovereignty of allies such as Canada and Greenland.\n\nCharles could also face some challenges during the visit because he is head of state of both the United Kingdom and Canada, which Mr. Trump has suggested should become the 51st U.S. state. During a speech to the Canadian parliament in May the king highlighted Canada's “unique identity” and “sovereignty,” while echoing the words of the country's national anthem when he said “The True North is indeed strong and free.” \n\nState visits to Britain are particularly prized by heads of state because they come with a full complement of royal pomp and circumstance, including military reviews, carriage rides and a glittering state banquet hosted by the monarch.\n\nThe events normally take place in and around Buckingham Palace in central London. But like last week's state visit from French President Emmanual Macron and his wife Brigitte, the Trumps will stay at Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace is undergoing extensive remodeling.","summary":"Trump, who is a big supporter of the royal family, particularly of the monarch, will be accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump during the three-day visit, the palace confirmed.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-second-visit-to-uk-september-17-to-19/article69809167.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/wjgf3u/article69809313.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-07-13T233508Z_1876923298_RC2ZLFA0XECM_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:31:00","author":"British Prime Minister","authors":["British Prime Minister"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.382},{"id":341273946,"title":"FIFA Club World Cup: Nigerian Afrobeats star Tems makes history in front of President Trump","text":"Nigerian Afrobeats star Tems makes history performing at the FIFA Club World Cup halftime show in front of President Donald Trump.\n\nNigerian singer-songwriter Tems made history by becoming the first African artist to headline the halftime show at the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup final.\n\nTems was the star of the halftime show held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nTems performed alongside international stars Doja Cat and J Balvin, curated by Chris Martin of Coldplay.\n\nTems at FIFA Club World Cup\n\nTems' performance marked her as the first Nigerian to perform at the FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nThe halftime show, strategically positioned above the stands to preserve the pitch showed Tems in her element.\n\nAdding to the event's prominence, Tems performed in front of U.S. President Donald Trump, who was in attendance,.\n\nThis achievement is a testament to Tems' rising prominence in the international music scene.\n\nIt follows her Grammy win earlier in the year as she continues to make a name for herself.\n\nShe witness Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 thanks to two goals from Cole Palmer and one from Joao Pedro.\n\nTems has also ventured into football, recently purchasing a stake in Major League Soccer side San Diego FC.","summary":"Nigerian Afrobeats star Tems makes history performing at the FIFA Club World Cup halftime show in front of President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.pulsesports.ng/sports-gist/story/fifa-club-world-cup-nigerian-afrobeats-star-tems-makes-history-in-front-of-president-trump-2025071400293532941","image":"https://sportal365images.com/process/smp-images-production/ringier.africa/14072025/f5069c31-2425-41f9-a2e7-fef945e386f4.jpg?operations=fit(1200:630)","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:29:35","author":"Chris Martin","authors":["Chris Martin"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.82},{"id":341274720,"title":"Elmo's X Account Hacked? Viral 'Trump Epstein Files' Tweet Sparks Confusion","text":"The internet erupted in disbelief early Monday, July 14, 2025, as the official Elmo Twitter account, beloved by generations through Sesame Street, appeared to be hacked, posting a shocking demand for President Donald Trump to release the long-debated Epstein files. The tweet, which surfaced around 7:20 p.m. ETM, saw the red puppet asking, “RELEASE THE FILES @realDonaldTrump CHILD FU***R,\" a call that quickly went viral, amassing thousands of views before the account’s activity spiralled. Within minutes, the hack took a darker turn. Elmo’s account began spewing anti-Semitic remarks and levelling disturbing accusations against Trump, including claims of inappropriate behaviour. Posts found on X described the account tagging Trump with inflammatory language. Another post read, \"DONALD TRUMP IS NETANYAHU'S PUPPET BECAUSE HE IS IN THE EPSTEIN FILES,\" before the content was swiftly deleted. The rapid shift from innocent puppet to political provocateur has left users stunned, with many concluding this was no prank by Elmo’s handlers but a clear breach. Hacking Suspicions Ignite Online Debate The timing and nature of the posts suggest a targeted hack, possibly exploiting Elmo’s wholesome image to amplify a political agenda. The Epstein files have been a hot topic, with recent tensions between Trump and Elon Musk reigniting public interest. Musk’s past claims about Trump’s alleged links to the files, later deleted, add context to the hack’s focus. Yet, no evidence from the breach supports these allegations, and Sesame Workshop has yet to issue an official statement confirming the hack as of 8:04 p.m. ETM.","summary":"The official Elmo Twitter account appears to have been hacked, sparking outrage and confusion after posting a demand for President Trump to release the Epstein files.

Yet Doctor Who actor Ncuti Gatwa yesterday said he stepped away from the role because he is 'old, tired... and doing ballet instead'\n\nNcuti became the first black actor to lead the BBC show and was hailed for bringing fresh energy to the Time Lord – but after two series he has called time on the role\nNcuti is one of the youngest actors to have played the Doctor, with Matt Smith taking on the role at 26, Peter Davison at 29 and David Tennant at 34. \nJodie Whittaker was 35 when she joined the show, while William Hartnell and Peter Capaldi were both 55 when they became the Time Lord. \nNcuti's exit follows speculation over his decision to pull out of presenting the UK's Eurovision Song Contest results in May, with suggestions it was linked to Israel's participation in the contest during the conflict in Gaza. \nAddressing the rumours, he said: 'It all panned out very interestingly. I pulled out of it a long time before it was announced. \n'And [I don't know why] it was announced when it was announced but I was just very busy.' \nNcuti's final Doctor Who appearance aired in May and he will now star in the West End show Born With Teeth. \nThis comes after the BBC issued a statement after livid Doctor Who fans complained about an episode being 'spoiled'. \nDoctor Who's 15th season wrapped up last month and saw Ncuti depart as the Time Lord in the series' finale. \n\nIt comes amid reports of behind-the-scenes tension and a Eurovision controversy that saw the actor withdraw from presenting the British votes\n\nThe actor said: 'I'm getting old, and my body was tired... and I've now just started doing some ballet, so I'm making really great decisions'\nNcuti's character regenerated into Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in scenes that sent viewers into a meltdown.\nHowever, some fans voiced concerns that the episode was ruined because the BBC News site published an article with the headline: 'Ncuti Gatwa regenerates into Billie Piper as he leaves Doctor Who'.\n\n Doctor Who fans go into MELTDOWN as Billie Piper makes a shock return as the Time Lord \nA spoiler warning was then written underneath, but many felt the headline spoiled the ending.\nSince then, the broadcaster has acknowledged the complaints and explained the reasoning behind the story. \nThe statement read: 'Some people contacted us to complain that the headline gave away the ending, spoiling this Doctor Who episode for them. \n'Others requested that the BBC be more conscious of spoilers going forward, particularly in the use of headlines.\n'Ncuti Gatwa's departure from the series had been widely speculated and many fans will have been aware that this was a possibility.\n'The headline on the news homepage that evening referred to Ncuti Gatwa's departure because this was a legitimate entertainment news story in its own right, and it is not unusual that we would carry this type of story once a programme has been broadcast and the details in the public domain.'\n\nThis comes after the BBC issued a statement after livid Doctor Who fans complained about an episode being 'spoiled' \n\nDoctor Who's 15th season wrapped up last month and saw Ncuti Gatwa depart as the Time Lord in the series' finale\n\nNcuti's character regenerated into Rose Tyler (Billie Piper, pictured) in scenes that sent viewers into a meltdown\nIt went on to reveal details of the regeneration was added in later on in the evening. \nThe statement continued: 'While we cannot account for everyone's viewing habits, we initially held back from headlining the announcement of Ncuti Gatwa's regeneration into Billie Piper. \n'This extra detail was added later in the evening and our approach was consistent across the BBC site.\n'BBC journalists are of course entitled to use their judgement to decide which stories to cover and the manner in which they are reported. We also want our headlines to be as informative as possible.\n'Although every story is different, we have discussed your concerns on this occasion with senior editors and we will be mindful of your views for future coverage.'\nWhen the episode aired, devout Whovians were not expecting the huge twist at the end when Ncuti's character regenerated into Rose amid his departure after just two series as woke storylines saw ratings for the much-loved show plunge. \n\nHowever, some fans voiced concerns that the episode was ruined because the BBC News site published an article with the headline: 'Ncuti Gatwa regenerates into Billie Piper as he leaves Doctor Who' \n\nSince then, the broadcaster has acknowledged the complaints and explained the reasoning behind the story \nBillie first starred as the companion to the ninth Doctor in 2005, playing Rose Tyler alongside Christopher Eccleston's Time Lord. She went onto star alongside David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor in the second series. \nTaking to X, formerly known as Twitter, fans were quick to share their reaction to Billie's shock comeback, with one even asking: ''Did my eyes actually deceive me?!'\nThey penned: 'THE WAY I SCREEEEEEEEEAMED', 'Did not see that coming.

The President caused a flurry of surprise at MetLife Stadium, turning the trophy presentation into a bizarre political sideshow, right after some post-match scuffles. With added guards surrounding him, Trump made a striking entrance at the FIFA function without prior notice. His unexpected showing drew jeers from the crowd as he emerged on the jumbotron, then stepped onto the stage with FIFA president Gianni Infantino. During the medal-giving process, Trump was heard praising Infantino as an \"excellent guy.\" READ MORE: England fans celebrate as Lionesses thrash Wales 6-1 to Euro 2025 quarter-final While Chelsea's Reece James was about to hoist the Club World Cup trophy, Infantino tactfully attempted to coax Trump away; nevertheless, the President hung around awkwardly among the triumphant team. Trump stayed put, stiffly amongst the jubilant footballers for photos, until finally Infantino shepherded him to a somewhat less obtrusive position, reports the Mirror US . Nevertheless, Chelsea's day in the spotlight remained undiminished thanks to Cole Palmer's brace and João Pedro's strike ensuring their commanding victory. PSG had already been dealt a blow with Joao Neves receiving a red card, leaving them a man down. This vibrant triumph before a record-breaking attendance of over 81,000 crowned Chelsea as double Club World Cup champions since 2021 and also handed them a handsome $40 million prize. Palmer claimed the Player of the Match accolade, while Robert Sánchez secured the Golden Glove award. The tournament's revamped format has sparked debate about the logistics for future events, particularly with the 2026 World Cup on the horizon. Trump also stole the spotlight during the event, highlighting FIFA's growing ties with American leaders. Infantino has praised Trump's administration for its support and led the launch of a new FIFA hub at Trump Tower. This move signals FIFA's intention to strengthen its relationship with U.S. officials and establish a presence in the American sports landscape. \"FIFA [is] a global organization [and] to be global, you have to be local,\" Infantino stated during an appearance at Trump Tower, alongside Eric Trump. \"You have to be everywhere, so we have to be in New York - not just for the FIFA Club World Cup this year and the FIFA World Cup next year - we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based. \"So today, we are opening an office of FIFA here in Trump Tower. Thank you, Eric [Trump], thank you to everyone. Thanks, of course, to President [Donald] Trump as well, who is a big fan of soccer, [together with] the whole family.\"","summary":"The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain was overshadowed by a post-match brawl and an awkward appearance from Donald Trump on the pitch","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/donald-trumps-awkward-gatecrash-turns-35549633","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35549631.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_gettyimages-2224343956-594x594.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:19:45","author":"Paige Ingram,Sahil Kurup","authors":["Paige Ingram","Sahil Kurup"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.465},{"id":341271922,"title":"Trump Plans Meeting With NATO Secretary General on Ukraine","text":"President Donald Trump will meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, a meeting that comes in the wake of Trump’s announced plan to sell weapons and ammunition to NATO, which would go on to sell and transfer these to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to an announcement by NATO on Sunday, Rutte will be in Washington, D.C., on July 14, where he'll meet with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and select members of the U.S. Congress.","summary":"NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will be in Washington, D.C., on July 14, where he'll meet with President Donald Trump and other officials.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-plans-meeting-with-nato-secretary-general-on-ukraine-5886885","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/07/10/id5885534-Rutte-Trump-GettyImages-2221296067-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:14:18","author":"Joseph Lord","authors":["Joseph Lord"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.661},{"id":341273972,"title":"Man Who Engaged in Prolonged Standoff and Shot Six Police Officers Learns His Sentence","text":"A man from Pennsylvania will spend his life in prison after shooting six police officers in Philadelphia during an attempted arrest on a drug-related warrant.\n\nMaurice Hill, aged 41, received his sentence on Thursday, which ranges from 120 to 240 years.

At MetLife Stadium, he stood and waved to the audience after joining FIFA president Gianni Infantino on the pitch, where fans booed loudly. The White House pool report states that the President and First Lady left their box suite at 5:27 p.m. ET. Fifteen minutes later, Trump and Infantino entered the field, \"appeared on the jumbotron, and were booed again. There was also some applause, whistling and cheering. The music in the stadium then drowned the boos.\" After the game, Trump was second only to Infantino in congratulating the coaches and players. As the players passed him on stage, he shook their hands and gave some a pat on the back. He presented Chelsea goalie Robert Sanchez with the Golden Glove, Cole Palmer with the Golden Ball for MVP of the match, and PSG's Desire Doue with the young player of the tournament trophy. The first two of Chelsea's three goals were scored by Palmer. The referees for the match were then all given medals by Trump. When Trump and Infantino went for a picture with the referees, the crowd booed more loudly. The Chelsea players assembled to claim the trophy and celebrate as a team following the awards ceremony. Trump waited to raise the trophy alongside the Chelsea players. In order for the team to celebrate, Infantino finally drew Trump behind the players. Trump was asked who he would consider his greatest football player of all time during an interview on the DAZN broadcast following the ceremony. \"Many years ago when I was young, they brought a player named Pelé to play, and he played for a team called the Cosmos... and this place was packed. It was an earlier version of this stadium, but right here in the Meadowlands, and it was Pelé. I don't want to date myself, but that was a long time ago.

Last week, the United States Department of Defence (DoD) took a blowtorch to global critical minerals strategy, inking a transformative agreement with MP Materials to accelerate rare earth magnet independence.\n\nAnd just like that, a cluster of ASX-listed explorers, not just in and around MP’s Mountain Pass mine in California, but also those with the potential for critical low-cost rare earth production in other favourable locations, find themselves thrust into the geopolitical spotlight. Locksley Resources, Dateline Resources, Bayan Mining and Minerals, Viridis Mining and Minerals, Eclipse Metals and Red Metal might not be household names. But each holds a piece of ground that now looks an awful lot more valuable, simply because of where it is and what it could become. Welcome to the new world of critical mineral real estate, where the Pentagon is your neighbour and proximity might be among the best commodities of all. The MP deal is a monster. It will see the DoD become MP Materials’ biggest shareholder, underwrite a 10-year offtake agreement for rare earth magnets and bankroll building a second US processing facility. It’s not just about shovels and ore - this is industrial policy at full throttle. The goal? Break China’s grip on the global magnet supply chain and resurrect a wholly American capability from mine to magnet. And at the centre of it all is MP’s Mountain Pass - the only operational rare earths mine in the US. Zoom out just a few kilometres and you’ll find ASX-listed Locksley Resources with its El Campo project sitting neatly along strike from Mountain Pass. Its tenements are surrounded on all sides by MP’s holdings. It has rock chip samples grading up to 12.1 per cent total rare earth oxides and 3.19 per cent neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr). MP Materials even tried to muscle in - unsuccessfully challenging Locksley’s title with the Bureau of Land Management. The bureau sided with the junior, and now drilling permits are in hand with rigs set to roll in September. According to Locksley managing director Nathan Lude, the significance of the MP deal could not be greater: “This is the most assertive US industrial policy move since the global financial crisis, and it places Locksley in a unique position to benefit from this strategic realignment. With two fully permitted projects in California, including our El Campo rare earths and Desert antimony assets, we are focused on advancing our multi-commodity, critical minerals drilling programs in the next eight weeks and truly look forward to the opportunity ahead for our investors.” Notably, as well as its El Campo project, Locksley holds the Desert antimony mine, historically mined in the 1930s. With surface samples returning up to 46 per cent antimony and approvals now locked in, the project adds a critical minerals angle the US government might just find hard to ignore. After all, antimony imports currently account for more than 80 per cent of US demand with most of it coming from China. Another neighbour is Dateline Resources, the owner of the Colosseum project, just 10km from Mountain Pass. Historically explored for gold, Colosseum holds a 27.1 million tonne JORC-compliant gold resource at 1.26 grams per tonne (g/t) - a glittering prize in its own right.\n\nBut new magnetotelluric data suggests Colosseum might also be sitting on the same kind of carbonatite system that hosts Mountain Pass - a rare trifecta of gravity high, magnetic low and intermediate resistivity. The company is now preparing to drill for rare earths, with a direct line of communication already established with US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who described the reopening of Colosseum as a strategic move in America’s quest for critical mineral independence. There’s also Bayan Mining - arguably the newest entrant - but already in the thick of it. Bayan recently picked up a rare earth tenement 4.5km northeast of Mountain Pass and launched its Desert Star exploration program, targeting radiometric anomalies linked to carbonatite and alkaline systems. The company has already completed surface sampling, with assay results pending. Bayan’s geology team is focused on Mesoproterozoic intrusive complexes, notably the same recipe that gave rise to Mountain Pass. Bayan executive director Fadi Diab says the address is no accident. “The project’s strategic location, just 4.5km northeast of the world-class Mountain Pass REE mine, offers significant potential,” he says. “We’re aiming to validate surface mineralisation and gain crucial insights into the geochemical and structural characteristics of the system.” But the story isn’t confined to California. If the Pentagon’s funding blitz is phase one of America’s reshoring agenda, then phase two is about building resilient supply chains that extend beyond US borders - and that’s where companies such as Viridis Mining, Red Metal and Eclipse Metals come in. Viridis is making serious waves in Brazil, where it has just produced a pre-feasibility study over its Colossus rare earths project, which looks to potentially be the world’s lowest-cost rare earth project. It is in the prolific Poços de Caldas Alkaline Complex in the state of Minas Gerais.\n\nThe company has also just delivered its first rare earth oxide shipment from decommissioned MRI machines to Latin America’s only magnet manufacturer, a milestone that completes the “mine to magnet” loop within the Americas. Viridis has been selected for support by Brazil’s national development bank BNDES and its strategic funding partner FINEP under a program designed to accelerate critical mineral production. It has also laid out plans to develop a rare earth refinery targeting US export markets, firmly positioning itself as a bridge between Latin American mineral wealth and North American industrial demand. Australia is also host to another intriguing project with Red Metal progressing its Sybella rare earths project near Mount Isa in Queensland - and doing it with a cost-conscious twist. The company is investigating heap leach recovery for its mineralised saprolite, a lower-cost alternative to traditional extraction methods. Optimisation test work has confirmed up to 71 per cent TREO recovery with a modest acid consumption profile. It’s early days, but in a world where economics matter as much as geology, Red Metal’s unconventional approach might pay some serious dividends. Red Metal’s managing director Rob Rutherford told Bulls N’ Bears the deal struck between the US DoD and MP Materials is potentially a big win for low-capex, low-opex projects all around the world.\n\n“We are very confident our Sybella project will sing at this NdPr floor price. It is now up to other manufacturing nations like South Korea, Japan, Europe and even Australia to invest in expanded magnet capacity with REO supply guaranteed with similar price flooring mechanisms,” Rutherford said.\n\nThe price flooring mechanism Rutherford is referring to is the DoD’s guarantee to pay a minimum of US$110 per kilogram (A$167/kg) for MP Materials’ NdPr produce as part of its deal. This is hugely significant because, while the spot price market for NdPr is extremely opaque, by any estimate, the US floor is significantly higher than current prices, possibly by as much as 40 per cent.\n\n“I strongly believe the Australian Government should jointly fund and build magnet plants in these resource-poor manufacturing nations, government to government, on the provision they utilise Australian raw REO materials,” he said. There is one other project that may be as isolated as any in the world, but which appears to have the exact mix of what’s in demand in a location where US President Donald Trump has already turned his eye. Eclipse Metals, with its Ivigtût project in Greenland, is playing a long game from a different part of the geopolitical chessboard. The project hosts both historical cryolite mines and the Grønnedal rare earths deposit. And while it might seem remote, it’s exactly the kind of jurisdiction now finding favour with the US and European Union. Eclipse’s project has been flagged by the European Commission as under active consideration for strategic project designation under the Critical Raw Materials Act. The area holds archived drill core with confirmed rare earths content and sits within a geostrategic zone where both US and EU interests overlap. Speaking with Bulls N’ Bears shortly after the MP news broke, Eclipse managing director Carl Popal said the key gap in building a fully integrated US domestic supply chain for permanent magnets is that Mountain Pass alone cannot carry the burden. “Mountain Pass won’t be enough to support the massive demand for the production of high-performance magnets,” Popal said. Greenland has long been eyed by American policymakers for its critical minerals potential and Eclipse’s dual listing and advancing resource work could place it in the sweet spot for future government support, particularly as Europe and the US deepen their alignment on critical raw material supply. Intriguingly, Matt Sloustcher, who oversees government relations and communications at MP Materials, is on record saying the company and the DoD are already looking to collaborate on the sourcing of third-party rare earth feedstock. It wouldn’t be a stretch to think that any of these companies are part of these “third-party” discussions. Taken together, all of this isn’t just a series of disconnected exploration stories and observations. It’s a single strategic narrative: a Western alliance trying to wrest control of the rare earths supply chain away from China — and doing it with increasing urgency. For ASX-listed juniors with the right mix of address, geology and timing, the upside may be bigger than any single drill hit. Locksley, Dateline and Bayan are walking the ground around Mountain Pass. Viridis, with an ultra-low-cost PFS just tabled, is already shipping product in Brazil. Eclipse is drilling in a place that’s suddenly on Washington’s radar and Red Metal is carving out a cheaper path to production. Each company is now a subplot in a much larger saga - one where government funding, supply chain realignment and geopolitical calculus are every bit as important as what’s in the core. Investors chasing critical mineral leverage might do well to stop looking only at majors with billion-dollar capex and long permitting timelines. The smarter money might already be poking around the juniors sitting quietly on the doorstep of America’s rare earth revival, or at the very least, within a diplomatic handshake of it.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

The president joined the players on the field after the match to congratulate the tournament's outstanding performers, present PSG players with their runner-up medals and hand Chelsea their championship trophy.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump were greeted with cheers as they arrived at MetLife Stadium just ahead of the pre-match performance by musical artists Robbie Williams and Laura Pausini. And the president got a smattering of boos when he was briefly shown on the stadium's mega-screen. The president waved to the crowd and pumped his fist as he and his entourage arrived at the stadium luxury box, where they took in the match with FIFA President Gianni Infantino and his wife, Leena Al Ashqar.

Other guests spotted in the president's suite included Attorney General Pam Bondi, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, NFL great Tom Brady and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. MetLife in a little over a year will host the 2026 World Cup final. Chelsea, of the English Premier League, spoiled PSG's bid to win its fourth major title of the season, exactly 100 days after PSG clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. The Paris team added the Coupe de France by beating Reims 3-0 on May 24, then romped over Inter Milan seven days later in the Champions League Final. Chelsea dominated throughout, racing out to a 3-0 lead in the first half behind a pair of goals from Cole Palmer and one from João Pedro. Sunday's match fell on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt Trump survived in Butler, Pennsylvania, while campaigning for president. “It remains my firm conviction that God alone saved me that day for a righteous purpose: to restore our beloved Republic to greatness and to rescue our Nation from those who seek its ruin,” Trump said in a statement released Sunday night after he returned to Washington. He also hailed doctors, first responders and rallygoers who helped guided other attendees to safety, saying, “These men and women arrived at the rally grounds as ordinary Americans, but left as heroes.” The international sporting match also offered an opportunity for Trump and aides to huddle with Qatari government officials. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of the match, said he remained “hopeful” about Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations. Witkoff, who joined Trump for the tournament finale, appeared to nod affirmatively when asked by reporters if he planned on meeting with senior officials from the Gulf nation of Qatar, which is serving as an intermediary with Hamas in the talks, during the match. “I'll be meeting them,” Witkoff said. The president, who has a warm relationship with Infantino, has said he plans to attend multiple matches of the World Cup tournament next year that will be held at stadiums in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Preparations for next year's big soccer moment for North America are well underway. But it comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and its neighbors over proposed tariffs, immigration and Trump repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st state. Trump earlier this year said the tensions will only make the tournament more “exciting.” “ Tension's a good thing, ” Trump said. Sporting events have made up the bulk of Trump's trips in the U.S. since taking office this year. In addition to his visit this weekend to the soccer tournament, he's attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the Daytona 500 in Florida, UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, and the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia.

They cover fields including AI and data science, intelligent manufacturing, robotics and bioengineering.\nBut such preferences were often “short-sighted and utilitarian” and lacked the support of personal passion, which meant that many graduates might only be able to perform at a relatively low level, Chu warned.\nChinese students have flocked to such disciplines over the past few years as universities have accelerated adjustments of priorities.\nShanghai’s Fudan University, a top institution known for its strength in liberal arts, announced earlier this year that it would reduce the proportion of liberal arts admissions from over 30 per cent to 20 per cent to make more room for engineering students.\nIt will offer over 1,000 undergraduate admission slots in engineering this year, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of its total enrolment plan and representing a year-on-year increase of over 20 per cent, according to an announcement released in May.\nThe adjustment of university majors is a response to national strategic priorities, as Beijing emphasises technology-driven economic growth and promotes high-end manufacturing.\nOver the past decade, the Ministry of Education has approved about 20,000 new undergraduate programmes covering 655 majors, with engineering majors accounting for the highest number, according to research from Huazhong University of Science and Technology that was published in March.\nAmerican families are not as utilitarian, and there is no phenomenon of society or the government guiding the choice of majors\nChen Hang, WholeRen Group\nThere had been a similar trend in the US as universities shifted their focus from diversity, equity and inclusion to employment outcomes following US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, said Chen Hang, co-founder of WholeRen Group, an education consultancy based in Pittsburgh.\n“This means that people are becoming more pragmatic in their choice of majors, leaning towards fields like technology, healthcare and education,” he said.\nChen gave the example of the University of California, a leading public research university, where its computer science master’s programme has an enrolment quota of 500 students but received 7,000 applications. In contrast, other programmes at the university had vacancies, he said, citing its president.\nBut social science degrees were still popular in the US because they were relatively easier to acquire and represented career versatility, he said. Compared with Chinese families, “American families are not as utilitarian, and there is no phenomenon of society or the government guiding the choice of majors”, he added.\nWhile engineering dominates in China, accounting for 36 per cent of undergraduates in 2022 according to data from Statista, the rate in the US is 5 per cent.\nBusiness is the top major in the US, accounting for 19 per cent of undergraduates in the 2021–2022 academic year, followed by health professions and social sciences, according to data from the National Centre for Education Statistics.\nBut that did not mean America was weaker in technological innovation than China, Chu, the Beijing researcher, said.\n“For any individual to achieve their best, they must independently choose to pursue what interests them,” he said, adding that following that logic, the emphasis on personal enthusiasm in the US ultimately led to higher societal efficiency.\nHaving been consulted by many Chinese students on which fields to study over the past decades, he said “few had a clear idea what they wanted to do in the future and picked majors accordingly”.","summary":"Like millions of Chinese students, 18-year-old He Junjie is anxiously waiting to see which university and major will admit him after last month’s intensely competitive National Higher Education Entrance Examination, or gaokao.\nAfter evaluating his score and studying the universities and programmes he qualified for, He focused on engineering when submitting his applications a few weeks ago.\nInformation and communications technology, as well as vehicle engineering, were the top choices, the young...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3317877/tech-takes-centre-stage-chinese-students-weigh-major-choices","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/07/11/986653d7-1591-4a48-9ebb-8bc353baedcb_cdab73c0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 00:00:55","author":"Mandy Zuo","authors":["Mandy Zuo"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.353},{"id":341269724,"title":"Jasmine Crockett claims GOP would rather 'bury their constituents' than fight climate change","text":"Rep.

exercises at Panama Canal","text":"The United States military teamed with Panamanian police to conduct a series of new exercises aimed at protecting the Panama Canal, amid tensions over alleged Chinese influence along the prized trade route.\n\nTo kick off the drills, three US Army helicopters arrived in Panama on Sunday -- two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and a CH-47 Chinook -- landing at the Panama-Pacific Airport, formerly the US Howard base.\n\nMichael Palacios, subcommissioner of Panama's National Aeronaval Service -- known as SENAN -- said the exercises would prepare Panama's forces, as well as countries in the region, against any threats to the security and defense of the canal.\n\nUS soldiers conducted similar exercises in Panama a month ago, under a bilateral agreement that allows Washington to use Panamanian air and naval bases for training without establishing its own bases.\n\nThe agreement sparked protests in the Central American country, and came amid pressure from US President Donald Trump, who threatened to reclaim the canal.\n\nHe has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade.\n\nIn April, Trump called for the free transit of American commercial and military ships through the inter-oceanic route, claiming the canal would \"not exist\" without the US.\n\nBut Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said the toll fees are regulated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous governing body overseeing the trade route.\n\nUS presence in Panama remains a sensitive issue, as it evokes a time when Washington had an enclave of military bases in the country before the canal was handed over to Panamanians on the last day of 1999.\n\nSENAN officials said the US maneuvers will last until Friday and will respect \"national sovereignty.\"\n\nPalacios said the exercise has been held for 23 years.\n\nSource:

Email Sam.Lawley@mailonline.co.uk \nBy SAM LAWLEY \n Published:00:53 BST, 14 July 2025 |Updated:00:53 BST, 14 July 2025 \n\n'Amusements, ice creams, sun'. The proud billboards at Bournemouth Beach paint a pretty picture of why the south coast seafront became one of Britain's quintessential day outs.\nA nice image. But sadly one that has faded fast.\nA more appropriate modern metaphor can be found just below the sunny messaging, with a bastion of bin bags and fast food boxes stacked in and around a solitary skip, creating a wall-climbing plant of rubbish.\nIn many ways, the beach's ills neatly tie together those that plague much of modern Britain.\nStop to look at the flytipping eyesore too long and your nostrils are filled with the invasive stench of cannabis, your ears the thumping boom of Bluetooth speakers.\nLoiter any further and you're bound to get bashed by a speeding bike, defiantly burning rubber over the promenade's sad 'No Cycling' signs.\nThose who have been coming for years talk of a gradual decline, but point to a slew of recent incidents that have left them feeling more unsettled than ever.\nWhen temperatures hit the mid-30s last week, brawls broke out in broad daylight, while a woman in her late teens was raped in a beachside public toilet just days later leading to the arrest of a man who has now been released on bail.\n\nBournemouth Beach has long been one of Britain's quintessential day outs, but has recently taken a sharp turn downhill\n\nIn many ways, the beach's ills neatly tie together those that plague much of modern Britain with teenagers seemingly taking hippy crack and annoying locals\n\nThose who have been coming for years talk of a gradual decline, but point to a slew of recent incidents that have left them feeling more unsettled than ever\n\nPolice carry away a detained individual after a mass brawl on Bournemouth beach last week\n\nFive officers were assaulted as they began making arrests in Bournemouth on Monday last week\nSitting in his deck chair not far from the epicentre of the cannabis cloud, Mike Lucas, 76, regrets that visiting his beach hut is not as relaxing as it used to be.\n'We get high off the weed here sometimes just from the smell,' he said. 'There's a lack of respect. I used to be a teacher, I wouldn't want to be anymore.\n'Music is a real issue here as well, what with all these ghettoblasters and things.'\nMike spends much of his day politely reminding speeding cyclists that bikes are banned from the path at this time of year - and is often greeted by a foul-mouthed response.\nRight on cue, a marauding peddler races past before reacting badly to the local's complaints.\nHe unleashes a colourful volley of x-rated insults and points an angry finger at a reclining Mike, who gives the impression of someone who sees this kind of thing every day - presumably because he does. \nViolence is becoming an increasingly common event on Bournemouth Beach as soaring temperatures prompt flared tempers. \nOn Wednesday, police released CCTV imagery of 12 males they would like to identify following a beach brawl between shirtless youths last week which saw five officers injured. \n\nSitting in deck chairs not far from the epicentre of a cannabis cloud, Mike Lucas, pictured right, and Bernd Rohring, left, regret that visiting their beach hut is not as relaxing as it used to be\n\nMike spends much of his day politely reminding speeding cyclists that bikes are banned from the path at this time of year\n\nRight on cue, a marauding peddler races past before reacting badly to the local's complaints\n\nCyclists ignoring local rules that ban it at this time of year. Fiends on two wheels remain as big a gripe as any for locals\n\nA large green camping tent stands firmly in the sand just yards in front of the duo with a man's legs poking out\n\nFootage posted online showed yobs fighting among themselves and clashing with officers, with some seen hurling objects and attacking them with bottles.\nMissiles appeared to be thrown at police and glass could be heard smashing on the ground as terrified day-trippers watched on in horror.\nFive police officers were injured during the chaos, as well as a teenage girl who was taken to hospital for treatment. Their injuries were not serious.\n'People are always telling you to 'eff off' while they're cycling along,' Mike said once his bad-tempered rival had disappeared. 'They don't listen.\n'A couple of weeks ago, some teens were using the back of the huts as a toilet. They were told to stop but one was clearly trying to impress the others and physically attacked an older gentleman and punched him. \n'The police issued a case number but said they couldn't send anyone down. \n'Music is a real issue here as well, what with all these ghettoblasters and things.'\nSitting in the hut next door, fellow beach-goer Patrick chimed in to describe cyclists as a 'real problem'.\n\nBournemouth is one of Britain's most historical beaches with people across the country visiting the resort during their holidays\n\nSome locals reminisce about the good old days, where Bournemouth was a stylish and fashionable destination\n\nA short walk past some more piles of rubbish, Ros and Terry Keenan are soaking in some afternoon sun\n\nAn enormous stack of overflowing bins provides a more accurate metaphor for Bournemouth Beach than the promising signs above it\nGesturing towards his friend Bernd Rohring, 83, Mike explained that rubbish was also getting out of control. \n'The beach is not properly manned,' he said. 'Bernie here spends his time each morning picking up litter.'\nBernd, taking a brief break from his tidying duties, added: 'The bins here can't cope with the level of rubbish. All the black bins here just disappeared.\n'There's also a rough sleeper just there on the beach – he's been here all week. The council won't do anything about it.'\nSure enough, a large green camping tent stood firmly in the sand just yards in front of the duo with a man's legs poking out.\nSimilar tents are interspersed among the sunbathing masses all across the beach and are clearly visible from the seafront's many vantage points.\nSitting on their regular bench on the pier, Paul, 73, and Barbara, 70, are well aware of the swelling rough sleeping population.\n'We come down here often,' Paul, sitting with his granddaughter Emilia, said: 'Bournemouth has got this very high rate of homelessness, particularly in the summer.\n\nCarol has been having a similarly grim time watching the bikes whizz past, creating muddy track marks in heaps of sand which have not been cleaned up by staff\n\nLocal enforcement officers spend a good deal of time chasing around rule-breaking BBQ operators\n\nA couple of police officers could be seen in the surrounding area following a slew of antisocial incidents\n\nA new camera being installed at the clifftop in light of a number of violent interactions\n'We're actually thinking of moving which is a shame. It's all a sign of the times.\n'We've had people fighting here and even a stabbing. We need more of a police presence.\n'But it's the homelessness more than anything [that's the problem].'\nBarbara, who lives with her husband close to the beach, says that the problems are mirrored in the town itself.\n'It is a shame. The town is such a dead end. The shops have all gone and there's so many homeless.\n'It's not very good at the moment. \n'There's a lot of drugs, soft drugs. You can smell the marijuana, we're fed up smelling it. Alcohol, I'm all for, but not the drugs.'\nThese regulars paint a vivid picture of a real hellhole - a Dante's Inferno in Dorset. \nAnd yet tourists still flock there in their droves, taking a day off to soak in the sun on one of the largest sand beaches on the south coast.\n\nLonger in the tooth than most is Lourde, a local who has spent many decades seeing the beach evolve - or devolve - since she first arrived aged 17\n\nSeveral residents complained about a lift service which has been closed for a long time following landslides\n\nAn area of the beach remains closed off some time after the landslides \nThis presents its own issues with limited parking options prompting day trippers to leave their cars on the side of the road, on grass verges or even in the middle of roundabouts.\nThe chaos has threatened to deter tourists from visiting the popular site and, in a bid to ease things, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council brought forward proposals to charge residents £70 to park outside their own homes.\nThis went down about as well as you would expect with the local authority forced into a dramatic U-turn after an influx of criticism. \nBarbara said: 'Everyone says the parking is horrendous. There are cars on yellow lines everywhere.'\nPaul added; 'Parking is expensive. You're never going to have enough spaces in the summer.\n'It's overcrowded.'\nDebbie and Terry, visiting from a nearby town, rented one of the colourful beach huts for their day at the seaside.\nThey explained that the parking situation has got worse lately with many people simply ignoring the signs threatening fines.\n\nA bong stands embedded in the golden sands of Bournemouth beach like King Arthur's Excalibur in May\n\nA male stands in plain sight and urinates near the beach huts with an e-scooter seen in the forefront \n\nGraffiti etched on the side of one beach hut two months ago\n'Parking is a big issue,' Debbie said. 'People parking on the roundabouts or on the side of the road. It's very hard to get parking there.'\nThe Liberal Democrat-led BCP Council suggested their unpopular plans on the basis that pirate parkers are happy to pay the existing £35 maximum fine so sterner measures were needed. \nMiles of road were set to be littered with new meters under the scheme, including the residential areas of Sandbanks, Canford Cliffs, Branksome Chine, Westcliff, Boscombe and Southbourne, under the proposals.\nBut this meant home owners would pick up the slack, paying £70 per car on their own streets, and the idea has been swiftly brushed back under the carpet.\nThe problem remains, however, and there is a general consensus that a clever new plan to deal with the chaos is needed. \nOn the other side of the promenade, a short walk past some more piles of rubbish and local enforcement officers chasing around rule-breaking BBQ operators, Ros and Terry Keenan are soaking in some afternoon sun.\nThey agree that the beach can be a nightmare to get to and count themselves lucky that their street, slightly closer to town, has not become one of the many jam-packed thoroughfares in the area. \nTerry said: 'There's a real issue with parking, but the council should just build a multi-storey car park down the road.'\n\nA group of young men appear to inhale balloons filled with nitrous oxide on Bournemouth beach\n\nA group of males hang out on the seafront with balloons held to their lips. One of the males appears to be holding a gas canister\n\nTwo young revellers are seen walking along Bournemouth beach, one with a balloon in his mouth\nFor all the chit chat and council minutes dedicated to parking problems, the fiends on two wheels remain just as big a gripe for locals.\n'Cyclists are a pain. They cycle very fast,' Terry added. 'They're dressed in black with balaclavas, cycling these things with huge tyres.\n'So they're not exactly here for a quiet day at the beach, they're obviously pushing.\n'The council are cycling fanatics. There's big blue signs in town, not for cars but for cyclist's directions. They don't need them.\n'They must be doing some really high speeds along here. They ignore the signs on the pavements.'\nRos added: 'The cycling is a problem. One of my grandchildren got knocked over by someone going past on a bike, and he was standing on a no cycling sign.'\nCarol, 71, and Laura have been having a similarly grim time watching the bikes whizz past, creating muddy track marks in heaps of sand which have not been cleaned up by staff.\n'There are far too many cyclists coming along this path,' she said. 'They're supposed to get fined but nobody is taking any notice of the signs or the rules.\n\nPolice patrol Bournemouth seafront amid a crackdown on people using hippy crack\n\nPolice officers descend on a group of revelers on Bournemouth beach to seize canisters of nitrous oxide\n\nPolice looking over the beach from the Pier as they seek to crackdown on people using nitrous oxide in the popular getaway spot\n\nA police officer speaks on the phone while holding a canister of nitrous oxide on Bournemouth beach\n'They just get off for a second and then get straight back on.'\nShe added that the beach was falling hopelessly short with regards to accessibility after a landslide a few years ago left the main lift permanently out of action.\nCarol said: 'It's also bad that the cliff side lift has not been working for three years due to the landslide.\n'We need a wheelchair so it is difficult.'\nAs one of the largest resorts in the south of England, Bournemouth has long attracted legions of youngsters from the inner cities looking for a glimpse at the bright blue sea.\nVisiting kids and lifelong residents have generally co-existed quite pleasantly, but it seems there has been a noticeable shift in recent years.\nShocking pictures show teens apparently taking hippy crack, or nitrous oxide balloons, in plain sight while playing loud music and even getting in confrontations with locals. \nTerry Keenan has seen such incidents come close to spiralling out of control in recent months and blames the police for lacking a beach side presence.\n\nCars parked all along the road on the East Cliff in Bournemouth. Plans to introduce a tax on those parking in the area have been struck down by local complaints\n\nVisitors to Bournemouth have been parking across driveways, on pavements and grass verges\n'The police are useless, they're never here,' he said. 'Kids come here for a big night, they come with the gas and balloons.\n'On these nights, it gets on the verge of being a nuisance.\n'We're down here all day and there's not one policeman, yet there's thousands of people here. It gets out of control. \n'We saw the police there one weekend, but why not have them here all the time? A police car would put people off.'\nDebbie agreed that antisocial behaviour was often rampant and suggested it might be down to 'too much cannabis'.\nTerry, meanwhile, said: 'There are lots of down and outs and a cannabis smell in the air.\n'There are also lots of problems with alcohol. These problems were not here before.\n'So many of the shops have been closed up and there is a real lack of police.'\nWhile the beach seemed quiet for a sunny July afternoon, the tourists haven't put off just yet and, thanks to their briefer exposure to Bournemouth's issues, were more enthusiastic about the resort.\nOne said: 'There's a big area closed off where everyone seems to have slung their rubbish. But other than that we've pretty much had a 10 out of 10 experience today.'\nAnd another added: 'We come down here most years for a few days. The sea is much clearer than in Kent, where I'm from, and the weather always seems to be good.'\nLonger in the tooth is Lourde, a local who has spent many decades seeing the beach evolve - or devolve - since she first arrived aged 17.\nShe reflected wistfully on a bygone era, where Bournemouth was trendy and safe, ruing the fact that she no longer feels comfortable taking to the promenade in the evening.\n'All the men used to come here in smart suits and the ladies wore business suits,' Lourde said. 'It was a certain status thing to walk along this beach side.\n'It's really busy now. Unfortunately the town itself has also gone downhill.\n'The whole atmosphere is completely rundown. It used to be stylish. \n'It all changed when the students stopped coming. They brought money in and went to bars and cafes and needed entertainment.'\nKeeping a safe distance sitting in the square a couple of hundred yards behind the beach, she added: 'I wouldn't want to go down here at nighttime. It's very sad, only six years ago I would have been fine. \n'There's an undercurrent – I can't quite say what it is.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe seaside resort that's lost its shine: How Bournemouth has plunged into decline with feral yobs terrorising locals, sex predators who prowl the beach, litter-strewn streets and car parking problems driving tourists away\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email sophia.stanford@mailonline.co.uk \nBy TOM MIDLANE and SOPHIA STANFORD \n Published:00:30 BST, 14 July 2025 |Updated:00:31 BST, 14 July 2025 \n\nA shattered father who saw a small plane become a 'fireball' at Southend Airport has spoken about how a bar erupted into screams when the jet 'violently' crashed after takeoff. \nBen Guppy, 34, had taken his 15-month-old daughter to watch the planes take off and land - but did not expect for a fun day out to turn into a 'nightmare'.\nThe family from Benfleet, Essex, have often made a trip out of going to the Holiday Inn at the airport, which has a bar and restaurant on the fifth floor with a window to watch the planes.\nJust before 4pm yesterday, a 40ft-long Beech B200 aircraft, which is reported to be a medijet with medical equipment onboard, was heading to the Netherlands but reached just 175ft before crashing yards from the runway.\nThe crowd in the bar began screaming, Mr Guppy said, whose own wife was distraught.\n'I just looked around like \"Am I dreaming?\". I turned to my wife Jess, who had her hands over her face. She was pretty much in tears. She's still pretty upset about it all,' the wholesale director said.\nIt is unclear how many people were onboard but the twin-engined turboprop plane, believed to be 31 years old, can fit up to 12 passengers and the pilots were seen waving to children as the plane was taxiing. \nOne local claimed there was four people on board who all died, however this was unconfirmed, it was reported in The Sun. \n\nCharred wreckage of the 40ft-long Beech B200 aircraft was seen yards from the runway yesterday evening\n\nA small plane crashed close to the runway after takeoff from Southend Airport on Sunday, exploding into a 'big fireball'\n\nThe flight to Lelystad was scheduled to take off at 3.45pm but appears to have veered off the runway, according to Flightradar\nThe flight to Lelystad, east of Amsterdam, was scheduled to take off at 3.45pm but took off 10 minutes late, according to Flightradar. \nThe airport is now closed for the foreseeable future and have advised 'any passengers due to travel tomorrow via London Southend Airport contact their airline for information and advice'.\nMr Guppy said he saw the plane reach 'probably 50 metres off the runway' before the plane began tilting left. \nHe said: 'My daughter was pointing at it and then it listed to the left. The left wing came down, the ring wing came up, I thought \"He's keen to go left as soon as he takes off.\" \n'He's banking hard left and then the next thing you know, it's like another handbrake turn. He went left so violently and I thought \"What is he doing?\" He was only about 100 metres up by this point.\n'And then he corkscrewed upside down into the floor, the plane was only in the air for seconds. I looked at it and the fireball went up, there was fire and smoke everywhere. Luckily my daughter was facing the other way.'\nMr Guppy said they were 'about 500 metres away on the fifth floor, so it's not like we could help. We decided to get our daughter out of there'.\nHe added: 'Driving home I did have a lump in my throat and goosebumps. Everyone was pulled over at the side of the road watching the smoke.\n'On my way back I rang the police and told them what I'd seen. They told me they'd give me a call on Monday.'\n\nFootage of a group of frantic men running across the Rochford Hundred Golf Club, which is next to the airport, towards a huge cloud of smoke was circulating on social media yesterday \n\nIt was a small Beech B200 aircraft that was reportedly involved in the crash (stock photo)\n\nThe airport is now closed for the foreseeable future and have advised 'any passengers due to travel tomorrow via London Southend Airport contact their airline for information and advice'\n\nEssex Police, ambulances and fire engines were all at the scene and the cops have set up a dedicated phone line for information or questions.\nChief Superintendent Morgan Cronin urged the public to call 0800 0961011, international callers were directed to 0207 1580126 and a Major Incident Public Portal is available. \nResidents are being advised to stay away from the area, which has a wide cordon in place, and several Easyjet flights from Southend were cancelled. \nFootage of a group of frantic men running across the Rochford Hundred Golf Club, which is next to the airport, towards a huge cloud of smoke was circulating on social media yesterday.\nThe desperate group appear to be looking for someone who was nearby to the 'fireball' - apparently fearful they'd been caught in the crash. \nIn clipped breaths one man shouts: 'Oi watch the explosion boys, watch the explosion. What the f***. Someone on the tee, who is it, who's on the tee?'\n'Where - where's someone on the floor,' he says dramatically before the video cuts out. \nIt was reported that the Rochford Hundred Golf Club was evacuated due to its proximity to the explosion as a 'precaution'. \n\nOne witness said the pilot 'corkscrewed upside down into the floor, the plane was only in the air for seconds'\n\nThe plane, which is often used for mapping and for medivac journeys, had completed two trips that day, one from Athens in Greece to Pula in Croatia and then from Pula to Southend, landing in the UK at 2.51pm \nA bartender at the club, which is next door to Southend Airport, said he felt a 'big heat wave' before looking up to a 'massive fireball' in the sky. \nIn a field nearby, children playing on a rugby pitch watched as the plane plunged out of the sky and exploded in a ball of flames.\nThe youngsters from Leigh Lionesses FC were at the all-girl football club’s annual presentation ceremony at Westcliff Rugby Club when the plane crashed a few hundred yards away.\nLauren Dawson who was with her daughter Dixie, 12, said: ‘The plane came down behind a line of trees, but a lot of people saw the huge fireball and then the black smoke.\n‘It looks like the pilot took off, and then had a problem, and came back on himself to try and land back at the airport. But the plane came down behind a line of trees.’\nThe chairman of Westcliff Rugby Club, which is near Southend Airport, said people at the club did not end up having to evacuate following the plane crash, despite initial reports. \nThe Zeutch Aviation plane appears to have taken off in a northeasterly direction at about 120mph and reached around 175ft, according to Flightradar, but data indicates it slowed after leaving the ground and turning to the north. \nThe plane, which is often used for mapping and for medivac journeys, had completed two trips that day, one from Athens in Greece to Pula in Croatia and then from Pula to Southend, landing in the UK at 2.51pm. \n\nIn one video circulating online, passengers were seen boarding with the crash billowing smoke on the other side of the runway\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague has not been contacted for support, Dutch outlet De Telegraaf reported.\nZeusch Aviation, based at Lelystad Airport in the Netherlands, said: 'We can confirm that Zeusch Aviation flight SUZ1 was involved in an accident today at London Southend Airport.\n'We are actively supporting the authorities with the investigation and will provide updates on this page as more information becomes available.\n'Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected.'\nFootage was circulating on social media of a black plume of smoke billowing into the sky on Sunday, with one clip showing passengers boarding another flight close by. \nFlights to and from Southend Airport were cancelled after the crash. Aideen Cowling, 40, also had her 5.30pm flight to Palma de Mallorca cancelled also but had already arrived at the airport with her husband Blair, 44, and sons Shay, six, and Jude, three, for their 10-day holiday when they saw the crash.\nMrs Cowling from Bexley Heath, Kent, said: ‘We had just parked in the car park, and had got out when I heard what sounded like seagulls squawking.\n‘I looked up and I saw this massive orange fireball. I called out to Blair and by the time he looked round, it was just black smoke.\n\nA huge cloud of black smoke was seen billowing from the side of the runway\n‘It didn’t sink in that a plane had crashed, and we just carried on into the terminal.’\nMr Cowling added: ‘We spoke to some guys in high vis jackets and asked them what was going on. They said that the fire service sometimes held exercises at the airport, and that was probably what it was.\n‘We then found out from that a plane had come down. It was pretty shocking. We were running a bit late and we were the last people to check in bags for our flight.\n‘The bags went through, and then they told us that our flight had been cancelled. We had to wait an hour to get our bags back because they had already been taken out on the runway,\n‘We had to book a new flight. I tried Gatwick and Stansted, but they were fully booked, and eventually we got places on a BA flight out from Heathrow on Monday morning, so we are having to get there and stay in a hotel.’\nIris Sousa, 23, of Lisbon, Portugal, who was flying home after a holiday in the UK was about to pass through airport security when she was told that her easyJet flight to Faro had been cancelled.\nShe said: ‘I got here at about 3.30pm and then at around 4pm. I went upstairs to go through security and they said that nobody could go through because there had been an incident on the airfield.\n\nEssex Police, ambulances and fire engines were all at the scene while residents have been advised to stay away from the area\n\nThe cops dashed to the blaze just after 4pm today and have set up a dedicated phone line for information or questions\n‘Ten minutes later, I received an email from easyJet saying the flight had been cancelled.’\nIris who works as an Airbnb host said easyJet had arranged for her to fly on an alternative flight to Lisbon from Gatwick tomorrow.\nShe added: ‘They are putting me up in a hotel as well. What can you do? We just have to follow directions, and hopefully tomorrow we can travel.’ \nAn airport spokesman said last night: 'Due to a serious incident today at London Southend Airport, we regret to advise that the airport is closed until further notice.\n'All flights to and from the airport have been cancelled while police, emergency services and air accident investigators are attending the incident.\n'We ask that any passengers due to travel tomorrow (Monday, July 14) via London Southend Airport contact their airline for information and advice.\n'Our thoughts are with those affected by today's events and all passengers impacted by this disruption.\n'We will restart flight operations as soon as possible and will continue to update the public on developments.'\n\nThe smoke cloud was visible 20 miles away from Tankerton Bay in Whitstable\nFamilies have been left distraught after seeing the traumatising crash, including John Johnson who was at the airport with his family when they saw the plane crash 'headfirst into the ground' and explode into a 'big fireball'. \nThe father said: 'We all waved at the pilots, and they all waved back at us. About three or four seconds after taking off, it started to bank heavily to its left, and then within a few seconds of that happening, it more or less inverted and crashed.'\nMr Guppy rubbished accounts online suggesting the Beech B200 had hit another plane on the runway.\nHe said: 'About 20 minutes before the crash a little Cessna landed and was having issues. The fire brigade went out and took the plane away.\n'People were saying the jet hit that plane on the runway but that's completely untrue.\n'It was perfect visibility and my eyesight's pretty good, and I didn't see anything.

Trump previously enjoyed the pomp and pageantry of the state visit in 2019 during his first term when he was hosted by Charles’ late mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe invitation for the second state visit from the king was hand-delivered by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February during a meeting at the White House.\nAfter reading it, Trump said it was a “great, great honor” and appeared particularly pleased by the fact he will be staying at Windsor Castle, to the west of the capital. “That’s really something,” he said.\nPrecedent for second-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit is usually tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle, as was the case for George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nState visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals. While the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, he does so on the advice of the elected government.\nThe visit is seen as part of Starmer’s effort to keep Trump close and lessen the impact of some of his polices on the U.K. The relationship between the two appears amicable, and has helped the U.K. from facing the sort of hefty U.S. tariffs that other nations are seeing.\nBut like Trump’s previous visit, it’s unlikely he will be welcomed by all. Last time, a day of protests saw the flying of a giant blimp depicting Trump as an angry orange baby from outside Parliament.\nLawmakers from Starmer’s Labour Party have also questioned whether the honor should be extended to Trump at a time that he is supporting Israel’s war in Gaza and threatening the sovereignty of allies such as Canada and Greenland.\nCharles could also face some challenges during the visit because he is head of state of both the United Kingdom and Canada, which Trump has suggested should become the 51st U.S. state. During a speech to the Canadian parliament in May the king highlighted Canada’s “unique identity” and “sovereignty,” while echoing the words of the country’s national anthem when he said “The True North is indeed strong and free.” State visits to Britain are particularly prized by heads of state because they come with a full complement of royal pomp and circumstance, including military reviews, carriage rides and a glittering state banquet hosted by the monarch.\nThe events normally take place in and around Buckingham Palace in central London. But like last week’s state visit from French President Emmanual Macron and his wife Brigitte, the Trumps will stay at Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace is undergoing extensive remodeling.

That is a jump from 58% last year while just 11% of central banks now view the euro as gaining ground compared to 20% last year.\n\nThe survey was carried out between January and March - before U.S. President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcements and at the peak of excitement around DeepSeek AI's emergence in China.\n\nWealth funds are seeing a major resurgence in interest in Chinese assets with nearly 60% intending to increase allocations there in the coming five years, specifically the tech sector.\n\nThat number jumps to 73% in North America despite the worsening U.S.-Sino tensions, whereas in Europe it sits at just 13%.\n\nWealth funds, the survey said, were now approaching China’s innovation-driven sectors with the \"strategic urgency they once directed toward Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"There's a little bit of a FOMO,\" Ringrow explained, a view that \"I need to be in China now\" as it shapes up to be a global leader in semiconductors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and renewable energy.\n\nPrivate credit has also emerged as a key focus for funds seeking alternative sources of income and resilience. It is now adopted by 73% of wealth funds, up from 65% last year, and with half actively increasing allocations.\n\n\"This represents one of the most decisive trends in sovereign asset allocation,\" the report said.\n\nThere is also growing interest, especially among emerging market wealth funds, in stablecoins - a type of cryptocurrency that is most commonly pegged 1:1 to the dollar.\n\nAlmost half of funds said stablecoins were the type of digital assets they were inclined to invest in, although that was still behind the likes of bitcoin, where the share was 75%.\n\nReporting by Libby George; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nLibby GeorgeThomson ReutersLibby George is a London-based journalist on the Reuters emerging markets team.

Trump, who is a big supporter of the royal family, particularly of the monarch, will be accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump during the three-day visit, the palace confirmed.

Trump previously enjoyed the pomp and pageantry of the state visit in 2019 during his first term when he was hosted by Charles' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The invitation for the second state visit from the king was hand-delivered by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February during a meeting at the White House.

After reading it, Trump said it was a “great, great honor” and appeared particularly pleased by the fact he will be staying at Windsor Castle, to the west of the capital. “That's really something,” he said. Precedent for second-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit is usually tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle, as was the case for George W. Bush and Barack Obama. State visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals. While the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, he does so on the advice of the elected government. The visit is seen as part of Starmer's effort to keep Trump close and lessen the impact of some of his polices on the U.K. The relationship between the two appears amicable, and has helped the U.K. from facing the sort of hefty U.S. tariffs that other nations are seeing. But like Trump's previous visit, it's unlikely he will be welcomed by all. Last time, a day of protests saw the flying of a giant blimp depicting Trump as an angry orange baby from outside Parliament. Lawmakers from Starmer's Labour Party have also questioned whether the honor should be extended to Trump at a time that he is supporting Israel's war in Gaza and threatening the sovereignty of allies such as Canada and Greenland. Charles could also face some challenges during the visit because he is head of state of both the United Kingdom and Canada, which Trump has suggested should become the 51st U.S. state. During a speech to the Canadian parliament in May the king highlighted Canada's “unique identity” and “sovereignty,” while echoing the words of the country's national anthem when he said “The True North is indeed strong and free.” State visits to Britain are particularly prized by heads of state because they come with a full complement of royal pomp and circumstance, including military reviews, carriage rides and a glittering state banquet hosted by the monarch. The events normally take place in and around Buckingham Palace in central London. But like last week's state visit from French President Emmanual Macron and his wife Brigitte, the Trumps will stay at Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace is undergoing extensive remodeling.
