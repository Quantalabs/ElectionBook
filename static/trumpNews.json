In dimly lit corridors, men slip in and out of back rooms, clutching bundles of dollars. Amid the shadows, a trader says that he deals in millions daily, mostly swapped for stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, usually the greenback.\n\nStablecoins are typically backed by cash or government bonds and run on public blockchains. Unlike bitcoin, the ur-cryptocurrency, their price barely fluctuates: tether, the biggest (whose issuer bears the same name), fetches a flat $1, within a few hundredths of a cent. They are mostly used to trade other cryptocurrencies, providing a stable bridge between wobblier digital assets. According to Chainalysis, a data firm, trading, payments and transfers in stablecoins hit $US27.6 trillion ($43.3trn) last year, or two-fifths of all value settled on public blockchains, up from a fifth in 2020.\n\nIn part, this reflects the broader crypto boom — but stablecoins are increasingly used for real-world purposes, too. Migrants send remittances with them, replacing a correspondent-banking system beset by high fees and delays. The Turkish trader says that shopkeepers in the Grand Bazaar pay suppliers with the coins as they are the fastest option.\n\nIn countries where inflation erodes savings and dollars are scarce they are catching on as a store of value. A survey of stablecoin-holders in Turkey and four other emerging markets by Castle Island Ventures, which invests in crypto startups, and Visa, a payments giant, finds that nearly half use them for this purpose.\n\nAs stablecoins have gained real-world traction, notes Bernstein, a broker, their market capitalisation has decoupled from that of cryptocurrencies more broadly. America, where stablecoins are central to crypto trading, remains the world’s biggest market, according to Chainalysis.\n\nRelative to economic size, though, Turkey is now the home of stablecoin transactions: in the year to March 2024 purchases alone were worth 4.3 per cent of GDP. In the year to June, Ethiopia saw the fastest growth — almost a tripling — in transactions of less than $US10,000, most of which were probably remittances and everyday payments.\n\nTether, the dominant stablecoin, accounts for 70 per cent of activity. Tether, the company, makes money by investing its reserves. It says it has $US113b, or 72 per cent of its assets, in American Treasuries, which rising yields have turned into a cash cow.\n\nBut dominance brings risks. A loss of confidence in tether could shake the market, much as the collapse of Terra-Luna, an algorithimc stablecoin system, did in 2022. If Tether was forced to fire-sell its government bonds, it could also have consequences for mainstream financial markets.\n\nTether insists its model is secure. It has proved resilient: during the Terra-Luna collapse, the firm made more than $US10b in redemptions in a fortnight while maintaining its peg to the dollar. Yet Tether’s opacity means that future difficulties cannot be ruled out, says Rajeev Bamra of Moody’s, a rating agency.\n\nUnlike Circle, its main rival, Tether does not undergo independent audits, making it hard to know whether its assets — which besides Treasuries include riskier things, such as bitcoin — match its liabilities. Nor does it disclose where its reserves are held. S&P, another rating agency, assigns tether a risk rating (in terms of its ability to keep its dollar peg) of four out of five. Circle’s USDC gets a two.\n\nMany governments are becoming stricter. In January European exchanges delisted Tether for failing to comply with new EU laws. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s boss, is critical of the rules, particularly a requirement that stablecoins hold 60 per cent of reserves in bank deposits. “If a bank fails, the stablecoin fails with it,” he argues. Still, he says, emerging markets are his real focus.\n\nYet their governments are growing uneasy, too. Tether is registered in El Salvador, whose president, Nayib Bukele, is eager to make his country a hub for digital assets. Before that, it was based in the British Virgin Islands. Neither place is noted for over-intrusive regulation.\n\nIn 2023 a study by TRM Labs, a blockchain-intelligence company, found that a relatively high share of Tether transactions were part of criminal activity. Iran and Russia have used the coin to evade sanctions. A UN report called it the “preferred choice” of South-East Asian money-launderers. Tether says that it works closely with law enforcement, freezing wallets linked to illicit activity and complying with official requests.\n\nFrom February 25 Turkey will require crypto exchanges to be licensed, enforce anti-money-laundering controls and verify users’ identities. Platforms such as Binance and KuCoin have scaled back their presence in the country in response. In Nigeria stablecoin volumes fell by 38 per cent in the year to July after authorities revoked the licences of over 4,000 exchanges, blaming them for the naira’s decline.\n\nAmerica, by contrast, may lighten its touch. In January Donald Trump signed an executive order directing officials to draft a regulatory framework for digital assets within six months. He declared that America would be “the crypto capital of the planet”. The order backed “lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins” to bolster the greenback’s dominance among conventional currencies.\n\nTighter oversight is not all bad for stablecoins, facilitating interest from mainstream financial institutions. Stripe, a payments giant, has bought Bridge, a stablecoin-infrastructure startup. Visa has built a platform to help lenders issue coins; BBVA, Spain’s second-largest bank, will be among the first to use it, perhaps for money transfers.\n\nStablecoins have demonstrated their value in the backrooms of the Grand Bazaar. Their next task is to do so in the regulators’ offices and boardrooms of Washington, DC and Wall Street.","summary":"Policymakers are racing to catch up with the rapid rise of stablecoins — a version of cryptocurrency that rarely fluctuates, is backed by cash or government bonds and run on public blockchains.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/technology/bitcoin/the-economist-stablecoins-have-become-the-real-crypto-craze-c-17828303","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17828303/db577f4489c87d5428577a2796a946f44032fb08-16x9-x0y277w3213h1807.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 00:57:11","author":"William Pearce","authors":["William Pearce"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":293621408,"title":"The triple threats facing Germany’s incoming leader","text":"Germany’s most pro-American leader in its history will take control of the government at a time when he faces three challenges: keeping a nation unified, strengthening Europe’s defences and keeping the alliance with the United States from fraying further.\n\nAt face value, any one of those tasks is monumental.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.\n\n“As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,” according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The Associated Press.\n\nAt the same time, the agency said it was beginning a reduction in force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based staffers. That means many of the Washington-based staffers who are being placed on leave would soon have their positions eliminated.\n\nThe Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco, has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers and families abroad.\n\nUSAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following an effort to freeze all foreign assistance. Trump and Musk contend that USAID’s work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.\n\nLawsuits by government workers’ unions, USAID contractors and others say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without lawmakers’ approval.\n\nThe Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that aid and development work overseas serves national security by stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances.\n\nThe notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past week, according to copies that AP viewed.\n\nThe blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted.\n\nA different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID has temporarily blocked the foreign funding freeze and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said Sunday that it was&#160;placing all&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: 2,000 USAID workers to be terminated by the Trump administration with others placed on leave first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/2000-usaid-workers-to-be-terminated-by-the-trump-administration-with-others-placed-on-leave/","image":"https://www.cbs42.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2025/02/AP25038773235472-e1740351616962.jpg?w=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 00:55:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":293620930,"title":"Alarming sight at Bondi Beach in Sydney","text":"Alarming sight at Bondi Beach in Sydney\n\nREAD MORE: Australian of the Year goes on an explosive online tirade\n\nBy MAX AITCHISON, POLITICAL REPORTER FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 00:35 GMT, 24 February 2025 | Updated: 00:42 GMT, 24 February 2025\n\nA convoy of pro-Russian vehicles drove along Bondi Beach with a police escort on Sunday, as both Labor and the Coalition condemn Vladimir Putin on the anniversary of his invasion of Ukraine. \n\nThe convoy of up to six vehicles, including utes, motorbikes and a military truck, was spotted driving slowly along Campbell Parade, the road running parallel with Australia's most famous beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs. \n\nA sign on the back of the military truck said 'Defenders of the Fatherland Day' in Russian, which has been celebrated every year on February 23 since 1918.\n\nIt marks the moment during the Russian Civil War when thousands of workers joined the Red Army to fight the German Kaiser's advancing troops.\n\nBut, in a not-so-subtle nod to the invasion of Ukraine, the larger vehicles in the convoy were emblazoned with 'Z' symbols, which is widely used as a propaganda symbol in support of the war. \n\nIt is regularly seen on Russian tanks and other military vehicles and the Russian Ministry of Defence said it was an abbreviation meaning 'for victory'.\n\nThe celebration of the Defenders of the Fatherland Day comes just a day before the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\nNSW Police said officers were 'in attendance to ensure traffic compliance/minimise traffic disruption' and that there were no incidents or arrests.\n\nThe convoy of up to six vehicles, including utes, motorbikes and a military truck, was spotted driving slowly with a police escort along Campbell Parade, the road running parallel with Australia's most famous beach in Sydney 's eastern suburbs (pictured)\n\nIt is regularly seen on Russian tanks and other military vehicles (pictured) and the Russian Ministry of Defence said it was an abbreviation meaning 'for victory' \n\nOne bemused onlooker was shocked to see a pro-Russian convoy in Australia.\n\n'I'm Russian, and I'm truly sorry for those people,' they said.\n\n'It brings me a lot of shame, to the point that I even never tell people where I'm actually from because I'm so ashamed of where I was born, that hellhole and people like them.'\n\n'They’re a disgrace and 100 per cent of them are idiots,' a second said.\n\n'Why is anyone even here if they think their motherland is so awesome -

Merz, who has no previous experience in office, is set to become chancellor with Europe's largest economy ailing, its society split over migration and its security caught between a confrontational U.S. and an assertive Russia and China. After the collapse of incumbent Olaf Scholz's unloved coalition, Merz, 69, must forge a coalition from a fragmented parliament in a process that could take months. His conservative bloc and other mainstream parties rule out working with the AfD, a party which has been endorsed by U.S. figures including billionaire Elon Musk. Merz took aim at the U.S. in blunt remarks after his victory, criticising the ultimately outrageous comments flowing from Washington during the campaign, comparing them to hostile interventions from Russia. So we are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now is to achieve unity in Europe. It is possible to create unity in Europe, he told a roundtable with other leaders. Merz's broadside against the U.S. came despite President Donald Trump welcoming the conservative victory. Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration, that has prevailed for so many years, Trump wrote on Truth Social. Hitherto seen as an atlanticist, Merz said Trump had shown his administration to be largely indifferent to the fate of Europe . Merz's absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can achieve real independence from the USA step by step , he added. He even ventured to ask whether the next summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which has underpinned Europe's security for decades, would still see NATO in its current form . Following a campaign roiled by violent attacks for which people of migrant background were arrested, the conservative CDU/CSU bloc won 28.5% of the vote, followed by the AfD with 20.5%, said a projection published by ZDF broadcaster at 9:46 p.m. (2046 GMT). The AfD, which looks set to double its score from the previous vote and saw Sunday's result as just the beginning. Our hand remains outstretched to form a government, leader Alice Weidel told supporters, adding next time we'll come first. MERZ'S JUGGLING ACT Merz is heading into coalition talks without a strong negotiating hand. While his CDU/CSU emerged as the largest bloc, it scored its second worst post-war result. It remains unclear whether Merz will need one or two partners to form a majority, with the fate of smaller parties unclear in a way that could jumble parliamentary arithmetic. A three-way coalition would likely be much more unwieldy, hampering Germany's ability to show clear leadership. Chancellor Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) tumbled to their worst result since World War Two, with 16.5% of the vote share, and Scholz conceding a bitter result, according to the ZDF projection, while the Greens were on 11.9%. Strong support particularly from younger voters pushed the far-left Die Linke party to 8.7% of the vote. The pro-market Free Democrats (FDP) and newcomer Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) party hovered around the 5% threshold to enter parliament. Voter turnout at 83% was the highest since before reunification in 1990, according to exit polls. Male voters tended more towards the right, while female voters showed stronger support for leftist parties. A three-party coalition runs the risk of more muddling through and more stagnation unless all parties involved realise that this is the last chance to bring change and to prevent the AfD from getting stronger, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. As long as the new government does not bring significant change, foreign investments will also be held back, weakening Germany's economic outlook. CARETAKER SCHOLZ A brash economic liberal who has shifted the conservatives to the right, Merz is considered the antithesis of former conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel, who led Germany for 16 years. Merz conditionally supports equipping Ukraine with longer-range Taurus missiles, a step Scholz's government shied away from, and sees Europe as firmly anchored in NATO. Sunday's election came after the collapse last November of Scholz's coalition of his SPD, the Greens and pro-market FDP in a row over budget spending. Lengthy coalition talks could leave Scholz in a caretaker role for months, delaying urgently needed policies to revive the German economy after two consecutive years of contraction and as companies struggle against global rivals. A delay would also create a leadership vacuum in the heart of Europe even as it deals with a host of challenges such as Trump threatening a trade war and attempting to fast-track a ceasefire deal for Ukraine without European involvement. Germans are more pessimistic about their living standards now than at any time since the financial crisis in 2008. Attitudes towards migration have also hardened, a profound shift in German public sentiment since its Refugees Welcome culture during Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, that the AfD has both driven and harnessed.","summary":"Germany's conservatives won the national election, placing Friedrich Merz in a difficult position as chancellor.

But when pressed on the subject in an interview with Fox News Radio on Friday, he acknowledged that Moscow had indeed invaded Ukraine on the order of Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin.\n\n“Russia attacked,” Trump admitted, but added that somehow Ukraine “shouldn’t have let him attack.”\n\nMany were surprised that the “Deal-Maker-in-Chief”, as Trump’s cabinet calls him, whose casinos and resorts have filed for bankruptcy six times between 1991 and 2009 (asking US taxpayers to help him out with his $916 million in losses) would cede ground on this one, but there were some important news items that led to the softening on Trump’s stance.\n\nFor one, Zelensky has been making overtures to the US president that we would hold elections in his country, even though it has been under martial law since the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022 and that millions of voters have had to flee to neighboring counties, and even the US.\n\n“If there is peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready,” Zelensky said over the weekend. “I can exchange it for NATO,” said Zelensky, who has urged that Ukraine be granted NATO membership as part of any agreement to end the war, but the US-led alliance has been hesitant to commit.\n\nFor another, Zelensky has been warming to the idea of an equitable deal on mineral rights, after turning down previous offers to sign away to the US half of the proceeds of Ukraine’s mined “rare earths” as part of any peace deal with Russia, without any guarantees of US security.\n\n “We’re signing an agreement, hopefully in the next fairly short period of time,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about a possible deal for Ukraine’s minerals.\n\nZelensky said on Friday that “I am hoping for a fair result.”\n\nSpeaking before those remarks on Friaday, at an event at the White House, Trump was still critical of Zelensky.\n\n“I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,” Trump said. “They don’t have any cards, but they’re playing tough.”","summary":"Speaking to Fox News radio just before the weekend, Trump puts his tail between his legs and admits Putin started the war, adding Ukraine doesn’t ‘have any cards, but they’re playing tough.’","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/47683","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/02/20/386983a480bbf1ce30d81820c5ff67a3.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 00:16:46","author":"Kyiv Post","authors":["Kyiv Post"],"language":"en","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.451},{"id":293623122,"title":"No comfort in rebased inflation figures","text":"STICKING to its promise, the National Bureau of Statistics announced Nigeria’s rebased inflation data on February 18. The headline inflation rate was revised downwards to 24.48 per cent in January from 34.80 per cent in December. This is a huge difference.\n\nIt follows the long-awaited rebasing of the Consumer Price Index, with a new base year and updated weighting of the composite baskets.\n\nWhile this recalibration was long overdue, it created the illusion that inflation had cooled significantly.\n\nA closer inspection of the figures reveals a glaring disparity between statistical adjustments and the lived experiences of ordinary citizens.\n\nThe rebasing with a base year of January 2024 is nothing short of feel-good economics and blatantly deceptive.\n\nIt attempts to erase the punishing inflationary effects of the petrol subsidy removal; naira free float and electricity tariff hikes implemented by the Bola Tinubu administration.\n\nThese policies have triggered skyrocketing food and transportation costs, escalated energy costs for households and businesses, and forced the recent 50 per cent hike in telecom tariffs.\n\nA more accurate reading could have been derived from setting 2023 as the base year.\n\nFood inflation supposedly fell to 26.08 per cent down from 39.84 per cent under the new methodology. However, this sanitised figure does not reflect the burdens families face in the market, where prices of basic staples have more than quadrupled and remain out of reach for many.\n\nA crate of eggs that cost N1,000 in 2023 is now N7,000 in urban communities. The government cannot ‘rebase’ hunger.\n\nBusinesses have not been spared. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria reported a record N1.4 trillion in unsold inventories by the end of 2024 as inflation eroded demand for manufactured goods.\n\nWhile the recalibration of Nigeria’s inflation basket aligns with global statistical best practices, which prescribe recurrent five-year adjustments, its timing is questionable.\n\nThe NBS shifted the base year from 2009 to 2024 and expanded the consumer basket from 740 to 960 items, claiming this adjustment reflects today’s consumption habits better. Yet, such technical changes do little to address the systemic factors driving high prices.\n\nIn this context, the rebasing of the inflation data appears more like statistical legerdemain than a reflection of improved economic conditions.\n\nIn 2024, the NBS unemployment figures suddenly dropped below 5.0 per cent compared with 56.1 per cent for unemployment and underemployment as of 2022 due to a change in the calculation methodology.\n\nThe NBS chose 2019 as the new base year, replacing 2010, for calculating Nigeria’s GDP which analysts estimate will then cross the $800 billion threshold.\n\nRegardless, the rebasing is significant and designed to reflect current spending patterns due to changes in income levels, urbanisation, and technological advancements.\n\nThe weighting of baskets was adjusted with “food and non-alcoholic beverages” dropping from 51.80 per cent to 40.00 per cent; “housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels” downgraded from 16.70 per cent to 8.40 per cent.\n\n“Transport” was upgraded from 6.50 per cent to 10.70 per cent while “restaurants and accommodation services” was upgraded from 1.20 per cent to 12.90 per cent to reflect rising rent, transport costs, and more people eating out in urban settings.\n\nAnalysts agree the new methodology and updated weights will ensure better inflation tracking. Policymakers can use the updated CPI data to adjust interest rates, wage policies, and social interventions. Businesses can use the refined inflation data to review pricing strategies, production planning, and investment decisions.\n\nHowever, this is not a moment for self-adulation. Even if inflation dropped to 24 per cent, other African peers are doing better.\n\nSouth Africa and Kenya recorded an inflation rate of 3.0 per cent in December. Neighbouring Benin recorded just 0.60 per cent inflation in January.\n\nThe real condition millions of Nigerians find themselves in is being unable to afford necessities.\n\nThe key inflation triggers viz: the collapse of the naira against the dollar from N480 in May 2023 to N1,500 today; five-fold hike in petrol prices; over 300 per cent hike in electricity (Band A) tariff, and the recent 50 per cent telecom tariff hike have combined to ensure that misery is a daily staple for 133 million Nigerians or 62.9 per cent of the population classified as multidimensionally poor.\n\nThe CPI rebasing is no shortcut to achieving Tinubu’s 15 per cent inflation target for 2025. That road must be paved with fiscal restraint, ramping up oil production, naira appreciation at the forex market, significant FDI inflows, and investment in critical infrastructure.\n\nThe CBN, which has implemented monetary tightening measures with limited impact retained the Monetary Policy Rate at 27.50 per cent at Thursday’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting as expected to pause six consecutive hikes by a cumulative 875 basis points seen in 2024. This reflects its confidence in the rebased inflation numbers.\n\nYet inflationary pressures linger. Expansionary government spending has yet to abate under Tinubu.\n\nMoney supply surged by 51 per cent year-on-year to N108.96 trillion in November, driven by increased government domestic borrowing. The N54.9 trillion 2025 budget is double that of 2024 but N14.3 trillion was allocated to debt servicing while the fiscal deficit stands at N13 trillion.\n\nNigeria’s debt surged to N142 trillion as of the third quarter of 2024, up 5.97 per cent from N134.3 trillion three months earlier.\n\nNigeria cannot rely on rebasing to present an illusion of progress and risk misleading domestic stakeholders and international observers. The Tinubu administration must address the root causes of inflation rather than masking real economic pain with optimistic numbers.\n\nThis means doubling down on structural reforms beginning with massive investments in agriculture. A comprehensive rural roads initiative must complement this effort to facilitate the evacuation of products, access to extension services, and expertise, and boost security in agricultural belts.\n\nIt remains a mystery why Tinubu has refused to implement the 150-day food import tariff suspension announced in July 2024 aimed at taming food inflation.\n\nThe power sector should be prioritised to reduce manufacturing costs and boost investments, competitiveness, and job creation. Investment in education and health will foster a more productive and skilled workforce needed by emerging industries.\n\nManufacturers need special consideration for support with targeted tariff waivers for machinery and certain inputs.\n\nThe government must ramp up oil production to the COVID-19 era level of 2.2 million bpd to boost forex earnings and ensure crude availability for local refiners to end fuel imports and associated forex leakages. Regulators must ensure that cooling oil prices and the recent naira appreciation benefit consumers at the pump.\n\nCrucially, the government needs to demonstrate fiscal discipline to curb wastage and ensure value for money in the planning and execution of projects.\n\nThe N23.4 trillion allocated for 2025 capital projects must be felt conspicuously nationwide.\n\nThe National Assembly must rise above self-seeking considerations and closely monitor government expenditure across all MDAs.\n\nTinubu should take a cue from US President Donald Trump and subsume base politics in favour of government efficiency by streamlining MDAs in line with the Oronsaye Report.\n\nPolicymakers should acknowledge the limitations of statistical adjustments and focus on delivering meaningful reforms.\n\nNigerians deserve a government that addresses economic hardships head-on, rather than one that seeks illusory comfort behind rebased figures.","summary":"STICKING to its promise, the National Bureau of Statistics announced Nigeria’s rebased inflation data on February 18.

How the to-be-Chancellor of Germany fell in love with politics at school - and almost walked away from it all together 20 years ago... but didn't","text":"With his party topping Germany's snap election poll, Friedrich Merz looks set to fulfil his lifelong ambition of becoming Chancellor of Germany. \n\nIt hasn't been an easy road for Merz to reach this point.\n\nThe politician turned banker looked as though his chance of leading Germany had passed when he left politics altogether nearly 20 years ago following a bitter power struggle between himself and Angela Merkel. \n\nBut in a remarkable political comeback the 69-year-old now looks as though he is in touching distance of the chancellory after his party, the CDU, secured 29 per cent of the vote in the February 23 election. \n\nBorn in 1955 in what was then West Germany, Merz took an earlier interest in politics. \n\nA staunch anti communist he joined the conservative CDU's youth wing when he was still in school. \n\nAfter a brief sting in the army he studied to become a lawyer before he settled on a career as a politician. \n\nIn 1989 he was elected as a member of the European Parliament and five years later he won a seat in the Bundestag where he quickly established himself as a leading member of the CDU's more right leaning pro-business wing. \n\nHe also developed a close relationship with Wolfgang Schäuble - who led the party in the German parliament from 1991 to 2000 - which put him in good step to become the CDU's candidate for chancellor in a future election.\n\nHowever, in a power struggle that ensued between Merz and Merkel for leadership of the party it was Merkel and her more centrist allies who came out on top. \n\nAfter which Merz took a backseat in German politics seeing no role for himself in Merkel's CDU and he later went on to criticise Merkel's leadership of the party slamming it as 'idle'. It is widely known the pair were never on the best of terms.\n\nMerz then left parliament in 2009 and instead went into the private sector first as a lawyer again while also taking the helm of Atlantik-Brücke, a lobby advocating transatlantic ties.\n\nHe then sat on a series of corporate boards which he claimed provided him valuable experience outside of politics and also led to the father-of-three becoming a reputed multimillionaire.\n\nWhen Merkel announced she was leaving politics in 2018 Merz saw an opportunity to return to politics. \n\nRunning on a right-wing platform, he failed to win the leadership of the party on two attempts. However, following the party's bruising defeat in the 2021 election, which ended nearly 20 years of uninterrupted government, Merz finally won leadership of his party.\n\nAs leader of the CDU, Merz has tried to stop the bleed of votes to the far-right AfD by moving the party's positions away from the centrism which defined the Merkel government. \n\nOn migration he has ditched the Merkel era policy of allowing millions of refugees from Syria and elsewhere to settle in Germany. \n\nEarlier this year he was condemned by other politicians - including Merkel - for voting with the AfD on an immigration bill breaking the so-called firewall in German politics where moderate parties refuse to work with the far-right.\n\nSince the last election the once mighty German economy, which steered the EU through the Euro crisis, has stagnated since the start of the Ukraine war with Scholz's government struggling to revitalise Europe's largest economy. \n\nIn the hope reviving Germany's economic fortune, Merz has hinted he could remove the 'debt brake' which strictly caps how much Berlin can borrow.\n\nIf he relaxes the policy it could open funds for investment in the country's creaking infrastructure which was once the envy of the world but has suffered from lack of funding for decades. \n\nA self-described Atlanticist, who claims to have visited America over 100 times, Merz seems slightly miscast for the current era which have become frosty since Trump returned to the White House. \n\nMerz criticised Trump for blaming Ukraine for the war and went as far as to claim Trump 'doesn't care about Europe'. \n\nSpeaking on a TV panel after the exit poll he said: 'I would've never thought I would need to say something like this on television, but after Donald Trump's statements last week it's clear: this American government doesn't care for Europe.'\n\nMerz now faces the task of building a coalition government which could take weeks if not months with Merz saying the negotiations could go on until Easter.\n\nHe has ruled out a coalition with the AfD. The most expected outcome of this election is a coalition of Merz's CDU with the SPD in an uneasy 'grand coalition.'\n\nOther coalition options include the 'Kenya coalition' - named for the colours on the Kenyan flag, which could see the Greens join the government.\n\nOr if the FDP enter parliament they might form a government with the CDU and Greens in a so-called 'Jamaica coalition'. \n\nAway from his career and politics, Merz has been married to his wife Charlotte Gass since 1981 and the couple have three children. \n\nMerz is also a keen aviator and Mrs Merz reportedly stopped him from buying a private jet until his children had moved. \n\nHe now reportedly owns two.","summary":"With his party topping Germany's snap election poll, Friedrich Merz looks set to fulfil his lifelong ambition of becoming Chancellor of Germany.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14427863/Who-Friedrich-Merz-Chancellor-Germany-politics.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/23/23/95502223-0-image-m-43_1740355051099.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 00:02:40","author":"Ed Holt,Editor","authors":["Ed Holt","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":293614802,"title":"Trump uses meme to mock federal workers after outcry over DOGE email asking what they 'accomplished' last week","text":"Trump uses Spongebob Squarepants meme to mock federal workers after outcry over DOGE email asking what they 'accomplished' last week\n\nPODCAST: All the biggest news and insider gossip from the Trump administration – listen to Welcome to MAGAland here\n\nBy MELISSA KOENIG FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 23:52 GMT, 23 February 2025 | Updated: 23:53 GMT, 23 February 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump invoked Spongebob Squarepants to mock federal employees who are outraged by a Department of Government Efficiency email asking what they 'accomplished' over the course of the week.\n\nThe commander-in-chief took to his Truth Social platform on Sunday to share an edited screenshot from the Nickelodeon cartoon, showing the titular yellow sponge pondering over a notepad with a pencil in his hand.\n\nThe second image showed a list entitled 'Got done last week' and included items like 'cried about Trump,' 'cried about Elon' and 'made it to the office for once.'\n\nTrump's post came as DOGE chief Elon Musk defended his late Saturday night email to all federal employees, asking them to list five things they did this week.\n\nIt was sent by the Office of Personnel Management's human resources department, and gave federal workers a deadline of Monday at 11:59 p.m. EST to send back their explanation of work.\n\nMusk said in a post to X that if workers fail or refuse to respond it would be 'taken as a resignation.' \n\nSome federal employees have since claimed the emails are 'harassment' and say the requirement to justify their weekly tasks amounts to a 'hostile work environment.'\n\n'This is the ultimate d**k boss move from Musk - except he isn't even the boss, he's just a d**k,' Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) posted in response to the directive from Trump's 'first buddy.' \n\nPresident Donald Trump invoked Spongebob Squarepants to mock federal employees who are outraged by a Department of Government Efficiency email asking what they 'accomplished' over the course of the week\n\nThe commander-in-chief took to his Truth Social platform on Sunday to share an edited screenshot from the Nickelodeon cartoon\n\n'It feels like harassment, especially sending it out on a Saturday and boasting about it in advance on X so that everyone could be checking their email [that] afternoon in anticipation of its arrival,' another federal employee told Business Insider. \n\nA third, who works for the Centers for Disease Control, said they 'can only imagine how many people they'll fire based on the responses/non-responses to this.'\n\nSeveral unions representing federal workers have even objected to the email, with the National Treasury Employees Union calling it 'yet another attempt by the administration to scare hardworking civil servants who deliver for the American people every day.'\n\nIn a letter on Sunday, the American Federation of Government Employees also argued that the email 'fails to identify any legal authority permitting OPM to demand the requested information.\n\n'Federal employees report to their respective agencies through their established chains of command; they do not report to OPM,' the letter says.\n\n'The email was nothing more than an irresponsible and sophomoric attempt to create confusion and bully the hard-working federal employees that serve our country.\n\n'By issuing this directive, OPM is actively pulling federal employees away from their critical duties without regard for the consequences,' it added.\n\n'As just two examples: a VA surgeon's attention belongs in the operating room and an air traffic controller's attention on keeping the skies safe, not on dealing with this unclear and unlawful distraction.\n\n'The request and the resulting confusion is not just inappropriate - it is disruptive to essential government functions,' the union argued. \n\nElon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has called his request 'a trivial task,' and noted that his DOGE workers have already received a 'large number of good responses'\n\nNewly-appointed FBI Director Kash Patel has even urged agents to 'pause any responses' until the bureau can come up with a coordinated response.\n\n'All FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,' he wrote in an email obtained by NBC News. \n\n'The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,' he said.\n\n'When and if information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.'\n\nSupervisors at the Department of Justice similarly told employees to leave Musk's email unanswered while they await further clarity on the situation, Newsweek reports.\n\nAt the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - which houses the National Weather Service, some managers initially cautioned against replying to the email, apparently thinking it was a phishing attempt.\n\nOne NOAA employee even told WIRED they were cautioned not to log onto their work email after receiving it.\n\nThe email came from the human resources department at the Office of Personnel Management\n\nBut Musk has called his request 'a trivial task,' and noted that his DOGE workers have already received a 'large number of good responses.'\n\n'These are the people who should be considered for promotion,' he insisted.\n\nNonprofit President of Brownstone Institute Jeffrey Tucker also said the email from DOGE 'is completely conventional in the service industry when there's new management.'\n\n'It is only causing screams and panics because it is government,' he added.\n\nAnother post Musk highlighted on his X account detailed how the task to detail their accomplishments from the week is common in the 'private sector.'\n\n'It's standard practice to report what you've accomplished to your manager,' Ana Mostarac posted. 'And if you've been a manager, you know how crucial it is to clarify expectations and priorities on a regular cadence.'\n\n'Now, government sector employees are being asked to do the same,' she continued. 'The request is being labeled 'harassment' and described as creating a 'hostile work environment,' with some even suggesting a class action lawsuit for 'undue stress and financial harm.'\n\n'Why should government sector employees be held to a different standard?

war.’\n\nToday marks three years since Putin ordered his army to invade Ukraine, beginning the deadliest war in Europe since World War II.\n\nAnalysis by BBC News found that more than 95,000 soldiers have died on the Russian side – though the figure is likely significantly higher – and the Ukrainian military death toll is likely around 70,000.\n\nThousands of Ukrainian civilians have also been killed by Putin’s troops or in strikes on cities and towns.\n\nThe total package of military, economic and humanitarian support provided by the UK since the full-scale invasion took place in 2022 adds up to £12.8 billion, according to government figures.\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous

the latest move was made as ‘Kremlin-linked elites can pose a real and present danger to our way of life’. \n\nThey added: ‘They denounce our values in public while enjoying the benefits of the UK in

negotiating table is critical not only for them, but for the security of the UK. \n\n‘These new measures send a powerful message that we will do what it takes to turn the tables on Putin’s

without demanding any concessions from them in return.\n\nUkraine itself has largely been sidelined in the negotiations, and the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth effectively binned the notion of Kyiv regaining control of its previous territory before the talks began.\n\nAmid concerns over his approach to dealing with Russia, Trump stunned European leaders by attacking Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and describing him as a ‘dictator without elections’.\n\nLater this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will travel to Washington DC for a meeting with President Trump where he is expected

Ukraine","text":"Ireland’s premier will attend a meeting of world leaders organised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss Ukraine.\n\nThe online meeting is being held on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and amid fragile relations between the US and Europe after Donald Trump launched an extraordinary verbal attack on Mr Zelensky last week.\n\nThe US president called Ukraine’s leader a “dictator” and appeared to accuse Ukraine of starting the war.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said he would reiterate to Mr Zelensky Ireland’s “continued steadfast support” for Ukraine.\n\n“This is also an important opportunity to discuss with partners and with President Zelensky how we can ensure a just, sustainable and durable peace, in keeping with the principles of the UN Charter.\n\n“I will also underline our continued strong support for Ukraine’s accession to the EU and argue that an important way to help guarantee Ukraine’s future security is to accelerate the process of joining the EU.\n\n“At this very difficult and uncertain moment for the people of Ukraine, this will also send a strong message of our support and our adherence to the position that Ukraine is part of our European family.\n\n“I will make clear that Ireland stands ready to do all we can to support a just and lasting peace, which is not only crucial for Ukraine but also for the security of Europe.”\n\nThe meeting is taking place after talks between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nMr Zelensky has said his country will not accept any outcome from talks that have taken place between Moscow and Washington since Kyiv was excluded from the discussions.\n\nThe Irish Government has said there cannot be a just or sustainable peace that excludes Ukraine or Europe.\n\nIreland’s leaders have also said it is too soon to talk about sending Irish peacekeepers to Ukraine, and Ireland’s deputy premier Simon Harris said: “I don’t think we can buy into the premise that there’s a peace process under way.”\n\nHowever Mr Harris, Ireland’s foreign affairs and defence minister, is to present proposals to Cabinet to change Ireland’s “triple lock” system for deploying soldiers on peacekeeping, crisis management and evacuation missions.\n\nCabinet in April approved to amend the triple-lock system, which opposition politicians had warned could threaten Ireland’s neutrality.\n\nThe Defence Bill will set out a proposal to remove a veto held by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council – the US, Russia, China, France and the UK – over the deployment of Irish peacekeepers abroad, in the event where it has been approved by the Irish Government and the Irish Parliament’s lower house.\n\nCurrently, Ireland cannot deploy any more than 12 Defence Forces peacekeepers overseas without the mission being approved by a UN Security Council vote.\n\nPre-legislative scrutiny of the amendment by the foreign affairs committee will be required as part of the proposed change.\n\nMr Harris said: “By making the changes proposed, we would be removing the veto power of Security Council members over Ireland’s international engagement, while safeguarding the essential link with international law and good governance.\n\n“Such a change would permit us to continue Ireland’s peacekeeping record, of which we are so justifiably proud.”\n\nHe added: “I want to be clear that in bringing forward these proposals I have no desire to alter Ireland’s policy of military neutrality. What we are proposing would remain fully consistent with the principles of the UN Charter and international law.\n\n“This will do nothing to change Ireland’s traditional position of military neutrality, which is characterised by Ireland’s non-participation in any military alliance.\n\n“This is also not in any way shape or form an attempt to disengage from the UN. Instead it allows Ireland to seek to improve the UN from within.”\n\nIreland has had no peacekeeping mission approved by the UN since 2014.","summary":"It comes after a tumultuous week in politics for Ukrainian and European security.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-micheal-martin-european-irish-government-b1212814.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/24/00/170233c821722a30d2c6791970d27760Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQwMzk3MzQx-2.67762231.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 00:01:00","author":"By Grinne N.

My message to Putin’s friends in Moscow is simple: you are not welcome in the UK.”\n\nDavid Lammy will also announce today a huge raft of sanctions targeting Russia to mark the third anniversary of its brutal invasion of Ukraine. The Foreign Secretary promised at the weekend it would be \"the largest package of sanctions against Russia since the early days of the war\".\n\n It comes as Keir Starmer prepares to jet to Washington DC this week for his first face-to-face talks with Donald Trump since he returned to the Oval office. The Kremlin's bloody invasion of Ukraine is expected to be at the top of the agenda for the high-stakes meeting. \n\nSpeaking on Sunday, Mr Starmer insisted talks about ending the war must not take place without Ukraine at the table after the US and Russia kick-started negotiations without Kyiv. The PM said first-hand experience of visiting the war-torn country had made him \"more determined to stand up for Ukraine\".\n\n Speaking at the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow, he said: \"Nobody wants the bloodshed to continue, least of all the Ukrainians. But after everything that they have suffered, after everything they have fought for, there can be no discussion about Ukraine without Ukraine, and the people of Ukraine must have a long-term, secure future.\" \n\nCabinet Minister Bridget Phillipson also declined to be drawn on whether the PM will set out a timeline for the UK to reach 2.5% of defence spending this week.\n\nBut with Mr Trump pushing for NATO allies to hike spending, she told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"We know we've got to increase defence spending. We know that as a nation, alongside our European allies, we have got to play a bigger role in defence.\"\n\n It also follows a war of words between the US President and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, who Mr Trump bizarrely branded a \"dictator\" last week. At a rally at the weekend Mr Trump moaned it was not \"fair\" that US tax dollars were paying for Ukraine's defence - vowing to \"get our money back.\"\n\nThe US President also repeated his claim Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if he'd been in the White House at the time. And he seethed: \"It affects Europe... It doesn't affect us.\"\n\nMr Trump told his supporters he would claw back hundreds of billions in dollars. \"There was no way Russia was going to go in\" if he had been President, he claimed. \"And they went in for a lot of reasons.\"\n\nHe said: \"I'm dealing with President Zelensky, I'm dealing with President Putin. Europe gave $100m. America gave $350m. I'm trying to get the money back. $350, because we had a stupid administration.\"","summary":"The Home Office said those who could be barred from entering the UK include anyone giving 'significant support' to Moscow or who owe their wealth to the Russian state","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/putin-cronies-face-ban-entering-34733977","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34733994.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_RUSSIA-POLITICS-DEFENCE.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 00:01:00","author":"Ashley Cowburn,Mikey Smith","authors":["Ashley Cowburn","Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":293620174,"title":"Billionaires' wealth 'soars by over £230billion in first month of 2025 alone'","text":"Billionaires' wealth soared by over $300billion (£237billion) in the first month of the year alone, new research shows today.\n\nCampaigners calling for higher taxes on the world's super-rich said this is more than the combined wealth of the poorest 2.8billion people globally.

He's earned the accolades for his unique brand of meticulously researched political humor. His Sunday night show, \"Last Week Tonight,\" is now in its 12th season on HBO, giving him a perch to unleash searing, satirical takes on America, his adopted homeland. So how did a British-born, middle-class, grade school cut up become one of this country's sharpest comedians? We traveled near and far to find out.This past summer, we returned with John Oliver to his comedic launching pad – Edinburgh, Scotland, where modern life is set against a medieval backdrop. Bill Whitaker: So tell me about this place.John Oliver: Well, as you can see, this is controlled mayhem.Every August, the city hosts the world's largest performing arts festival — a month-long free-for-all known as the Fringe. Artists from 60 countries perform nearly 4,000 shows. No act is turned away.John Oliver: Some of it will be great. Some of it will be otherworldly bad. But the fact that the two can exist concurrently is kind of the point.The fringe is a magnet for comedians. As a 20-year-old studying English at Cambridge University, John Oliver felt the pull. He went and tried his hand at stand up.John Oliver: And I remember walking offstage thinking, \"Oh boy, I wanna do that again right now.\" Bill Whitaker: Almost sounds like it's addictive.John Oliver: Oh it's-- absolutely addictive. He came back year after year and headed to the Royal Mile, a picturesque cobblestone street that turns into a competitive marketplace for attention. Bill Whitaker: Were you doing this?John Oliver: I was absolutely doing this. When you're first coming up here, the only way to do it is to almost beg for people to come and see you. He doesn't have to beg people any more. He was welcomed with open arms at this basement club where he cut his comedic teeth. John Oliver (during stand-up): I want you to know that I've befouled this stage so many times before, there's no guarantee this will go well.He told us he learns from his mistakes and, starting out, he made a lot of them. John Oliver: It's the best place– But nowhere worse than at this tiny, 55-seat venue called Pleasance Below. John Oliver: This room was in many ways my comedic Waterloo.Bill Whitaker: Did you fill all the seats? John Oliver: All of this was empty-- apart from those four seats and I thought, \"Fine, that's fine. I can do an hour to four people.\" And that was my intention going in. (laughter)But his plans went awry. About 10 minutes in, two people walked out, then a third, leaving one woman … alone.John Oliver: I saw her hand slowly move down to her bag. And I said to her, \"Are you leaving?\" And she said, \"Yeah, I-- yeah, I think I'm going to.\" Got up, walked out and it's just me and a sound technician in the room. And he said, \"Do you wanna keep going.\" I-- I said, \"No, I think we're done here.\" And also when you say, \"Do you wanna keep going?\" \"Do you mean this show or this career? Certainly it feels like I've got some decisions to make.\"He decided to stop going for the easy laughs. John Oliver: When I started off I just wanted to make people laugh. Then I wanted to make people laugh about things I cared about. And for me that was politics in its broadest form. Bill Whitaker: Did it f-- feel like a risk at the time?John Oliver: It felt like a risk worth taking.And it worked. On his weekly HBO show taped in New York City, his unique take on politics and intrinsic problems is what sets him apart from just about every other comedian on TV.He delights in revealing the absurdity in the obscure — always, we noticed, with a twinkle in his eye, and a mischievous smile. John Oliver: Our main story tonight is the threat of nuclear annihilation.Bill Whitaker: You tackle topics: hospice care, bail reform, organ donations. It's not your typical comedy fare.John Oliver: No. I know those don't sound funny, but it's because fundamentally, they're not. But there are funny things about how entrenched some of those problems are. And sometimes I think comedy is the best, most illuminatin' way to talk about them. John Oliver has been making people laugh since he was a kid in the suburbs of Birmingham, England. His dad was a school principal, his mom a music teacher. Young John excelled as the class clown. Later, as a young comedian, he couldn't get enough of \"The Daily Show.\"So in 2006, he sent a sample of his work and was called in to try out. This is the audition tape. On Oliver's first trip to New York, he riffed with Jon Stewart about the time Vice President Dick Cheney shot and injured a friend on a quail hunt.John Oliver: I'm sure right now those birds are laughing maniacally at us in one of those little coveys of theirs.Jon Stewart: I don't- I don't- I don't think birds can- can laugh, John.John Oliver: Well, whatever it is that they do do then. Warble. Tweet. Coo. They're, they're they're coo-- they're cooing at us right now, Jon…He was hired on the spot and, over the next seven years, showed his range. In 2013, Jon Stewart stepped away to direct a movie, and tapped John Oliver to step in. Bill Whitaker: Was that kinda like taking daddy's car for a joyride?John Oliver: Oh yeah. That very first day the Edward Snowden news broke. And it was really fun to sit behind the steering wheel and think, \"Oh, how fast does this thing go?\" Oh, pretty quick, it turns out. His turn at the desk caught the eye of HBO, which gave him carte blanche to create his own show. He asked Tim Carvell, head writer at \"The Daily Show,\" and comedy producer Liz Stanton to join him. They were given the 11 o'clock slot on Sunday nights. Bill Whitaker: Did that seem like a gift or like they were-- hiding you someplace?Tim Carvell: No. I mean, we-- we were on after \"Game of Thrones.\" Like, it was -- like, it was more of a sense of, \"Oh, we-- we're going to let some people down.\"John Oliver: Yeah.But it's his take downs that seem to delight him the most. He pounced on news reports that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had not disclosed lavish gifts from rich friends and a generous deal on his prized motor coach.He offered Thomas a new motor coach, plus $1 million a year out of his own pocket if Thomas would resign from the Supreme Court.Thomas' lawyer says the justice met the terms of the RV agreement and any other omissions were strictly inadvertent.Bill Whitaker: You seem to have few limits-- on how far you'll go to get a laugh.John Oliver: With Clarence Thomas, the main point with that we're saying that there are not enough guardrails on people giving them money. I can prove that to you by offering this guy a million dollars a year to get the f**k off the Supreme Court. That should be a crime. The very fact that it isn't is a problem. And that felt like the most visceral way to prove that fact.Facts are fundamental to Oliver's humor.His deep dives into serious topics are painstakingly crafted.Bill Whitaker: I've seen your show described as satirical journalism, investigative comedy. How would you describe it?John Oliver: In general, it is just a rigorously researched comedy show-- both because we want it to be right, and for self-preservation purposes. We don't wanna be sued into oblivion.Oliver's staff of 83 includes former journalists as well as comedy writers. They churn out 30 shows a year. It starts with this: hundreds of pages of research on each main story. Oliver, Carvell, and the writers turn those into outlines and then a script, which is tested at a table read.John Oliver (During table read): I do not want to see a headline tomorrow that says John Oliver blasts expensive detention camps. On taping day, we watched them rehearse.John Oliver: But there are much more humane ways to do that and even–Make last minute changes, and get signoff from the lawyers. Finally, it's showtime.Liz Stanton: There's a little bit of bated breath when he says the – \"Tonight's story is.\" Like, you know, they've been waiting for maybe a year to come to the show. And they're gettin' a real dark one.John Oliver: Like you've lined up in the cold. You've maybe taken a flight, and you're being told, \"The main story is organ donation.\" It's like oh– Bill Whitaker: And this is my trip to New York.Liz Stanton: Yeah.John Oliver: That's right.Liz Stanton: Have a nice dinner.To balance things out, Oliver likes to close the show with something zany.The productions are Stanton's department. Liz Stanton: I try and do to my best ability anything we can do to make something happen just 'cause we love the dumb. The dumb stuff is stuff we all love to do. Bill Whitaker: Some of the-- segments are pretty elaborate. John Oliver: Yeah.Bill Whitaker: They can't be cheap.Liz Stanton: We don't talk about that.John Oliver: We don't talk about that. They'll never find out how much any of it costs. We're- we're cheaper than dragons. As far as we're concerned, that's the financial bar.Oliver has devoted fans and passionate critics. He takes aim at both sides of the aisle. Bill Whitaker: Last season, you told your viewers, \"Do not vote for--\"John Oliver: Yes.Bill Whitaker: --\"Donald Trump.\"John Oliver: Absolutely. I'm not gonna sit here and say that that is not a partisan thing to do, to say, \"Don't vote for Donald Trump.\" I think it's good advice. Bill Whitaker: But more than 77 million people voted for Donald Trump. Does your show speak to them?John Oliver: I really hope it speaks to some of them, yes, because most of those main stories that we talk about are not actually party political. Those are lasting problems that have been there before the last two or three presidents, and may well be there for-- after the next two or three.Though he highlights America's shortcomings, he told us he fell in love with this country as soon as he immigrated. He's now a U.S. citizen who fell for an Iraq War veteran. John Oliver: I married someone who's very American, yeah. She was a medic in the-- in the U.S. Army. And now we're married with two American kids.Bill Whitaker: You do love to poke fun at America. John Oliver: Yeah.Bill Whitaker: Does it trouble you that some people think that criticizing this place means you don't love it?John Oliver: Yeah. I mean, I just think that's utterly absurd. I think you can criticize something because you love it. Because you love it and you want it to get better. John Oliver: That's our show– He told us, in his personal life, he's risk averse. But when it comes to comedy, John Oliver loves to stir up trouble. Bill Whitaker: So if you were to look into your crystal ball, what's next?John Oliver: Other than-- living in the president's gulags in the future? That's what my crystal ball is showin' me right now. What's next? I've no idea. Hopefully, just more of this.Bill Whitaker: Keep doin' what you're doin'?John Oliver: Yeah. It's so fun. I can-- it's incredibly hard, not infrequently stressful, but it's really, really fun. As long as America has systemic problems, we'll be there poking fun at them.Produced by Marc Lieberman.

They are engaging in the very politicization and weaponization that they claim to be trying to eliminate.\"During her confirmation hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi, President Trump's new leader of the Justice Department, said she had no plans to politicize the office. Trump's history with the Justice DepartmentMr. Trump was the subject of Justice Department investigations in recent years during the Biden administration. Mr. Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi, who declined a 60 Minutes request for an interview, launched a review to scrutinize those in the Justice Department who were involved in prosecutions of Mr. Trump, including his indictment in the 2020 election case, and his indictment related to allegations he hid classified documents in his Mar-a-Lago estate. Those cases were dropped after Mr. Trump won the 2024 election. The prosecution was brought by Jack Smith, who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House. After consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, Smith said that \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"The Justice Department during Trump's second termOne of Mr. Trump's first actions after returning to the White House was the pardon of about 1,500 people in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The pardon proclamation called the January 6 prosecutions, \"a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.\" Not long after the ink was dry, letters of termination hit the Justice Department. The letters rewrote history, and echoed the words of the president, calling the Jan. 6 cases \"a grave national injustice.\"Sara Levine and Sean Brennan were federal prosecutors on the Justice Department's biggest investigation — the attack on the Capitol — until they were fired by the Trump administration on Jan. 31. They had both been hired about a year and a half ago to prosecute cases from the riot. While fear has silenced many in the department, Levine and Brennan chose to speak up. \"The Justice Department is under attack. They're coming after the people that want to uphold the laws that exist. And that should be terrifying to everyone,\" Levine said. Keisler, who served as acting attorney general in 2007 under then-President George Bush, said the pardons send a message. \"It says that you can commit some very serious crimes, but if you do so as an identifiable supporter of the president's agenda and political interests, you may be able to get off,\" Keisler said. \"And I think it was designed to send that message.\"That message also hit the FBI when Mr. Trump's acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, demanded the names of FBI personnel who had tracked down the Capitol rioters in 50 states. He also directed the firing of eight of the FBI's senior career executives.\"I do not believe that the current leadership of the Justice Department can trust these FBI employees to assist in implementing the President's agenda faithfully,\" Bove, who declined an interview with 60 Minutes, wrote of the FBI executives last month.Keisler said it is not the job of the FBI to implement the president's agenda. \"Both the FBI and the larger Justice Department, of which it's a part of, owe their duty to the law,\" Keisler said.Do presidents always clean house?What's happening now isn't business as usual with a new president in the White House, Keisler said.\"This is really unprecedented and it's important to understand why,\" Keisler said. \"Political appointees get removed and replaced by presidents all the time. This is the top layer of leadership. But beneath them in the core of the government are the civil servants. These are people who have developed expertise over often decades of experience working across administrations of both parties. And whose jobs are protected by civil service laws that have been on the books since the late 19th century.\"Keisler was a Republican until Mr. Trump's first term, when he switched to independent.\"Well, it's true that I've never voted for Donald Trump. My concern about the use of law enforcement to achieve political ends, that's among the reasons I've never voted for President Trump. But at the end of the day, people can support whatever candidate they want. I would hope that nearly everybody would agree as a basic matter that our criminal justice system shouldn't be used as a tool of politics to reward friends and punish personal enemies.\"Is the Justice Department being used to reward people?The appearance of \"rewarding friends\" has triggered the biggest rupture so far. It involves a bribery indictment against New York City Mayor Eric Adams — a charge Adams denies. Though he's a Democrat, Adams agreed to help Trump's deportation effort. This month, Bove ordered New York prosecutors to drop the bribery prosecution of Adams, in part, so that Adams could \"devote full attention\" to \"illegal immigration and violent crime.\"\"The directive to drop the charges against Mayor Adams was one of the most nakedly political documents out of the Justice Department I've ever seen,\" Keisler said. \"If Mayor Adams had instead been an opponent of the president's immigration agenda, then he would've been prosecuted. But because he says he wants to help advance the president's immigration agenda, he doesn't get prosecuted.\"Bove's order triggered resignations. Danielle Sassoon, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned. She refused to sign a motion to dismiss the case because it was, in her words, for \"no other reason than to influence Adams's mayoral decision-making.\"Bove shot back, writing, \"you have also strained, unsuccessfully, to suggest that some kind of quid pro quo arises from my directive. This is false.\"But a second Manhattan prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, also quit, telling Bove in a letter he would have to find someone who is \"enough of a fool, or enough of a coward\" to sign the motion. When Bove ordered prosecutors in Washington to sign the motion, six more resigned, bringing the total number of resignations to eight. \"[The resignations are] a flashing red light. Nobody gives up these jobs easily,\" Keisler said. \"But people have resigned because they are being otherwise commanded to perform unethical acts that they think are contrary to their responsibilities.\"This past week, Bove explained his motion to dismiss to a federal judge. There is no decision yet. Is the justice system in trouble?Keisler believes the justice system is in trouble.\"I think when you have a major political corruption prosecution dismissed because somebody has agreed to become a political ally of the president, you know, that tripwire has already been tripped,\" he said. For Levine, the fired prosecutor, the U.S. is \"teetering on the edge.\"Speaking up was not an easy decision for Levine or her fellow fired prosecutor, Brennan. But in the end, they believe silence may be the greatest threat to justice.\"I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't at least try to help people understand why what we've seen happening in the Department of Justice over the past few weeks is so critical and why it not only puts all Americans individually at risk,\" Brennan said. \"It really puts our constitutional governmental structure at risk.\"","summary":"The Department of Justice is in upheaval from firings and resignations in the first weeks of the Trump administration.

One senior leader describes a workplace of \"confusion\" and \"fear.\" The Justice Department wields enormous power through the FBI and federal prosecutors. It is critical to crime fighting and national security. But even more, the Justice Department is where Americans look for the rule of law. President Trump has been a target of its investigations during the Biden administration. Now, Trump says, his administration is cleaning up a Justice Department corrupted by politics. Fear has silenced many in the department. But two prosecutors we met, chose to speak up.Sara Levine: The Justice Department is under attack. They're coming after the people that want to uphold the laws that exist. And that should be terrifying to everyone. Sara Levine and Sean Brennan were federal prosecutors on the Justice Department's biggest investigation – the attack on the Capitol – until they were fired by the Trump administration January 31st. Scott Pelley: Why were you fired?Sara Levine: Because I did my job. I mean, it's really that simple, is, I went in. I followed the facts. I followed the law. And I got fired because I did exactly what I was supposed to do. Sean Brennan: I think we know what we did was right. No regrets, absolutely none. Sara Levine: What we did was justice. 'Justice' for 140 police officers wounded January 6th, 2021. Levine and Brennan were hired, about a year and a half ago, to prosecute cases from the riot.Scott Pelley: And in how many of your cases was the defendant acquitted?Sean Brennan: None. Sara Levine: None.Scott Pelley: Which tells you what?Sara Levine: The evidence was overwhelming.Overwhelming but, last month, the president pardoned even the most violent convicts —whom he calls by another name.President Trump (on Jan. 20, 2025, in the Oval Office): So this is January 6th, these are the hostages, approximately 1,500, for a pardon. Full pardon.Not long after the ink was dry, letters of termination hit the Justice Department. The letters rewrote history, calling the prosecution itself, in the words of the president, \"a grave national injustice.\"Sean Brennan: Anyone who has watched videos of what happened on January 6th, knows that the grave national injustice was not the decision to prosecute the rioters. The grave national injustice has been the Department of Justice turning its back on those law enforcement officers, those members of Congress, and all of those victims who were affected.Peter Keisler: This was a decision to protect people who had committed serious crimes because they were doing so in support of the president's reelection. To understand the Department of Justice, we went to one who knows it well. Peter Keisler served Republican presidents and was, himself, head of the Justice Department in 2007 as acting attorney general for George Bush. Peter Keisler: I don't think anybody believes that these people would've been pardoned if they had engaged in exactly the same acts, but had stormed the Capitol, say, in opposition to the president and his policies.Scott Pelley: What message does the president's pardon send?Peter Keisler: It says that you can commit some very serious crimes, but if you do so as an identifiable supporter of the president's agenda and political interests, you may be able to get off. And I think it was designed to send that message. A message that also hit the FBI. Trump's acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, demanded the names of about 5,000 FBI personnel who had tracked down the Capitol rioters in 50 states. He has encouraged agents to inform on one another. And he directed the firing of eight of the FBI's top executives, saying in part…Scott Pelley: \"I do not believe that the current leadership of the Justice Department can trust these FBI employees to assist in implementing the President's agenda faithfully.\" Is that the job of the FBI to implement the president's agenda?Peter Keisler: No. I mean, the president obviously has the prerogative to set the overall policies of the administration. But both the FBI and the larger Justice Department of which it's a part of owe their duty to the law. Scott Pelley: But someone might say, \"Well, isn't this what always happens? A new president comes in, the former people are wiped out, and new people are appointed.\"Peter Keisler: Not at all. This is really unprecedented and it's important to understand why. Political appointees get removed and replaced by presidents all the time. This is the top layer of leadership. But beneath them in the core of the government are the civil servants. These are people who have developed expertise over often decades of experience working across administrations of both parties. And whose jobs are protected by civil service laws that have been on the books since the late 19th century.Trump's new leader of the Justice Department is Attorney General Pam Bondi, former attorney general of Florida. She is a Trump loyalist who says that the Justice Department's prosecutions of the president were motivated by politics. Pam Bondi (on January 15, 2025, during a confirmation hearing): They targeted Donald Trump. They went after him. Actually, starting back in 2016, they targeted his campaign. They have launched countless investigations against him. That will not be the case if I am attorney general. I will not politicize that office. I will not target people simply because of their political affiliation. Justice will be administered even-handedly throughout this country. Bondi and Bove declined our request for interviews.Pam Bondi (on January 15, 2025, during a confirmation hearing): If confirmed I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components. The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.Having said that, Bondi launched a review to scrutinize those in the Justice Department who were involved in prosecutions of Donald Trump, including his indictment in the 2020 election case and his indictment for allegedly hiding classified documents in his home. Peter Keisler: I don't think anyone who's been watching the last four weeks could say they are taking politics— politics out of the law enforcement process. Quite the contrary. They are engaging in the very politicization and weaponization that they claim to be trying to eliminate.Peter Keisler, former acting attorney general, was a Republican until Trump's first term, when Keisler switched to Independent. Scott Pelley: Some people watching this interview say, \"You were always against the president. Of course you're saying these things.\"Peter Keisler: Well, it's true that I've never voted for Donald Trump. My concern about the use of law enforcement to achieve political ends, that's among the reasons I've never voted for President Trump. But at the end of the day, people can support whatever candidate they want.

This is false…\" But a second Manhattan prosecutor quit, telling Bove he would have to find someone who is \"...enough of a fool, or enough of a coward…\" to sign the motion. Bove ordered prosecutors in Washington to sign and there, six more resigned, for a total of eight.Scott Pelley: And how seriously should the public take those resignations?Peter Keisler: Oh, it's a flashing red light. Nobody gives up these jobs easily. But people have resigned because they are being otherwise commanded to perform unethical acts that they think are contrary to their responsibilities. Scott Pelley: Looking ahead, what is the tripwire, in your view, that would signal that the country is in serious trouble?Peter Keisler: Well, I think we're already there. I think when you have a major political corruption prosecution dismissed because somebody has agreed to become a political ally of the president, you know, that tripwire has already been tripped.This past week, Emil Bove explained his motion to dismiss to a federal judge. There is no decision yet. Last Thursday, by the thinnest of margins, the Senate confirmed Trump's new director of the FBI, Kash Patel. In a message to the bureau, Patel said his commitment is to \"justice\" and \"the rule of law.\" He's a former prosecutor who is dedicated to Trump. Patel has written children's books featuring a 'King Donald' who is protected by a wizard named Kash.Sara Levine: Right now we are really in a place where we are teetering on the edge. For former prosecutors Sara Levine and Sean Brennan, speaking publicly was not an easy decision. But in the end, they believe silence may be the greatest threat to justice.Sean Brennan: I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't at least try to help people understand why what we've seen happening in the Department of Justice over the past few weeks is so critical and why it not only puts all Americans individually at risk. It really puts our constitutional governmental structure at risk.Sara Levine: The thing is, as prosecutors, we have an ethical obligation that's higher than any other attorney. Because what a prosecutor can do is we can take away somebody's liberty. And what they're doing is they're driving out people that are willing to follow the law. And that's terrifying because our democracy falls apart if there's not some sort of law and order that goes along with it.Produced by Aaron Weisz, Ian Flickinger and Pat Milton.

The second biggest concern was business regulation and ease of doing business, cited by 54%.\n\nOf those surveyed, 30% cited international trade and risks of tariffs as one of their top three priorities — up 8% compared to last year. Trade and tariffs would be a “major challenge” for 19% of respondents and a “minor challenge” for 41%.\n\n“There is little movement in terms of the major challenges facing firms,” the Ibec report said. “But as political uncertainty abates in Ireland, there is greater recognition of the impact, or potential impact, attached to increased geopolitical risk.”\n\nIbec executive director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien said the report shows that the overall outlook among chief executives “remains positive” but “recent geopolitical shifts have significantly altered the landscape”.\n\n“This is evident in the sharp rise in concerns over international trade and potential tariffs,” he said. \n\n Notably, the research was conducted before the most recent US announcement of intent to pursue tariffs, meaning current concerns are likely even higher.\n\nDespite the international picture deteriorating, chief executives in Ireland remained largely optimistic about the broader business environment.\n\nThe survey shows that six in 10 firms expect an increase in demand and turnover this year along with growth in both domestic and export sales. However, 88% of chief executives anticipate the cost of doing business will continue to rise throughout 2025.\n\nThe top three domestic business priorities identified by those surveyed included the overall cost of doing business, cited by 62%; talent retention, upskilling, and attraction, cited by 51%; and improving productivity, cited by 47%.\n\nMr O’Brien said despite the international uncertainty, “many of the growth obstacles for CEOs are EU and domestic factors”.\n\nHe pointed to how the report by the former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi last year highlighted challenges for Europe including high energy costs, project delays, regulatory burdens, and an incomplete single market. Mr O’Brien said: \n\n To unlock its full economic potential, the Government must pursue key commitments — such as enhancing competitiveness, accelerating housing and infrastructure projects, and reducing regulatory burdens — with clarity and speed.\n\nChief executives said housing and the cost of doing businesses should be the top two priorities for the new Government.\n\nIbec surveyed 213 chief executives as part of the report, with 59% in the services sector and 36% in the manufacturing sector. The remaining 5% were categorised as “other”.","summary":"Having already slapped a 10% tariff on goods from China and 25% on steel and aluminium, Donald Trump is expected to roll out more levies on imports including pharmaceuticals","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/companies/arid-41580283.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9028/4514428_7_seoimage1x1_FergalO_27BrienIbec_281_29.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 00:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Ronan Smyth","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Ronan Smyth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.336},{"id":293613714,"title":"Keke Palmer, “Nickel Boys”, and “The Six Triple Eight” win big at the 2025 NAACP Image Awards: See the full list of winners","text":"The 56th NAACP Image Awards have come to an end, unveiling a new set of winners.\n\n Both before and during the official Feb. 22 ceremony, the organization bestowed honors upon several artists and works, with winners including Denzel Washington for Best Supporting Actor in Gladiator II, Abbott Elementary for Best Comedy Series, Cross for Best Drama Series, Sing Sing for Best Independent Motion Picture, Emilia Pérez for Best International Motion Picture, and Nickel Boys filmmaker RaMell Ross for Best Director and Best Writing, with co-writer Joslyn Barnes.\n\n Tyler Perry's The Six Triple Eight also won big, nabbing Outstanding Motion Picture, with star Kerry Washington also winning Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture.

Janet Mills’ vow that she would see Trump in court over his threat to withhold money from the state if it didn’t comply with his executive order delighted Democrats who want more strident pushback. But the dust-up that played out in the open Friday as Trump hosted governors at the White House ticked off a president known to retaliate against people he considers enemies.\n\nHours after the spat, the federal Department of Education announced it was initiating an investigation into the Maine Department of Education over the inclusion of trans athletes. Trump doesn’t want them playing in girls and women’s sports; Maine law bars discrimination based on gender identity.\n\n“Any time a public interaction like that takes place, it’s coming from a person who’s grounded in their values,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in an interview Sunday. “I love Janet Mills and I appreciate her for standing up. I also know that there’s always a cost that comes with that.”\n\nThe Democrats who lead the nation’s most populous states were in Washington for a meeting of the National Governors Association, where they tried to strike a balance between their states’ needs and their feelings about Trump.\n\nWhitmer, known for clashing with Trump during his first term over the federal COVID-19 response, campaigned vigorously against him in 2024 on behalf of Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. Whitmer said she sat next to Trump at a White House dinner on Saturday night.\n\n“I was the only Democrat at the table. I was a little surprised. I think everyone in the room was a little surprised, to be honest,” she said. “But I took the opportunity to talk a little bit about tariffs.”\n\nMichigan and other states could be significantly affected by some of the president’s early proposals. For example, Michigan expects nearly 42% of its budget to come from federal funds and relies heavily on trade with Canada, which now faces potential Trump-imposed trade penalties.\n\nA federal judge is considering a request to block the administration from freezing trillions of dollars in grants and loans, a move that could severely impact states. At the same time, Trump’s key ally, Elon Musk, is pushing to shrink the federal government, with likely ripples nationwide. About 80% of the roughly 2 million people in the federal workforce live outside metro Washington, dispersed across the country.\n\n“I’m very worried that people are going to make make decisions without a real understanding of what the ramifications are going to be for the American public,” Whitmer said. Musk, she said, is “dangerous.”\n\nAt discussion panels and news conferences at the meetings, state leaders struck a conciliatory tone.\n\n“We always hope that people can disagree in a way that elevates the discourse and tries to come to a common solution,” said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, the association’s chair, when asked about the Trump-Mills exchange. “I don’t think that disagreement was necessarily a model of that,” he said.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., met with Trump for more than an hour on Friday afternoon to discuss Manhattan’s congestion tolling. Trump ordered a halt to the program, a key Hochul priority, and declared in a social media post: “Long live the king!”\n\nAsked about the meeting, Hochul told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that it was “adversarial” and said New Yorkers “need to know I’m willing to take the fight wherever I have to.”\n\n“We’re not going to sit idly by and let our rights be attacked,” she said. “We’ll work with you when there’s common ground, no doubt about it, let’s build great projects and infrastructure. There’s areas where we’re going to work with you on immigration and getting the violent criminals off our streets. We do not dispute that, but don’t think that you can just come in and bully us around and not expect a reaction from governors.”\n\nWhitmer said she had a chance to speak with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in addition to Trump.\n\n“I’ve got to put the people’s interests before my own interests, before my partisan interest. I got a job to do,” said Whitmer, considered a top-tier potential candidate for the 2028 Democratic nomination for president. “So even if it’s uncomfortable, even if, you know, it’s all the all the things you would assume, on a personal level, that’s second to my job as governor.”\n\nHundreds of miles from Washington, another 2028 contender took a different direction.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, in his State of the State address on Wednesday, compared the Trump administration to the Nazi movement and criticized members of his own party, declaring, “Going along to get along does not work.”\n\nPritzker’s response resonated with some key voters.\n\n“We didn’t elect Democrats to become collaborators with our oppressors,” said Lori Goldman, founder of “Fems for Dems,” a Michigan-based group focused on voter turnout.\n\n“We are beyond angry and we are organizing against Democrats that sell us out,” she said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump&#8217;s real-time confrontation with Maine&#8217;s governor over transgender&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democratic Governors Contemplate Response as Trump Targets Fellow Governor first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/democratic-governors-contemplate-response-as-trump-targets-fellow-governor/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/2J4B3ZGRNFCN3FYXLT7PU5AWPY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 23:39:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.025},{"id":293617590,"title":"Donald Trump knew exactly who to call to connect with Daniel Penny — me!","text":"Penny saved, Penny earned\n\nThe New York Post recently featured a whole page honoring GodBlessUs former Marine Daniel Penny who defended his honor, country, life, his Godliness, his manhood and his birthright when he alone — as everyone else just sat, stared and watched a crazy man who was spouting threats at a lady on the subway, minding their own business.\n\nI’ll share an unknown backstory. After Bragg the DA tried to indict him, the White House calls me. I do not repeat conversations DJT and I have. Like him/don’t like him/I don’t care.\n\nPresident Trump and I — friends over 50 years — have had each other’s phone numbers since we had rotary dials.\n\nThe Daniel Penny story then was front page. This time the call was from Donald’s private secretary. She said the president wanted Penny’s phone number. He didn’t have it. He told her to call me to get it.\n\nPost Editor-in-Chief Keith Poole instantly gave me what he had that moment — the number of Penny’s lawyer.\n\nGratefully, we recently saw the photo and story of President Trump receiving Penny at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nA ‘vortex of fear’\n\nThree more — MORE — lawsuits against Sean Combs hit the United States District Court, Southern District of New York recently. One requests a jury trial.\n\nIt’s from a Las Vegas-based entertainer who alleges “sexual, physical, psychological abuse” over five years. It caused their life “to spiral into a living nightmare.”\n\nThe plaintiff’s preliminary statement includes he “used his false promises of career advancement as weapons” to trap the plaintiff into utilizing “a relentless pattern of drugging, sexual assaults, death threats, clandestine recording, blackmail and psychological manipulation that far exceeded any bounds of consent or professionalism.” Allegedly it was a “vortex of exploitation and fear.”\n\nEthics are nothing to laugh at\n\nSummer’s coming. July Fourth. Entertaining time. “Tea Travels” expert Ellen Easton on:\n\nTolerance: Maintain your beliefs if embracing behavior or opinions not your own.\n\nPrivacy: Not same as secrecy. Careful what you share.\n\nRespect: Mindfully recognize and regard the rights of others.\n\nEtiquette: Enhance civil communication. Understand what is expected socially.\n\nEthics: Do no harm. Correct behavior for truth and conduct.\n\nTolerance: Respect another’s attitude not your own.\n\nCannot subscribe to these ethics? Then just stay home alone. And sulk.\n\nOr you can schlep to Greenwich Village’s Comedy Cellar, a favorite spot of Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Louis C.K., Dave Chappelle, Amy Schumer.\n\nAlso Will Arnett who plays a comedian in Bradley Cooper’s new film “Is This Thing On?” about a stand-up comic. (He also helped write the thing.) Arnett’s been sharpening lines at the joke joint. His new gig is promoting Australia. May we all hope he goes over Down Under.\n\nJeweler to a policeman: “A truck opened. An elephant came out, sucked up all my jewelry then climbed back into the truck.” Policeman: “Indian or African elephant? The African has big ears. The Indian has littler ears.” Said the jeweler: “I couldn’t tell. He had a stocking over his head.”\n\nDefinitely only in New York, kids, only in New York.","summary":"The Post's Cindy Adams shares that President Trump reached out to connect with former Marine Daniel Penny after he was acquitted.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/23/opinion/donald-trump-knew-exactly-who-to-call-to-connect-with-daniel-penny-me/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/newspress-collage-rjg7irg2f-1740351021295.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1740333081&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 23:39:06","author":"Cindy Adams","authors":["Cindy Adams"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.213},{"id":293611900,"title":"Who Is Friedrich Merz?

However, it remains highly unlikely Merz will go to AfD to form a coalition.What Is CDU?CDU under political titan Angela Merkel helped establish Germany as a force in European politics, but the party's fortunes switched in 2017 after the rival center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) led by Olaf Scholz took control.Under Merkel, the CDU, a traditionally center-right party, leaned more into centrist positions and politics, much to the party's benefit. Merkel led CDU to a narrow victory in the 2005 federal elections, unseating SPD from power at that time. She grew the party's lead in subsequent elections but ultimately needed to create a coalition party to retain power in the 2013 election.Ultimately, the migrant crisis in Europe in 2015 hit Germany especially hard, causing significant divisions in public and among political parties. CSU's then-Interior Minister Horst Seehofer challenged Merkel over her handling of the crisis.Initially, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer led the party but resigned after losses in the European Parliamentary elections, replaced by Armin Laschet led the party after Merkel stepped down to preserve the coalition, but he ultimately was unable to prevent SPD from winning the 2021 federal election.Who Is Friedrich Merz? Merz had run twice to take control of the party, losing to Kramp-Karrenbaur and Laschet both because he had a reputation as a more right-wing politician.He first joined the CDU while still in school. Born in the west German town of Brilon in 1955, he went on to serve in the military before studying law and marrying his fellow student Charlotte Gass in 1981, according to the BBC.Merz worked as a lawyer for a few years but sought office at the age of 33 and was elected to European Parliament in 1989. He made the switch from European to German politics in 1994, quickly rising through the ranks as a talent among a traditionalist faction.He then launched three bids for party leadership, finally winning control of the party in 2022.What Does CDU's Victory Mean for Germany? CDU and Merz managed to unseat SPD, but the party failed to gain enough seats for an outright majority.According to Peter Doran, an adjunct senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and former president for the Center for European Policy Analysis, there will be a return to the \"Grand Coalition\" with SPD.\"Merz has been very firm in maintaining the so called firewall that would prevent any coalition agreement with AfD, and at the basic level, any coalition with AFD would rip the CDU/CSU apart,\" Doran told Newsweek. \"The party would not survive in its current state if it pursued a coalition arrangement with AFD at this point.\"Doran later said: \"[Merz] appears inclined to take the easiest option, and that is a so-called 'Grand Coalition,' once more with the SPD. However, this coalition, unlike past grand coalitions, will have none of the splendor or dynamism: In fact, we might best consider it a grim coalition, more with the energy of a funeral that everyone has to go to but no one wants to be there.\"However, SPD and CDU/CSU would not be able to achieve a majority on their own, meaning they will need to find a third party to complete the coalition. The most likely option, at this point, would be the Greens party, forming what Doran called the \"Black/Red/Green Coalition,\" in reference to the color associated with each party.The efficacy of that coalition remains unclear for two reasons: First, that Scholz is likely out as leader of SPD, having given his \"swan song\" speech, as Doran called it, meaning the party will need to pick a new leader and direction; Second, that Merz has argued to take the party further to the right in an effort to pick up disaffected voters who switched to AfD.\"He's identified immigration and the economy as the two main drivers of voter dissatisfaction with the previous governments, plural, and he's positioned his party to answer those frustrations,\" Doran said.One policy that is likely to cause waves is Merz's desire to increase Germany and Europe's independence from the U.S.\"I am communicating closely with a lot of prime ministers, and heads of E.U. states, and for me it is an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the US, step by step,\" Merz said after polls closed on Sunday, according to German outlet DW.Merz added: \"I never thought that I would ever need to say something like that, on television, but after the latest statements made by Donald Trump last week, it is clear, that the Americans—at any case these Americans, this administration—mostly don't care about the fate of Europe one way or another.\"He also criticized Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance for \"intervention\" in the election, saying it was \"no less drastic, dramatic, and ultimately no less brazen than the intervention we have seen from Moscow.\"Who Is Alice Weidel? One of the great challenges Merz will face as the new German chancellor is that AfD, the party he will likely pass over for his coalition, will remain the second-biggest party in the Budestag and therefore the main opposition party, giving them a chance to further normalize their position in the government.\"The disparagement strategy was employed against AfD, trying to frame them as far-right, fascist, etc,\" Doran said. \"Obviously, one-fifth of the German population didn't buy it: They rejected the disparagement strategy, because ... AfD was talking to them about the things that matter to German voters – immigration, the economy and having too much government in their lives.\"AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, is a 46-year-old who got her doctorate in economics. She is fluent in English and Mandarin and worked for Goldman Sachs and Allianz Global Investors, and a freelance business consultant before pivoting to politics, according to Reuters.AfD is 12 years old and has rapidly ascended in prominence, impacting politics and CDU, specifically. The party's coalition partner CSU opposed Merkel on migrants due to AfD making gains in the Bavaria elections in 2015, and Kramp-Karrenbaur faced a leadership crisis when it emerged that a contingent of CDU was in talks with AfD in 2020.","summary":"The German federal polls have closed, and the exit polls appear to have handed the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) a victory.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/friedrich-merz-germany-chancellor-2035041","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2593808/german-chancellor-friedrich-merz-elections.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 23:34:40","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.139},{"id":293618478,"title":"Grok blocked results saying Musk and Trump &#8220;spread misinformation&#8221;","text":"Grok, Elon Musk’s ChatGPT competitor, temporarily refused to respond with “sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation,” according to xAI’s head of engineering, Igor Babuschkin.

Unions want the administration to rescind the request and apologize to workers, and are threatening to sue.\n\nSome officials are resisting. Others are encouraging their workers to comply. At some agencies, there was conflicting guidance.\n\nOne message on Sunday morning from the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., instructed its roughly 80,000 employees to comply. That was shortly after the acting general counsel, Sean Keveney, had instructed some not to.\n\n“I’ll be candid with you. Having put in over 70 hours of work last week advancing Administration’s priorities, I was personally insulted to receive the below email,” Keveney said in an email viewed by The Associated Press that acknowledged a broad sense of “uncertainty and stress” within the agency.\n\nKeveney laid out security concerns and pointed out some of the work done by the agency’s employees may be protected by attorney-client privilege: “I have received no assurances that there are appropriate protections in place to safeguard responses to this email.”\n\nMusk’s team sent an email to hundreds of thousands of federal employees on Saturday giving them roughly 48 hours to report five specific things they had accomplished last week. In a separate message on X, Musk said any employee who failed to respond by the deadline — set in the email as 11:59 p.m. EST Monday — would lose their job.\n\nDemocrats and even some Republicans were critical of Musk’s ultimatum, which came just hours after Trump encouraged him on social media to “get more aggressive” in reducing the size of the government through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The day before, Musk celebrated his new position by waving a giant chainsaw during an appearance at a conservative conference.\n\nSen. John Curtis, R-Utah, was among the members of Trump’s own party who had concerns. Utah has 33,000 federal employees.\n\n“If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,” Curtis said. “These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. … It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., questioned the legal basis the Trump administration would have for dismissing tens of thousands of workers for refusing to heed Musk’s latest demand, though the email did not include the threat about workers losing their jobs.\n\nFor Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., there was no doubt: “The actions he’s taking are illegal, and we need to shut down this illegal operation.”\n\nTrump mocked the affected workers in a meme he posted Sunday on his social media network. The post featured a cartoon character writing a list of accomplishments from the previous week led by, “Cried about Trump,” “Cried about Elon,” “Made it into the office for once,” and “Read some emails.”\n\nNewly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel, an outspoken Trump ally, instructed bureau employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now.\n\n“The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,” Patel wrote in an email confirmed by the AP. “When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.”\n\nEd Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, sent his staff a message Sunday that may cause more confusion. Martin noted that he responded to Musk’s order.\n\n“Let me clarify: We will comply with this OPM request whether by replying or deciding not to reply,” Martin wrote in the email obtained by the AP, referring to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n“Please make a good faith effort to reply and list your activities (or not, as you prefer), and I will, as I mentioned, have your back regarding any confusion,” Martin continued. “We can do this.”\n\nThe night before, Martin had instructed staff to comply. “DOGE and Elon are doing great work. Historic. We are happy to participate,” Martin wrote at that time.\n\nOfficials at the Departments of State and Defense were more consistent.\n\nTibor Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, told employees in an email that department leadership would respond on behalf of workers. “No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,” Nagy wrote in an email.\n\nPentagon leadership instructed employees to “pause” any response to Musk’s team as well. “The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,” according to an email from Jules Hurst, the deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. “When and if required, the Department will coordinate responses.”\n\nEverett Kelley, president of the 800,000-member American Federation of Government Employees, said in a letter Sunday to the administration that it should rescind Musk’s original email request and apologize to all federal workers by the end of the day.\n\n“We believe that employees have no obligation to respond to this plainly unlawful email absent other lawful direction,” he wrote, describing Musk as “unelected and unhinged.”\n\nThousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce — either by being fired or through a “deferred resignation” offer — during the first month of Trump’s second term.\n\nThere is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs so far, but the AP has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Many work outside of Washington.\n\nMusk on Sunday called his latest request “a very basic pulse check.”\n\n“The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!” Musk wrote on X. “In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.”\n\nHe has provided no evidence of such fraud. Separately, Musk and Trump have falsely claimed in recent days that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of other employees are preparing to leave the federal workforce this coming week, including probationary civilian workers at the Pentagon and contractors at the U.S. Agency for International Development. The USAID move escalates a monthlong administration assault on the international humanitarian agency that has frozen its funding.\n\nCurtis and Van Hollen were on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and Lawler appeared on ABC’s `This Week.”\n\nPeoples reported from New York. Associated Press writers Byron Tau, Ellen Knickmeyer and Tara Copp contributed to this report.","summary":"Musk said any employee who failed to respond to his email by Monday's deadline would lose their job.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/23/elon-musk-workforce-ultimatum/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CPAC_2025_73412.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 23:31:40","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":293617382,"title":"Warren Buffett Said He Could End U.S. Deficit In 5 Minutes: 'If You Guys Can't Get It Done, We'll Get Some Other Guys To Get It Done'","text":"Warren Buffett back in 2011 made a bold claim on CNBC. He said he could fix the U.S. deficit in five minutes. His idea? Make sure politicians actually feel the consequences of their spending habits.\n\n\"You just pass a law that says that any time there's a deficit of more than 3% of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election,\" Buffett said. He laughed, but his point was clear: politicians don't fix the deficit because there's no real incentive for them to do so. \"A more effective threat would be just to say, ‘If you guys can't get it done, we'll get some other guys to get it done.'\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy. Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. \n\nNearly 14 years later, the deficit hasn't just stuck around—it's ballooned. In 2011, the U.S. debt was around $14.3 trillion. As of 2025? It's now past $36 trillion, with an annual deficit projected at $2.84 trillion. If Buffett thought Washington was reckless in 2011, what would he say now?\n\nEnter Trump and Musk: A New Plan to Cut the Deficit\n\nIn a move that nobody saw coming at the time, President Donald Trump—reelected in 2024—teamed up with billionaire Elon Musk to take a swing at government inefficiency. Their newly formed Department of Government Efficiency aims to trim federal spending by up to $2 trillion by July 4, 2026.\n\nDOGE, which Musk himself is leading, has already started slashing budgets, focusing on programs under agencies like USAID and the Department of Health and Human Services. So far, their reported savings sit at $55 billion, a small dent in their massive goal — but it's only been four weeks.\n\nTrending: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nTrump, never one to shy away from bold claims, has praised Musk as the smartest guy for the job. But not everyone is convinced. Conservatives are torn—some love the aggressive cost-cutting, while others point out that major entitlement programs, which make up a bulk of federal spending, remain untouched.\n\nWould Buffett's Idea Have Worked?\n\nBuffett's plan was simple but ruthless: make politicians personally accountable for running deficits. But in reality, Congress would never pass such a law—because it would mean voting themselves out of power.\n\nIn a 2011 CNBC article, an attorney pointed out that there is a legal loophole that could make it happen. Under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, two-thirds of state legislatures could call for a convention to propose an amendment. If three-fourths of the states ratified it, it would become law—no Congressional approval needed. But as the attorney noted, odds of that happening would have been slim and the process would take longer than \"five minutes.\"","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-said-could-end-233043535.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eQqKYN45SXKRXvBRvd.SKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Benzinga/aa3c50bd27bef14835084da83e182257","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 23:30:43","author":"Jeannine Mancini","authors":["Jeannine Mancini"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":293616550,"title":"Crypto derivatives a missing piece in Hong Kong’s virtual-asset push, Deribit says","text":"Deribit, the world’s largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, aims to expand in Hong Kong, a sign of momentum as the market regulator looks to make the city a hub for virtual assets.\nThe Dubai-based company was drawn to Hong Kong because of its position as an international financial hub and its vibrant community of family offices and asset managers, which are increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies, said Jean-David Péquignot, the firm’s chief commercial officer, who is based in the city.\n“Hong Kong is this central financial hub in the world and a big one in Asia,” he said. “If regulators can solve the derivatives piece, it is a place where we love to be.”\nOn Wednesday, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) unveiled a new road map of initiatives for the virtual-asset ecosystem. The plan includes studying the introduction of virtual asset derivative products for professional investors, or those with portfolios of at least HK$8 million (US$1 million).\n\nCrypto derivatives trading was the missing piece of what Hong Kong regulators currently allow, which was predominantly focused on licensing, Péquignot said.\n“Derivatives can be speculative instruments for people who want to take leveraged bets into a market,” he said. “They can be risky, but they are also very powerful instruments for hedging and risk management.”\nThe risk-management element could help investors navigate fluctuations in the volatile crypto market, Péquignot said.\nDeribit, licensed in Dubai, provides a trading platform for bitcoin and ether options. This derivative instrument gives traders the right to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specific time without immediate commitment to buy or sell the underlying asset.\n“Asia is a big market for derivatives, with sophisticated investors who are highly speculative in nature,” Péquignot said. “We want to be in Asia. We just need to find the right place and time to engage with regulators and get a regulatory framework to work with.”\nSingapore, another major Asian financial hub, has yet to establish regulations for crypto derivative trading.\nHong Kong-based asset managers and family offices had a high appetite for crypto, said Péquignot. Some of his firms’ biggest trading counterparties either had operations in Asia or dealt with Asian money directly, he added.\n“We see an uptrend in adopting derivatives products in the crypto space,” he said. The heightened interest has come from savvy individual investors, hedge funds and family offices.\nLast year, Deribit recorded a 95 per cent year-on-year surge in trading volume to US$1.2 trillion, with a strong fourth quarter thanks to heightened optimism around the US presidential election and the US$100,000 bitcoin bull run that followed, the firm said last month.\nWith US President Donald Trump running a crypto-friendly administration, Deribit hoped to serve the US market once a suitable regulatory framework was in place, Péquignot said.\nThe firm, established in 2016, is in discussions with regulators in France and Brazil to acquire derivatives licences.","summary":"Dubai-based exchange aims to expand in the city as the regulator is set to consider letting professional investors trade crypto derivatives.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3299671/crypto-derivatives-missing-piece-hong-kongs-virtual-asset-push-deribit-says","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/21/37d534fb-0b98-40d8-bf62-86d7bf16e889_3eb066af.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 23:30:13","author":"Aileen Chuang","authors":["Aileen Chuang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.44},{"id":293611070,"title":"Canada tears itself apart over hockey legend Wayne Gretzky's MAGA ties","text":"Canada tears itself apart over hockey legend Wayne Gretzky's MAGA ties\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump reveals the political role he wanted for Gretzky \n\nPODCAST: All the biggest news and insider gossip from the Trump administration – listen to Welcome to MAGAland here\n\nBy ALEX RASKIN and ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nPublished: 23:19 GMT, 23 February 2025 | Updated: 23:25 GMT, 23 February 2025\n\nHockey legend and Canadian icon Wayne Gretzky has been thrust into that country's ongoing uproar over US President Donald Trump, tariffs, national anthems, and America's '51st state.'\n\nGretzky was already being criticized for his ties to Trump after attending post-election parties at the President's club in Palm Beach, Florida as well as the inauguration in Washington. But, amid the two nations' unfolding trade war, it was Gretzky's presence as Team Canada's honorary captain at the NHL's recent 4 Nations championship that really infuriated some of his countrymen.\n\nMany have criticized Gretzky for failing to wear team colors at Canada's overtime win over Team USA in Boston. Others, meanwhile, focused on Gretzky's ties to Trump, who has insisted that Canada renounce its sovereignty and join America as its 51st state.\n\n'Just going to state this matter-of-factly,' Canadian-based TSN reporter Dave Naylor wrote on X, 'the honorary captain for Canada in this game publicly supports a political leader whose position is that Canada should not exist as a nation.'\n\nBut he did get support from a fellow Hockey Hall of Famer in Boston Bruins great Bobby Orr.\n\nIn an op-ed piece for the Toronto Sun, the Ontario native defended Gretzky, who famously won several major international competitions as captain of Team Canada during his playing days.\n\nWhile Team USA's honorary captain Mike Eruzione (near left) wore a replica jersey at Thursday's 4 Nations finale, Canada's honorary captain Wayne Gretzky (near right) did not\n\nBruins legend Bobby Orr (right) wrote a column defending Gretzky (left) from Trump critics\n\nBeloved NHL announcer and ex-Capitals star undergoes open heart surgery\n\n'For the life of me, I cannot understand why the 'haters' have decided to go after Wayne because he 'didn't wear a Canadian jersey' during his introduction at the final match,' Orr wrote. 'I, for one, thought that he looked very dignified while representing Canada with class and professionalism.\n\n'Remember, this is a man who wore the Maple Leaf on multiple occasions with pride,' Orr continued. 'As both a player and administrator, he has brought nothing but glory to his homeland year after year, decade after decade.'\n\nCuriously, Orr's column makes no direct mention of Trump.\n\nIt does, however, work to remind Canadians that Gretzky is one of them.\n\n'Wayne is a guy from Brantford, Ont., who made good and has done nothing throughout his life but give aid and assistance to innumerable Canadians along the way,' Orr concluded.\n\n'Please, let's take a time out. Extend a little grace, and a little respect for a good man and a great Canadian.'\n\nThis isn't the first time Canada has been at war with itself over Gretzky. The trade that sent him from Edmonton to Los Angeles continues to haunt the country, even after the Oilers won the 1990 Stanley Cup without him.\n\nThen there was Gretzky's support for then-President George W. Bush's controversial 'War on Terror' in 2003. With the country divided America's invasion of Iraq, critics hung a sign reading 'U$ Lackey'' around a Gretzky statue in Edmonton.\n\nGretzky did attend Trump's election victory party at Mar-a-Lago, where the two golf aficionados and their families were seen celebrating together.\n\nJanet Jones, Gretzky's long-time wife, shared a picture of her husband with Trump on social media, which appeared to anger liberal hockey fans last month.\n\n'You have to really question someone's ethics and logic supporting someone like Trump,' one user posted.\n\n'Apparently there is an inverse relationship between hockey skills and intelligence,' another added.\n\nOne said: 'Few things on earth more embarrassing than Canadian maga weirdos'.\n\nBut while Gretzky was getting criticized by Canadian hockey fans, he was embraced by Trump, who suggested the NHL's all-time leading scorer should run for Prime Minister.\n\nGretzky's wife Janet Jones also posted an older picture of him with a beaming Donald Trump\n\nJanet Jones Gretzky was complimentary of Canada and the US but critics weren't having it\n\nWayne Gretzky and his wife Janet Jones arrive for the Presidential Inauguration of Donald Trump at the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington on January 20 \n\n'I have some many great friends,' the 78-year-old Trump said to a crowd at Mar-a-Lago in January. 'One of them is the ''Great One .'' I said, ''Run for Prime Minister, you'll win… It will take two seconds.''\n\n'He said, ''Well, am I gonna run for Prime Minister or Governor? You tell me,''' Trump continued.\n\n'I said: ''I dunno, let's make it Governor. I like that better.''\n\nFamously preoccupied by America's trade deficit with Canada, Trump previously suggested the country's 10 provinces and three territories should become the 51st state. He even tweeted about the idea on Christmas Day, offering Gretzky as a potential 'Governor of Canada.'\n\n'You would win easily, you wouldn't have to campaign,' Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\nAlas, Gretzky did not seem eager to become the Prime Minister or Governor of Canada, according to Trump.\n\n'He had no interest, but I think the people of Canada should start a DRAFT WAYNE GRETZKY Movement,' Trump added.

The driver, their vision likely obscured by the add-on metal plates, didn’t notice the deep hole—a possible shell crater—in the tank’s path. As a surveillance drone from the Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade watched, the Russian vehicle tipped into the hole.\n\nAn explosive first-person-view drone immediately slammed into the stuck tank. One Russian managed to climb out of the vehicle—but collapsed in the snow a short distance away.\n\nUkrainian troops warned this kind of thing might happen.

Serhiy Misyura listed the vehicle’s flaws. “The driver has almost no visibility,” Misyura warned.\n\nThe turtle tank’s “fatal trip,” as the 47th Mechanized Brigade described it, was one of countless such incidents as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds into its fourth year. Russian forces are actually losing ground in Kursk, but they’re managing to slowly advance in several sectors of front in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBut at staggering cost. In total, the Russians have lost more than 15,500 vehicles and other pieces of heavy equipment—twice what the Ukrainians have lost.\n\nTotal Russian casualties since February 2022 could be close to 800,000. Ukrainian losses since early 2022 are much lower: 43,000 killed and 370,000 injured, Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelensky said in December. In the best-defended sectors, the Ukrainians kill seven Russians for every Ukrainian soldier the Russians kill, one Russian defector claimed.\n\nDrones are among the biggest killers on both sides. But the Ukrainians deploy more drones—2.2 million last year, according to Zelensky—and enjoy greater freedom of flight as widespread Ukrainian jamming grounds all but the best Russian drones: the radio-free fiber-optic models.\n\nUkraine’s drone superiority is the main reason Zelensky can reject, and so far has rejected, attempts by the increasingly Russia-aligned administration of U.S. Pres. Donald Trump to force Ukraine into an unfavorable ceasefire while also extorting the war-torn country for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of rare minerals.\n\nBut Ukrainian drone coverage is uneven and fragile in places. Many Ukrainian teams depend on Starlink satellite terminals to connect them to their drones. But Starlink is largely owned by rightwing billionaire Elon Musk, a top Trump donor and a major purveyor of Russian propaganda. After Zelensky rejected the mineral extortion, the United States reportedly threatened to cut off Starlik access for Ukrainian forces.\n\nFortunately for Ukraine, Polish officials intervened, reminding the Americans that Poland pays for much of Ukraine’s Starlink services on the basis of commercial contracts.\n\nThere are other vulnerabilities in the Ukrainian drone system. At least one drone team in Kursk has run out of the infrared sensor equipped “vampire” drones that the Ukrainians use to harass Russian positions and supply lines at night. “We really just don’t have night drones anymore and it’s very important,” operator Kriegsforscher wrote.\n\nAt the same time, Zelensky claimed Ukraine would further ramp up drone production, possibly implying any current shortages are temporary. “This year, we will make more,” he said. And that could make it even harder and costlier for Russian troops to advance.\n\nFollow me on Twitter. Check out my website or some of my other work.

It didn’t end well last time","text":"A White House fact sheet about Donald Trump’s recently announced “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” on trade described it as “the art of the international deal” – a reference to Trump’s 1987 business book, The Art of the Deal. \n\nIt was a classic piece of self-marketing from the president, but whether his latest tariff proposal will really turn out to be artful is very much open to question.\n\nIn fact, the United States’ long history of “reciprocity” in tariffs and trade suggests ordinary Americans could be in for a bumpy ride.\n\nIn essence, Trump is reviving a strategy used in the US more than a century ago to protect developing domestic industries. This time, according to the president, reciprocal tariffs aim “to correct longstanding imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board”. \n\nThe plan targets trade relationships with other countries where the US does not receive reciprocal treatment. And it echoes the policies of the 25th US president, William McKinley, who presided over an aggressive reciprocal tariff regime in the late 19th century.\n\nMcKinley was president from 1897 until he was assassinated in 1901. And while Trump greatly admires his business acumen, McKinley’s economic legacy also reads like a cautionary tale.\n\nNot a simple equation\n\nFrom the current US perspective, “reciprocity” refers to symmetrical tariffs. Trump’s plan targets unequal rates, such as the European Union’s 10% tariff on US cars, compared with the 2.5% US tariff on European automobiles. \n\nThe EU’s 10% rate represents its “most-favoured-nation” tariff, which applies to all its favoured-nation trading partners (with certain exceptions). \n\nWhile this looks like a clear lack of reciprocity, it’s not that simple. The US also applies a 25% tariff on EU utility vehicles (pickup trucks). \n\nThis is significant because of the popularity of pickups in the US – a 2024 survey found 47% of Americans owned one. Until last year, the Ford F150 had been the bestselling “car” in the US for 42 years in a row.\n\nThis is just one example of how differences in tariffs can be more complex than they appear at first glance.\n\nA history of reciprocal tariffs\n\nThis cycle of higher and lower tariffs has gone on for well over a century. From 1861 to 1930, the US Congress maintained control over trade tariffs, with levels as high as 50% to protect developing industries. \n\nBut in 1934, Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, giving President Franklin D. Roosevelt authority to negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions with individual nations to stimulate global trade during the Great Depression. \n\nThese tariff reductions continued after World War II with the development of the World Trade Organization and US tariff levels declining to 5%. Economist Douglas Irwin refers to this period as the “reciprocity period” of nations lowering barriers to international trade.\n\nThe last time “reciprocity” was used to refer to the opposite process of raising tariffs was in 1890, under the Tariff Act, often just called the McKinley Tariff. It is this era Trump harked back to in his inaugural address:\n\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent – he was a natural businessman.\n\nBefore he became president, McKinley was head of the House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Committee. He proposed an average increase in tariffs on all imports, rising from 38% to 49.5% to “secure reciprocal trade”. \n\nThe new law was designed to protect the tinplate industry with a tariff of 70%, and “to reduce the revenue and equalize duties on imports”.\n\nAt the time, the US was running large surpluses from tariff revenues, which was threatening economic growth. This sounds counterintuitive these days, but surpluses were a problem because the US dollar was backed by gold at a fixed price (the gold standard). \n\nBecause the amount of money in circulation – and state spending – were limited to the amount of gold held by the government, surplus funds had to be kept in the Treasury reserves. This reduced the money supply and led to lower growth, less investment and tighter credit.\n\nRepublicans thought higher tariffs would reduce imported goods and therefore tariff revenues. Instead, income from the higher tariffs more than compensated for import reductions, and the surpluses increased. \n\nConsumer prices rose, farm prices dropped, and the resulting voter backlash saw the Republicans lose control of Congress at the 1890 midterm elections. There was a financial panic in 1893, followed by a recession that lasted until 1896.\n\nA new ‘Gilded Age’\n\nThis period in late 19th-century US history is often referred to as the “Gilded Age”, from the title of an 1873 book by Charles Dudley Wright and Mark Twain. \n\nThe book was a satire of political corruption and unscrupulous businessmen who benefited from political favours. The title reflects the reality of the era – superficially prosperous but not truly golden. \n\nA thin veneer of technological progress, innovation and wealth concealed widespread corruption, scandals and income inequality. \n\nBut aside from the obvious historical parallels, it is overly optimistic to expect a plan from 1890 to succeed in a complex global trade environment that relies on interdependent supply chains to function.\n\nMcKinley’s flawed strategy sought protection for a few industries, but also aimed to reduce revenue for a government running large surpluses. However, Trump’s new tariffs are meant to raise revenue to pay off the US$36.5 trillion national debt, as well as to enforce reciprocal trade terms.\n\nTrump began his second term with a declaration that “the golden age of America begins right now”. As in 1890, however, the risk remains that a handful of wealthy industrialists will benefit from increased protection, while ordinary citizens will pay higher prices. \n\nLess the “art of the deal”, then, than a possible dealbreaker. In which case, Trump may yet be remembered less for a new golden age than for a Gilded Age 2.0.","summary":"Donald Trump praises the 19th-century “reciprocal” tariff policy of former president William McKinley.

Around 83.5 per cent of Germans turned out to vote, the highest figure since the reunification in 1990.\n\nIn second place is the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right group that has called for the deportation of all foreign-born people in Germany who have committed a crime. Projections estimated that around 850,00 CDU voters had defected to the AfD, pushing them to 20.5 per cent of the total vote. \n\nThe far-right party’s leader, Alice Weidel, hailed the “historic” election result which saw her party double their vote from 2021. She then suggested the AfD “hand is outstretched” to join a coalition government. To deprive them of that, she added, would be tantamount to “voter fraud”. \n\nMr Merz said it would be months before the CDU worked out its coalition, until at least Easter. The coalition will require a 316-seat majority, with the CDU projected to have won 209 seats themselves. The most likely grouping will be with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and possibly, also, the Greens, who came third and fourth with a projected 119 and 90 seats respectively. Mr Merz says he would prefer to have just one coalition partner. \n\nDespite courting controversy after accepting AfD votes last month to push through a motion proposing tougher migration laws, the 69-year-old future chancellor and former corporate lawyer reiterated on Sunday night his promise not to form a coalition with the far-right political party. Germany has maintained a policy of not working with the far-right in government since the 1950s, known as “Brandmaeur”. \n\nIn a televised debate with all the party leaders, after the first election projections were released, Mr Merz said Ms Weidel “does not seriously believe that we will accept his hand”. \n\nBut German political analyst Nicolai von Ondarza says there is a strong feeling within the CDU that this is “a government of last chance” to fend off the appeal of the AfD and that they will “need to be more radical in delivering for economic growth and on migration” to do that. \n\nHe added that the AfD will likely spend the next few months trying to “tempt the CDU” by pushing proposals in the Bundestag on migration and tax policy that neither the SPD nor the Greens will support.\n\nMr Merz was greeted with cheers as he took to the stage at the CDU’s headquarters in cold Berlin on Sunday evening before admitting he was “aware of the responsibility that now lies ahead” of him. \n\nWhen he eventually assumes the role, his in-tray will be spilling over. German magazine Zeit described it on Sunday as “a mountain of problems of mythical proportions.”\n\nHe will need to tend to Germany’s struggling economy and infrastructure, become a leading European figure in supporting Ukraine against Russia and build ties with the Donald Trump administration across the Atlantic, as well as fend off the rise of the AfD, a group that the US president has all but endorsed. \n\nSpeaking after the first election projections, Mr Merz warned that the new US administration had made it “clear that this government is fairly indifferent to Europe’s fate” and that the continent needed to be more self-reliant on defence. \n\nNonetheless, Mr Trump hailed the election result as a “great day” for the country, suggesting that the vote for conservatism showed that “the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration”. \n\nWriting in all caps and referring to himself in the third person, he added that it was also a victory for “the United States of America under the leadership of a gentleman named Donald J. Trump”. \n\nHe did not mention the AfD but senior figures in his administration, including X owner turned government official Elon Musk and vice president JD Vance, have endorsed the party and called for an end to the “Brandmaeur”. \n\nLast November, a failure to improve the struggling economy caused the collapse of the three-way coalition government under chancellor Olaf Scholz, forcing this snap election. The vote had originally been scheduled for September. \n\nMr Scholz struck a markedly different tone to his soon-to-be successor at the headquarters of his party, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), after they finished with their worst postwar result in a national parliamentary election. They are projected to win just 16.5 per cent of the vote, down nearly 10 per cent from the election in 2021. \n\nHe conceded it had been a “bitter election result” before urging his fellow parties not to work with the AfD. \n\n“Now we have the far-right - the AfD - and the fact they got such a good election result is something we cannot accept and I will never accept,” Mr Scholz said. \n\n“We need to stick to what we have always said, we mustn't work with the far-right.” \n\nDuring an AfD event on Saturday in Erfurt, the capital of the central German region of Thuringia, where the party won the state elections last September despite being designated as extremist, local officials were confident that the nation would follow in its footsteps in four years no matter what the mainstream parties did. \n\nThat victory in Thuringia was the first time the far-right had won elections since Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. \n\n“In time, we will get there,” said a smiling Stephan Möller, a senior figure and elected official in the Thuringia branch. “The way we did it in Thuringia and a few other federal states, the entire Federal Republic of Germany is a step behind this development.\n\n“It will take another four years, then we will be the strongest party.”","summary":"US president Donald Trump declared the conservative victory as a ‘great day for Germany’ before congratulating himself","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-elections-afd-cdu-b2703245.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/23/20/Germany_Election_77913.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 23:11:29","author":"Tom Watling","authors":["Tom Watling"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.413},{"id":293613452,"title":"Some U.S. agencies tell workers not to reply to Musk’s email","text":"WASHINGTON >> Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump’s adviser Elon Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward.\n\nTrump administration-appointed officials at the FBI and State Department sent their staff emails telling them not to respond outside their chains of command, in a possible sign of tension between members of the Republican administration and the world’s richest person in his campaign to cut down the government’s 2.3 million member civilian workforce.\n\n“The FBI, through the office of the director, is in charge of all our review processes,” said FBI Director Kash Patel, a Trump appointee, in an email to staff seen by Reuters.\n\nMusk leads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which in the first weeks of Trump’s administration has laid off more than 20,000 workers and offered buyouts to another 75,000, across wide swaths of the government from the Defense Department — long a top Republican priority — to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where all staff have been ordered to halt work.\n\nThe frantic pace has led the federal government in some cases to rush to rehire workers who perform critical functions like securing the nation’s nuclear arsenal and trying to fight the worsening bird flu outbreak, which has caused egg prices to spike higher.\n\nWhile there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government, which carries $36 trillion in debt, would benefit from reform, Musk’s tumultuous approach has drawn widespread criticism, including from voters in some Republican areas.\n\nFederal workers on Saturday evening received an email instructing them to detail the work they did during the previous week by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), shortly after Musk posted on his X social media site that failing to respond would be taken as a resignation.\n\nThe subject of the email read, “What did you do last week?” and came from a human resources address in the Office of Personnel Management, but did not include Musk’s threat of termination.\n\nWorkers at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Education and Commerce, as well as at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Institutes of Health and the Internal Revenue Service also were told not to respond pending further guidance, according to sources and emails reviewed by Reuters.\n\n“To be clear — this is irregular, unexpected, and warrants further validation,” a senior executive at the National Centers for Environmental Information, an agency that manages environmental data and is part of the Commerce Department, wrote.\n\nSome officials welcomed the move. Ed Martin, Trump’s nominee for U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., who is serving in an interim capacity, praised Musk and DOGE in an email response.\n\nBut other offices within the Justice Department, including the executive office that supports all U.S. attorneys and the department’s civil division, told employees not to reply pending additional information.\n\nEmployees at the Drug Enforcement Administration, part of the Justice Department, were told to respond, according to an email seen by Reuters.\n\nUNION QUESTIONS MUSK’S AUTHORITY\n\nThe largest federal workers’ union, the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote on X on Sunday that it did not believe Musk had the authority to fire employees who did not respond and would formally request that OPM rescind the message.\n\nMeanwhile, the union advised members to ask their supervisors directly whether to reply and to follow their guidance.\n\nThe email left some employees even more frustrated and worried after weeks of uncertainty about their futures.\n\n“I really wonder when someone is going to say enough,” one IRS employee told Reuters.\n\nMedia offices at the Commerce, Justice, Education and Treasury departments, as well as at the FDIC and NIH, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a State Department spokesperson referred questions to the White House.\n\nMusk on X on Sunday called the email “a very basic pulse check.”\n\nSenator John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, said he supports the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce government spending but that Musk should take a more humane approach.\n\n“If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s please put a dose of compassion in this,” Curtis said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well. We can do both.”\n\nSome federal judiciary employees, including judges, also received the Saturday email from OPM, even though the court system is not part of the executive branch, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts confirmed.\n\nThe judiciary advised employees that no action should be taken in response to the message, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.\n\nIn some cases, employees were left unsure how to respond even if they chose to do so.\n\nSome lawyers, for instance, expressed concern that their work is confidential.\n\nWorkers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email, according to people with knowledge of the matter, even though they were all ordered to cease working since early this month, leaving them with little to do.\n\nFormer New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, said the email was “a complete overstep” that would be defeated in court.\n\n“From a management perspective, you can see what a clown car this is right now,” Christie said during ABC News’ “The Week” on Sunday.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump&#8217;s adviser Elon Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/02/23/breaking-news/some-u-s-agencies-tell-workers-not-to-reply-to-musks-email/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/web1_2025-02-23T164500Z_1259847454_RC2JSCAAVA2B_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-DOGE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 23:03:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":293608996,"title":"2,000 USAID Workers Fired by the Trump Administration, with Thousands More Placed on Leave","text":"The Trump administration said Sunday that it is eliminating 2,000 positions at the U.S. Agency for International Development and placing all but a fraction of other staffers worldwide on leave.\n\nIt comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas that came in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.\n\n“As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,” according to the notices sent to USAID workers and viewed by The Associated Press.\n\nAt the same time, the agency said it is cutting the U.S.-based workforce by about 2,000 employees.\n\nThe move escalates a monthlong administration assault on the agency that has closed its headquarters in Washington and shut down thousands of U.S. aid and development programs worldwide following an effort to freeze foreign assistance. President Donald Trump and his chief cost-cutter, Elon Musk, contend the aid and development work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.\n\nCiting a big concern for workers stationed overseas who have reported being cut off from government communications, the notices say that “USAID is committed to keeping its overseas personnel safe. Until they return home, personnel will retain access to Agency systems and to diplomatic and other resources.”\n\nThe administration said employees put on leave overseas are expected to receive “voluntary Agency-funded return travel” and other benefits.\n\nNichols, who was nominated by Trump, said he had been “very concerned” about workers in high-risk areas left overseas without access to emergency communications.

Eisenhower, visited the Scottish castle in the past, when he stopped in to see Queen Elizabeth II alongside former Prime Minister Harold MacMillan in August 1959.\n\n The claim that Trump may be invited to Balmoral was reported by The Sun this evening, with the newspaper mentioning political and royal sources who said the unique offer could be made in days. A Downing Street source said an invitation to a state visit would be communicated by the PM once he arrives at the Oval Office on Thursday to hold talks with Trump.\n\nA Whitehall insider claimed: \"He's already been to Windsor and Buckingham Palace, so Balmoral is being talked about. Everyone knows he loves Scotland and it's near his golf course.\" The Mirror has contacted Buckingham Palace for comment.\n\n It comes after the Mirror reported that the King and Queen are to be deployed on their biggest royal tour yet - a \"charm offensive\" in the USA. Charles and Camilla are expected to head to America and Canada, in a jaunt our government hopes will help diplomatic relations with Trump. The royals will first be deployed to Canada, Charles' first visit to the British realm as monarch, before being welcomed to the US by President Trump.\n\nNext year is also the 250th anniversary of American Independence, which will be celebrated across the nation on July 4, 2026. Sources close to the planning say discussions between governments have already begun, with an official invitation from Washington expected imminently.\n\nThe Mirror understands both North American tours will be agreed for the first half of next year, most likely the Spring. In line with the King’s continued cancer treatment, a US visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales has been earmarked as a contingency, although it is the preference to host Their Majesties, sources said.\n\nIt will be the first time a British monarch has visited the United States since 2007, the last of five royal tours the late Queen Elizabeth undertook. As Prince of Wales, Charles undertook more than 20 official visits to the US. The King's most senior aides will be key to developing the framework for the highly anticipated trip.\n\nBuckingham Palace is understood to be \"overwhelmingly keen\" on the tour and is committed to working with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) for the plans, sources suggest. A government source said: \"This will undoubtedly be the biggest tour of the King’s reign so far, a huge undertaking for a British monarch to be hosted in the United States.\n\n\"Americans love the British Royal Family and it is a great opportunity for both sides to reaffirm the special relationship in such an important and historic year for the US. The King has been especially keen to travel to Canada, a country and people he holds so much affection for, it will be a charm offensive on both sides.\"\n\nHowever, the Palace remained tight-lipped over the royal tour plans, with one palace source remarking: \"There are no current dates in the diary for Their Majesties to tour either Canada or the USA, or active Palace planning taking place for either option.\"","summary":"A government source has claimed that when Keir Starmer travels to the US this week, he might invite Donald Trump to the UK - and the US president could stay at Balmoral Castle","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/donald-trump-will-invited-stay-34735285","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34735361.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Balmoral.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 22:58:19","author":"Chiara Fiorillo,Russell Myers","authors":["Chiara Fiorillo","Russell Myers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.311},{"id":293609000,"title":"Controversial Ohio Bathroom Law Causes Division on School Campuses","text":"YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio — For some famously progressive colleges in Ohio, a new state law designed to keep transgender women from using women’s restrooms at schools is bringing a moment of soul-searching for students, alumni and administrators.\n\nIt’s one of many such laws adopted around the country, with the stated intent of protecting female students. The Ohio law — which applies fully to private colleges, unlike the others — allows individual institutions to decide how they will obey and enforce the measure.\n\nBut navigating the law has become a challenge, especially at colleges like Antioch and Oberlin, campuses built on a bedrock of idealism and protest where many see the law as part of a wider attack on transgender students.\n\nFor some, the idea of complying at all runs counter to the long-held value of being gender-inclusive. At the same time, colleges across the country are sorting the impact of the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, including a threat to cut federal funding for schools that reject its interpretation of civil rights laws.\n\nOberlin has published policies saying the school will comply with the law taking effecting Tuesday and is offering counseling and a chance for students to ask to move out of their dorms. Antioch has not announced a detailed plan.\n\nAhri Morales-Yoon, a first-year student at Antioch College who is nonbinary, said the law’s impact will go beyond bathroom access.\n\n“It will cause a lot of fear and uncertainty,” they said. “It’s in the back of your head that this law is hanging over us.”\n\nJane Fernandes has been president of Antioch College since 2021. In that time, she said, she hasn’t fielded a single complaint about anyone’s presence in a restroom.\n\nThe school, about an hour’s drive west of Columbus, was founded in 1850. Horace Mann, the education reformer, abolitionist and former member of Congress became its first president. The school shuttered in 2008 amid financial struggles but relaunched three years later. Nearly 90% of the school’s 120 students identify as LGBTQ+ and about 1 in 6 say they are transgender.\n\n“We will do everything we can to make it possible for transgender students to be very supported and safe here,” said Fernandes, who has spoken out repeatedly against the law.\n\nShelby Chestnut, the executive director of the Transgender Law Center, who is an Antioch graduate and chair of the school’s board of trustees, said the law is an effort to deter colleges from supporting students.\n\n“This is an outright attack on student safety,” they said in an interview.\n\nThe law calls for colleges in Ohio to designate all multioccupancy restrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms and showers for the exclusive use of males or females, based on sex at birth.\n\nTen other states already enforce bathroom laws. But none of those apply broadly at private colleges and universities.\n\n“The point was that we’re treating our students equally across the board in Ohio,” said Republican state Rep. Beth Lear, one of the measure’s sponsors.\n\nThe bathroom laws are part of a wave of anti-transgender policies. Most GOP-controlled states, including Ohio, have banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors and passed laws to keep transgender women from competing in women’s sports.\n\nSince returning to office, President Donald Trump has signed a series of executive orders targeting transgender and nonbinary people on several fronts, an abrupt change from President Joe Biden’s efforts to include them explicitly in civil rights protections.\n\nSince its founding in 1833, Oberlin College and Conservatory, outside Cleveland, has broken down social barriers, including being among the first colleges to admit women and Black students. The college was on the cover of Life magazine in 1970 when it offered co-ed dorms.\n\nBy the 1990s, dorm residents were voting on bathroom policies, and they often made facilities open to any gender.\n\nThe bathroom law has sparked angst on campus and among some alumni, who see the administration’s intention to comply with the law as an abdication of values by the school of nearly 3,000 students. The college said in a campus-wide note that following the law “does not diminish our support for every member of our diverse community.”\n\nBut it’s not that simple to everyone.\n\nIt goes against “the whole idea of Oberlin,” English professor DeSales Harrison said, “to refrain from making a decisive argument about what seems true and good in the world.”\n\nSome have called for Oberlin to take a more forceful stand.\n\nKathryn Troup Denney, who graduated in 1995, is a Massachusetts-based musical theatre director who wrote a production about transgender people. Like several alumni on message boards, she said her alma mater should not comply with the state law, even if it means risking government funding.\n\n“When the law is deliberately causing discriminating against one particular population of people,” Denney said, “that’s when good people can rise up and say, ‘No, this law is not fair, it is not equitable, and it is not safe.’”\n\nOberlin officials declined interview requests.\n\nWhen students returned to Oberlin for the spring semester, there were new signs designating multi-person bathrooms as being for either men or women.\n\nMany dorm bathrooms previously had signs designating them as open to everyone, people of just one gender or just one occupant. Students could change the signs. In academic and other buildings, instead of designating a gender, some signs described whether a bathroom had stalls or urinals.\n\nSome of the new signs have been removed, apparently as acts of protests, and the administration has been replacing them.\n\nBut at both Antioch and Oberlin, it’s not clear that who uses which restroom will change.\n\nNatalie DuFour, Oberlin’s student body president, noted the law does not require anyone to check who is using the bathrooms.\n\n“Students, in theory, have the freedom to use whatever they want,” she said.\n\nAntioch’s Fernandes has signaled the same thing: “We’re not going to monitor who’s going in which bathroom.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA private college has published policies saying the school will comply with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Controversial Ohio Bathroom Law Causes Division on School Campuses first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/controversial-ohio-bathroom-law-causes-division-on-school-campuses/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Ohio-bathroom-law-targeting-transgender-students-has.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 22:56:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":293608288,"title":"Video: Jake Tapper Discusses Trump’s Dismissal of Inspector Generals and Military Lawyers","text":"Top Stories\n\nEntertainment\n\nSunday, February 23, 2025\n\nWelcome!

Reports of Yunus approaching the SpaceX CEO came up amidst Elon Musk's possible business setup in India after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent US visit. Meanwhile, it is speculated that Yunus' move is aimed to revolutionise Bangladesh's digital sector and provide high-speed internet access to its citizens, especially in rural and underserved areas.Bangladesh Govt Looking For Major Economic Boost Amidst ChallengesMuhammad Yunus' invitation comes at a time when Bangladesh's economy is facing major challenges, including a massive jolt from former US President Donald Trump 's decision to bar funds to the country. Despite these challenges, the Bangladesh government is keen to leverage technology to drive economic growth and social development. The launch of Starlink is expected to have a transformational impact on the country's economy, particularly for Bangladesh's enterprising youth, rural and vulnerable women, and remote and underserved communities.In a letter to Musk, Yunus asserted that the visit would offer an opportunity to engage with Bangladesh's youth, who are expected to be the primary beneficiaries of this advanced technology. \"Let us work together to deliver our mutual vision for a better future,\" the Chief Adviser said in his letter to the tech mogul. Yunus has also reportedly directed his High Representative, Khalilur Rahman, to work in close coordination with Elon Musk's SpaceX team to expedite the necessary preparations, ensuring Starlink's readiness for launch in Bangladesh within the next 90 working days.Reports suggested that last week, Yunus held a detailed phone conversation with Musk to discuss potential collaboration and the prospects of launching Starlink satellite internet services in Bangladesh. \"I look forward to it,\" Musk told Yunus during the phone call. Starlink, a satellite constellation operated by SpaceX, aims to provide global broadband coverage, especially targeting regions with limited or no access to high-speed internet.The local Bangladesh media reports quoted Yunus as saying, “Integrating Starlink's connectivity into Bangladesh's infrastructure will have a transformational impact, particularly for Bangladesh's enterprising youth, rural and vulnerable women, and remote and underserved communities.” The launch of Starlink in Bangladesh is expected to have a huge impact on the country's digital economy and global connectivity. It will provide high-speed internet access to rural and underserved communities, bridging the digital divide and unlocking new opportunities for socio-economic growth. Trump Administration Stops Funds In BangladeshEarlier, the Donald Trump administration's US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the leadership of Elon Musk, announced the cancellation of major funding programs in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, a USD 29 million funding program aimed at \"strengthening the political scenario\" was scrapped. The move sparked speculation about US involvement in election-related activities in Bangladesh, further pointing to the recent change of regime in the country. The cancellation of funds was part of a broader effort by the DOGE to cut international aid and reduce government spending.","summary":"Bangladesh Seeks Digital Revolution With Elon Musk&#39;s Starlink Launch Amidst Economic Challenges","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/bangladesh-seeks-digital-revolution-with-elon-musk-s-starlink-launch-amidst-economic-challenges","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/muhammad-yunus-meets-elon-musk-1739611996073-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-23 22:45:27","author":"Digital Desk","authors":["Digital Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.063},{"id":293609332,"title":"Trump Celebrates Conservative Party Win in Germany and Promises 'Many More Victories to Follow!'","text":"President Donald Trump took to social media to celebrate the victory grasped by Germany's conservative opposition in the recent federal election.Trump took to his social media app, Truth Social, on Sunday to congratulate the Christian Democratic Union on their win.\"LOOKS LIKE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN GERMANY HAS WON THE VERY BIG AND HIGHLY ANTICIPATED ELECTION.
