A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.”\n\nFordow and Natanz both house uranium enrichment centers, while Isfahan is where Iran is believed to be keeping near-bomb-grade enriched uranium.\n\nThe Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is buried deep underground, heavily fortified and expected to contain 2,700 centrifuges, which are essential for uranium enrichment. \n\n“All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors,” Trump added. “There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\n\nIsrael launched attacks against Iran on June 13, claiming the country was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons. Iran then retaliated with its own series of airstrikes. The two countries have continued to trade attacks since. At least 657 people have been killed in Iran, with another 2,037 wounded, the Associated Press reports.\n\nIn a follow-up post on Truth Social, Trump announced he will address the nation at 10 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n“I will be giving an Address to the Nation at 10:00 P.M., at the White House, regarding our very successful military operation in Iran,” Trump wrote. “This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU!”\n\nTrump also told Reuters the strike was a “great success.”\n\nSome users have reported issues loading the post or Trump’s profile on Truth Social. However, the post is still visible on his X account.\n\nThe U.S. used B-2s to carry out the strikes. Those planes dropped six 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs on Fordow, Trump told Fox News’s Sean Hannity. The U.S. also fired 30 Tomahawk missiles at Natanz and Isfahan, he said.\n\nMultiple B-2 bomber planes departed an airbase in Missouri and flew across the Pacific earlier today ahead of the strikes. U.S. officials gave Israel a warning before the strikes, according to reports from CNN and The New York Times.\n\nThe Independent understands that Trump decided to green-light the strikes in the last few days despite issuing a statement through Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday that he would make a decision within two weeks. \n\nThat decision was informed by a belief that only American capabilities could take out Iran's nuclear program, and it was made only after American forces in the Middle East region had made preparations for possible Iranian retaliatory attacks. The timing of the attack was also informed by concerns that Iran would soon be able to restore defensive and offensive weapons systems that had been knocked offline by Israeli attacks over the last week.\n\nIranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that U.S. attacks on Iran would be “very, very dangerous,” during a round of diplomacy in Istanbul on Saturday. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, similarly warned on Wednesday that the U.S. will suffer “irreparable” harm for entering the conflict. \n\nThere are tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East across several military bases that could become targets for retaliation by Iran. The U.S. military operates at least 19 locations in the Middle East region. Eight of them are permanent, including in Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nIran-backed forces have attacked American troops on several occasions since the outbreak of the latest war in Gaza and the subsequent conflicts in the wider region. Trump has previously warned that any attack on American military forces in the Middle East will be met with the “full strength and might of the US Armed Forces.”\n\nJust 24 hours before Saturday’s strike, Trump claimed Tehran could produce a working nuclear weapon within “a matter of weeks.” His remark directly contradicted sworn testimony given in May by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard. The former Congresswoman testified that the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon.”\n\nTrump said Wednesday that Iranian negotiators should have accepted an agreement his administration previously proposed during talks that took place over the last two months. \n\n“They should have made the deal. I had a great deal for them,” Trump said. “They should have made that deal 60 days. We talked about it, and in the end, they decided not to do it, and now they wish they did it, and they want to meet, but it's, you know, late to meet, but they want to meet, and they want to come to the White House.”\n\nAccording to White House officials, the president monitored the strikes from the White House situation room on Saturday after returning from New Jersey, where he attended a political fundraiser at his Bedminister golf club. \n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, a Republican and Chair of the Senate Budget Committee, called today’s strikes “the right call.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, said he “stand[s]” with Trump and will “pray for the American troops and personnel in harm’s way.”\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson said the strikes serve as a reminder that “Trump means what he says.”\n\n“President Trump has been consistent and clear that a nuclear-armed Iran will not be tolerated,” Johnson said in a statement. “That posture has now been enforced with strength, precision, and clarity.”\n\nBut other lawmakers, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, aren’t as happy with the move. Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who co-sponsored a bill that would require Congressional authorization for military action against Iran, called the attack “not Constitutional.” \n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who co-sponsored that same bill, said Congress must “immediately return to DC and vote on @RepThomasMassie and my War Powers Resolution to prevent America from being dragged into another endless Middle East war.”\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

On one end, Hong Kong’s financial, professional and business services are being revived on the back of China’s resurgent, tech-driven economy and the shifting balance of power between Washington and Beijing.\nUS President Donald Trump’s global tariff war, announced on April 2, was supposed to kneecap the world. But the shock and awe unleashed have rapidly dissipated due to rising misgivings about the looming fiscal crisis, compounded by the US immigration crackdown and Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” to cut taxes for the wealthy, which is likely to add an estimated US$2.8 trillion to the fiscal deficit.\nCredit rating downgrades, poor responses to auctions of US Treasuries and slower growth as predicted by the World Bank – lowered to 1.4 per cent in June from 2.3 per cent in January – have sent the mighty US dollar on a downtrend and a flight of capital to Asia for better returns.\nHong Kong’s stock market is positioned in the right place at the right time. As tariff chaos and policy flip-flops erode the US’ credibility and moral standing, China has emerged as an oasis of certainty in an increasingly volatile and dangerous world.\nThe mainland’s use of Hong Kong as a platform for its new tech champions to raise funds and connect with global markets has fuelled the city’s return to its role as one of the world’s top fundraising venues. More than 100 enterprises – including leading companies from the mainland – are said to be in line for public listing on Hong Kong’s stock exchange. The Hang Seng Index is up 15 per cent in the first quarter of this year, building on a surge of over 17 per cent in 2024.\nState policies aimed at maximising the use of Hong Kong’s internationally connected financial and capital markets have helped, but local officials have not sat on their hands either. Taking advantage of the city’s reformed legislative system, the government has taken action to bolster Hong Kong’s position as a global financial hub.\n\nThe Companies Ordinance has been amended to promote the re-domiciliation of overseas companies. The Legislative Council also passed a law on stablecoins in May. It is scheduled to be implemented in August, ahead of the passage of the US’ Genius Act to regulate cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar.\nThe coming implementation of a new, comprehensive regulatory regime on stablecoins and legislative amendments to streamline the trading, management and investment of digital assets have generated widespread interest. Altogether, these policies will catapult Hong Kong into a full-fledged digital financial trading centre.\nThe economic benefits of Hong Kong’s revitalised financial markets are clear. Business receipts of the computer and information technology services rose by 60.2 per cent compared to the same period last year; finance services – excluding banking – by 32.5 per cent, insurance by 23.1 per cent, import and export by 19.4 per cent and banking by 19 per cent. Real estate and retail receipts fell by 6.7 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively.\nWhile financial services are bouncing back, Hong Kong’s consumer services data tell a totally different story. In April, Hong Kong’s retail sales dropped for a 14th consecutive month. Local restaurant receipts dipped in the first quarter of this year, with total receipts by value falling by 0.6 per cent.\n\nInterestingly, the total value receipts of Chinese restaurants declined by 4.9 per cent compared to the same period last year; for fast food shops, the value increased by 1.9 per cent, while that of non-Chinese restaurants rose by 2.4 per cent. Bars registered the sharpest gain of 6.5 per cent, possibly due to last year’s substantial reduction of the excise duty on spirits.\nThe economic integration of Hong Kong with cities in the Greater Bay Area development zone has contributed to a divergence between the local economy and the city’s internationally connected sectors.\nThe improvement of cross-boundary transport infrastructure following the opening of the high-speed rail links with the mainland and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, has practically turned Hong Kong and nearby mainland cities into a single market. The free movement of people from Hong Kong and the much better value-for-money offered by services in neighbouring cities have seriously dented local demand for consumer services.\nChinese restaurants cannot compete with their counterparts on the mainland on price or variety. There is not much the government can do to prop up these ailing sectors except to allow market forces to produce new demand for more attractive offerings. Even consumption vouchers – assuming the government could issue another around – would only have a short-term effect. The best hope for resuscitating Hong Kong’s local consumer services lies in price adjustments and innovation.\n\nPrice cuts are already happening. Commercial rentals for offices and shops have dropped significantly, though not as sharply as desired by small operators. Many local eateries are offering two-dish meals at attractive prices for low-income workers. A major fast food chain recently applied for their signature baked pork chop rice to be listed as an “intangible cultural heritage” and offered a limited number of deeply discounted coupons for the popular dish. The coupons were snapped up instantly.\nHowever, it will be a long and painful process if markets are left to regain competitiveness solely based on price adjustment. New products, service delivery innovation and the creative redesign of shopping malls are key to offering greater customer satisfaction.\nGovernment planners cannot rely on old models. They must work with business to be bold and forward-looking, or else Hong Kong will be left behind.","summary":"Hong Kong is at risk of splitting up into two economies.

What has been achieved since coming into office again in January?\n\nThe administration has been accused of seeming less like a new broom than a threadbare old brush; not so much sweeping clean as brushing the country’s problems under a rug to be tidied up later.\n\nBut defenders of the Fianna Fáil/Fine Gael-led Coalition would no doubt argue it has been faced with a series of obstacles since the start of the year, most notably the still unresolved threat of tariffs from Donald Trump.\n\nThere is also the worsening international -situation, which last week saw Ireland join other countries in pulling embassy staff from Iran as the conflict with Israel continues.\n\nThese, however, are matters with which all our partners are having to deal. It is no excuse for not dealing robustly with domestic matters. \n\nThe legislation programme for the summer term of the Oireachtas lists a number of bills as a priority, including the Defence (Amendment) Bill which will remove the so-called triple-lock on Irish troops serving abroad, as well as measures tackling air pollution, cyber security and terrorism. All important matters, no question about it.\n\nThe logjam in planning and services is well documented\n\nBut none directly addresses the deepest issue confronting the country: that is, of course, the lack of supply, and crippling cost, of housing.\n\nLast week there was more bad news as the Central Bank revised downward its forecast for the number of houses that will be built between now and 2027 — also the midway point of the 34th Dáil, a date which the Government may find itself careening towards at an alarming pace.\n\nThis year, it now expects 32,500 homes to be built, well short of what is needed to make a significant dent in the target of 300,000 by 2030.\n\nThe logjam in planning and services is well documented. Historically, it has often felt as if Irish bureaucracy stymies rather than stimulates innovation. No wonder we lag far behind comparable EU states when it comes to infrastructure.\n\nThe apparent lack of urgency to break through these roadblocks remains a bigger concern.\n\nThe Government already seems to have -retreated into explaining rather than doing, as if seeking to justify in advance the failure to meet its own target, which it has already accepted is inevitable.\n\nThe appointment of the former HSE chief -executive as chair of the newly revamped An -Coimisiún Pleanála may make a difference.\n\nIf anyone has experience of cutting through red tape, it is Paul Reid. Health is another area where much-needed change sadly comes a cropper.\n\nMinisters must act swiftly to hand him the power to green-light the infrastructure projects needed to house an estimated population of six million by 2040.\n\nNo other achievements by this Government will be worth a penny candle if the crisis in housing does not ease dramatically.\n\nThe summer recess is set to begin less than a month from now, on July 18. When TDs and senators return in September, all eyes will be on the presidential election and it will be the winter solstice before we know it.\n\nIt is still not too late to get a grip on housing, but it soon might be if more time is wasted.","summary":"Yesterday marked the summer solstice — the longest day, and shortest night, of the year.

Iran is a deeply ideological regime, committed to the destruction of Israel. The supreme leader said he wants to wipe Israel off the map,” he told host David Speers.\n\n“I suspect diplomacy will probably fail and we will see a strike of some sort (in) the next two weeks.\n\n“It will be tough for innocent people caught in the war.”\n\n‘It’s sometimes better the devil you know’\n\nAsked about the ramifications of the US involvement amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, Mr Hastie warned a collapse of the Iranian regime could cause “large-scale migration and refugees across the world” and a power vacuum in the Middle East. \n\n“If there’s one lesson that I take out of Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya, be careful what you wish for,” he said.\n\n“You know, it’s sometimes better the devil you know.\n\n“Particularly for stability once those structures of order - as bad as they might be under a tyrannical regime like that in Iran - when there is no order at all and it’s just chaos, it’s a very dangerous situation for the people of Iran, but also the rest of the world.”\n\nAcknowledging the US could not “pull up the drawbridge” and roll up decades of economic, diplomatic, and strategic interest, Mr Hastie said any decision was ultimately one for Mr Trump.\n\nHe also warned of the risks posed by Iran’s nuclear program.\n\n“One thing is clear, if you’re Iran and you survive this conflict with your regime intact and the nuclear program intact, I think you’re going to move at best speed to build a bomb to put yourself in the strongest position the next time this happens,” he said.\n\n“Who knows how they would use a nuclear weapon if they got one? It wouldn’t just be for Israel potentially.”\n\nMr Hastie also backed the Labor government’s approach to date, which has focused on calling for further dialogue between the US, Iran and Israel, while also condemning Iran for its nuclear programs. \n\n“I think broadly speaking they’ve made it clear, Iran shouldn’t get a nuclear weapon,” he said. \n\n“Israel has a right to self-defence. We want to see this war ended quickly.

While Ellen and Portia originally snapped up a sprawling 43-acre farmhouse, things didn’t go to plan. The luxury mansion bought as a dream escape was reportedly hit with epic flooding, and locals say nearby roads were left five feet under water. The couple are also said to have struggled with tight country roads, even needing to detour a mile and a half just to get around traffic bollards. Now, they’ve moved to a second property perched on higher ground in Oxfordshire and the new spot already seems like a better match - no flooding, fewer detours and as fans have seen this week, plenty of space for sheep to roam.. or sneak inside This week, we got a peek inside as Ellen shared a sweet snap of Portia photographing a rainbow from their hilltop garden. Captioning the photo, she gushed: “My wife, a rainbow, and my wife taking a photograph of a rainbow.” She’s also been showing off their growing animal family including their new sheep, who’ve made themselves very at home. In a recent Instagram video, four sheep were seen wandering through the couple’s open-plan home, startling their tiny dog. “They’re inside?” Portia can be heard asking, to which Ellen calmly replies, “Yeah, they’re inside.” Another clip, filmed by Portia, shows one of the sheep named Bernie strolling indoors. “Oh no, Bernie, you can’t be in here,” she laughs, gently guiding her back out. Just days earlier, Ellen posted footage of the sheep barging into the chicken coop. “That’s not your food! Get out of there,” she scolded, chasing them off camera. But while the couple are embracing rural life - chickens and all. However not everything’s gone unnoticed. Ellen was recently roasted by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane at a star-studded charity gala, where he joked: “She left right after the election… now she’s the nicest person in France.” But not quite accurate, she’s actually set up home in the English countryside. Ellen previously hit back at claims she’s “mean,” telling fans during a stand-up show: “I can be demanding and tough… but I’m not mean.” Despite the storms, the pair seem to be settling into village life with their new £15 million hilltop home offering sweeping views, a sustainable drainage system, and hopefully fewer surprises.

Jaishankar said India “should not expect smooth sailing” all the time when it comes to its ties with the neighbouring countries but asserted that New Delhi has tried to create a “collective interest” to build an inherent stability in relationships, irrespective of the regime. At the end of the day, “the logic every one of our neighbours must realise” is that working with India will “give you benefits”, and not working with India “has a cost”, he said, without elaborating. “Some take longer to realise; some understand it better. One exception, of course, is Pakistan, because it has defined its identity under the Army; in a way it has an in-built hostility in it. So if you put Pakistan aside, the logic will apply everywhere else,” the EAM said.\n\nAir India starts releasing interim compensation of ₹25 lakh each to relatives of crash victims, survivors\n\nAir India on Saturday (June 21, 2025) said it has started releasing the interim compensation of ₹25 lakh each to the families of the deceased and survivors of the June 12 Ahmedabad plane crash. The airline said a team of trained psychologists and doctors has been deployed in Ahmedabad to provide trauma counselling and psychological support to the affected families or individuals. “The interim compensation began being released from June 20, with three families having received payments so far, and the remaining claims being processed,” Air India said.\n\nFATF report links dual-use cargo seized by India in 2020 to Pakistan missile agency\n\nA dual-use equipment seized by India from a Pakistan-bound merchant vessel in 2020 is linked to Islamabad’s National Development Complex, which is involved in the country’s missile development programme, a new report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-terror financing watchdog, has said. “In 2020, Indian customs authorities seized an Asian-flagged ship bound for Pakistan. During an investigation, Indian authorities confirmed that documents mis-declared the shipment’s dual-use items,” the FATF report said.\n\nWest Bengal BJP chief faces flak over ‘sex workers’ remark\n\nWest Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president and Union Minister of State for Education Sukanta Majumdar has landed in a controversy for a remark directed at sex workers in Kolkata’s Sonagachi area. The Trinamool Congress on Saturday (June 21, 2025) criticised Mr. Majumdar’s remarks and demanded an “unconditional apology” from the BJP leader. During an altercation with the police on Friday (June 20, 2025), Mr. Majumdar compared Bengal’s law and order situation with “sex workers.”\n\nInvoking anti-gangster law to counter one communal violence incident triggered by a social media post is misuse: SC\n\nThe Supreme Court has concluded that the use of the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters Act — a law meant to counter organised crime — in a solitary case of communal disturbance caused by an “incendiary” social media post amounts to a misuse of the stringent penal law. The recent judgment, authored by Justice Sandeep Mehta, came after the court heard an appeal filed by people accused under the State law for mobbing and vandalising the business establishment of a man who posted content derogatory to a particular religion on social media. \n\nCBI conducts searches in Bihar and Jharkhand in ₹100-crore fake GST claim case \n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Saturday (June 21, 2025) conducted searches in Bihar and Jharkhand in a case registered against the then Additional Commissioner, Customs, Patna, and 29 others over bogus GST claims through fake export bills of nearly ₹100 crore. In a press statement, the agency said searches were conducted at seven places in Bihar and Jharkhand, including Patna, Purnia, Jamshedpur, Nalanda and Munger. The searches led to the recovery of seven gold bars, each weighing 100 gram, incriminating documents and mobile phones. It is alleged in the FIR that senior officials of the Customs department, including then Additional Commissioner and four Superintendents, entered into a criminal conspiracy with the accused.\n\nMahmoud Khalil vows to continue protesting Israel’s war in Gaza after coming back home\n\nA Palestinian activist who was detained for more than three months pushed his infant son’s stroller with one hand and pumped his fist in the air with the other as supporters welcomed him home Saturday (June 21, 2025). Mahmoud Khalil greeted friends and spoke briefly to reporters Saturday (June 21, 2025) at New Jersey’s Newark International Airport a day after leaving a federal immigration facility in Louisiana. “The U.S. government is funding this genocide, and Columbia University is investing in this genocide,” he said. “This is why I will continue to protest with everyone of you. Not only if they threaten me with detention. Even if they would kill me, I would still speak up for Palestine.”\n\nAt least eight dead as hot-air balloon catches fire in Brazil\n\nA hot-air balloon caught fire and tumbled from the sky on Saturday (June 21, 2025) in Brazil’s southern state of Santa Catarina, killing eight people, firefighters said. Footage shared by local news outlet G1 showed billows of smoke coming from the balloon, which was in flames as it hurtled toward the ground in the municipality of Praia Grande. Thirteen people, including the pilot, managed to jump out but eight were unable to. Authorities have opened an investigation and the results will be made public within 30 days, Santa Catarina’s public safety secretary Col. Flávio Graff told journalists. \n\nUkraine received at least 20 bodies of Russian soldiers in recent exchanges: Zelenskyy\n\nUkraine’s President said that Russia repatriated at least 20 of its own dead soldiers in recent exchanges with Ukraine, describing it as a result of Moscow’s disorganisation in carrying out large swaps of wounded POWs and remains of troops. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that an Israeli citizen was among the dead Ukraine had received in recent exchanges. He spoke to journalists on Friday but his comments were embargoed until Saturday (June 21, 2025). Officials did not disclose the identities of the bodies. “They threw the corpses of their citizens at us. This is their attitude toward war, toward their soldiers. And this is already documented. Sometimes these bodies even have Russian passports,” he said.\n\nHeadingley Test | Pope rides his luck as England hits back after Pant’s ton\n\nWhether India lives to regret the fact that it added just 112 runs to its day one total of 359 for three in the first Test against England at Headingley will eventually depend on Jasprit Bumrah’s golden arm, for the 31-year-old magician has this remarkable ability to inflate the value of every total his team makes. And on Saturday (June 22, 2025), he tried his utmost to make India’s 471 seem even bigger and to erase the memory of his side losing the last seven wickets for just 41 runs. The pacer partly succeeded (13-2-48-3), but a lack of pressure from the other end and some bad catching ensured that by stumps, England had cut the deficit to 262, reaching 209 for the loss of three wickets.","summary":"Here is a select list of stories to start the day.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/morning-digest-june-22-2025/article69722594.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/4gpxxp/article69402444.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-04-01T000851Z_443260097_RC2FODA2AIAJ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-22 00:50:38","author":"The Hindu Bureau","authors":["The Hindu Bureau"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":333865214,"title":"“Very successful,” Trump says of Iran strike","text":"The United States has launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, joining Israel’s military campaign, President Donald Trump said late Saturday on social media.\n\n— Donald J.

Now the MIDAS investment guru reveals how YOU can cash in on soaring value of rare minerals the world is rushing to grab","text":"In the midst of World War One, the American government made a disturbing discovery – several vital metals needed for the military effort were increasingly hard to find.\n\nOfficials swiftly drew up a critical mineral list, alongside a policy to help secure these commodities. Similar policies have now been drawn up across the Western world, focusing on minerals that are essential for defence, energy and technology. The Tories devised a strategy for the UK too, an update is overdue from Sir Keir Starmer and should be delivered imminently.\n\nGovernment concerns are all too timely.\n\nChina dominates the metals industry and can withdraw supplies at a whim. Russia is a major producer of many commodities, but all its goods are under sanction. The conflict between Iran and Israel has put the entire world on notice and global supply chains are increasingly under threat.\n\nFor canny investors, this dangerous cocktail creates an opportunity – to buy shares in critical mineral mining firms and benefit from rising demand for their wares. Certain stocks stand out, including titanium-focused Empire Metals, whose shares have doubled since Midas tipped them 18 months ago and Greenland-based Amaroq, a gold and rare earths specialist, up nearly 90 per cent – whose shares have more than doubled since Midas recommended them in the summer of 2022.\n\nEmpire Metals\n\nLightweight, durable and rust resistant, titanium is a vital component for the defence industry, used in tanks, submarines, aircraft and missiles. The metal also plays a key role in renewable energy, while its dazzling white cousin titanium dioxide is essential for paints, plastics and paper.\n\nEmpire is developing one of the largest titanium mines in the world, a 400 square mile site in Western Australia, just north of Perth.\n\nMidas recommended the shares in December 2023 at 9.5p. Today they are 23p, but supporters believe the price has much further to go, with several important milestones to come this year and next.\n\nMost titanium comes from low-grade ore, which is processed to create titanium dioxide. Conversion is costly, particularly for defence equipment and premium pigments, which need top-quality material.\n\nEmpire’s mine is different, with exceptionally pure titanium dioxide that is ideal for the highest-grade titanium markets.\n\nJust this month, Empire chief executive Shaun Bunn, a geologist with decades of experience, unveiled tests showing his mine can simply and cost-effectively deliver titanium dioxide that is more than 99 per cent pure.\n\nThe news puts Empire in a different league from conventional producers and it has set pulses racing among investors, customers and government experts.\n\nTitanium is on critical mineral lists around the world, but the good stuff is in extremely short supply.\n\nEmpire is backed by the Australian government, the group is in talks with officials around the world and interest is mounting among potential customers, from Japanese titanium specialists to pigment and paint producers.\n\nIn the next few months, Bunn expects to produce an independent estimate of his mine’s resources, a study on costs and a new test facility to fast-track development.\n\nTurning a vast mine site into a commercial operation is a tough job and an expensive one. But Bunn and his team are seasoned hands and are already evaluating ways to finance this project and take it to fruition. The rewards could be extensive. High-grade titanium dioxide sells for thousands of dollars a ton, demand is rising and Empire is well positioned to benefit.\n\nEarly-stage miners are not for the faint-hearted, but existing shareholders have already done well out of Empire and, at 23p, the shares still look like a bargain for adventurous investors.\n\nTraded on: Aim \n\nTicker: EEE \n\nContact: empiremetals.com \n\nAs President Donald Trump has made clear in recent months, Greenland has plenty of attractive attributes, not least its rare earth minerals. These play an integral role in military kit, such as radars and missiles, they are used in wind turbines and electric motors and they are critical for smartphones, computers and other electronic devices. But China has cornered the market, which makes all of us vulnerable.\n\nWhile Trump and Chinese premier Xi Jinping wrangle over access to these commodities, Greenland-based Amaroq has been busy, acquiring land and licences to become the largest private holder of mining rights in the country.\n\nThe group, formed eight years ago, owns the right to mine for gold, rare earths and a range of other critical minerals over an area five times the size of Greater London.\n\nGold production has already begun, from a dormant mine brought back to life by Amaroq’s energetic chief executive Eldur Olafsson. Production will ramp up next year, with a target of up to 20,000 ounces of gold.\n\nProfits should accelerate exploration for other commodities, including copper and rare earths, and, speeding the process along, Olafsson has this month acquired two new sites on Greenland’s west coast. These include another dormant mine, which previously produced lead, zinc and silver.\n\nThe deals were partially financed by an oversubscribed £45 million stock market fund-raise, supported by UK, American and European investors, including Denmark’s state-backed export and investment fund.\n\nOlafsson has his work cut out in turning all this potential into commercial reality, but he has made encouraging progress and investors seem impressed.\n\nMidas tipped Amaroq in 2022 at 44p. Today the shares are 80p and brokers expect the price to rise further, boosted by heady sales and profits growth.\n\nWith Greenland in the international spotlight and Amaroq in pole position, the shares should deliver long-term rewards.\n\nTraded on: Aim \n\nTicker: AMRQ \n\nContact: amaroqminerals.com \n\nValterra Platinum\n\nPlatinum has been used in jewellery since Ancient Egyptian times. Lustrous, rare and hard-wearing, it is a top choice for wedding and engagement rings to this day.\n\nDespite its romantic allure, however, industry accounts for the vast majority of demand for platinum and its partners in mine, palladium and rhodium.\n\nThe trio, known as platinum group metals (PGMs), can be found in products from medical tools to computer panels, they are core components for green energy technologies and play a central role in catalytic converters, which reduce exhaust emissions and have been mandatory for years in the UK, Europe and America.\n\nPrices of these metals have been volatile, as forecasters predicted that combustion engines would soon be replaced by electric vehicles and that demand for PGMs would fall off a cliff.\n\nNow it seems the doom-mongers were mistaken and Valterra Platinum should benefit. The Johannesburg-based group split off from parent Anglo American on June 1 and is now an independent company listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe shares have had a good start but, at £29.72, there should be more growth to come.\n\nValterra is the largest PGM group in the world, with huge mines and top-quality processing plants used both in-house and by other mining groups.\n\nAnnual production is focused on platinum, palladium and rhodium, but other metals are part of the business too, including gold, copper and chrome.\n\nThe range should work in Valterra’s favour, while trends in the electric vehicle market are helpful too. Interest in these cars is growing far more slowly than predicted, with traditional cars accounting for more than 90 per cent of sales outside China last year.\n\nThat means catalytic converters remain very much in demand. Valterra is also looking into new uses for PGMs, including batteries for electric cars, hydrogen power and even food containers to keep produce fresh for longer.\n\nChief executive Craig Miller is an experienced operator and he is determined to use Valterra’s scale and heft to best advantage.\n\nThe group also intends to pay out 40 per cent of underlying profits in dividends, which suggests generous future payments.\n\nWith platinum in demand and Valterra firing on all cylinders, the shares should deliver long-term rewards at £30.20. It is also reassuring to see a company choosing to list in London.\n\nTraded on: main market \n\nTicker: VALT \n\nContact: valterraplatinum.com \n\nSovereign Metals\n\nRio Tinto is one of the largest mining companies in the world, valued on the stock market at more than £70 billion.\n\nAs a giant of the industry, it can pick and choose who to do business with, and last summer it chose Sovereign Metals, an Aim-listed junior, focused on titanium and graphite in Malawi.\n\nStarting out with a 15 per cent stake in the business, Rio has built up its holding to 18.5 per cent, provided in-depth technical support and invested in a study to see whether the mine is feasible. The signs are good so far.\n\nSovereign’s mine, Kasiya, covers around 75 square miles, roughly the size of Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nThe site is home to the world’s largest known deposit of rutile, an oxide mineral composed of titanium dioxide, and the second largest graphite resource.\n\nRutile can be processed to create high-grade titanium dioxide, while graphite plays a key role in steel production and is a central component of lithium-ion batteries used for electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\nChina dominates the graphite industry, so much so that President Trump has threatened top Chinese operators with tariffs of more than 700 per cent!\n\nSovereign could change the dynamics of this market.\n\nBacked by Rio Tinto, it intends to become the lowest-cost graphite producer in the world, beating China at its own game by delivering a mineral that is top quality, reasonably priced and produced with green credentials.\n\nChairman Ben Stoikovich has already completed extensive, practical studies on his mine, aided by Rio Tinto.\n\nBy the end of this year he hopes to publish a definitive report assessing Kasiya’s economic viability. Once the report is done, Rio has six months to decide whether to continue with the partnership, mount a full-blown bid for Sovereign or walk away.\n\nSupporters are confident that Sovereign will deliver a world-class mine, come what may.\n\nThe shares have had a roller-coaster ride in recent months, soaring to 48p before Stoikovich embarked on a £20 million fund-raise in March by issuing shares at a 13 per cent discount.\n\nToday the stock is 32p but should recover over the months ahead.\n\nTitanium and graphite are on critical mineral lists around the world, and Rio Tinto’s investment suggests that Sovereign’s mine is a good ’un.\n\nTraded on: Aim \n\nTicker: SVM \n\nContact: sovereignmetals.com.au","summary":"In the midst of World War One, the American government made a disturbing discovery - several vital metals needed for the military effort were increasingly hard to find.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/mailplus/article-14834569/Midas-soaring-value-rare-minerals-world-rushing-grab.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/21/15/99594959-0-image-a-14_1750516201314.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-22 00:47:45","author":"Editor,Joanne Hart","authors":["Editor","Joanne Hart"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.474},{"id":333865056,"title":"Trump to address the nation after 'successful attack' on Iran's nuclear sites","text":"President Donald Trump will address the nation at 10 p.m. ET Saturday after announcing on Truth Social that the United States bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. \n\n'I will be giving an Address to the Nation at 10:00 P.M., at the White House, regarding our very successful military operation in Iran,' the president posted to Truth Social.

Iranian state media reported that the three nuclear sites were evacuated “some time ago.” The U.S. strike, which was conducted without congressional authorization, comes just over a week after Israel launched dozens of strikes against targets in Iran, with Tehran responding in turn. The attacks ended talks between the U.S. and Iran over a new nuclear deal, after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the previous agreement between the two countries struck during Barack Obama's second term. Trump has argued that Iran is very close to a nuclear weapon. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, however, testified to Congress in March that the U.S. intelligence community did not believe that Iran was building such a weapon. “I don’t care what she said.

Far from a banal observation, his statement situates migration within its long historical context, reminding us that «America was built by immigrants» and that while hostility toward newcomers may be «understandable», it is «entirely misguided», as opposition has always existed.\n\nIn his ten-minute address, Blanchard focused particularly on the paradoxes of our time. Despite globalization supposedly enabling greater connection, «it’s precisely when the world becomes a village that moving freely becomes more difficult». He attributed this to a longstanding «fear of mixing», a phenomenon with deep historical roots that now finds new forms of expression, particularly through digital technologies.\n\nThree Contemporary Shocks\n\nBlanchard identified three major «shocks» shaping current migration debates. The first is demographic and economic: «Do you want to receive twice the pension?» A seemingly simple question that speaks to the challenges of aging Western societies.\n\nThe second is global inequality: «Most countries won’t be able to remain wealthy» as wealth is redistributed on a global scale. The third, and perhaps most unpredictable, is the climate crisis: «Climate risk is equivalent to the risk of war», Blanchard warned, given its power to trigger massive and unforeseen population movements.\n\nThe Political Instrumentalization of Migration\n\nThe conversation then turned to the increasingly politicized nature of migration. Andrea Rea, a sociology professor in Belgium, spoke of a «toxic instrumentalization» that has come to permeate broader societal debates. Migration, he noted, is now wielded as diplomatic leverage between countries.\n\nThis dynamic cuts across traditional political lines. As Blanchard pointed out, «Donald Trump wasn’t elected only by white men. White women voted for him too and so did many minorities». Opinions on migration, he argued, are far more nuanced, even among the communities most affected.\n\nBlanchard called for a fundamental rethinking of how migration is approached, as a means of combating the global rise of the far right. That begins, he argued, with education by «deconstructing xenophobia». Xenophobia, he insisted, «is not abstract. It’s a culture», rooted in colonial history and sustained by historical stereotypes.\n\nToday’s youth, he added, reject these outdated narratives. For them, the fear of the Other «can no longer hold». And as Blanchard powerfully concluded: «What we need to change is not human mobility, but the fixity of our fears». The new generation, he believes, may well drive that change.\n\nCulture as a Universal Tool\n\n«Culture opens doors when it listens rather than judges or rejects, it softens migration». These words from documentary filmmaker Kamal Redouani, who has worked extensively in conflict zones such as Syria, brought a deeply human perspective to the discussion. Sharing the story of Marwa, a young actress from Aleppo forced into exile, he emphasized how «culture gives people a voice of dignity».\n\nHis message resonated particularly within the Moroccan context, where cultural diversity is a strength. The very fact that this forum was held during the Gnaoua and World Music Festival is a testament to that.\n\nRedouani also stressed the importance of «making room» for migrants and seeing the people behind the numbers. «We talk about statistics, but we forget where they’ve been», he said, recalling a poignant encounter with an elderly man on the road to exile: «I left my home behind, but I did not leave my memory». A sentence that, on its own, captures the strength, resilience, and dignity of those who continue to move forward despite having no guarantees for tomorrow.\n\nCrossing Borders Through Screens\n\nIn an era where physical borders are increasingly blurred by digital networks, historian Yvan Gastaut posed a new question: how do we rethink migration in a hyper-connected world? He spoke of the «deterritorialization» brought about by constant digital access: «Will our longing for elsewhere be satisfied by this deterritorialization, which ultimately reduces the weight of physical space?»\n\nGastaut’s reflection challenges us to reconsider the mobilities of tomorrow. While digital platforms symbolically erase borders and offer access to other cultures, they also risk creating a homogenized world. The world appears more open but at the cost of a growing uniformity that raises as many concerns as it does hopes.","summary":"From June 19 to 21, as part of the Gnaoua and World Music Festival, the 12th edition of the Human Rights Forum brought together researchers, artists, and policymakers to explore a timely theme: «Human Mobility and Cultural Dynamics».

Bunker Buster Bombs?\n\nThe “bunker buster” refers to several deep-penetrating ordinances, but in targeting Fordow, the U.S. military likely needed to use the GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, Rafael Grossi, told the BBC on Monday the Fordow site—which is reportedly located between 260-295 feet underground—has seen “very limited if any damage,” even though centrifuges at the key Natanz facility have been “severely damaged if not destroyed.” The 30,000-pound precision-guided weapon is the largest and heaviest piece of conventional air-dropped bomb deployed by the U.S. military. The bomb is also significantly larger than the biggest “bunker buster” in the Israeli military’s arsenal, the 5,000-pound GBU-28. The GBU-57 is believed to be capable of penetrating about 200 feet of mountain rock before it detonates.\n\nWhy Was The U.s. Military Needed To Deploy The Bunker Busters?\n\nDue to the GBU-57’s massive size it can only be deployed by the B-2 Spirit stealth strategic bomber. The B-2 is only operated by the U.S. Air Force and the Israeli military lacks any large strategic bombers in its fleet to deliver such a weapon.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe Israel-Iran conflict reignited a little more than a week ago when Israeli forces carried out strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, killing several top Iranian generals and nuclear scientists. The two countries have exchanged military strikes since then, with Israel claiming Iran was close to developing a nuclear weapon. Israel also said this week it could carry out the attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities without help from the U.S. Trump mulled joining the Israeli strikes over the past four days and called for Iran’s unconditional surrender. Iran has insisted it is prepared for a long confrontation with Israel, while Trump has claimed the U.S. is “not looking for a long-term war… I only want one thing: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” Israeli strikes against Iran continued Saturday, when Iran’s health ministry reported some 400 people had been killed and over 3,000 people injured.\n\nGot a tip?

But U.S. and Israeli officials have said that American stealth bombers and a 30,000-lb. bunker buster bomb they alone can carry offered the best chance of destroying heavily-fortified sites connected to the Iranian nuclear program buried deep underground.\n\n“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,” Trump said in a post on social media. “All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home.”\n\nTrump said B-2 stealth bombers were used but did not specify which types of bombs were dropped. The White House and Pentagon did not immediately elaborate on the operation.\n\nThe strikes are a perilous decision for the U.S. as Iran has pledged to retaliate if it joined the Israeli assault, and for Trump personally, having won the White House on the promise of keeping America out of costly foreign conflicts and scoffed at the value of American interventionism.\n\nTrump told reporters on Friday that he was not interested in sending ground forces into Iran. He had previously indicated that he would make a final choice over the course of two weeks, a timeline that seemed drawn out as the situation was evolving quickly.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on Wednesday the United States that strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them.” And Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei declared “any American intervention would be a recipe for an all-out war in the region.”\n\nTrump has vowed that he would not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon and he had initially hoped that the threat of force would bring the country’s leaders to give up its nuclear program peacefully.\n\nIsrael ‘s military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, while Iran’s foreign minister warned before the U.S. attack that American military involvement “would be very, very dangerous for everyone.”\n\nThe prospect of a wider war threatened, too. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they would resume attacks on U.S. vessels in the Red Sea if the Trump administration joins Israel’s military campaign. The Houthis paused such attacks in May under a deal with the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Israel announced the U.S. had begun “assisted departure flights,” the first from Israel since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war in Gaza.\n\nBut Trump appears to have made the calculation — at the prodding of Israeli officials and many Republican lawmakers — that Israel’s operation had softened the ground and presented a perhaps unparalleled opportunity to set back Iran’s nuclear program, perhaps permanently.\n\nThe Israelis say their offensive has already crippled Iran’s air defenses, allowing them to already significantly degrade multiple Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nBut to destroy the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, Israel has appealed to Trump for U.S. bunker-busting bombs, the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets and then explode. The penetrator is currently only delivered by the B-2 stealth bomber, which is only found in the American arsenal.\n\nThe bomb carries a conventional warhead, and is believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is producing highly enriched uranium at Fordo, raising the possibility that nuclear material could be released into the area if the GBU-57 A/B were used to hit the facility.\n\nPrevious Israeli strikes at another Iranian nuclear site, Natanz, on a centrifuge site have caused contamination only at the site itself, not the surrounding area, the IAEA has said.\n\nTrump’s decision for direct U.S. military intervention comes after his administration made an unsuccessful two-month push — including with high-level, direct negotiations with the Iranians — aimed at persuading Tehran to curb its nuclear program.\n\nFor months, Trump said he was dedicated to a diplomatic push to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions. And he twice — in April and again in late May — persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on military action against Iran and give diplomacy more time.\n\nThe U.S. in recent days has been shifting military aircraft and warships into and around the Middle East to protect Israel and U.S. bases from Iranian attacks.\n\nAll the while, Trump has gone from publicly expressing hope that the moment could be a “second chance” for Iran to make a deal to delivering explicit threats on Khamenei and making calls for Tehran’s unconditional surrender.\n\n“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump said in a social media posting. “He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”\n\nThe military showdown with Iran comes seven years after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-administration brokered agreement in 2018, calling it the “worst deal ever.”\n\nThe 2015 deal, signed by Iran, U.S. and other world powers, created a long-term, comprehensive nuclear agreement that limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nTrump decried the Obama-era deal for giving Iran too much in return for too little, because the agreement did not cover Iran’s non-nuclear malign behavior.\n\nTrump has bristled at criticism from some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who have suggested that further U.S. involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end U.S. involvement in expensive and endless wars.\n\nRising reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

On Monday, a pro-Iranian account on X called SilencedSirs claimed that \"two giant cargo planes flying from China to Iran turned off their tracking signals before entering Iranian airspace\".\nAccording to SilencedSirs, the proof is two-fold: a video shared in a post viewed over six million times made by a supposed media outlet called Prime Scope, and a screenshot of an aircraft's route tracked by Flightradar24, purporting to show one of the planes in Iranian airspace. According to France 254, since Friday, many Internet users have also been sharing other Flightradar24 images purporting to show several flights from China entering Iran.

This is alarming. Trump is taking the bet that sending in the U.S. Air Force with “bunker buster” bombs will once and for all end Iran’s nuclear threat. But anticipating U.S. military capabilities is very different from dealing with what the volatile leaders of Iran or Israel will choose next. After launching missile strikes inside Iran and killing key leaders of Iran’s nuclear program and the Revolutionary Guard, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear he sees an opportunity to topple the government in Iran, telling Fox News that Israel is “geared to do whatever is necessary to achieve our dual aim, to remove ... two existential threats” and that killing the leader of Iran “could certainly be the result because the Iran regime is weak.” Iran has also arrayed its missile systems towards U.S. military assets in the region, which include the 5th fleet based in Bahrain and military bases in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. While world leaders agree that Iran is a hostile regime and that, in Netanyahu’s words, “we can’t have the world’s most dangerous regime have the world’s most dangerous weapons,” the ongoing military escalation and retaliation were not the only path toward security and stability in the Middle East. Diplomacy worked before. Ten years ago, in 2015, Iran agreed to dismantle its nuclear program and allow United Nations weapons inspectors inside the country for regular monitoring and review. By all accounts, this worked to halt weapons-grade uranium enrichment, if not Iran’s other hostile activities. But despite fashioning himself as the dealmaker-in-chief, President Donald Trump pulled out of the original deal in 2018 and has yet to secure a new one. In the first go-around, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom an the United States — plus Germany were involved in a deeply deliberative process. This time, Iran is asking the United States to calm the waters and Russia is offering to secure Iran’s uranium, while Trump leaves a meeting with G-7 leaders warning “everyone should evacuate Tehran.” So yes, you should be worried — because cooler heads are not prevailing. Netanyahu is poised to open hostilities on a third front, adding to the conflicts Israel is engaged in in Gaza and Lebanon, and his bravado is dragging the United States along: As the primary supplier and funder of the Israeli military, the United States is by default considered complicit in Israel’s actions, the conceit being that Israel would never dare move beyond the comfort zone of U.S. geopolitics. What makes this moment even more worrisome is that Trump never laid down any consistent theory of when and how the United States will engage militarily other than the America First pablum of eliminating dependency, aka humanitarian aid, and withdrawing from foreign wars. Trump’s reluctance to support regime change in Iran created a rift with his first-term national security adviser John Bolton, who is now surely salivating at the idea of this current opportunity. But MAGA allies such as Tucker Carlson are breaking with Trump over this moment, saying continued military support of Israel would be a betrayal of the commitment to let other countries “fight their own wars.” Trump, like presidents before him, has promised to come to the defense of Israel; how far does that commitment go when facing a capable Iranian military and a population nine times the size of Israel? What happens if a U.S. military installation in an Arab country is attacked? What happens if U.S. citizens are killed? Trump could soon find himself and the American public dragged into a very high-stakes choice between keeping an ally happy or investing in another doomed, boots-on-the-ground war of regime change.","summary":"President Donald Trump shared on Truth Social that the U.S. attacked the three major Iranian nuclear sites Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/us-attacked-3-iranian-nuclear-sites-trump-says-truth-social-rcna213400","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250616-tehran-iran-smoke-ac-1043p-c4de47.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-22 00:21:42","author":"Nayyera Haq","authors":["Nayyera Haq"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.25},{"id":333865312,"title":"Trump says US has attacked three nuclear sites in Iran","text":"Donald Trump announced Saturday that the US had completed strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, directly joining Israel ’s effort to destroy the country’s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe amid Tehran’s threat of reprisals that could spark a wider regional conflict.\n\n“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,” Trump said in a post on social media. “All planes are now outside of Iran air space.

The movement comes as US President Donald Trump considers military options on Iran amid the ongoing conflict, including the possibility of launching an airstrike. Also Read | Israel-Iran War: Israeli Air Force Kills Amin for Judaki, UAV Commander in Revolutionary Guards' Air Force.\nA US defence official said that no official orders have been issued to carry out an operation using the B-2 bombers. As of Saturday, the aircraft were flying over the Pacific Ocean and appeared to be en route to Guam, as reported by CNN. Two defence officials emphasised that the deployment of the B-2s does not signal an imminent operation but is instead part of a strategy to keep military options open for the US President. Another official explained that such movements also serve as a show of force to deter potential adversaries as Trump continues to weigh his choices.

Each B-2 can carry two of these powerful bombs. This strategic redeployment follows a week in which Trump has spent considerable time in the White House Situation Room reviewing military plans and asking advisors about potential outcomes. He has stated that a decision on military action could come sooner than the two-week window he previously mentioned, CNN reported. Meanwhile, on Friday night, eight KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft, which are aerial refuelling tankers, departed from Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma, CNN reported, citing data from FlightRadar24. These refuelling planes reportedly met up with two groups of aircraft, identified via air traffic control as MYTEE11 FLT and MYTEE21 FLT -- callsigns commonly linked to B-2 bomber operations. The bombers were refuelled over Kansas, California's coast, and again near Hawaii. Satellite images from Thursday also showed six KC-135 tankers positioned at Diego Garcia, a strategic refuelling point in the Indian Ocean, potentially in preparation for further bomber movement toward Iran.

Thomas Massie, a libertarian Republican often at odds with the new Trump administration.Senator John Fetterman, the Democrat from Pennsylvania who is among strongest supporters of Israel in the caucus, called it \"the correct move.\"Online, MAGA supporters and influencers were far less assured.

While Trump fired a few dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria in the first year of his first term — and famously ordered the strike that killed Qasem Soleimani in 2020 — Iran is another matter.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - Israel 's military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, while Iran's foreign minister warned that U.S. military involvement \"would be very, very dangerous for everyone.\"\n\nThe prospect of a wider war threatened, too. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they would resume attacks on U.S. vessels in the Red Sea if the Trump administration joins Israel's military campaign. The Houthis paused such attacks in May under a deal with the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Israel announced the U.S. has begun \"assisted departure flights,\" the first from Israel since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's military said it struck an Iranian nuclear research facility overnight and killed three senior Iranian commanders in pursuit of its goal to destroy Iran's nuclear program. Smoke rose near a mountain in Isfahan, where the province's deputy governor for security affairs, Akbar Salehi, confirmed Israeli strikes damaged the facility.\n\nThe target was a centrifuge production site, Israel's military said. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed the attack and said the facility - also targeted in the war's first day - was \"extensively damaged,\" but that there was no risk of off-site contamination.\n\nIran again launched drones and missiles at Israel but there were no reports of significant damage. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity under army guidelines, estimated the military has taken out more than 50% of Iran's launchers.\n\n\"We're making it harder for them to fire toward Israel,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military's chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, later said Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir told the army to prepare for a \"prolonged campaign.\"\n\nUS aerial refueling tankers on the move\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is weighing active U.S. military involvement in the war, and was set to meet with his national security team Saturday evening. He has said he would put off his decision for up to two weeks.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said U.S. military involvement \"would be very, very dangerous for everyone.\" He spoke on the sidelines of an Organization of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Turkey. Araghchi was open to further dialogue but emphasized that Iran had no interest in negotiating with the U.S. while Israel continues to attack.\n\nBarring a commando raid or even a nuclear strike, Iran's underground Fordo uranium enrichment facility is considered out of reach to all but America's \"bunker-buster\" bombs. The U.S. has only configured and programmed its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to deliver the bomb, according to the Air Force.\n\nOn Saturday, multiple U.S. aerial refueling tankers were spotted on commercial flight trackers flying patterns consistent with escorting aircraft from the central U.S. to the Pacific. B-2 bombers are based in Missouri. It was not clear whether the aircraft were a show of force or prepared for an operation. The White House and Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe war's toll\n\nThe war erupted June 13, with Israeli airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 722 people, including 285 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,500 wounded, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group.\n\nOne Tehran resident, Nasrin, writhed in her hospital bed as she described how a blast threw her against her apartment wall. \"I've had five surgeries. I think I have nothing right here that is intact,\" she said Saturday. Another patient, Shahram Nourmohammadi, said he had been making deliveries when \"something blew up right in front of me.\"\n\nSeveral Iranians have fled the country. \"Everyone is leaving Tehran right now,\" said one who did not give his name after crossing into Armenia.\n\nFor many Iranians, it is difficult to know what's going on. Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org said Saturday that limited internet access had again \"collapsed.\" A nationwide internet shutdown has lasted for several days.\n\nIran has retaliated by firing more than 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli army estimates. Israel's multitiered air defenses have shot down most of them, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and over 1,000 wounded.\n\nNo date has been set for more talks after negotiations in Geneva failed to produce a breakthrough Friday.\n\nIran's nuclear program\n\nIran has long maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state to enrich uranium up to 60% - a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Israel is widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear weapons program but has never acknowledged it.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel's military operation will continue \"for as long as it takes\" to eliminate what he called the existential threat of Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile arsenal.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday that his country will never renounce its right to nuclear power, which \"cannot be taken away from it through war and threats.\" Pezeshkian told French President Emmanuel Macron via phone that Iran is ready to provide guarantees and confidence-building measures to demonstrate the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities, according to IRNA, the state-run news agency.\n\nIran previously agreed to limit its uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors access to its nuclear sites under a 2015 deal in exchange for sanctions relief. But after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal during his first term, Iran began enriching uranium up to 60% and restricting access to its nuclear facilities.\n\nIran has insisted on its right to enrich uranium - at lower levels - in recent talks over its nuclear program. But Trump, like Israel, has demanded Iran end its enrichment program altogether.\n\nAttacks on Iranian military commanders\n\nIsrael's defense minister said the military killed a paramilitary Revolutionary Guard commander who financed and armed Hamas in preparation for the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nIranian officials did not immediately confirm Saeed Izadi's death, but the Qom governor's office said a four-story apartment building was hit and local media reported two people had been killed.\n\nIsrael also said it killed the commander of the Quds Force's weapons transfer unit, who it said was responsible for providing weapons to Hezbollah and Hamas. Behnam Shahriyari was killed while traveling in western Iran, the military said.\n\nIran threatens head of UN nuclear watchdog\n\nIranian leaders say IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's statements about the status of Iran's nuclear program prompted Israel's attack. On Saturday, a senior adviser for Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamanei, Ali Larijani, said on social media, without elaboration, that Iran would make Grossi \"pay\" once the war is over.\n\nGrossi on Friday warned against attacks on Iran's nuclear reactors, particularly its only commercial nuclear power plant in the southern city of Bushehr. A direct hit \"would result in a very high release of radioactivity,\" Grossi said, adding: \"This is the nuclear site in Iran where the consequences could be most serious.\"\n\nIsrael has not targeted Iran's nuclear reactors, instead focusing on the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, centrifuge workshops near Tehran, laboratories in Isfahan and the country's Arak heavy water reactor southwest of the capital.\n\nRising reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Associated Press writers Mehmet Guzel in Istanbul; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Samy Magdy in Cairo; Matthew Lee in Washington, D.C.; and Farnoush Amiri and Jon Gambrell in Dubai contributed to this report.","summary":"President Donald Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military struck three sites in Iran, directly joining Israel's effort to decapitate the country's nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe amid Tehran's threat of reprisals that could spark a wider regional conflict.","url":"https://abc7chicago.com/post/us-has-struck-iranian-nuclear-sites-trump-says-joining-israeli-air-campaign/16811258/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/9259093_010120-wls-breaking-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-22 00:07:21","author":"Aamer Madhani Associated Press","authors":["Aamer Madhani Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.159}]}
