Circuit on Monday blocked President Donald Trump from immediately firing Lisa Cook from her role on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the latest in a high-stakes court fight that is almost certain to be quickly appealed to the Supreme Court. The 2-1 ruling from Judges Gregory Katsas, Michelle Childs, and Brad Garcia keeps in place a lower court order handed down last week by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, which reinstated her to her role on the Fed's Board of Governors. Judge Cobb said in the preliminary injunction last week that Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and Cook's due process protections. That decision prompted the Trump administration to appeal the case to the higher court for emergency relief. \"When Governors by misconduct or gross neglect erode the foundations of such confidence, the President acts properly and lawfully by removing them,\" Justice Department attorneys said in appealing the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. The 2-1 ruling from the appeals court is a near-term blow to the Trump administration. It comes after Trump announced on social media last month that he would be firing Cook from her position on the independent Fed board due to allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook's lawyers immediately sued Trump over his attempt to remove her far before the end of her 14-year tenure, arguing that he did not have sufficient cause to do so. Cook has denied any wrongdoing.

Joe Lombardo of Nevada on Monday kicked off his 2026 re-election campaign in the crucial western battleground state. Lombardo, the only challenger to defeat an incumbent governor in the 2022 elections as he edged out Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, made Nevada the only blue-to-red governor flip that year. Fast-forward four years and Lombardo, the former sheriff of Las Vegas anchored Clark County, is certain to face a bruising re-election, and is widely considered to be the most at-risk GOP governor seeking another term. Lombardo warned of the risks ahead if the Democrats retake the governor's office. And he said he's the backstop against what he described as the \"woke, California agenda\" from Nevada's bigger neighbor to the west. TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT BUT FRONT-AND-CENTER IN 2025 ELECTIONS \"I’ll continue to do everything in my power to stop Gavin Newson from imposing his left-wing agenda on Nevada. As long as I’m your governor, I won’t ever accept Californians telling Nevadans what to do or making us pay the price for their bad ideas,\" Lombardo said, according to an excerpt shared with Fox News Digital ahead of delivery. Lombardo, speaking at Rancho High School in North Las Vegas, where he graduated and launched his first campaign for governor four years ago, also spotlighted his accomplishments while emphasizing the \"unfinished business\" to secure Nevada's future. The governor touted cutting over 600 regulations during his tenure steering the state, and said Nevada has experienced four percent annual job growth since 2022, which he touted made it the sixth-fastest state in the nation for employment growth. Lombardo also pointed to delivering the single largest education investment in state history, signing into law a school choice expansion bill, a double-digit raise for law enforcement, and allocating $130 million for middle class housing. The Democratic Governors Association (DGA), which called Lombardo \"the most vulnerable Republican governor in America,\" pointed ahead of his announcement to what it called his \"failed record.\" The DGA argued that Lombardo \"twists himself into knots trying to defend his disastrous agenda that has left Nevada’s working families and small businesses behind.\" The Nevada Democratic Party tied Lombardo to President Donald Trump, slamming the governor for what they charged was his \"embrace of Trump’s reckless policies, all of which have led to worst-in-the-nation unemployment rates, a growing housing crisis, and sky-high costs.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford and Reno-anchored Washoe County commissioner Alexis Hill have both launched campaigns for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.","summary":"Republican Joe Lombardo, who flipped Nevada&apos;s governorship in 2022, kicks off his re-election bid as the most vulnerable GOP governor seeking another term.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-governor-targeted-democrats-launches-re-election-bid-key-battleground","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Nevada-Election-Results-Joe-Lombardo-Governor-Race.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6360664094112","publish_date":"2025-09-16 00:30:35","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":360806526,"title":"Senate approves White House economist to serve on Fed board","text":"By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate has approved one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers for a seat on the Federal Reserve’s governing board, giving the White House greater influence over the central bank just two days before it is expected to vote in favor of reducing its key interest rate.\n\nThe vote to confirm Stephen Miran was largely along party lines, 48-47.

Gavin Newsom would temporarily set aside districts crafted by an independent state commission and replace them with dramatically reshaped districts drafted by Democrats and designed to benefit the party's candidates.\n\nIf approved, it's possible the new political maps could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state while bolstering Democratic incumbents in other battleground districts in the 2026 midterm elections. That could boost the Democratic margin to 48 of California’s 52 congressional seats, up from the 43 seats the party now holds.\n\nSpeaking at the University of Southern California, Schwarzenegger repeatedly stressed the proposal would set aside maps drawn in a public process by an independent commission he promoted as governor, and replace it with partisan maps shaped behind closed doors and blessed by “the politicians.” He never directly criticized Newsom or the Legislature's Democratic majority, which endorsed the proposal.\n\nSchwarzenegger signaled last month he would actively oppose the ballot proposal, posting a photo of himself lifting weights on the social platform X while in a T-shirt imprinted with the slogan, “Terminate Gerrymandering” and a partially obscured obscenity aimed at “the politicians.”\n\n“I’m getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,” he wrote.\n\nBut it's not yet clear how involved the wealthy former governor and one-time bodybuilding champion will be in the campaign, in which he could finance advertising and use his global celebrity to influence voters. Schwarzenegger, a centrist, is a longtime critic of Trump who has argued the parties need to move away from the extremes to break Washington gridlock.\n\nStill, he's remains a formidable political presence 15 years after he left office.\n\n“I don’t think you want to run against Arnold Schwarzenegger,” said Bill Whalen, a fellow at Stanford University’s right-leaning Hoover Institution.\n\nCalifornia and Texas — the nation’s two most populous states — have emerged as the center of a partisan turf war in the House that is spiraling into other states as well as the courts in what amounts to a proxy war ahead of the 2026 elections.\n\nNewsom has cast the contest as a showdown with Trump, as Republicans seek to maintain the party's slim House majority.\n\n“We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,” Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender, said at a Los Angeles rally last month. “Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back.”","summary":"Arnold Schwarzenegger on Monday entered the national battle over U.S. House control, urging voters to reject a California ballot proposal to rejigger districts that he said would erode democratic principles and allow politicians to 'take the power away from the people.'

The livestream of the two-hour program was broadcast in the White House press briefing room and featured a series of appearances by White House and administration officials who knew the 31-year-old Kirk.\n\nVance, who transported Kirk’s body home from Utah to Arizona aboard Air Force Two last week, opened by saying he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for, but I’ll do my best.” He recounted his conversations with Kirk’s widow, Erika, and her remembrances of him as a kind, loving husband.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Vance criticized what he said were lies about Kirk that he blamed for the killing. He also promised that the Trump administration will act to stop anyone who would kill another person because of their words. Kirk made comments over the years that some Democrats and others said were anti-immigrant, racist, misogynistic or offensive in other ways.\n\n“I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend,” Vance said on the program. “I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”\n\nKirk’s influence with Trump and Vance\n\nVance’s self-described “moonlighting” as substitute radio host, as well as the broadcasting of the program from the White House complex, served as a powerful reminder of Kirk’s close relationship with the Trump-Vance team and the valuable role Kirk’s operation boosting youth voter turnout played on the campaign.\n\nThe Republican vice president, 41, was especially close to Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, one of the nation’s largest political organizations with chapters on high school and college campuses. The two began a friendship nearly a decade ago, and Kirk advocated for Vance to be Republican Donald Trump’s choice for vice president last year. Kirk also was someone who had Trump’s ear.\n\nVance spoke in the show’s opening segment Monday about being at a loss for words as he sat with Erika Kirk last week. But he said she told him something he’ll never forget, which was that the father of their two young children had never raised his voice to her and was never “cross or mean-spirited to her.”\n\nVance allowed that he could not say the same about himself.\n\n“I took from that moment that I needed to be a better husband and I needed to be a better father,” the vice president said on the program, which airs on Rumble, a streaming platform. “That is the way I’m going to honor my friend.”\n\nWhite House and administration officials mourn Kirk\nOthers who joined Vance on Kirk’s program were White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., press secretary Karoline Leavitt and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\n\nThe conversation turned toward fighting what Vance described as “festering violence on the far left” with Miller, the first guest.\n\n“With God as my witness, we’re going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks,” Miller said. “It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie’s name.”\n\nLaw enforcement officials have said they believe the suspect accused of killing Kirk acted alone.\n\nThe relationship between Vance and Kirk\n\nVance, who said, “I owe so much to Charlie,” elaborated on his close friendship with Kirk in a lengthy social media post late on the night of the conservative activist’s killing. Vance said it started randomly around 2017 after he appeared on program by conservative host Tucker Carlson. Kirk sent Vance a private message through social media telling Vance he’d done a “great job.”\n\n“And that moment of kindness began a friendship that lasted until today,” the vice president wrote.\n\nVance said he and Kirk both initially were “skeptical” of Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign but had come around to support the now-two-time president.\n\nKirk was among the first people to hear from Vance in early 2021 when the Ohio Republican was “interested but skeptical” about running for a U.S. Senate seat, the vice president said in a testimony to Kirk’s role in his political rise.\n\n“We talked through everything, from the strategy to the fundraising to the grassroots of the movement he knew so well,” Vance said. “He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr., who “took a call from me because Charlie asked him too.”\n\nVance said Kirk arranged for him to speak to Kirk’s donors at a Turning Point USA event when he had no reason to help someone polling as low as he was at the time, “but he did it because we were friends, and because he was a good man.”\n\nVance and others credit Kirk’s efforts and influence with helping Trump win reelection.\n\n“So much of the success we’ve had in this administration traces directly to Charlie’s ability to organize and convene,” Vance said in the post. “He didn’t just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\n\nHe added on the program, “If it weren’t for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States … it’s one of the reasons why I feel so indebted to him.”\n\nVance as radio show host\n\nJody Baumgartner, a political science professor at East Carolina University in North Carolina, said Vance’s hosting duty likely was possible because vice presidents have more free time than presidents.\n\n“If President Trump had time to do something like this, don’t you think he would?” Baumgartner asked. “It’s an interesting question with respect to resources and time, but a vice president has the time that a president doesn’t.”\n\nAfter Kirk’s assassination\nAfter Kirk was fatally shot last Wednesday at Utah Valley University, Vance tore up his schedule for the next day — he was scheduled Thursday to attend the 24th annual observance in New York of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — to fly instead to Orem, Utah, with his wife, second lady Usha Vance.\n\nThe couple accompanied Erika Kirk and Charlie Kirk’s casket to Arizona aboard Air Force Two.\n\nAssociated Press writer Chris Megerian contributed reporting.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance said Monday while hosting Charlie Kirk’s radio show that he is “desperate” for national unity after the conservative political activist’s killing but that finding common ground with people who celebrated the assassination of his friend is impossible.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/15/vice-president-jd-vance-takes-the-mic-to-host-charlie-kirks-radio-show/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25258604588625.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 00:13:48","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":360806524,"title":"Trump explains away not ordering half-mast flag honors for Melissa Hortman","text":"President Donald Trump defended his order that flags be lowered to half-staff after last week’s slaying of conservative activist Charlie Kirk by suggesting he would have done the same following the assassination of a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker this summer had he been asked by the state’s governor.\n\nThat’s despite Trump saying at the time that he had no interest in calling Minnesota Gov.

The deal is expected to be finalised after President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump speak on Friday, Bessant said.\n\nTikTok has faced the threat of a ban in the US unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divested ownership due to what Washington purports to be national security concerns. \n\nLast year, under former US President Joe Biden, congress passed legislation mandating the separation, with anxious US politicians accusing Beijing of seeking to harvest the data of Tiktok’s youthful American users. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the measure, but 17 September had been viewed as a final deadline before a ban would take effect.\n\n[See more: China launches chip probes as US, Beijing open trade talks in Madrid]\n\n“The framework is for a switch to a US-controlled ownership,” Bessent told reporters, noting that it also enabled a short extension of the deadline to complete the deal. \n\nWhile mainly focused on TikTok, the Madrid discussions also touched on China’s export controls on rare earth minerals and its lack of US agricultural purchases, along with ways to curb money laundering and the illegal fentanyl trade. \n\nBessent said more in-depth trade talks were likely to happen “in about a month in a different location,” where rare earth minerals and magnets would take centre stage.

The Hamas leaders had been meeting to discuss the latest United States-backed proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nSheikh Tamim called for “concrete steps to address the state of madness of power, arrogance, and bloodthirstiness obsession that has befallen the government of Israel, and what resulted and continues to result from it”.\n\nThe attack on mediators proved that Israel had “no genuine interest in peace” and was seeking to “thwart negotiations” to end the war in Gaza that has killed more than 64,800 Palestinians, he said.\n\nThe emergency summit was organised after fury swept the region following Israeli strikes on September 9, which killed six people.\n\nThe GCC said that consultations were already under way among the bloc’s military bodies to build up “Gulf deterrent capabilities”, with a meeting of the group’s Unified Military Command to take place soon in Doha, according to Majed Mohammed Al-Ansari, spokesman for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No further details were available about the new defence mechanism, which states that an attack on one member state is an attack on all.\n\n“The joint statement obviously called for a meeting of the high command to be held here in Doha to discuss further steps to ensure that the safety and the joint security of the GCC countries is addressed,” Al-Ansari told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The GCC stands in one line,” he added.\n\nIsrael’s expansionist vision\n\nThe Qatari emir also warned against Israel’s expansionist vision of the region, with repeated bombings of Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Israel has also grabbed Syrian land and refused to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dreaming of making the Arab region “an Israeli sphere of influence”, Sheikh Tamim said, adding that it “is a dangerous illusion”.\n\nNo immediate political or economic measures were announced against the Israeli aggression at the summit.\n\nBut Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, the secretary-general of the GCC, urged US President Donald Trump to rein in Washington’s closest ally, Israel.\n\n“We expect our strategic partners in the US to use their influence on Israel for it to stop this behaviour – we really do expect that,” Albudaiwi said.\n\n“They have leverage and influence over Israel, and it’s about time that this leverage and influence are used”.\n\nDespite expectations of more forceful measures, the summit’s final communique largely consisted of condemnations and pledges of solidarity.\n\n“We condemn in the strongest terms Israel’s cowardly and illegal attack on the State of Qatar. We respond with absolute solidarity with Qatar and support for its steps,” read the memo issued by member states of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\n\nThe communique also praised Qatar’s response to the attacks, voiced solidarity with Doha’s mediation role alongside Egypt and the US, and rejected any justification for further aggression.\n\nThe member states also rejected “Israel’s repeated threats of the possibility of targeting Qatar again”.\n\nWhen questioned about these threats, as well as Israel’s resolve to target Hamas “anywhere”, Foreign Ministry spokesman Al-Ansari said Qatar would make use of the international system to hold Israel to account.\n\n“We will hold Israel accountable in the international community, and our tool in doing that is our belief in international law and international organisations,” he said.\n\n“This is why we went to the [United Nations] Security Council and now, of course, to the Arab and Islamic Organisations and GCC … we are working very closely with all our partners to make sure that we deter Prime Minister Netanyahu from attacking sovereign states again.”\n\nTougher calls by individual states\n\nWhile the joint communique stopped short of hard measures, several Arab and Islamic leaders tabled stronger, more actionable responses to Israel.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Arab and Muslim leaders to apply economic pressure on Israel, arguing that “past experience has proven the success of such pressure”.\n\nHe also called for Israeli officials to be brought to justice through international legal mechanisms.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said that “the heinous attack on Qatari territory is a grave violation of international law and sets a dangerous precedent”.\n\n“I say to the people of Israel that what is happening now is sabotaging the existing peace agreements, and the consequences will be dire,” he said. Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in 1979.\n\nPakistan, meanwhile, urged the UN to suspend Israel, and also called for an Arab-Islamic task force.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the task force should “adopt effective measures to ward off Israeli expansionist designs”.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, meanwhile, stated that “condemnations will not stop the missiles, declarations will not free Palestine”.\n\nHe pressed for strict sanctions and the suspension of diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian earlier on Monday had also urged Muslim nations to cut ties with Israel.\n\n“We should act together to stand up to Israeli behaviour because Israel has violated the sovereignty of a number of Arab and Muslim states under the false pretext of self-defence,” he said.\n\nAndrea Dessi, assistant professor of international relations at the University of Rome, said the Doha summit marked a change of tone among Arab Islamic states.\n\n“At the rhetorical level, we are seeing the beginnings of a coming together, of a change of tone and a change of mind – the actions will have to follow,” Dessi told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe professor said the event was important, as Arab and Muslim leaders agreed that “something has to change in terms of the security architecture of the region. We are far away from this, but there are movements”.\n\nAs the summit was being held in Doha, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio travelled to Israel to meet Netanyahu, who again threatened to target Hamas leaders if Qatar did not expel them. But Trump on Monday repeated his assertion that Israel would not strike Qatar again.\n\nAl-Ansari said that Qatar has “been engaging very closely with the Trump administration”.\n\nHe told reporters that Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani had “excellent” meetings in New York in the past week, and that discussions on next steps between the allies are taking place.\n\nRubio is expected to visit Doha on Tuesday.","summary":"The Gulf states pledge to activate the joint defence pact as Arab and Islamic leaders stand in solidarity with Qatar.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/16/gcc-vows-joint-defence-but-arab-islamic-summit-short-on-concrete-action?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-15T174517Z_1998133526_RC2HSGATB57D_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-QATAR-SUMMIT-FAMILY-1757980857.jpg?resize=1920%2C1362","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 00:00:15","author":"Apps Support,Urooba Jamal","authors":["Apps Support","Urooba Jamal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":360806340,"title":"Trump administration joins Republicans' campaign to police speech in reaction to Kirk's murder (World)","text":"Vice President JD Vance on Monday jumped onto the conservative movement demanding consequences for those who have cheered Charlie Kirk's killing, calling on the public to turn in anyone who says distasteful things about the assassination of his friend and political ally.\n\n“When you see someone celebrating Charlie’s murder, call them out,” Vance urged listeners on the slain activist’s podcast Monday. “And hell, call their employer.”\n\nVance's call also included a vow to target some of the biggest funders of liberal causes as conservatives stepped up their targeting of private individuals for their comments about the killing. It marked an escalation in a campaign that some warned invoked some of the darkest chapters of American history.\n\n“The government involvement in this does inch this closer to looking like McCarthyism,” said Adam Goldstein of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, referring to the 1950s campaign to root out communists that led to false allegations and ruined careers. “It was not a shining moment for free expression.”\n\nCampaign broadens to those who quote Kirk critically\n\nRepublican-controlled states such as Florida, Oklahoma and Texas have launched investigations of teachers accused of inappropriate statements after last week’s assassination. The U.S. military has invited members of the public to report those who “celebrate or mock” the killing and said some troops have already been removed for their comments.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration has vowed to target what it contends is a “vast” liberal network that inspired the shooter, even as authorities maintain it appears he acted alone and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe campaign has broadened to include even those whose statements were critical of Kirk without celebrating his assassination.\n\nThe Washington Post fired Karen Attiah, an opinion columnist, for posts on the day of the shooting that lamented how “white America” was not ready to solve gun violence and that quoted Kirk denigrating the intelligence of prominent Black women such as Michelle Obama.\n\nPEN America, a press freedom group, warned in a statement that firings like Attiah's “risk creating a chilling effect.”\n\nGoldstein worried there were many cases of people targeted for simply quoting Kirk or failing to mourn his passing adequately. “That’s one of the key symptoms of cancel culture,” he said. “Trying to paint everyone with the same brush.”\n\nConservatives coined the term cancel culture for what they claimed was persecution of those on the right for their views, especially related to the COVID-19 pandemic and Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, leading to campaigns to get regular people fired.\n\nIt was a significant cause for President Donald Trum p, who pledged to end it during his campaign last year. But after the Kirk killing, he and his administration have instead leaned into it from the right.\n\nA hero to conservatives, a provocateur to many Democrats\n\nA father of two and a Christian conservative, Kirk was a hero to many Trump Republicans for his fiery warnings about the dangers of Democrats and ability to organize young voters. But Kirk also was a provocateur and supporter of Trump’s attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss who left a long record of partisan quips that enraged many on the left.\n\n“According to Kirk, empathy is a made-up new-age term, so keep the jokes coming. It’s what he would have wanted,” read one post on X that Melvin Villaver Jr., a Clemson University music professor, re-posted the day of the killing, according to a screenshot circulated by college Republicans demanding his firing. Clemson eventually fired one staffer and suspended Villaver and another professor after intense pressure from elected South Carolina Republican officials.\n\nOther targeted posters, such as Army Lt. Col. Christopher Ladnier, simply quoted Kirk on the day of his assassination. This included Kirk calling the Civil Rights Act a “beast” that “has now turned into an anti-white weapon,\" his criticism of Martin Luther King Jr. and his statement that some gun deaths are the cost of a robust Second Amendment.\n\nLadnier, who has been targeted by conservative activists online, said in a Facebook message to The Associated Press that he would respond “when/if” his chain of command takes action.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott approvingly posted a video of a Texas Tech University student who was arrested Friday after a confrontation at a campus vigil for Kirk, writing: “This is what happened to the person who was mocking Charlie Kirk’s assassination at Texas Tech.\"\n\nSome people targeted have been victims of mistaken identity.\n\nA school district in rural Elkhorn, Wisconsin, reported receiving more than 800 messages after one conservative influencer mistakenly identified an associate principal at an elementary school as celebrating Kirk's death.\n\nTop Republicans vow to go after ‘domestic terrorist network’\n\nAuthorities say Kirk was shot by 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who grew up in a conservative household in southern Utah but was enmeshed in “leftist ideology,” according to the state's Republican governor, Spencer Cox.\n\nCox said investigators may reveal more about what motivated the attack after Robinson's initial court appearance, scheduled for Tuesday. The governor said the suspect, who allegedly carved memes onto his bullet casings, appeared radicalized by the “dark corners of the internet.”\n\nOn Monday, Vance was joined on Kirk’s podcast by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, who vowed to crack down on what he called the “vast domestic terrorist network” he blamed for Kirk’s death.\n\nAlluding to free speech concerns, Vance said: “You have the crazies on the far left that say, ’Oh, Stephen Miller and JD Vance, they’re going to go after constitutionally protected speech.'”\n\nBut he added: “No no no! We’re going to go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence,” — a reference to non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request seeking clarity on the remarks, including which groups might be targeted.\n\nThe idea of a retribution campaign against individuals or groups for expressing a particular viewpoint has alarmed many.\n\n“Just having that ideology, just believing differently than some other American is not illegal,” Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said on CNN on Sunday.\n\nInstead, he said any groups that have been involved in illegal or violent acts should be targeted.\n\nKilling as a pretext to go after political rivals\n\nOn Kirk’s show, Vance talked about the need for unity after the assassination, but then dismissed it as impossible given what he described as the left’s embrace of political violence. Naming two foundations that fund a wide range of liberal causes, Vance said: \"There is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathizers.”\n\nDemocratic officials have roundly condemned Kirk’s murder. Democrats also have been victims of political violence recently, including the June assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, and the 2022 beating of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband in their San Francisco home.\n\nCaitlin Legacki of Stop Government Censorship, formed to fight the Trump administration’s use of government against its political rivals, said it was one thing for people making abhorrent statements to face consequences.\n\n“When we get concerned is when there appears to be a concerted effort in the government to use this tragedy to punish political opponents,” she said.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance on Monday jumped onto the conservative movement demanding consequences for those who have cheered Charlie Kirk's killing, calling on the public to turn in anyone who says distasteful things about the assassination of his friend and political ally.

FBI Special Agent Cindy Barrois, an Evidence Response Team leader in the Miami Field Office, said the Xterra’s back seats were folded down with what looked like a mattress. \"It appeared the vehicle was lived in,\" she said. In court Monday, she displayed six cellphones collected from the SUV, Routh’s expired Hawaii driver’s license, a valid U.S. passport and handwritten notes — including a list with \"pipe,\" \"C-clamp,\" \"blanket,\" \"pillow,\" \"tape,\" \"paint,\" \"green poncho\" and phone numbers. Another note listed flight options to Mexico and Colombia under the name \"Bryan Wilson.\" A separate Bank of Hawaii paper read, \"Make tourniquet.\" PROSECUTION PRESSES FORWARD AS RYAN ROUTH TRIAL RESUMES ON DAY 6 Routh is on trial representing himself for federal charges filed against him for allegedly attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump exactly one year ago on Sept. 15, 2024. Barrois testified in court Monday the vehicle was \"not organized,\" and included food, tools, gloves, a disposable tablecloth and a .45-caliber cartridge casing in the glove box. Photos shown to jurors included the passport in the driver’s area, multiple phones and where they were found, and a close-up of the .45 casing. She also pointed to alleged stickers on the Xterra that appeared to have been blacked out with spray paint, showing drip marks. Items presented in court from the SUV included a red Harbor Freight flashlight, an Akaso camera battery, a black metal rod like those used in chain-link fences, multiple pairs of work gloves, a black mask, poncho and zip tie in a Ziploc and a large quantity of orange earplugs. Prosecutors also walked jurors through receipts they say place Routh in Palm Beach County, Florida, for weeks: cash overnight-parking slips from a Marathon gas station in South Bay, Florida, dated Aug. 14 (eight nights), Aug. 21 (six nights), Aug. 29 (six nights), Sept. 5 (six nights) and Sept. 12 (four nights), plus local receipts from Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and McDonald’s. Jurors also saw two unopened cans of Vienna sausages and a 56-ounce SunnyD bottle allegedly found in the car, along with a SunnyD receipt. Barrois said North Carolina and Ohio license plates were recovered under the driver’s seat; a North Carolina registration in the glove box listed Routh’s daughter, Sara Ellen Routh. RYAN ROUTH TRIAL: JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT CASE Routh, representing himself, asked whether some items \"could have been in there for years\" and why one photo showed the .45-caliber casing in the glove box and another did not. For the first time in the trial, the prosecution came up after Routh’s cross-examination to \"re-direct\" the witness with further questioning. Routh also said there were dress clothes in the SUV and referenced a note that read, \"If you need this car moved text,\" listing numbers for \"Sarah\" and \"Oran.\" Later, FBI Evidence Analysis Request Coordinator Erin Farais testified about items removed from the SKS rifle. She said a fingerprint was found on tape from the gun but did not identify whose it was. When Routh asked whether removing tape affected scope accuracy testing, Judge Aileen Cannon told jurors, \"This case isn’t about how accurate the gun shoots.\" RYAN ROUTH TRIAL OPENS WITH BIZARRE JURY QUESTIONS AND WITNESS DRAMA CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Court staff told media that trial exhibits will be made public only after the proceedings conclude. Routh also told the judge he hadn’t decided whether to call his son, Oran, to the witness stand. Judge Cannon noted \"a lot of work\" had gone into arranging his transport. Prosecutors said additional FBI forensic witnesses — including a firearms/toolmark examiner — were slated to follow.","summary":"Trial for man charged with allegedly trying to assassinate Trump continues as FBI agent testifies cluttered SUV containing phones, notes about Mexico flight and a .45-caliber cartridge casing.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ryan-rouths-suv-looked-lived-in-filled-passports-phones-notes-fbi-special-agent-testifies","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/routh-skethc-day-6-003.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379047590112","publish_date":"2025-09-15 23:54:05","author":"Jake Gibson,Jamie Joseph,Jennifer Johnson,Olivianna Calmes","authors":["Jake Gibson","Jamie Joseph","Jennifer Johnson","Olivianna Calmes"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":360804546,"title":"Manchin says he wanted GOP to win Senate to stop Democrats' quest for 'raw political power'","text":"Former Sen.

Another disastrous day for Labour sees a key aide quit and PM admit he DID know about Epstein emails as unrest mounts","text":"Starmer goes into meltdown! Another disastrous day for Labour sees a key aide quit and PM admit he DID know about Epstein emails as unrest mounts\n\nBy JASON GROVES, POLITICAL EDITOR\n\nPublished: 00:00 BST, 16 September 2025 | Updated: 00:41 BST, 16 September 2025\n\nDowning Street was in meltdown on Monday as Keir Starmer lurched into a fresh crisis.\n\nOn another disastrous day for Labour, he struggled to explain why he kept backing Peter Mandelson, even while officials were urgently investigating new information about the US ambassador's links to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn a further body blow – as exclusively revealed Monday on dailymail.co.uk by Daily Mail columnist Dan Hodges – the Prime Minister's director of strategy was forced to quit over crude messages about Labour veteran Diane Abbott.\n\nThe latest departure of another key ally came just two weeks after Sir Keir launched 'Phase Two' of his government in a bid to put his dismal first year in office behind him.\n\nPaul Ovenden's resignation – after the departures of Lord Mandelson and Angela Rayner – means that the PM has now lost three senior figures in controversial circumstances since the relaunch this month.\n\nLast night, some Labour MPs were publicly warning that Sir Keir has just months to save his job. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch had accused Sir Keir of going 'into hiding' since sacking Lord Mandelson as US ambassador on Thursday – less than 24 hours after backing him to the hilt.\n\nWhen he finally broke cover on Monday, the PM struggled to explain why he had continued to stand by the disgraced peer even after the Government was told that he had urged Epstein to seek early release from jail.\n\nThe PM said he was 'angry' about an alleged lack of candour from Lord Mandelson, who had been forced to resign from two previous Cabinet roles in the 1990s during a long and chequered political career. \n\nDowning Street was in meltdown last night as Keir Starmer (pictured) lurched into a fresh crisis\n\nHe said he now wished he had never appointed Lord Mandelson, who was championed by the PM's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney.\n\n'I am angry,' he told Channel 4 News. 'I don't particularly think anger helps, but I feel let down. I feel that the process was gone through and now information has come to light which, had I known it at the time, I wouldn't have appointed him.'\n\nStarmer was told of Mandelson investigation before backing him at PMQs\n\nBut the PM admitted that he had known about Lord Mandelson's friendship with Epstein when he handed him the top diplomatic role in December last year.\n\nNo 10 confirmed this included knowing that he stayed at Epstein's house while he was in prison for child sex offences.\n\nAnd Sir Keir said he had known the Foreign Office was investigating further emails between the pair when he defended him in the Commons last week. He claimed he had not known the content of the emails but decided to defend him anyway.\n\nMrs Badenoch last night urged the PM to 'come clean' about exactly what he knew and when. The Tory leader added: 'In just ten days, Starmer has lost a housing secretary for dodging tax on her house, a US ambassador over his links to a vile paedophile, and now his 'strategy chief' has resigned in disgrace.\n\n'The Government is a disaster, distracted from the serious issues our country is facing.' The Conservatives have also lodged a formal request for the release of the 'Mandelson files' covering exactly what the Government knew about the disgraced peer at the time he was appointed. \n\nThe Daily Mail understands that Mr Ovenden had exchanged emails with a former colleague in 2017 in which he retold a story about a game of 'shag, marry, kill' involving Ms Abbott\n\nPaul Ovenden today quit his role as Director of Strategy in No10 after the emails from 2017 were uncovered\n\nThe row came as:\n\nSir Keir said he would not resign, despite Labour warning his faltering leadership risks handing the next election to Nigel Farage;\n\nThe Conservatives twisted the knife by securing a three-hour emergency debate on the growing Mandelson scandal in the Commons today;\n\nSenior Labour backbencher Helen Hayes suggested the Prime Minister could be forced out if next May's local election result in another wipeout for the party;\n\nMinisters scrambled to salvage plans for Donald Trump's state visit, which is due to get underway tonight;\n\nReform UK claimed another scalp with the defection of senior Tory MP Danny Kruger.\n\nLabour morale took a further blow on Monday with the dramatic resignation of the PM's director of strategy, who was one of his most senior aides and a close ally of Mr McSweeney.\n\nMr Ovenden, who wrote speeches for Sir Keir and led Labour's 'attack unit' that helped bring down Boris Johnson, was forced to go after Daily Mail columnist Dan Hodges revealed messages containing crude sexual remarks about Ms Abbott, Labour's first black female MP.\n\nDowning Street said the messages, written in 2017, were 'appalling and unacceptable'. But allies of Mr Ovenden, who was a popular figure in No 10, criticised the PM for failing to stand by him.\n\nHis departure fuels a growing sense of crisis engulfing the Government.\n\nSir Keir tried to revive Labour's flagging fortunes after the summer break by announcing a 'reset' designed to focus the government on 'delivery, delivery, delivery'.\n\nBut instead he has lost three senior figures, raised questions about his own judgment and triggered fresh infighting within the Labour Party. Former Labour frontbencher Andy McDonald said 'morale is very low' and called for an urgent change of course from the leadership, adding: 'The Prime Minister's future is in his own hands.'\n\nPressure is mounting on the PM's all-powerful chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, with several MPs calling for him to be sacked\n\nPictured: Lord Mandelson (left) in a fluffy white dressing gown enjoying a chat with Epstein (right)\n\nFellow Left-winger Richard Burgon predicted the PM would be 'gone by next May' unless he shifts to the Left immediately.\n\nMs Hayes, Labour chairman of the Commons education committee, told the BBC that there would be 'questions about the nature of the leadership' unless Labour's fortunes improve before next May's elections in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nEducation minister Jacqui Smith urged Labour MPs to halt the infighting, saying they should focus on 'building back people's confidence that government can make a difference for them.'\n\nKeir StarmerLabour\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nStarmer goes into meltdown!

When someone is called a Pied Piper, it suggests they are a charismatic but ultimately untrustworthy leader who uses their allure to draw followers into a potentially harmful situation they don’t fully understand.\n\nIn calling Charlie Kirk “the Pied Piper of the conservative movement,” the author inadvertently hit the nail on the head by describing how many of the working-class conservatives have been duped into voting against their own interests.\n\nJimee Welte\n\nBill is important step\nin protecting water\n\nRe: “Newsom must kick plastics out of water” (Page A8, Sept. 14).\n\nGov. Newsom has a chance to take a simple but powerful step to protect Californians’ health and drinking water: sign AB 823. Microplastics are no longer an abstract problem. They are in our rivers, reservoirs and even our bodies — linked to cancers, reproductive harm and developmental issues in babies. Yet we continue to allow unnecessary plastic microbeads in cleaners and cosmetics, despite safer alternatives like shells, sand and mica.\n\nThe bill doesn’t ban exfoliants or glitter. It simply requires that they be safe. This is common sense — preventing pollution at the source rather than forcing water agencies, and ultimately ratepayers, to pay billions for costly clean-up. California has led before, successfully banning microbeads in rinse-off products. It can lead again by keeping microplastics out of our water supply and safeguarding public health for future generations.\n\nArav Mestry\n\nWe need legislative\nsolution for migrants\n\nMy name is Vidushi, and I’m a graduating senior at American High School. I’ve lived in the U.S. most of my life on an H-4 visa, yet my future is in jeopardy.\n\nDespite being raised and educated here, I am forced to apply to colleges as an international student. This means I’m not eligible for federal aid or in-state tuition. My family pays taxes, yet we must pay thousands more for my education—an American education.\n\nThis financial burden is a direct result of our broken immigration system, which prevents my family from getting a green card due to decades-long backlogs. I am a “Documented Dreamer,” and my life has been shaped by American values. Don’t make me leave the only home I’ve ever known. It’s time to pass legislation that protects young people like me.\n\nVidushi Agrawal\n\nTrump’s untruths are\nundermining democracy\n\nAmerican democracy is in serious trouble. Too many voters accept whatever Donald Trump says, so long as the story sounds good. His claims often begin with a kernel of truth but quickly become a cover for imposing his will.\n\nTrump has targeted immigrants, denying legal rights and detaining thousands. An estimated 70% of those held had not been charged with crimes; many were here legally and following immigration rules. The most shocking case came over Labor Day weekend at 2 a.m., when 60 children awaiting release to relatives were put on a plane to Guatemala — until a judge stopped it.\n\nIn the name of fighting drug smuggling, Trump went further, appointing himself judge, jury and executioner by ordering the military to sink a boat 1,000 miles away, killing 11 people he claimed were an “immediate threat.”\n\nDemonizing, coercing, exceeding his authority and bypassing the law — Trump’s tactics put democracy itself in peril.\n\nLarry Bieber\nCastro Valley\n\nRecapture integrity\nby opposing Trump\n\nRe: “Honesty, integrity could make America great” (Page A6, Sept. 11).\n\nRegarding Tim Brown’s letter to the editor on Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” being a good slogan, it wasn’t Trump’s idea. Ronald Reagan used this motto in his campaign.\n\nBut I must agree with the thesis of Tim Brown’s letter. Yes, we need to reclaim our country’s honesty and integrity by standing up against Trump’s lies and policies of revenge and hatred.\n\nElizabeth Pentacoff\nPleasant Hill","summary":"Also: Apt comparison &#124; Protecting water &#124; Legislative solution &#124; Undermining democracy &#124; Recapture integrity.

It marked an escalation in a campaign that some warned invoked some of the darkest chapters of American history.\n\n“The government involvement in this does inch this closer to looking like McCarthyism,” said Adam Goldstein of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, referring to the 1950s campaign to root out communists that led to false allegations and ruined careers. “It was not a shining moment for free expression.”\n\nCampaign broadens to those who quote Kirk critically\n\nRepublican-controlled states such as Florida, Oklahoma and Texas have launched investigations of teachers accused of inappropriate statements after last week’s assassination. The U.S. military has invited members of the public to report those who “celebrate or mock” the killing and said some troops have already been removed for their comments.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration has vowed to target what it contends is a “vast” liberal network that inspired the shooter, even as authorities maintain it appears he acted alone and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe campaign has broadened to include even those whose statements were critical of Kirk without celebrating his assassination.\n\nThe Washington Post fired Karen Attiah, an opinion columnist, for posts on the day of the shooting that lamented how “white America” was not ready to solve gun violence and that quoted Kirk denigrating the intelligence of prominent Black women such as Michelle Obama.\n\nPEN America, a press freedom group, warned in a statement that firings like Attiah’s “risk creating a chilling effect.”\n\nGoldstein worried there were many cases of people targeted for simply quoting Kirk or failing to mourn his passing adequately. “That’s one of the key symptoms of cancel culture,” he said. “Trying to paint everyone with the same brush.”\n\nConservatives coined the term cancel culture for what they claimed was persecution of those on the right for their views, especially related to the COVID-19 pandemic and Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, leading to campaigns to get regular people fired.\n\nIt was a significant cause for President Donald Trum p, who pledged to end it during his campaign last year. But after the Kirk killing, he and his administration have instead leaned into it from the right.\n\nA hero to conservatives, a provocateur to many Democrats\n\nA father of two and a Christian conservative, Kirk was a hero to many Trump Republicans for his fiery warnings about the dangers of Democrats and ability to organize young voters. But Kirk also was a provocateur and supporter of Trump’s attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss who left a long record of partisan quips that enraged many on the left.\n\n“According to Kirk, empathy is a made-up new-age term, so keep the jokes coming. It’s what he would have wanted,” read one post on X that Melvin Villaver Jr., a Clemson University music professor, re-posted the day of the killing, according to a screenshot circulated by college Republicans demanding his firing. Clemson eventually fired one staffer and suspended Villaver and another professor after intense pressure from elected South Carolina Republican officials.\n\nOther targeted posters, such as Army Lt. Col. Christopher Ladnier, simply quoted Kirk on the day of his assassination. This included Kirk calling the Civil Rights Act a “beast” that “has now turned into an anti-white weapon,” his criticism of Martin Luther King Jr. and his statement that some gun deaths are the cost of a robust Second Amendment.\n\nLadnier, who has been targeted by conservative activists online, said in a Facebook message to The Associated Press that he would respond “when/if” his chain of command takes action.\n\nTexas Gov.

Chris Van Hollen stood before Iowa Democrats over the weekend and blasted his party’s leadership as “spineless” for refusing to endorse Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor.\n\n“Many Democratic members of the Senate and the House representing New York have stayed on the sidelines,” Van Hollen said. “That kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of. They need to get behind him and get behind him now.”\n\nIt was another jab in an ongoing rift within the party over Mamdani’s campaign. Democratic leaders in Washington and moderate Democrats on the ballot this fall are actively distancing themselves from Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist, while progressives rally behind him, noting Mamdani’s economic populism and youthful charisma have generated tremendous support from grassroots activists well beyond New York.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans, including President Donald Trump, are watching with delight and sometimes piling on, linking Mamdani and his far-left policies to the Democratic brand. That’s been the case in New Jersey and Virginia, the only states holding elections for governor this year, and GOP officials have signaled that the strategy will continue well into next year’s high-stakes midterm elections.\n\nDemocratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Mamdani on Sunday, declaring in a New York Times opinion piece that “New York needs leaders who will put aside differences, stand up and fight back against Mr. Trump.”\n\nTrump responded Monday in a social media post where he inaccurately described Mamdani as a communist and implied federal funding could be withheld from the city if Mamdani is elected.\n\n“This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New York City,” Trump wrote. “Washington will be watching this situation very closely. No reason to be sending good money after bad!”\n\nDemocratic leaders on Capitol Hill haven’t endorsed\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has repeatedly declined to endorse Mamdani when asked by reporters, saying, “I choose to make endorsements when I choose to make endorsements.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he met with Mamdani last week — but did not endorse him. Both are New Yorkers.\n\nSchumer and Mamdani worked together on issues in the past, including debt relief for taxi drivers, and have spoken highly of each other. After Mamdani won the Democratic primary, Schumer praised him on social media for running a campaign that connected with New Yorkers.\n\nThe lack of endorsement underscores the political pressure the leaders face, needing to win races not just in Democratic strongholds like New York but also in swing states or places that lean toward Republicans, such as Senate contests next year in North Carolina and Ohio.\n\nMamdani has been an outspoken critic of Israel. He called its military campaign in Gaza a “genocide” and said Palestine should exist as “a state with equal rights.” He also has called for tax increases on the wealthy to make life more affordable for everyday New Yorkers through initiatives like free buses.\n\nThe split also has deepened within the New York delegation itself. After Hochul’s endorsement, Rep. Tom Suozzi on Monday said he would not be endorsing Mamdani because he does not agree “with his proposed solutions.” In contrast, swing-district Rep. Pat Ryan endorsed Mamdani on Tuesday: “I know whose side I’m on. I’m with the people. I’m with Zohran.”\n\nFor many progressives, the Democratic establishment’s Mamdani snub has echoes of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ political rise. The independent Vermont senator struggled for decades to earn the support and respect of Democratic leaders, even as his popularity exploded and he emerged as a leading presidential candidate.\n\nPerhaps that’s why Sanders himself has served as one of Mamdani’s fiercest defenders.\n\n“I find it hard to understand how the major Democratic leaders in New York State are not supporting the Democratic candidate,” Sanders said last week. “So, we got another fight on our hands, and that is the future of the Democratic Party.”\n\nNational progressive groups have united behind Mamdani, sensing much larger stakes than New York City’s mayoral contest.\n\n“I can’t overstate how angry grassroots voters are.

After Mamdani won the Democratic primary, Schumer praised him on social media for running a campaign that connected with New Yorkers.\n\nThe lack of endorsement underscores the political pressure the leaders face, needing to win races not just in Democratic strongholds like New York but also in swing states or places that lean toward Republicans, such as Senate contests next year in North Carolina and Ohio.\n\nMamdani has been an outspoken critic of Israel. He called its military campaign in Gaza a “genocide” and said Palestine should exist as “a state with equal rights.” He also has called for tax increases on the wealthy to make life more affordable for everyday New Yorkers through initiatives like free buses.\n\nThe split also has deepened within the New York delegation itself. After Hochul’s endorsement, Rep. Tom Suozzi on Monday said he would not be endorsing Mamdani because he does not agree “with his proposed solutions.” In contrast, swing-district Rep. Pat Ryan endorsed Mamdani on Tuesday: “I know whose side I’m on. I’m with the people. I’m with Zohran.”\n\nFor many progressives, the Democratic establishment’s Mamdani snub has echoes of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ political rise. The independent Vermont senator struggled for decades to earn the support and respect of Democratic leaders, even as his popularity exploded and he emerged as a leading presidential candidate.\n\nPerhaps that’s why Sanders himself has served as one of Mamdani’s fiercest defenders.\n\n“I find it hard to understand how the major Democratic leaders in New York State are not supporting the Democratic candidate,” Sanders said last week. “So, we got another fight on our hands, and that is the future of the Democratic Party.”\n\nNational progressive groups have united behind Mamdani, sensing much larger stakes than New York City’s mayoral contest.\n\n“I can’t overstate how angry grassroots voters are. It’s off the charts on this one,” said Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of Our Revolution, an activist group born of the Sanders movement.\n\nThe debate has spilled into contested primaries ahead of next year’s midterm elections. That includes a Senate contest in Michigan between establishment candidates like Rep. Haley Stevens and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, and Abdul El-Sayed, who is more of a political outsider.\n\n“It’s odd to me that if a candidate were to win a Democratic primary that the Democratic party wouldn’t take notes and understand why that person won. And then shift accordingly,” said El-Sayed.\n\n“Parties exist to funnel the will of the people and I think when you have a growing chasm between leadership in the party and what the people want, that only ever ends up in one way: Either the parties lose elections, or the party moves.”\n\nHow is it playing in looming elections?\n\nRepublicans are actively fighting to link Democratic candidates to Mamdani.\n\nIn New Jersey, Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli described Mamdani as a sign the “modern Democratic Party has lost its mind.”\n\nThe Republican’s campaign also made a digital ad showing video from Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s interview in which she was asked if she’d back Mamdani’s general election campaign. She said, assuming he’s the nominee, “I assume I will.”\n\nCiattarelli has posted the video on social media throughout the campaign, most recently last week.\n\nSherrill has disengaged when asked about Mamdani. She had earlier said she would back the eventual Democratic nominee in New York City’s mayoral race but later said she wasn’t wading into the contest and was letting voters there decide the race.\n\n“As she’s said throughout the campaign, Mikie’s leaving the NYC mayoral race to the voters of New York,” Sherrill campaign spokesperson Carly Jones told The Associated Press.\n\nVirginia Democratic governor candidate Abigail Spanberger’s team offered almost identical language when asked if she would endorse Mamdani, saying, “Abigail is laser-focused on Virginia.”\n\nIn New York, Mamdani faces former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams — both running as independents.\n\nAfter Hochul’s endorsement, Mamdani said he was grateful “for her support in unifying our party.”\n\nEarlier, he had a more pointed message for veteran Democratic officials like Cuomo, a powerhouse in New York politics for decades.\n\n“What Andrew Cuomo doesn’t seem to understand is that him and Donald Trump are two sides of the same coin that New Yorkers want to throw away into the dustbin of history,” Mamdani said in a recent podcast. “We want a new kind of politics.”\n\nCappelletti reported from Washington.

Marjorie Decker and John Lawn and Sen. Julian Cyr provide a pathway for cities and towns to establish safe injection sites, while providing legal protections for workers, drug users accessing the facilities, government officials and other stakeholders.\n\nAt the centers, trained health care workers would supervise individuals who use pre-obtained illicit drugs — and they could intervene and prevent fatal overdoses. The House bill has about three dozen sponsors and the Senate bill about a dozen.\n\nAt the start of a hearing, Rep. Mindy Domb, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery, took swipes at the Trump administration and affirmed that Massachusetts believes in “evidence-based public health practices,” as she invoked vaccination policy and other initiatives. Massachusetts last year recorded fewer than 2,000 fatal overdoses, breaking a grim yearslong trend, Domb said.\n\n“There is no doubt that evidence-based harm reduction measures like naloxone distribution and availability, drug checking, and the distribution of sterile needles and other harm reduction supplies and the use of harm reduction practices contributed to this decline,” Domb said.\n\nThe Amherst Democrat continued, “Sadly at this time, this work and the progress made in reducing overdose mortality, and the humanity and the science that is foundational to these programs — like other evidence-based public health initiatives — is under threat in this country, whether it’s written in executive order, announced in the termination of funding, or spoken in language that dehumanizes our residents and perpetuates stigma. People and communities in need of our support are under attack.”\n\nBoston Sen. Nick Collins sounded off against the proposals.\n\n“Safe injection sites are not a mitigation factor,” he said in a statement to the Herald. “They risk accelerating the trafficking of drugs, increasing human exploitation, and compounding illegal gun violence.”\n\n“Nobody should mistake enabling a facility that further encourages illicit behavior as progress. We have to do better than that,” he continued.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order on July 24 addressing homelessness and drug use. It directed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. to ensure that substance use disorder grants “fund evidence-based programs and do not fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called ‘harm reduction’ or ‘safe consumption’ efforts that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.”\n\nRecipients of federal housing and homelessness assistance that operate safe consumption sites could also face civil or criminal charges, according to the order.\n\nU.S. Attorney Leah Foley in April called overdose prevention centers “categorically illegal” and said they “do nothing to help people overcome their addictions.”\n\nThe state Senate last session embraced overdose prevention centers, though the policy was dropped from a compromise addiction and substance disorder bill with the House.\n\nThe compromise expanded access to overdose reversal drugs, and limited legal liability for drug users and harm reduction workers who use drug-checking equipment.\n\nLegislative leaders have not flagged consumption sites as a priority so far this session.\n\nNew York City opened two overdose prevention centers in 2021, and a new facility began operating in Providence in January, said Gavi Wolfe, legislative director at ACLU of Massachusetts. Overriding a gubernatorial veto, Vermont lawmakers last year also passed a law enabling a pilot overdose prevention center in Burlington, according to the Associated Press.\n\n“We need to be real about the fact that in 2025, the Trump administration and its anti-public health policies cast a long shadow over harm reduction, substance use harm reduction work,” Wolfe said. “There’s been a lot of heated rhetoric coming out of Washington trying to turn back the clock and renew the failed war on drugs that’s been going on for 50 years.”\n\nReferring to the new Providence center, Wolfe continued, “But there’s been no change in the law or facts on the ground. The OPC is already in operation, hasn’t seen any federal interference, they’re keeping their doors open and continuing to save lives. It’s time for Massachusetts to join them.”","summary":"Controversial bills to legalize overdose prevention centers  were back in the spotlight Monday, as a committee leader touted recent gains in reducing the state's volume of fatal opioid-related overdoses and warned about shifting federal policies that could affect the landscape.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/15/safe-needle-sites-pitched-on-hill/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/drugsms012.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 23:11:28","author":"State House News Service","authors":["State House News Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":360797992,"title":"What to know after US says it has reached framework deal with China to keep TikTok in operation","text":"TikTok users in the U.S. may get a reprieve from the threat of a shutdown after the Trump administration announced it has reached a framework deal with China for the ownership of the popular social video platform.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press conference after the latest round of trade talks between the world’s top two economies concluded in Madrid that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping would speak Friday to possibly finalize the deal.

There were reportedly six unauthorised planes which entered restricted airspace over Bedminster, New Jersey, while the US President was staying at his golf course over the weekend. And it led to the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) being activated with jets investigating the trespass and intercepting the plane. It has led to concern about national security as well as the safety of Trump with the violations having taken place while he was staying at his golf club. There have been multiple similar cases in recent months of planes entering into restricted airspace where Trump has been staying. In the latest incident they were all small private aircraft which were directed away from the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, according to the US Air Force, which intercepted one of the planes on Sunday with F-16 fighter jets. “NORAD and the FAA aim to keep the skies over America safe, with close attention paid to areas with Temporary Flight Restrictions to ensure flight safety, national security, and the security of the President,” Gen. Gregory Guillot of NORAD said. Trump headed to his golf club on Friday evening and his calendar showed that he headed back to Washington on Sunday afternoon. In the statement from the US Air Force it stated after the violations: “General aviation pilots are reminded that TFR (Temporary Flight Restriction) procedures are mandatory and to verify all Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) and Fly Informed before every flight.” It added: “General aviation pilots are reminded that TFR procedures are mandatory and to verify all Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) and Fly Informed before every flight.” He is in Washington on Monday before leaving for a state visit to the UK in what will be a major security operation. Specialist police have been brought in to carry out searches of Windsor Castle where Trump will have an overnight stay and meet King Charles . It is part of the multimillion pound security operation which has taken months to prepare. Protests are expected against Trump around the UK including one in central London, although the decision to keep the US President away from the capital will ease pressure on the Metropolitan Police. Meticulous planning has been organised between law enforcement, civil servants and government departments, with Trump visiting the Windsor estate before heading to the Prime Minister’s country retreat Chequers.","summary":"F-16 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a plane flying in unauthorised airspace where Donald Trump was staying in Bedminster, New Jersey, at his golf club","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/fighter-jets-scrambled-unauthorised-aircraft-35908395","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35908397.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_FILES-US-DEFENSE-F16-MILITARY-AVIATION-WASHINGTON-ACCIDENT.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 23:09:04","author":"Tim Hanlon","authors":["Tim Hanlon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.041},{"id":360802784,"title":"Trump’s love of royals the key to state visit charm offensive","text":"With Donald Trump well known for his love of the monarchy, the royal family’s soft power diplomacy will be in full flow during the US state visit.\n\nThe American president has made no secret of his admiration for the late Queen, her successor the King, and monarch-in-waiting the Prince of Wales.\n\nMr Trump has always boasted of his bond with the royal family, saying he had “automatic chemistry” with the late Queen, and hailing Charles as a “really wonderful guy”.\n\nHe will pay a private tribute to Elizabeth II by laying flowers at her tomb in St George’s Chapel during his two-day stay.\n\nWhen Mr Trump met William in Paris in December after the ceremonial reopening of the Notre Dame cathedral, he declared the prince “very handsome”, adding “some people look better in person”.\n\nMr Trump enquired after the Princess of Wales’s health following her treatment for cancer, revealing William told him Kate was “doing well”.\n\nHe did however once make remarks about Kate when she was photographed sunbathing topless by the paparazzi in France in 2012.\n\n“Kate Middleton is great – but she shouldn’t be sunbathing in the nude – only herself to blame,” he said on Twitter.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump wrote in her memoir that she and her husband have an ongoing letter correspondence with the King.\n\nWhile Charles, known for his eco-credentials, has warned climate change is “the wolf at the door”, Mr Trump has branded it a “Chinese hoax”.\n\nBut Mr Trump maintained he “totally listened” to the then-prince when he was pressed on climate change by Charles during his 2019 state visit.\n\nForeign monarchs, presidents or prime ministers are invited to visit the monarch on the advice and request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with the decision down to the Government.\n\nMr Trump’s election victory marked an extraordinary return to the Oval Office in 2025 in a political career which has been mired in controversy, criminal charges, accusations of racism and sexism, and the US Capitol riots in January 2021.\n\nThere were suggestions the “special relationship” between the UK and the US had faced strain, with high-profile Labour figures having expressed critical opinions about Mr Trump in the past.\n\nBut the Government will be keen to make the most of the US leader’s self-proclaimed bond with the royal family.\n\nThe controversial American leader – the first ever convicted felon to become US president – received an invitation from the King in January this year to make an unprecedented second state visit.\n\nCharles and the Queen are reportedly set to be invited to make a state visit to the US by Mr Trump in 2026 to coincide with the 250th anniversary of America’s Declaration of Independence.\n\nMr Trump has often spoken of his rapport with Charles’s late mother, Elizabeth II, saying: “I really got to know her because I sat with her many times and we had automatic chemistry, you will understand that feeling.”\n\nBut author Craig Brown, in his biography, A Voyage Around The Queen, has since claimed that the monarch found Mr Trump “very rude”.\n\nShe is said to have “particularly disliked” the way he “couldn’t stop looking over her shoulder, as though in search of others more interesting”.\n\nIn 2018, Mr Trump joined the Queen for tea at Windsor Castle ahead of his 2019 state visit and said of the sovereign: “That is a beautiful woman.”\n\nThe 47th American president has, however, been publicly critical of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nHe lambasted the King’s younger son and Meghan, accusing them of treating the late Queen “very disrespectfully”.\n\nBut at the start of February, he ruled out trying to deport Harry after it was alleged that drug use referenced in his memoir could have disqualified the duke from a US visa, saying “I’ll leave him alone” and adding: “He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.”\n\nMeghan previously labelled Mr Trump “divisive” and a “misogynist”.\n\nHarry and Meghan are, however, no longer working royals and will be thousands of miles away at their home in California when Mr Trump visits the UK.\n\nMr Trump did, however, used to bombard Diana, Princess of Wales, William and Harry’s late mother, at Kensington Palace with massive bouquets, according to broadcaster Selina Scott, who said he saw the princess as “the ultimate trophy wife”.\n\nHe also once said he would have slept with Diana without hesitation and after her death called her “beautiful” but “crazy”.","summary":"The US president boasted of his bond, telling of ‘automatic chemistry’ with the late Queen, and calling Charles a ‘really wonderful

meticulous and lavish will be deployed in honour of the controversial US president and First Lady Melania Trump as they join some 160 guests in the impressive St George’s Hall for the extravagant feast.\n\nEvery element of the banquet is checked and approved by the King, down to the very last detail.\n\nCharles and the Queen usually inspect the table beforehand in person, making their way round the room in the afternoon and examining the preparations with the Master of the Household, Vice-Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt.\n\nIn a tradition started by the King, a bespoke cocktail will be created specially for the occasion, no doubt celebrating the “special relationship” between the UK and the US.\n\nFor French President Emmanuel Macron’s state dinner, the alcoholic tipple was named L’entente – in a nod to the L’Entente Cordiale – and it combined British gin with lemon curd and French pastis and was garnished with dried French cornflowers and English roses, while the Japanese state visit was honoured with a yuzu marmalade sour, featuring whisky and marmalade and resembling the flag of Japan.\n\nMr Trump is a teetotaller so will not indulge in sampling the variety of vintage wines on offer, nor the cocktail unless it is alcohol-free.\n\nPreparations for a state banquet start six months before the big event and it usually takes household staff around three days to lay the table.\n\nGuests – who have been invited on the basis of their cultural, diplomatic or economic links to the US – will dine on an exquisite menu, written in French, prepared by royal chefs and served on historic, priceless dinner sets.\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama’s state banquet in 2011 was sprinkled with Hollywood stardust, with a guest list including actor Tom Hanks, actress Helena Bonham Carter and director Tim Burton.\n\nBut the dinner for Mr Trump’s last state visit in 2019 was more trade and business rather than showbusiness.\n\nThe King and Queen will head members of the royal family, with the Prince of Wales expected to attend, and the Princess of Wales likely, but not yet confirmed, to join him, along with other Windsors.\n\nThe monarch will be seated next to Mr Trump in the middle of one side of the table, with Mrs Trump and Camilla opposite them on the other side.\n\nAt Mr Macron’s banquet, Kate was seated next to the president at his right hand side, while William was opposite, next to France’s First Lady Brigitte Macron.\n\nOther royals will be spread around the table between the guests.\n\nMuch has shifted within the royal family over the last six years amid a change in reign, the occurrence of royal scandal, and the passing of time.\n\nAbsent will be the disgraced Duke of York, who attended last time but since then was forced to step down from the working monarchy over his friendship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe attending royals have yet to be announced, but at the last state banquet for Mr Trump, there were 16 family members.\n\nThe late Queen Elizabeth II, who hosted the occasion in 2019, died three years ago.\n\nThe Duke of Kent is grieving his wife the Duchess of Kent, whose funeral is taking place on Tuesday, and Princess Alexandra is now frail and has not attended banquets for several years.\n\nMissing too will be Lord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as US ambassador by the Prime Minister just days before the event, after it emerged he sent supportive messages to sex offender Epstein.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, who is facing a challenging week amid the furore over Lord Mandelson, the fallout of Angela Rayner’s resignation and frustrations from MPs, will be expected to put on his white tie and tails and turn up to join the guests.\n\nBut Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is boycotting the banquet in a protest against Mr Trump’s position on Gaza.\n\nRoyal chef Mark Flanagan and his team of 20 chefs will serve seasonal produce, sourced from royal estates.\n\nCharles and Camilla will have selected the final menu, which will be expected to include a nod to the US, from a series of four alternatives.\n\nSeasonal flowers handpicked from the gardens at Windsor Castle and Windsor Great Park will be on show arranged in elaborate displays along the table in silver-gilt centrepieces.\n\nAfter the banquet, the flowers are usually donated to Floral Angels, a charity of which Camilla is patron, which delivers the blooms to hospices, elderly care homes and shelters.\n\nThe impressive St George’s Hall is the largest room in the castle at 55.5 metres long (180ft) and nine metres wide (29.5ft), and the 50 metre (164ft) table stretches its full length.\n\nThe castle’s staff will have started constructing the mahogany table almost a week ago.\n\nTablecloths and napkins – folded in the shape of a Dutch bonnet – cruet sets, elaborate floral decorations, priceless plates, candelabra and six glasses – for water, a champagne toast, red and white wines, a dessert wine and port – will all have carefully been put in order.\n\nEvery place setting must be precisely 18 inches apart – with measuring sticks used to ensure absolute precision.\n\nThe footmen and women must make sure every chair is exactly the same distance from the table and each glass is the same distance from the front edge of the table.\n\nSome 19 stations are set up around the edge of the room, each manned by four staff – a page, footman, under butler and a wine butler – who use a traffic light system to co-ordinate the serving of courses.\n\nDetailed diagrams are used to illustrate the serving plans and a list of special instructions sets out any dietary requirements and requests for royals and other guests.\n\nStaff must also put in place a special cushion on the King’s seat to ease his long-standing back issues.\n\nCharles also likes a bowl of olive oil, rather than butter pats, at his setting for his bread.\n\nThe dress code is tiaras and white tie – or national dress.\n\nMembers of the royal family wear sashes and badges known as orders if they have been given them in recognition of royal service.\n\nSpeeches take place at the start at around 8.30pm when the King and Mr Trump will both make a speech and propose toasts to one another, followed by the playing of the national anthems.\n\nA string orchestra usually provides the musical backdrop.\n\nThe hall’s gothic style ceiling with impressive oak beam roof is studded with the coats of arms of every single Knight of the Garter since the order was founded in 1348.\n\nIts walls and ceiling were decimated in the Windsor Castle fire of 1992 and had to be painstakingly rebuilt.\n\nJust before the banquet begins, members of the royal family will be lined up to be personally introduced to Mr Trump and First Lady Melania.\n\nThen, the King and Queen and the American couple will be formally introduced to and shake hands with each and every guest as they file into the ballroom.\n\nThe King and the president will then make their way into the room side by side.\n\nThe end of the banquet is signalled by the arrival of 12 pipers processing round the room, a tradition started by Queen Victoria.","summary":"Some 160 people will

being feted with a stay in Windsor Castle where he will be hosted by the King and treated to a ceremonial welcome on Wednesday and a lavish state banquet.\n\nSecurity will be paramount, with Mr Trump confined to the private Windsor estate on the first full day, before heading to the Prime Minister’s country residence Chequers on Thursday.\n\nThere are no public-facing engagements for the president throughout, with thousands expected to take part in major protests against his two-day stay.\n\nDemonstrators from the Stop Trump Coalition will take to Windsor high street on Tuesday evening, followed by a march through central London the next day ending with a mass rally in Parliament Square.\n\nSeparately, Socialist Students said hundreds of students have pledged to walk out of schools, colleges and universities across the country on Wednesday.\n\nChannel 4 will air a night of programming focusing on Mr Trump’s untruths, including 100 falsehoods, distortions and inaccuracies either written or said by the president during his time in office.\n\nThe trip is Mr Trump’s second state visit to the UK – an unprecedented gesture for a US president – with his last one six years ago in 2019 seeing thousands of people turn out on the streets in London in opposition and a 20 foot Trump baby blimp take to the skies.\n\nPolice plans to ensure Mr Trump, who will travel with his own security detail of Secret Service agents, is kept safe are under daily review amid the very high threat level and against the backdrop of the assassination of his ally Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales will meanwhile play a key role in entertaining the president, who is known for his love of the royal family, and First Lady Melania Trump.\n\nWilliam and Kate will meet the American couple, who make an administrative arrival in the UK on Tuesday evening, in the grounds of the Windsor estate on Wednesday and escort them a short distance to see the King and Queen for an open air greeting nearby.\n\nThe proceedings are aimed at extending a personal, family-centred welcome to the Trumps ahead of the official ceremony in the castle quadrangle after a carriage ride through private Home Park.\n\nThe princess will also, in a rare move, carry out a joint engagement with Mrs Trump on Thursday in Frogmore Gardens where they will meet Chief Scout Dwayne Fields and members of the Scouts’ Squirrels programme as they learn about nature to achieve their Go Wild badge.\n\nIt has not yet been confirmed whether Kate, who announced at the start of the year that she was in remission from cancer, will attend the state banquet on Wednesday evening.\n\nBut it is likely she will be present at the opulent dinner during the diplomatically high-stakes visit, having done so for French President Emmanuel Macron in July.\n\nThe state visit is a major opportunity for Sir Keir Starmer’s Government to influence Mr Trump’s thinking on several domestic and international issues.\n\nChief among the UK’s concerns is eliminating the tariffs on British steel imports to the US, which remain in place despite many of the main points of a UK-US trade deal being hammered out.\n\nOver the weekend, Liam Byrne, the Labour chairman of the Commons Business and Trade Committee, said the state visit is “no mere pageant” and warned the Government that “we can’t escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past”.\n\nPeter Kyle, the newly appointed Business Secretary, has said that tariff relief for UK steel is being negotiated and that he will “make sure that we have an announcement as soon as possible”, but figures within Government have been hesitant to suggest such a deal could come during the state visit.\n\nMinisters have elsewhere been keen to stress the importance of a new nuclear partnership with America, aimed at speeding up the development of power plants.\n\nSome £1.25 billion of investment from US financial firms was also announced ahead of the visit.\n\n“The state visit not only reflects centuries of bond between our two countries but cements the next 250 years as the closest of allies, creating a safer, richer future for people both sides of the Atlantic,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman told reporters.\n\nSir Keir may also use the state visit to convince Mr Trump that the US should heap further sanctions on Russia, as European powers scramble to help Ukraine.\n\nThe American leader has held off on imposing sanctions on Moscow, but has said he is ready to do so once other Nato countries stop buying Russian oil.\n\nEfforts to woo Mr Trump may however prove more difficult than expected for Sir Keir with the absence of former ambassador Lord Peter Mandelson.\n\nBritain’s top man in Washington was dismissed last week after the closeness of his relationship with the paedophile US financier Jeffrey Epstein came to light.\n\nEmails published by Bloomberg included passages in which Lord Mandelson told Epstein to “fight for early release” shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nMr Trump has also been implicated in the Epstein scandal, with a tranche of documents released by US legislators said to include a letter from the president to Epstein to celebrate his 50th birthday.\n\nThe White House has denied the message is authentic, but Mr Trump continues to face a domestic political battle over the scandal, all while Sir Keir faces continued questions about his judgment over the appointment of Lord Mandelson.\n\nMeanwhile, additional flourishes have been added to the regular state visit programme in honour of Mr Trump.\n\nHe will be honoured with a flypast by the Red Arrows and UK and US F-35 military jets on the east lawn at Windsor Castle on Wednesday afternoon, after watching a special Beating Retreat military spectacle never before staged for an incoming state visit.\n\nThe president will also visit the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II in St George’s Chapel, Windsor, to privately lay a wreath and pay his respects.","summary":"The US president is set to arrive in the UK on Tuesday

second state visit.\n\nThe US president is due to arrive in Britain on Tuesday for a two-day trip during which he will meet the King and the Prime Minister.\n\nBut a survey carried out by Ipsos UK found just 36% of people agreed with the idea that there was a “special relationship” between the two countries.\n\nAlthough this was higher than the 30% who said the same in the immediate wake of Mr Trump’s sweeping tariffs, imposed in April this year, it is well down on the 51% who believed in the special relationship at the start of Joe Biden’s presidency in 2021.\n\nBut despite pessimism about the UK-US relationship, MPs were much more positive, with 73% saying the special relationship still existed, including 84% of Labour MPs.\n\nTom Fife-Schaw, managing director at Ipsos UK, said the findings showed a “perhaps surprising resilience in parliamentary faith in the special relationship”.\n\nHe said: “The confidence among Labour MPs likely reflects the current Government’s diplomatic successes in rebuilding bridges with Washington, although that may now be shaken by the recent news about Lord Mandelson.”\n\nThe Ipsos poll also found that 61% of British people said they did not like Mr Trump, and a similar proportion believed the UK did not need a leader like him.\n\nBut despite opposition to the president, almost half said they thought the state visit should go ahead and only a third backed protests against Mr Trump.\n\nOpposition to the state visit had fallen significantly, at 34%, having been as high as 44% in March.\n\nIpsos UK senior director Gideon Skinner said people showed “negative attitudes towards Donald Trump”, but that views had “started to show some recovery since the immediate post-tariff low earlier this year”.","summary":"The Ipsos poll also found

research shows.\n\nNew data from HSBC comes ahead of US President Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK, which begins this week.\n\nIt found that British firms are enjoying higher sales with US firms despite many feeling the effects of Mr Trump’s steeper tariff rates on exports.\n\nThe value of payments made by HSBC’s business customers in the UK to those in the US surged by 23% in the year to June compared with the prior year.\n\nPayments made to the UK from US business customers also rose by 13% year on year.\n\nA separate survey by the bank of 2,000 UK businesses found a third said they now had more new customers in the US – compared with 16% reporting a decline.\n\nOf those already trading with America, 37% said their revenues had increased, with a tenth reporting a significant rise.\n\nIn contrast, a fifth reported falling revenues.\n\nStephanie Betant, HSBC’s head of global trade solutions, said the agreement struck between the UK and the US in July gave businesses “clarity fairly quickly” in terms of the framework for trading.\n\nFurthermore, she stressed the UK being predominately made up of firms in the services sector means many have been cushioned from the impact of steeper tariffs on goods exports.\n\n“Fundamentally, the UK is a service economy and the US is the number one service economy,” she told the PA news agency.\n\n“If you look at the shape of UK trade over the past four or five years, it’s gone from being largely majority goods to now majority services.”\n\nServices – which incorporates everything from hospitality and entertainment, to IT, communications and healthcare – are not subject to tariffs to the extent that goods exports are.\n\nMs Betant added that many “goods-focused businesses” were choosing to “add a services layer” to what they offer in order to boost the value of their exports.\n\nThis has resulted in more firms investing in digital assets and technology, rather than building up their inventories of physical stock.\n\nNevertheless, Ms Betant acknowledged there was a “huge amount of disruption” for some sectors such as carmakers and Scotch whisky firms who are facing new and steeper levies to export to the US.\n\n“The environment has created a lot of friction for companies – certain companies wouldn’t have paid tariffs before, now they have to, and when it comes to goods, slowing down shipments,” she said.\n\n“Tariffs are working their way through the system so they are starting to impact more broadly into the economy.”\n\nMs Betant stressed a key thing businesses were looking for was greater sector-based trade agreements.","summary":"The value of payments made by HSBC’s business customers in the UK to those in the US surged by 23% in the year to

killing","text":"Vice President JD Vance spent Monday hosting Charlie Kirk’s radio show, using his power to continue whitewashing the deceased conservative pundit’s record while leveling threats at President Donald Trump’s political opponents.\n\nThe White House promoted the radio appearance, hyping it up on official government-funded social media accounts. The White House’s official rapid response account live-tweeted throughout the show, which was broadcast from the White House.\n\n“Every single person in this building, we owe something to Charlie,” Vance said, hailing a man who once described Martin Luther King Jr. as a “myth,” “awful,” and “not a good person.”\n\nAs part of his radio show hosting duties, Vance invited several White House staffers to appear on the program with him. For instance, White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich hailed the work of Kirk’s group, Turning Point USA, which is notorious for hiring white supremacists.\n\nSenior Trump aide Stephen Miller also appeared and revealed the administration’s plans to use Kirk’s death to attack the left.\n\n“We are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people. It will happen and we will do it in Charlie's name,” Miller said in reference to progressive groups who have told the truth about Kirk, the right, and the Republican Party.\n\nHosting a political talk show while holding office as a sitting vice president is strange. Constitutionally the job of vice president is to preside over the Senate, including casting tiebreaking votes as former Vice President Kamala Harris frequently did. Instead, Vance led the show for over two hours, culminating in a thunderous condemnation of the left, falsely asserting that the bulk of political violence and threats comes from the left.\n\n“While our side of the aisle certainly has its crazies, it is a statistical fact that most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far-Left,” Vance said.\n\nVance also threatened to use the power of the government to go after the nonprofit Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundation for purportedly financing The Nation. Vance falsely alleged that an article in the magazine justified Kirk’s death. The article, by writer Elizabeth Spiers, detailed the vile, bigoted things that Kirk said but did not endorse his murder. \n\nFollowing the Vance broadcast, Spiers wrote, “Glad the vice president of the United States, whose salary my taxes fund, is using his position to *checks notes* attack me on the Charlie Kirk show.”\n\nRelated | JD Vance sure does take a lot of vacations\n\nVance is currently vice president because Trump’s last running mate was the target of death threats after Trump incited a riot at the U.S. Capitol—an invasion that Kirk supported.

With the federal government weighing whether to reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, operators, investors, and policymakers face unprecedented uncertainty.\n\nThe decision matters more than symbolism. Rescheduling could usher in regulatory legitimacy, tax relief, and capital access — or it could impose compliance burdens that push smaller players out of the market. Conversely, failure to act would deepen the patchwork chaos of federal prohibition, leaving states and operators adrift.\n\nThis three-part series explores the realities, opportunities, and risks of rescheduling. In Part I, we examine the compliance burden existing operators will face. Part II looks to the opportunities and limitations that come with rescheduling. Part III imagines the chaos to the state-regulated industries that could result in the event of rescheduling, or worse yet, de-scheduling. Together, these pieces form a roadmap for navigating cannabis’s uncertain but inevitable journey forward. And, as you know, sometimes the light’s all shinin’ on me, other times I can barely see.\n\nPart 1 of 3\n\n“Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own.” These words echo faintly in the background as cannabis faces one of its most pivotal transitions yet: the potential move from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. For decades, the industry has thrived—sometimes barely survived—in a paradoxical environment where state-level legality danced uneasily with federal prohibition. That uneasy tune may be about to shift, and for existing operators—whether in Denver or Durban, Toronto or Tangier—the refrain will be compliance.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters from the Resolute Desk after signing an executive order to appoint the deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Oval Office at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump also signed a memorandum ordering an immediate assessment of aviation safety and ordering an elevation of what he called “competence” over “D.E.I.” (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nBy way of background, on August 11, 2025, President Trump confirmed that his administration is “looking at” reclassifying cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. He acknowledged the issue is “very complicated”—noting that some strongly oppose the idea while others praise cannabis’s medical value—but his willingness to even consider rescheduling marks a dramatic shift from past rhetoric. Trump once described cannabis as dangerous and a threat to young people’s development, yet now frames it as a substance that may warrant less restrictive control.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nThis evolution is not accidental. For years, Trump’s cannabis stance has been mixed—at times promising to respect state-level rules or improve banking access, at other times warning of cannabis’s harms. The current openness reflects mounting pressure from industry lobbying, shifting public opinion, and the reality that 38 states now regulate cannabis in some form. In many ways, this is less about personal conviction and more about aligning federal posture with political and economic momentum.\n\nIf cannabis is moved to Schedule III, the implications are profound. It would acknowledge cannabis’s medical use and lower abuse potential, unlocking relief from IRS 280E tax penalties, improving banking access, and expanding research opportunities. But it would definitely not legalize recreational cannabis nationwide. States would still govern access, DEA oversight would remain, and businesses would face the daunting task of complying with FDA standards and pharmaceutical-level GMP requirements. Rescheduling is a step forward—but not the final destination.\n\nThe reality, however, is that rescheduling isn’t something a president can simply declare. The process requires coordinated evaluations from HHS and FDA, followed by DEA rulemaking and a public comment period. Legal challenges are likely, and procedural snags already delayed the Biden-era effort. Trump’s statement that a decision could come “in the next few weeks” is aspirational at best.\n\nFor cannabis businesses, the message is clear: prepare for a compliance-heavy environment. Relief from punitive tax rules could fuel profitability, but only for those ready to meet the federal government’s new demands. Much like the broader global trend, the U.S. is slowly beginning to tune its instrument for a different kind of performance. The wheel is turning—what remains to be seen is whether American operators are ready to keep pace.\n\nThe main point here is that rescheduling is not legalization. It’s not even a clear invitation to participate in a normalized federal marketplace. Instead, it’s a reclassification that drags the cannabis sector out of the shadows of total prohibition and into a pharmaceutical-style framework. That means DEA registration, FDA oversight, and full compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). For an industry built on entrepreneurial grit, cultural rebellion, and patchwork state rules, the compliance reality is going to feel like a sharp turn in the music.\n\nNEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2024/02/28: Alfredo Angueria, Chief Compliance Officer of CONBUD speaks during Governor Kathy Hochul announcement at New York office to enforce closing cannabis illegal stores. Governor called on the state legislature to pass a law to enable local authorities to padlock illegal stores selling cannabis and called on tech giants like Google, Meta, Yelp to stop promoting illegal stores locations showing at one point Google maps on a cell phone with dozens of illegal stores in the Midtown neighborhood of the Governor's office.

For businesses, this translates into mandatory DEA registration for any entity handling cannabis. Manufacturers, distributors, researchers, and even dispensary-equivalents will need federal licenses. The often-times casual recordkeeping tolerated under various state regimes won’t cut it. Instead, operators will face meticulous controls: batch-level traceability, inventory reconciliation, validated processes, and documented quality systems.\n\nFDA oversight compounds the challenge. In the pharmaceutical world, compliance isn’t optional—it’s existential. GMP requires written standard operating procedures, facility validations, clinical-grade product testing, and audit trails capable of withstanding federal scrutiny. In short, the regulator doesn’t care about your origin story, your state licenses, or your reputation among patients. The only thing that matters is whether you can prove, with data and documentation, that your product is safe, consistent, and precisely what the label claims.\n\nFor many cannabis operators, this is foreign territory. The industry has evolved from legacy growers, storefront dispensaries, and multi-state operators (MSOs) that scaled rapidly to capture market share. Few have invested in compliance systems resembling Big Pharma’s playbook. Some MSOs have dipped their toes in, hiring compliance officers or adopting partial GMP frameworks for international exports. But for the bulk of the U.S. market—especially small and mid-sized operators—rescheduling represents an entirely new language to learn, a new set of instruments to play.\n\nThis is not a matter of tightening a few screws or hiring one more consultant. It’s cultural. Compliance under Schedule III demands a mindset shift from opportunistic growth to methodical, data-driven precision. It means trading “good enough” for “provable.” And it means accepting that the risk-tolerant DNA of the cannabis industry will be reshaped—sometimes painfully—into something resembling a pharmaceutical company.\n\nMADRID, SPAIN - 2022/04/25: Customers walk-in into a marijuana Cannabis shop inspired by Amsterdam's drug culture.

Other countries have already taken the plunge.\n\nGermany’s medical-first framework mandated full EU-GMP compliance for all imports and domestic production. Overnight, this winnowed the field. Small cultivators and opportunistic entrepreneurs couldn’t keep up, and the supply chain consolidated around a fewer larger, compliant operators. Patients benefited from higher-quality products, but the market lost much of its grassroots diversity.\n\nCanada imposed pharmaceutical-grade standards on its federally licensed producers at legalization. The result? Rapid consolidation, ballooning compliance costs, and a supply chain dominated by well-capitalized corporations. Small craft growers—once the heartbeat of Canada’s cannabis culture—were pushed to the margins or into the illicit market.\n\nMorocco offers a different lens. Its move to regulate cannabis for medical and industrial purposes required traditional farmers to adapt to GMP-compliant facilities if they wanted access to export channels. Those who succeeded did so through partnerships with larger companies that brought capital, training, and compliance infrastructure. Those who couldn’t are being left behind.\n\nThe lesson for U.S. operators is clear: rescheduling will not be a level playing field. Only the capitalized, compliance-ready companies will survive. Those without the resources, infrastructure, or appetite for pharmaceutical-grade oversight may be forced to consolidate, partner, or exit.\n\nThe State-Federal Collision\n\nAnother wrinkle is the collision between federal rescheduling and the patchwork state systems already in place. State regulators are unlikely to abandon their frameworks overnight. Instead, operators may find themselves answering to two masters: the FDA and state cannabis agencies. This dual compliance burden could create enormous friction.\n\nImagine a dispensary in Colorado that has operated for years under state rules. Under Schedule III, that same business would need DEA registration, FDA-level compliance, and alignment with Colorado’s Marijuana Enforcement Division. What happens when the federal standard contradicts the state one? Which label claim governs? Which packaging requirements prevail?\n\nWithout clear federal guidance, the result could be legal and operational chaos. Compliance staff will spend as much time reconciling contradictions as they do implementing procedures. For small businesses, this may be an impossible burden.\n\nThe Cost of Compliance\n\nCompliance is not just a regulatory challenge; it’s an economic one. And GMP standards are not the norm for state-compliant cannabis operations. Building GMP-compliant facilities, hiring compliance staff, implementing validated software, and conducting regular audits costs millions. For MSOs with access to capital markets, this is painful but feasible. For small operators—dispensaries, boutique cultivators, family-owned businesses—the cost could be prohibitive.\n\nThis is where consolidation enters the picture. Just as Germany and Canada saw waves of mergers and acquisitions post-regulation, the U.S. market is poised for similar restructuring. Large players will swallow small ones. Pharmaceutical companies will acquire cannabis operators to leverage existing infrastructure. Private equity will swoop in, funding compliance upgrades in exchange for equity stakes.\n\nCompliance, in this sense, becomes both a barrier to entry and a driver of consolidation. The industry that emerged from legacy markets and entrepreneurial spirit will be reshaped into one dominated by corporations that can afford the compliance tax.\n\nWhat Compliance Really Means\n\nCompliance is often discussed in abstract terms—forms, audits, paperwork. But at its heart, compliance is about trust. It’s about demonstrating to regulators, patients, and the public that cannabis can be produced, distributed, and consumed safely.\n\nFor decades, opponents of cannabis reform pointed to safety concerns: inconsistent potency, contamination, lack of quality control. Rescheduling flips the script. It puts the burden on the industry to prove, through data and compliance, that cannabis can meet the same standards as any other medicine. This is not a punishment. It’s an invitation to legitimacy.\n\nYet it is also a test. Will the industry embrace compliance as the foundation of credibility, or resist it as an existential threat? Will legacy operators find ways to adapt, or will they be written out of the story they helped create?\n\nLooking Ahead\n\n“Once in a while you can get shown the light, in the strangest of places if you look at it right.” Compliance, uncomfortable as it may be, is that light. For operators who adapt, compliance is the path to legitimacy, sustainability, and perhaps even global competitiveness. For those who resist, it may be the end of the road.\n\nThe wheel is indeed turning. Rescheduling is not the endgame—it’s the overture. It sets the stage for pharmaceutical integration, international trade pressures, and eventually, the larger conversation about full descheduling or removal from the Controlled Substances Act. That conversation will bring its own chaos, opportunities, and limitations—the focus of the next two parts in this series.\n\nFor now, the message is simple: the compliance reality is coming. The music is changing. The industry must decide whether to tune its instruments or risk being left in silence.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Part 1 explores the compliance reality for cannabis operators if rescheduled to Schedule III, highlighting federal standards, global lessons, and operational challenges.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthoban/2025/09/15/trump--us-cannabis-rescheduling-the-compliance-reality-for-existing-operators-part-1-of-3/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68c89715e187019a75d3bc38/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 22:51:32","author":"Chip Somodevilla,Contributor,Robert Hoban","authors":["Chip Somodevilla","Contributor","Robert Hoban"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.118}]}
