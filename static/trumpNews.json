More than 75 million Americans had already cast an early ballot, data from the University of Florida showed. The number of eligible voters is estimated at about 244 million, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nUncertainty still shrouds the general election as Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump have been caught in a dead heat, with narrow margins in battleground state races that will likely determine the presidency.\n\nTo occupy the Oval Office, a candidate must win at least 270 electoral votes out of the total 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Seven swing states -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina -- are expected to play an outsize role in hitting that magic number.\n\nPennsylvania has been at the center of election-year attention as the Keystone State has 19 electoral votes -- the highest among the seven toss-up states -- that could provide a substantial boost for either of the candidate to surpass the 270 Electoral College threshold.\n\nHarris is thought to secure 226 electoral votes from Democratic or Democratic-leaning states, while Trump is forecast to lock up 219 electoral votes from states traditionally supportive of Republicans.\n\nThus, Harris and Trump need to win 44 and 51 more votes, respectively, from swing states to hit the 270-mark.\n\nShould Harris take Pennsylvania's 19 votes, she would need 25 more votes -- possibly from Michigan with 15 votes and Wisconsin with 10 votes -- to reach the magic number. For Trump, taking Pennsylvania will greatly brighten his election chances as well, though there are other scenarios for his possible win.\n\nThis is why both Harris and Trump have devoted a big chunk of their time and financial resources to courting undecided voters in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump lost Pennsylvania to Biden by a small margin in 2020, but won it by a thin margin in 2016 -- a reason why the state has been seen as a toss-up. Polls have shown Harris ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nGiven the close race, questions have lingered over whether a smooth transition of power can happen as Trump has claimed he would only lose if Democrats \"cheat\" -- remarks that further reinforced speculation that he might not accept an election outcome in favor of his rival.\n\nSome observers have worried that the US could undergo a period of post-election confusion, amid still potent memories of an attack on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6, 2021, though legal and other efforts have been made to forestall such an incident.\n\nIt remains uncertain when a winner will be named. In the 2020 election that proceeded amid COVID-19, President Joe Biden's victory was announced four days after the vote. But the 2016 election was called for Trump in the wee hours of the morning after Election Day.\n\nAside from the presidential vote, 34 Senate seats and all 435 House seats are at stake in Tuesday's general election.

They are close to numbers seen during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when migration crawled to a near stop.\n\nIllegal border crossings spiked to record levels under President Joe Biden, averaging 2 million per year from 2021 to 2023. The migrants arrived in every state in the country, overwhelming cities such as New York, Chicago and Denver as newcomers seek shelter and aid.\n\nIllegal crossings at the southern border spiked to 250,000 in December 2023, but dropped earlier this year, mainly due to efforts by Mexico to slow U.S.-bound migrants.\n\nThe upturn was largely driven by the expiration of Proclamation 10014 in 2022, which suspended the entry of certain migrants into the U-S because of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut the numbers dropped after Biden invoked sweeping presidential powers to sharply limit asylum in early June. Since then, migrant crossings have plateaued.\n\nThe Biden administration was forced to tighten its border policy and numbers have now reached levels close to what they were during the pandemic.\n\nWith regard to this year's election, some analysts have warned of a spike in illegal migration if Trump wins the race, scurrying to get into the country before he takes office in January and tightens border policy and begins his threatened mass deportations.\n\nDespite Trump's harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration generally and about Mexico in particular, Bembenek is not clear on whether Trump or the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will be the best president as far as Mexico is concerned, largely because of the important but often dicey trade relationship between the two countries.\n\n\"Former President Trump by far has had the most vocal comments about what he would do with tariffs with Mexico,\" Bembenek wrote.\" As a result, many think he would be \"bad for Mexico.\" But the current USMCA agreement, which has undeniably been good for the country and allowed Mexico to steadily increase exports to the point of now being the No. 1 exporter to the United States, was signed during the Trump administration.\"\n\nHarris voted against that deal, Bembenek said, which does not bode well for future trade agreements under the USMCA with her as president. Bembenek admitted that Trump will be harder on China with tariffs than with Mexico, which would benefit Mexico.

The event was held in Kinston, North Carolina.\n\n After arriving late to his second rally of the day, he gave a shout-out to a Republican running for office… except the person was not running in the swing state of North Carolina.\n\n “You have one of the best of all right here. David McCormick,” he told the audience. “Where is David? Is he around someplace? You know, we just left him. He’s a great guy.” The thing is, McCormick is running for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, a state Trump visited on Sunday morning.\n\n His tardiness and lethargy appeared to not only affect his energy but also affected attendees early on, with a reporter sharing video of people leaving the event less than five minutes after he began his speech.\n\n A rally exodus seems to be a thing of late at the crowd-obsessed candidate’s rallies. On Friday in Greensboro, North Carolina as Trump was bragging that “we have the biggest rallies in the history of any country,” a camera operator fact-checked him live as he panned around the stadium to show empty seats and people exiting the arena, though it is not clear whether those attendees left the venue for good.\n\n Earlier on Sunday during his first rally, he made dangerous remarks against the media again, while discussing the bullet-proof glass that surrounds him during his rallies.\n\n “I have this piece of glass here,” Trump said. “But all we really have over here is the fake news, right?” which elicited laughs from the crowd.\n\n “And, to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind. I don’t mind that,” he said. His campaign later released a statement saying, in part, “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also.”\n\n On Sunday night, Trump rounds out his weekend rally blitz with a rally in Macon, Georgia.","summary":"The GOP presidential nominee was lethargic during his appearance in Kinston, North Carolina on Sunday","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-forgets-what-state-north-carolina-rally-1235152016/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Donald-Trump-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:38:59","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":262180060,"title":"US election: Harris, Trump in final push for votes tomorrow","text":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump began a frantic last push across the United States swing states on Sunday, with less than 48 hours of campaigning left to secure a decisive edge in a bitterly fought and historically close presidential election.\n\n“The fate of our nation is in your hands. On Tuesday, you have to stand up,” Trump said at his first rally of the day in Pennsylvania, where he doubled down on unfounded claims of election rigging.\n\nAFP reports that over 76 million people have cast early ballots ahead of Tuesday’s climax and the battle is down to the wire – with more states functionally tied in polls at this point than in any comparable election.\n\nThe closeness of the race is all the more remarkable given its dramatic twists and the fact that the candidates could hardly be further apart in their campaign styles and visions for the future.\n\nA final New York Times/Siena poll on Sunday flagged some incremental changes in the key battleground states, but the results from all seven remained firmly within the margin of error.\n\nHarris – desperate to shore up the Great Lakes states seen as essential to any Democratic ticket – was to spend the day in Michigan, beginning in Detroit before a stop in Pontiac and an evening rally at Michigan State University.\n\nTrump’s Sunday timetable centred on Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, the three biggest prizes in the “Electoral College” system that awards states influence according to their population.\n\nTrump is expected to reject the results if he loses, as he did four years ago.\n\nOn Sunday, he seized on isolated irregularities caught by election officials to amplify his claims of widespread “cheating.”\n\n“They are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing,” he insisted at the rally.\n\nRepublicans are also scrambling to contain fallout in Pennsylvania – home to a large Puerto Rican community – after a speaker at Trump’s New York rally prompted outrage by describing the US territory as a “floating island of garbage.”\n\nLike Pennsylvania, Michigan is among the seven closely watched battlegrounds. \n\nTrump flipped the state, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden returned it to the Democratic column in 2020, buoyed by unionised workers and a large Black community.\n\nBut this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nPollsters have noted an erosion in Black support for the Democratic ticket and Harris’s aides acknowledge that they still have work to do to turn out enough African American men to match Biden’s winning coalition in 2020.\n\nBut with reproductive rights emerging as a top voter concern, her campaign has taken some comfort from the large proportion of women turning out among the early voters.\n\nHarris wrapped a day on the campaign trail Saturday with a surprise appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” mocking her presidential election rival Donald Trump on the iconic sketch show.\n\n“Keep Kamala and carry on-ala!” the vice president said in a well-received appearance alongside Maya Rudolph, the comedian who has been playing her as “America’s fun aunt” on the show.\n\nKeen on as much TV exposure as possible, the Harris campaign has booked a two-minute spot to air during Sunday’s NFL football games, including the matchup between the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions, both from crucial swing states.\n\nIn the ad, Harris pledges to be “a president for all Americans” and promises to “build a brighter future for our nation.”\n\nHer campaign said its own research shows the “last week has proven decisive in cementing the choice in this election with both undecided and lower-propensity voters,” particularly the contrast of two candidates’ closing argument rallies.\n\nHarris, 60, got a boost Saturday in Iowa as the final Des Moines Register poll before Election Day — seen as a highly credible test of wider public sentiment — showed a stunning turnaround, with Harris ahead in a state won easily by Trump in 2016 and 2020.\n\nAt his morning rally in Pennsylvania, Trump dismissed the findings as a “fake poll.”","summary":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump began a frantic last push across the United States swing states on Sunday, with less than 48 hours of campaigning left to secure a decisive edge in a bitterly fought and historically close presidential election. “The fate of our nation is in your hands.

Trump intensified his verbal attacks against a “grossly incompetent” national leadership and the American media, steering his rally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at one point on to the topic of violence against members of the press.\n\nThe GOP nominee for the White House noted the ballistic glass placed in front of him at events after a gunman’s assassination attempt in July at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump talked about places where he saw openings in that protection.\n\n“I have this piece of glass here,” he said. “But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much.”\n\nIt was the second time in recent days that Trump has talked about guns being pointed at people he considers enemies. He suggested former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic, wouldn’t be willing to support foreign wars if she had “nine barrels shooting at her.”\n\nWith less than 48 hours before Election Day, Trump continues to promote falsehoods about elections and argue that he can only lose to Democrat Kamala Harris if he is cheated, even though polls suggest a tight race.\n\nSome of his allies, notably former chief strategist Steve Bannon, have encouraged him to prematurely declare victory on Tuesday even if the race is too early to call. That’s what Trump did four years ago, kicking off a process of fighting the election results that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nFor much of this year, Trump has run a relatively disciplined campaign that emphasized the issues and voters his aides believe could deliver him victory, even as he clung to false theories about voter fraud and went on frequent digressions stirring controversy. But that discipline is increasingly collapsing.\n\nTrump in recent weeks has joked about golfer Arnold Palmer’s genitalia, continued using gendered or sexist language in his efforts to win over women and staged a rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden that included crude and racist insults that dominated headlines.\n\nTrump co-campaign manager Susie Wiles, long credited with bringing order to his often-chaotic political operation, watched the former president silently from off stage Sunday.\n\nHis campaign later sought to clarify his meaning in talking about the media.\n\n“President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about,” campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. “The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else.”\n\nHarris was campaigning Sunday in Michigan, where she told a predominately Black church congregation in Detroit that God offers America a “divine plan strong enough to heal division.”\n\nThe two major candidates offered starkly different tones with the campaign almost at an end, as Harris said voters can reject “chaos, fear and hate.”\n\nTrump usually veers from subject to subject, a discursive style he has labeled “the weave.” But outside the Lancaster airport, he went on long tangents and hardly mentioned his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris.\n\nTrump referred to John Bolton, his former national security adviser and now a strident critic, as a “dumb son of a b—.” And he repeated familiar and debunked theories about voter fraud, alleging that Democrats could only win by cheating. Public polls indicate a tight and competitive race across the battleground states that will determine the Electoral College outcome.\n\n“It’s a crooked country,” Trump said. “And we’re going to make it straight. We’re going to make it straight.”\n\nHarris pushed back at Trump’s characterizations of U.S. elections, telling reporters after the church service that Trump’s comments are “meant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country.” Those “good systems” were in place in 2020, Harris said, and “he lost.”\n\nThe vice president said she trusts the upcoming vote tally and urged voters, “in particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for this tactic, which I think includes, suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won’t matter.”\n\n“Trump’s unhinged ramblings and dangerous rhetoric confirm what those closest to him have already told us: he is completely unfit to lead and would put our democracy and the rule of law at risk if given a chance,” Alex Floyd, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement, referring to former Trump aides who have warned against returning him to the White House, including retired military officers who said he’s a fascist.\n\nTrump, for his part, acknowledged that he was sidestepping his usual approach with his conspiratorial speech. He repeatedly talked about disregarding the advice of his aides, repeating their feedback in a mocking voice and insisting that he had to talk about election fraud despite their objections.\n\nTrump at one point suggested that he wouldn’t deliver this version of his speech again: “I hope you’ve enjoyed this,” he said, “because I’m only doing this one time.”\n\nIndeed, his next speech a few hours later at an airport in Kinston, North Carolina, drifted between prepared remarks and familiar stories. Trump praised David McCormick, the businessman running for Senate in Pennsylvania, appearing to briefly lose track of his location but quickly recovering.\n\n“Where’s David? Is he around some place?” Trump said. “You know we just left him. He’s a great guy.”\n\nSome rallygoers began leaving almost immediately. One of them was Whitney Riley, 60, who said she desperately wanted to stay but had another event. She noted Trump started late.\n\n“I got to see him land. I got to see him open,” said Riley, wearing Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hat and an American flag scarf. “And that’ll have to be enough.”","summary":"With less than 48 hours before Election Day, Trump continues to promote&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-discusses-shooting-of-journalists-and-regrets-leaving-white-house-following-2020-defeat/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Trump-talks-about-reporters-being-shot-and-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:30:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":262179112,"title":"Ông Trump ẩn ý không công nhận kết quả bầu cử nếu thua","text":"Kết quả thăm dò dư luận trước bầu cử Mỹ chính xác tới mức nào?\n\n Các đơn vị thăm dò dư luận trước thềm bầu cử Mỹ phải đối mặt với nhiều thách thức, nhưng cũng đã có sự điều chỉnh trước cuộc bầu cử năm nay.\n\n Các kết quả thăm dò thường không thể hiện hoàn chỉnh quan điểm của người Mỹ trước thềm bầu cử (Ảnh: Reuters).\n\nKhi nhắc đến thăm dò dư luận trước bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ năm 2016, nhiều người Mỹ sẽ coi đây là một sai lầm lớn. Đa số cuộc khảo sát khi đó cho rằng bà Hillary Clinton sẽ thắng cử. Kết quả, người chiến thắng lại là ông Donald Trump. Trên thực tế, các tổ chức khảo sát đã đán.h giá thấp sự ủng hộ dành cho ông Trump tại các bang chiến địa.\n\nTuy nhiên, báo New York Times chỉ ra, số liệu thăm dò ở quy mô toàn quốc khá tương đồng với số phiếu phổ thông, chỉ số mà bà Hillary Clinton xếp trên.\n\nVới một cuộc bầu cử sát sao như năm 2024, thăm dò dư luận càng thêm khó khăn. Một số kết quả thăm dò chỉ ra bà Harris dẫn trước, số khác cho rằng người dẫn trước là ông Trump.\n\n\"Sự thật là thăm dò dư luận - và các mô hình chủ yếu dựa vào kết quả thăm dò để dự báo kết quả - không thể tự tin dự đoán những gì xảy ra vào ngày 5/11 tới\", ông Brian Klaas, phó giáo sư chính trị toàn cầu tại trường University College London (UCL), viết trên trang tin Atlantic.\n\n Khó khăn bủa vây\n\nTrong mỗi cuộc bầu cử, kết quả thăm dò đều có mức độ chênh lệch nhất định với kết quả cuối cùng. Đây là điều không thể tránh khỏi vì các đơn vị thăm dò chỉ có thể ước đoán những ai sẽ thực sự đi bầu. Bên cạnh đó, nhiều người chỉ đưa ra quyết định khi tới hòm phiếu. Một số sự kiện đột xuất cũng có thể xuất hiện ở những phút cuối cùng.\n\nTừ bài học của năm 2016, giới phân tích chính trị đã chỉ ra điểm yếu của các cuộc thăm dò dư luận là không thể xác định đầy đủ các \"điểm mù\" trong quan điểm của cử tri.\n\nRất nhiều người cảm thấy xấu hổ và không dám thừa nhận mình sẽ bầu cho ông Trump, ứng viên gây tranh cãi hàng đầu trong lịch sử nước Mỹ hiện đại. Do đó, dữ liệu thu thập được không chính xác. Trên thực tế, kết quả phân tích của New York Times cũng cho thấy mức độ sai lệch cao hơn trong các cuộc bầu cử có sự hiện diện của ông Trump.\n\n\"Tên ông Trump trên lá phiếu, vì lý do nào đó, khiến việc thăm dò dư luận khó khăn hơn\", ông Berwood Yost, Giám đốc Trung tâm thăm dò dư luận thuộc Đại học Franklin & Marshall, bang Pennsylvania, nhận xét.\n\nBên cạnh đó, việc chọn mẫu cũng đôi lúc không hoàn toàn hoàn hảo. Trong cuộc bầu cử năm 2016, nhóm cử tri có trình độ giáo dục thấp đã không được tính đến đầy đủ, một phần do tỷ lệ phản hồi của nhóm này thấp hơn với những người có trình độ giáo dục cao.\n\nTỷ lệ người trả lời điện thoại của các trung tâm thăm dò cũng có xu hướng giảm.\n\n\"Mọi người không trả lời điện thoại. 10 năm trước, bạn có thể phải gọi 20 người để có người bạn cần. Giờ đây, con số đấy tăng gấp đôi: Phải gọi 40 người để tìm thấy người bạn cần. Do đó, các cuộc thăm dò mất nhiều thời gian và tốn nhiều tiề.n bạc hơn\", bà Rachael Cobb, giáo sư chính trị học tại Đại học Suffolk, nói với CNBC.\n\nSự phân cực trong đội ngũ cử tri cũng khiến các cuộc thăm dò gặp thêm khó khăn. Bà Lonna Atkeson, giáo sư nghiên cứu về quan điểm dư luận tại Đại học bang Florida, cho biết từng nhận được những email trả lời thẳng thừng sẽ không tham gia thăm dò, thậm chí ch.ỉ tríc.h bà \"tẩy não\" tr.ẻ e.m.\n\nDữ liệu trong bốn thập niên qua được New York Times phân tích cho thấy kết quả thăm dò có thể thiên lệch ở cả hai đảng. Mức độ chính xác cũng tương đối khác biệt kể cả với hai cuộc bầu cử gần nhau. Ví dụ, sau chênh lệch lớn năm 2020, các đơn vị bầu cử đưa ra dự đoán tương đối chính xác trước bầu cử giữa kỳ năm 2022.\n\nTrước cuộc bầu cử tổng thống năm nay, các hãng thăm dò đang tìm mọi cách để cải thiện dự đoán của mình. Một số quan tâm tới các nhóm cử tri khác nhau, trong khi số khác quan tâm nhiều hơn đến các cử tri thiếu kiên nhẫn, không trả lời hết tất cả câu hỏi.\n\n Ứng viên Kamala Harris và đối thủ Donald Trump (Ảnh: AFP).\n\nÔng Don Levy, Giám đốc Viện Nghiên cứu Đại học Siena (SCRI), đơn vị tổ chức thăm dò dư luận cùng New York Times, cho biết nếu tính đến nhóm cử tri trên, kết quả thăm dò sẽ dịch chuyển \"khoảng 1,25 điểm phần trăm về phía ông Trump\". Năm nay, SCRI dành nhiều suất phỏng vấn hơn cho các cử tri được phân loại \"ở nông thôn, khả năng cao bầu cho ông Trump\".\n\n\"Nếu bạn coi họ là các viên kẹo M&M - cử tri bầu cho ông Trump là kẹo đỏ chẳng hạn - chúng tôi đã cho thêm một số viên kẹo đỏ vào hũ\", ông Levy nói với CNBC.\n\n Bang nào có kết quả thăm dò dễ sai nhất?\n\nĐộ chính xác của kết quả thăm dò dư luận cũng có sự chênh lệch giữa các bang. Ông Nathaniel Rakich, chuyên gia phân tích bầu cử của trang web FiveThirtyEight, đã tính toán mức độ sai lệch với kết quả thăm dò dư luận trong vòng 21 ngày trước bầu cử tại các bang, tính từ năm 1998 đến nay. Kết luận rút ra là kết quả tại một số bang thường chính xác hơn hẳn các bang khác.\n\nVới mức độ sai lệch trung bình 3,3 điểm phần trăm, kết quả thăm dò toàn quốc thường chính xác nhất. Đây là điều không mấy bất ngờ do dân số cả nước lớn hơn nên đơn vị khảo sát dễ xác định mẫu hơn. Bên cạnh đó, các cuộc đua vào thượng viện và thống đốc - vốn chỉ giới hạn ở quy mô một bang - thường dễ sai lệch hơn bầu cử tổng thống.\n\nXét đến các bang riêng lẻ, Colorado, Virginia và Oregon thường có kết quả thăm dò chính xác nhất. Tuy nhiên, đối với giới quan sát chính trị, dữ liệu này không có quá nhiều tác dụng, khi cả 3 bang đều được dự đoán sẽ bầu cho bà Harris.\n\nĐiều họ chú ý hơn sẽ là kết quả tại 4 bang chiến địa thuộc \"Vành đai Mặt Trời\" phía Tây và Nam nước Mỹ gồm Nevada, Bắc Carolina, Arizona và Georgia. 4 bang này đều nằm trong số những nơi ghi nhận tỷ lệ sai lệch thấp nhất, dao động từ 3,8 đến 4,1 điểm phần trăm.\n\nNếu chỉ tính từ năm 2016 đến nay, tỷ lệ sai lệch của Nevada thậm chí chỉ là 3,3 điểm phần trăm, thấp hơn mức ghi nhận trên cả nước cùng kỳ (3,9 điểm). Đây là điều tương đối bất ngờ vì Nevada bị coi là bang khó thăm dò dư luận do người dân ở đây có xu hướng đổi chỗ ở thường xuyên hơn và làm trái giờ nhiều hơn các bang khác.\n\nNgược lại, số liệu thăm dò dư luận ở các bang chiến địa miền Bắc ít tin cậy hơn, dù vẫn chính xác hơn mức trung bình. Tính từ năm 1998, mức sai lệch tại Pennsylvania và Wisconsin là 4,6 điểm phần trăm, trong khi tại Michigan là 4,9 điểm phần trăm.\n\nĐặc biệt, Wisconsin có tiếng là bang rất dễ ghi nhận kết quả sai lầm. Năm 2020, ABC News/Washington Post từng đán.h giá ông Biden dẫn trước 17 điểm phần trăm tại bang này. Kết quả chung cuộc, ông Biden chỉ đán.h bại ông Trump với 0,83 điểm phần trăm chênh lệch.\n\nTuy nhiên, Wisconsin chưa phải bang khó thăm dò dư luận nhất. 3 bang xếp \"đầu bảng\" về chỉ số này là Oklahoma, Wyoming và Hawaii. Tính từ năm 1998, mức độ sai lệch trung bình tại Hawaii lên 10,4 điểm phần trăm. Nguyên nhân có thể đến từ mức độ quan tâm tới chính trị thấp của người Hawaii, cũng như sự đa dạng về sắc tộc khiến việc chọn mẫu khó khăn hơn.\n\n\"Điều gì khiến các bang dễ hoặc khó thăm dò? Diện tích và dân số chắc chắn là nhân tố chính. Tuy nhiên, dữ liệu cũng cho thấy rõ kinh nghiệm là yếu tố quan trọng. Các bang thăm dò chuẩn xác nhất là các bang được thăm dò thường xuyên nhất\", ông Rakich nhận định.","summary":"Cựu Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump nói rằng, ông lẽ ra nên ở lại Nhà Trắng ngay cả khi thua trong cuộc bầu cử năm 2020.","url":"https://vietgiaitri.com/ong-trump-an-y-khong-cong-nhan-ket-qua-bau-cu-neu-thua-20241104i7308551/","image":"https://t.vietgiaitri.com/2024/11/2/ong-trump-an-y-khong-cong-nhan-ket-qua-bau-cu-neu-thua-600x432-dd5-7308551.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:27:30","author":"Minh Phương","authors":["Minh Phương"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vn","sentiment":0.05},{"id":262179354,"title":"Keeping ballots and poll workers safe in Georgia's 2024 election","text":"In the runup to Election Day in Georgia, Gabriel Sterling is trying to prevent all possible scenarios that might disturb his state's vote.Sterling is the chief operating officer for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose office runs elections in Georgia, a battleground state preparing for a very close Election Day. In 2021, then-President Donald Trump called Raffensperger, a Republican, and tried to get him to change the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state. Raffensperger refused. Later, both Raffensperger and Sterling testified before the House January 6th Committee and a grand jury in Georgia about the 2020 election. Why Georgia election officials say voters can trust the process in 2024Today, election deniers continue to use debunked conspiracy theories to challenge the legitimacy of the 2020 election, and officials hope to proactively ward off any suspicions about this year's contest. For this week's 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley spoke with Sterling to see how Georgia officials are preparing for this year's election â both in safeguarding the ballot and in assuring people that the race in the Peach State is fair. Security precautions at the pollsOne of Sterling's priorities for Election Day is keeping the polls safe, both for voters and for poll workers. He told Pelley his office is working across the state with local law enforcement agencies to centralize the safety effort and to make plans for various Election Day scenarios. In the event of any action that disturbs the polls â such as a person verbally assaulting a poll worker or someone threatening a voter with a gun â Georgia has invested in a texting tool for every county that wants to opt in. With one text, a poll worker can immediately get through to the county elections director, the state elections director, and local law enforcement at the same time. In Georgia's Election Day war room, all the agencies who may need to be called upon to keep the vote going will assemble. This includes the FBI and Georgia's state equivalent, and the companies in charge of gas, power, and trains in the state. \"We really have to think about everything you can think of,\" Sterling said. \"A tree falls over and knocks out the power somewhere? We have to work quickly to get it done, because any one of these things can then turn into a conspiracy theory, as we've learned over and over again.\"Securing the ballotAfter explaining how Georgia plans to keep poll workers and voters safe, Sterling walked 60 Minutes through Georgia's approach for securing its ballots. At the polls, the first thing Georgia voters must do is show their ID. They bring it to a poll worker holding a check-in device called a \"poll pad.\" If voters don't have a driver's license, they can use another government ID. The barcode on the back of the ID pulls up their information in the state voter rolls, assuring they are legally allowed to cast a ballot. Once the ID has been scanned, a voter signs the poll pad, and the poll worker signs to verify that they witnessed the voter's signature. The poll worker then encodes the appropriate ballot for the voter's precinct onto a green voter card, which is used to access the ballot marking device, or BMD.Although each of Georgia's 159 counties has its own election team, the ballots for every resident are prepared and coded by the secretary of state's office.Georgia election officials defend voting system against barrage of false claims, conspiracy theories After the voter inserts the green voter card into the device and selects their desired candidates, the machine prints a paper copy of their ballot, indicating exactly who they voted for and asking the voter to confirm their selection. From there, the paper ballot goes into a scanner, which takes an image of the ballot and keeps a record of the number of ballots that have been scanned. Sterling told 60 Minutes the paper copy is an important step. \"You want to have an auditable trail,\" he said. \"So that if the memory cards get corrupted, we lose anything that happens on these [BMDs], we can compare the paper records to the outcomes that came out of all the machinery to make sure that it's done correctly.\"Paul Petruska, a trained poll worker in Georgia, said the redundancy in the process shows the integrity of the state's voting system. \"You have three different areas that are keeping a count,\" he told 60 Minutes. \"All three are totally separated from each other.\"The poll pads, Petruska explained, have data from the state-run registrar of who is eligible to vote, and they cannot be altered at the local level. These devices begin the count of voters. Next, the ballot marking devices, which are independent of the poll pads, tally the number of voters and record their selections. Finally, the scanner that photographs the paper ballots also counts the number of ballots inserted. All three devices independently count the number of votes recorded, and the numbers can be compared against each other.To further safeguard the ballots, voting machines and scanners are not connected to the Internet and cannot be hacked, Sterling told 60 Minutes. Each machine has two memory cards where ballot results are downloaded. The first memory card is taken by two election workers to the respective county's headquarters. There, the results will be put into another offline machine, which tallies the votes. Those results are then downloaded onto a separate memory stick and put into a computer that is connected directly to the state's election system, where the votes are posted publicly by the secretary of state's office. The second memory card, along with the paper ballots that were inside the scanner, are taken to local election headquarters through a strict chain of custody. If people still doubt that votes can be changed or added, poll worker Petruska pointed to the hand count. After the election, election workers take a percentage of specific races and hand count the voters' selections as reflected by the paper ballots to verify the number matches up with the record from the ballot marking devices. \"There's no way you can rig the system. You can't stuff ballots,\" Petruska said. \"You can't bring in people into the registrar that aren't there. It's just all falsehood. It's somebody standing on a soap box wanting to scare people, use fear tactics. And we're here to make sure that doesn't work.\" The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann.","summary":"Ahead of Election Day, Georgia officials are preparing for this year's contest – both in safeguarding the ballot and in assuring people that the race in the Peach State is fair.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/keeping-ballots-and-poll-workers-safe-in-georgia-2024-election-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/03/793e2285-2b23-4d7e-8a0b-0266dcc173db/thumbnail/1200x630/d8be3bacc40b45b2a0aab254b7ec45a6/ot-gaelectionworkersfd.jpg?v=379420b9063a2aadbcd559df18e2d1ae","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/11/03/2385274435573/3311703_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:26:37","author":"Brit McCandless Farmer","authors":["Brit McCandless Farmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":262179362,"title":"Georgia officials defend voting system against barrage of conspiracies","text":"More than 70 million people have already voted in the 2024 election, and Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State's office, knows what he'll say to people who will inevitably challenge the results. \"I'm sorry that your candidate lost. But the rules are the rules. The law is the law. And the count is the count,\" Sterling said. As of Friday, more than half of registered voters in Georgia had already voted, according to data from Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office.Sterling and Raffensperger were among the Republicans pushing back against claims of fraud in 2020, when Georgia — where President Biden won — was at the center of a scheme to overthrow the election results. In a state where Republicans controlled every branch of government, Raffensperger stood up to former President Donald Trump and stood by the state's results. Why Georgia election officials say voters can trust the process in 2024\"I work for the people of Georgia. I respond and I work for the voters of Georgia,\" Raffensperger told 60 Minutes in an interview. \"My job is to run a fair, honest, accurate election.\"Election lie chaos That fairness and honesty was met with threats of violence toward election workers. Sterling, in a news conference after the 2020 election, urged Trump and lawmakers to condemn the threats. \"Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get hurt. Someone's going to get shot. Someone's going to get killed,\" Sterling said.But election chaos continued, with some election deniers storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Sterling hoped his message would get through to everyone, but it hasn't. \"There's some you're never going to convince and you just have to accept that you're never going to convince them,\" Sterling said. \"But for the vast majority of Americans who have questions, basically they think, 'Well, if there's this much smoke, there must be something. Nobody would lie this much about it.' So I think there's savable souls there, who basically, they want to understand.\"Does fraud happen?There is some election fraud, but it's rare, CBS News election consultant David Becker said. Few people know elections like Becker, who helped enforce voting rights at the Justice Department and who led the creation of a data center now used by half of the states in the U.S. that help keep voter records up to date.\"We're talking about dozens of votes in a big national election. It is, for all intents and purposes, impossible to steal a big national election. We are so decentralized with almost 10,000 different jurisdictions run by Democratic and Republican election officials,\" Becker said. \"Our voter lists are as accurate as they ever have been before, and they're checked regularly.\"In Georgia, Trump's lawyers brought shocking tales of fraud to the legislature, but investigations by state police, the FBI and Raffensperger's office found the allegations were false. \"They said there were 66,000 underage voters. There were zero,\" Raffensperger said. \"Then they said that there were 2,423 non-registered voters. There were zero.\"What drives election fraud conspiracy theoriesThere's always been some amount of skepticism about election results, but it reached new heights in 2020, when Trump ran against President Biden, Sterling said. In the 2020 election, Trump lost Georgia by just 11,779 votes. Two recounts confirmed his loss. Despite that, Trump said things were \"so bad in Georgia.\" \"Nobody wants to see the kind of fraud that this election has come to represent,\" Trump said on Nov. 26, 2020.According to Becker, claims of stolen elections are driven by one factor: whether your candidate won. Keeping ballots and poll workers safe in Georgia's 2024 election\"Sadly, tens of millions of Americans have been targeted for this disinformation. They've been preyed upon by losing candidates and foreign adversaries,\" Becker said. \"And importantly, they have donated money. Because a lot of this is financial. There's a financial incentive for those who've spread the lies, who have raised, let's face it, hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, off the lie that our elections aren't to be trusted.\"Voters remain skeptical today, just days away from the 2024 election. \"We have to tell them over and over again, 'Voter suppression's fake. Voter fraud is fake. It's used to raise money and get you angry,'\" Sterling said.Debunking election fraud conspiracy theoriesWith false and misleading information circulating ahead of Election Day, Becker took on some of the conspiracy theories around election fraud in the United States.Conspiracy theory: Bogus votes are electronically inserted into a tabulation machine - \"They're not connected to the internet. They are under strict physical chain of custody. It is really hard to get access to a physical machine and do anything to it. And even if there were some attempt to hack the machine or, probably more likely, have some kind of malfunction of the machine, the audits would catch it,\" Becker said.Conspiracy theory: Immigrants who have crossed the border illegally are voting by the millions -\"That is 100% false,\" Becker said. \"Every single voter has to give a driver's license number or social security number, which is matched against files, databases that are held to make sure the voter is who they say they are, and they're eligible to vote. And we also know that states who have gone looking for non-citizens voters have found shockingly few even potential non-citizen registrants.\"Becker pointed to Ohio.\"Ohio just recently announced that in a period of time of over a decade it had found six possible cases of non-citizens voting,\" he said.The key to confidence in the 2024 election Paper ballots are key to giving voters confidence in the 2024 election, Becker said. Ninety five percent of Americans will vote on paper ballots, which are verifiable and auditable. \"And then we audit those ballots, which means we do hand counts of the ballots to compare them to the machine counts, to make sure the machine's got the right result,\" he said. Becker explained why voters should trust people working the election. \"I can tell you, I've been working with election officials for over a quarter of a century,\" he said. \"And when you talk to these election officials out there, Republicans and Democrats, they don't do this because it makes them rich and famous.\"They do it because it's a calling, Becker said. George Harrison, Beverly Woityra and Paul Petruska, trained poll workers in Cobb County, Georgia, are among those who answered that calling. In their experience, if there's a problem, it's nearly always because of a mistake the voter made. They'll listen to election doubters vent and answer their questions. Petruska shared a message for voters. \"Stay off the internet. Listen to the people, come down here and talk to us,\" Petruska said. \"Fact check with more than Facebook and TikTok.\"He also urged them to stop listening to gossip about elections. People need to have faith in the ballot, Sterling said, adding that election workers have done a lot of work to ensure voters can confidently accept election results. \"Every state in this country now has poked and prodded and looked at their processes. And we know that while we all do it slightly differently, everybody assures that there's one person and one vote. Everybody assures that there's a single ballot cast,\" Sterling said. \"Nearly every state in the Union now has audits after the fact. Every state in the Union tests their equipment beforehand in a public way.\"What should voters expect on Election DayThere will be breakdowns, mistakes and disinformation this year, but none of that should be confused with election-altering fraud, Becker said. Come Election Day, voters shouldn't expect to get results quickly in many races. \"Definitely don't expect to know who controls the United States House of Representatives. There are a lot of very close races, even in places like California, that will take days or maybe even weeks to resolve. The Senate we might know a little bit sooner, but unclear,\" Becker said. \"We probably will have a pretty good idea who won the presidency maybe around Thursday or Friday.\"That's because the race is essentially tied, including in Georgia, where Sterling is hoping America can endure its next close election without coming apart. \"I know that 2024 will be the safest and most secure election in history,\" Sterling said. \"It will be the most scrutinized election in history. And whoever the winner is, be it Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, we will know that they are the correct winner at the end of the day.\"","summary":"In Georgia, where millions of people have already voted, officials are focused on ensuring the vote counting process is accurate — and that voters actually believe that.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-election-officials-defend-system-after-trump-fraud-claims-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/01/99f14ede-24e9-4198-b05b-002b9fcb5e4a/thumbnail/1200x630/188b7861d2b2441ab1204f3673504e2b/60-minutes-full-episode-11-3-24.jpg?v=379420b9063a2aadbcd559df18e2d1ae","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/11/03/2385244227996/3311373_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:26:04","author":"Aliza Chasan,Scott Pelley","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Scott Pelley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":262179364,"title":"What Georgia election officials want voters to know about 2020 claims","text":"Tuesday, Americans will consider a question more vital than who wins the White House. They'll decide whether they have faith in the ballot. Whether Jan. 6, 2021 was the end of chaos or the beginning. Election fraud lies are aimed at destroying confidence. You're about to hear why they are lies. Gabriel Sterling is a messenger of election truth. He's the Republican chief operating officer for the Georgia secretary of state who runs elections there. Georgia was the center of the scheme to overthrow the 2020 election. Sterling says these are the stakes this Tuesday. Gabriel Sterling: People have to have faith in the outcomes, and for 200-some-odd years we had to have the acceptance of the person who came in second or lost to say, \"You know what? I lost. I will come back again and fight in two years.\" The reason we have ballots is to avoid bullets. And if you say, \"Ballots don't matter anymore,\" there's only one logical direction to go. And that's not healthy in any democracy.Scott Pelley: Why should Americans have confidence in this election?Gabriel Sterling: Every state in this country now has poked and prodded and looked at their processes. And we know that while we all do it slightly differently, everybody assures that there's one person and one vote. Everybody assures that there's a single ballot cast. Nearly every state in the Union now has audits after the fact. Every state in the Union tests their equipment beforehand in a public way. We have tons of people, processes and policies in place in all 50 states and the district to assure that the outcome of the election is correct.Scott Pelley: And there are millions of people who are skeptical about what you just said.Gabriel Sterling: There's always some level of skepticism. It's always there but it's reached a different level in the 2020 and 2024 elections.In the 2020 election, President Trump lost Georgia by a slender 11,779 votes. Two recounts confirmed his loss, but he said this. Donald Trump (on Nov. 26, 2020): Nobody wants to see the kind of fraud that this election has really come to represent, we are looking at things that are looking at things that are so bad in Georgia.Four days before the vote was to be certified on January 6th, Trump called Sterling's boss Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. Donald Trump (on call): So, look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have.In a state where Republicans controlled every branch of government, Raffensperger stood up to Trump on the call.Brad Raffensperger (on call): We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right. Trump's lawyers brought shocking tales of fraud to the legislature. But investigations by the state police, FBI and Raffensperger's office found none was true. Brad Raffensperger: They said there were 66,000 underage voters. There were zero. Then they said that there were 2,423 non-registered voters. There were zero. Scott Pelley: But you're a Republican. He was your president.Brad Raffensperger: I work for the people of Georgia. I respond and I work for the voters of Georgia. My job is to run a fair, honest, accurate election.But fairness and honesty were met with threats of violence.Gabriel Sterling (during press conference): It has all gone too far.Death threats to his election workers snapped Republican Gabe Sterling's patience. Gabriel Sterling (during press conference): It has to stop. Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up and if you are going to take a position of leadership, show some. Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone's gonna hurt. Someone's going to get shot. Someone's going to get killed.His warning was five weeks before January 6th.More than 1,000 rioters have been convicted—just part of the election lie chaos. Trump filed 64 lawsuits and lost 63. Lawyer Rudy Giuliani was sued to bankruptcy after falsely accusing Georgia election workers of fraud. Fox News paid $787 million to settle a suit that said Fox knew it was lying about the election. And Trump was indicted in Georgia. He's pleaded not guilty to election interference but four co-defendants did plead guilty to related charges. Sterling hoped his message would get through to everyone but it hasn't. Georgia election officials defend voting system against barrage of false claims, conspiracy theories Gabriel Sterling: And there's some you're never gonna convince and you just have to accept that you're never gonna convince them. But for the vast majority of Americans who have questions, basically they think, \"Well, if there's this much smoke, there must be something. Nobody would lie this much about it.\" So I think there's savable souls there, who basically they want to understand. We have to tell 'em over and over again, \"Voter suppression's fake. Voter fraud is fake. It's used to raise money and get you angry.\"Trump riled supporters with election denial from the very first time he was ever on a Republican ballot. He lost the Iowa caucus in 2016 and wrote… \"Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it.\" Later, when Trump won the national electoral vote but not the popular vote, he posted \"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" Later, a fraud commission he appointed, disbanded when it couldn't find the evidence. Scott Pelley: People are gonna say that the election was stolen. It's inevitable.Gabriel Sterling: Yes, it is.Scott Pelley: And to them you say what?Gabriel Sterling: I'm sorry that your candidate lost. But the rules are the rules. The law is the law. And the count is the count.David Becker: Georgia in many ways is a model. They do a lot of things exceptionally well.Few people know elections like David Becker. At the Justice Department he helped enforce voting rights. Later, he led the creation of a voter registration data center that is used today by half the states. Becker is a CBS News election consultant.David Becker: One of the things everyone should understand is the claims about election theft and fraud are not driven by the actual policies that exist in the states. They're driven by one factor, and one factor only. And that's whether your candidate won. Sadly tens of millions of Americans have been targeted for this disinformation. They've been preyed upon by losing candidates and foreign adversaries. And importantly, they have donated money. Because a lot of this is financial. There's a financial incentive for those who've spread the lies, who have raised, let's face it, hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars off the lie that our elections aren't to be trusted.Scott Pelley: Let's look at some of the conspiracy theories of fraud.

And even if there were some attempt to hack the machine or, probably more likely, have some kinda malfunction of the machine, the audits would catch it. Scott Pelley: Another of the conspiracy theories is that illegal immigrants are voting by the millions.David Becker: That is a 100% false. Every single voter has to give a driver's license number or social security number, which is matched against files, databases that are held to make sure the voter is who they say they are, and they're eligible to vote. And we also know that states who have gone looking for non-citizens voters have found shockingly few even potential non-citizen registrants. Ohio just recently announced that in a period of time of over a decade it had found six possible cases of non-citizens voting.Scott Pelley: But fraud does happen, doesn't it?David Becker: It happens very rarely. We know how much fraud in this country happens. We know it's not zero, but it's very, very close to zero. Scott Pelley: We're not talking about millions of votes or hundreds of thousands of votes?David Becker: No, we're talking about dozens of votes in a big national election. It is, for all intents and purposes, impossible to steal a big national election. We are so decentralized with almost 10,000 different jurisdictions run by Democratic and Republican election officials. Our voter lists are as accurate as they ever have been before, and they're checked regularly. David Becker told us the key to confidence in this election, is the paper ballot. David Becker: Ninety five percent plus of all Americans are gonna vote on paper ballots, which are verifiable and auditable to confirm the count was accurate. And then we audit those ballots, which means we do hand counts of the ballots to compare them to the machine counts, to make sure the machine's got the right result.Scott Pelley: Why should we trust the people who are working the election?David Becker: I can tell you I've been workin' with election officials for over a quarter of a century. And when you talk to these election officials out there, Republicans and Democrats, they don't do this because it makes them rich and famous. They do this because it's a calling.… a calling heard by George Harrison, Beverly Woityra and Paul Petruska, trained poll workers near Atlanta. They told us, when there's a problem it's nearly always a mistake the voter made. And there's a saying at state headquarters, \"if you don't know how anything works, everything's a conspiracy.\"Keeping ballots and poll workers safe in Georgia's 2024 electionGeorge Harrison: Sometimes they just want to vent. Sometimes they just wanna have somebody listen to their question and say, \"Hey, I have this question. What about this? I try to have all of my voters, by the time they leave, be in a better mood than when they came in.Election doubters are welcome to volunteer. Like two skeptical women who took the four-hour training course recently. Beverly Woityra: And they just wanted to see for themselves, and they were both convinced by the time they left training that everything was on the up and up.Paul Petruska: I would say to the voters who are watching this, stay off the internet. Listen to the people, come down here and talk to us. Fact check with more than Facebook and TikTok. What I would want people to take away from this whole entire conversation, is that gossip, gossip kills.Gossip isn't the only menace. Many Georgia poll workers have a 911 panic button on a lanyard. Offices are armed with the antidote, Narcan. Last year, Fentanyl was mailed in an attack on election workers just doing their jobs. David Becker: They want to ensure that all eligible voters, and only eligible voters can vote in a system that is accurate and breeds confidence. But confidence remains under attack. This post last week claimed illegal Haitian immigrants are voting with Georgia driver's licenses. The FBI traced it to Russia. Election consultant David Becker told us, there'll be more disinformation and a few breakdowns, and mistakes, none of which should be confused with fraud.Scott Pelley: What should we expect in terms of results on election night?David Becker: So on Election Night don't expect to know the winner. Definitely don't expect to know who controls the United States House of Representatives. There are a lot of very close races-- even in places like California, that will take days or maybe even weeks to resolve. The Senate we might know a little bit sooner, but unclear. We probably will have a pretty good idea who won the presidency maybe around Thursday or Friday.That's because the race is essentially tied, including in Georgia where Gabriel Sterling, the Republican secretary of state's chief operating officer, hopes America can endure its next close election without coming apart. Scott Pelley: What is it like to be the chief operating firewall against lies and myths in the election?Gabriel Sterling: I've never heard it put to me quite that way. Wild horses couldn't drive me away from this job right now. I mean, I know our system is great in the state. I know the elections across America are safe and secure. I know that 2024 will be the safest and most secure election in history. It will be the most scrutinized election in history. And whoever the winner is, be it Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, we will know that they are the correct winner at the end of the day.Produced by Henry Schuster and Sarah Turcotte.

That allowed her to get a jump on potential protesters and disruptions.\n\nShe gave a shout out to leaders of the Arab American community ‘which has deep and proud roots here in Michigan,’ then added: ‘This year has been difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza.’ \n\nShe said as president she would do ‘everything in my power to end the war in Gaza’ – getting cheered loudly inside the venue – as well as to ‘bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure israel is secure’ and ensure ‘the Palestinians people can realize their right to dignity, freedom and security and self determination.’\n\nHarris managed to get through the speech without suffering major protests – although a man yelled ‘Cease fire!’ just after she heralded ‘Gen Z’ and told student leaders, ‘I see you and I see your power.’\n\nDemocrats traditionally hold the edge among young voters, but the Harris camp has had to stare down troubling surveys showing erosion in the group in battleground Michigan – a state that is key to her most plausible path to victory.\n\nAt the same time, she must contend with worries about a shift of some Arab American and Muslim voters toward Donald Trump amid fury over Israel’s war in Gaza.\n\nThe late polling shows a big gender gap, with Harris running up the score among women, and Trump holding a big edge among men.\n\nOne of her biggest lines in East Lansing came when she spoke about abortion and the ‘fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body.’\n\nHarris already banked the vote of Daphne Ruby, a 21-year-old fourth year student. ‘Honestly, it was just very calming … I feel like we all just agree on one thing and that’s just like we want something better for our country,’ she said.\n\nBrooke Racine, 19, a first-time voter from Lake Orion, liked how Harris handled the Gaza issue. ‘She hasn’t really said much about it, so I’m happy that she said first thing’ about the issue, and noted that a lot of college students are concerned about the issue.\n\n‘I think her saying it here, and saying it so clear, that was really important,’ she said.\n\nWith just two days before Election Day, it was a day of demographic strategy for the Harris campaign.\n\nThe campaign said there were 7,000 people packed into the arena, with more outside in an overflow area. \n\nHarris’s optimism came on a day when some encouraging polls came in for her.\n\nBut she holds the narrowest of an edge in battleground Michigan and Wisconsin, with Trump holding a tiny margin in Pennsylvania in the RealClearPolitics average. \n\nHarris started her day in Detroit, where she visited a black church just hours after her surprise trip to appear on ‘Saturday Night Live‘ – in a bid to get before as many eyeballs on TV as possible. \n\nLater, she visited a predominantly black barbershop in Pontiac, Michigan. a critical battleground where Joe Biden won with 56 percent of the vote in 2020.\n\nShe also popped into Kuzzo’s Chicken and Waffles in Detroit’s Livernois district – in the final hours of a campaign that began with a play by Trump to question her racial identity.\n\nThose stops were meant to underline the importance of African American voters turning out to vote, in a race where Trump has eaten away at a traditional edge among Black and Hispanic men. \n\n‘As a nation, we face real challenges, we carry real burdens. We feel real pain, and we must remember that faith, combined with our actions, gives us power, the power to move past division and fear and chaos, the power to do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with our God,’ she said, speaking at Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ in Detroit.\n\n‘And the power to fulfill The promise of America, the promise of freedom and opportunity, not just for some, but for all,’ she said, in a city with a long history of labor and civil rights direct action.\n\n‘So church, we have two days, two days until we decide the fate of our nation,’ she said.\n\nThe shock Des Moines Register / Mediacom poll had Harris leading Trump 47-44 in Iowa, a state that hasn’t been competitive in a presidential race in November for years.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris fired up a crowd of young voters on&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-energizes-young-voters-at-michigan-state-campus-confident-in-her-campaign-momentum-after-a-promising-poll-result-in-iowa/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-tells-Michigan-State-campus-crowd-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:25:16","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.285},{"id":262178432,"title":"Newspaper headlines: Spanish ‘flood fury’ and US candidates in ‘final push’","text":"Many of Monday’s newspapers focus on two things: The US election and Spain’s King and Queen being pelted with mud when visiting flood-devastated Valencia. Both stories appear on the front page of the Guardian, along with a much-reported photograph of King Felipe with mud on his face, consoling a local. The Metro also leads on the confrontation the King and Queen of Spain faced in Valencia. The headline ‘Spanish royals face floods fury’ reflects how the residents felt. There has been anger at a perceived lack of warning and insufficient support from authorities after the floods. With one day to go until the US election, the i reports on its own poll which suggests that many Britons want Democrat Kamala Harris to win, but expect Republican Donald Trump to return to the White House. Other polls suggest that the race is still exceptionally close. The Financial Times leads on a story critical of Donald Trump. ‘That he is even on the cusp of the American presidency again is remarkable.’ the paper says. In a separate story, the paper reports that a ‘Barbie world’ is planned, according to the doll’s manufacturer Mattel. The Sun leads on a different story, focused on Prince Andrew. The paper reports that the Duke of York’s Windsor home is going ‘to ruin’. The story follows earlier reports the King has ordered Prince Andrew’s annual allowance to be stopped according to an updated biography of the monarch by Robert Hardman. The Times reports businessman Sir James Dyson has criticised the government’s Budget as ‘spiteful’, following its release on 30 October. Images of the King and Queen of Spain are prominent on the front page, describing the royal’s Valencia visit as ‘Emotional’. The Daily Mail continues its coverage of an updated biography on King Charles, by Robert Hardman. The paper offers an exclusive ‘moving’ story about the monarch’s experiences with cancer. Elsewhere, journalist Samantha Brick shares how her husband’s use of weight loss drug Ozempic has affected her own life. An image of a lead pipe and a bloodstained bag is on the front page of the Daily Mirror. The paper returns to a much reported story from 1974 of Lord Lucan, who disappeared after the body of Sandra Rivett, nanny to his three children, was found. This pipe is alleged to be the weapon used and is pictured for the first time. Actor Olivia Colman accompanies a marmalade sandwich-eating Paddington Bear on the front of the Daily Express, pictured at the premiere for the Paddington in Peru film. Colman plays a guitar-playing nun in the latest instalment. And finally, the Daily Star with the paper’s second consecutive Bonfire Night front page story. Monday’s paper estimates that temperatures will reach 21C this week. The BBC Weather’s Matt Taylor has forecast temperatures will be around 15C.","summary":"Many of Monday&#8217;s newspapers focus on two things: The US election and Spain&#8217;s King and Queen being pelted with mud when visiting flood-devastated Valencia.

He accused the attorney general of being a “friend” of the Biden-Harris Administration who doesn’t “stand up” for Bay State residents.\n\n“Non-citizens should not vote in elections and they should not be registered voters,” Craney said in a statement. “There are some who believe they should. Andrea Campbell should break her silence on this matter and protect the integrity of our voter rolls by signing onto the amicus.”\n\nCampbell’s office did not immediately respond to a Herald request for comment on Friday.\n\nA federal judge previously found that Virginia illegally purged more than 1,600 voter registrations over the past two months, an action the feds argued happened after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an executive order in August.\n\nA federal appeals court had allowed that judge’s order to remain in effect, triggering an emergency appeal from Youngkin’s administration which the high court granted last Wednesday.\n\nCampbell served on the Boston City Council for six years. In her second term, as council president in 2018, she led an effort that looked to allow non-citizens to vote in the city’s municipal elections.\n\n“I want to have conversations about how noncitizens can fully participate and come out of the shadows to do so,” Campbell said at the time. “These residents generate millions in taxes coming from folks who are identified as undocumented, DACA, legal permanent residents as well as having green cards.”\n\nLast year, the City Council approved a home rule petition that granted immigrants with “legal status” the ability to vote in local elections, over concerns that the move could jeopardize their path to attaining full citizenship.\n\nThe specter of immigrants voting illegally has been a main part of the political messaging this year from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans, even though such voting is rare in American elections.\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act requires a 90-day “quiet period” ahead of elections for the maintenance of voter rolls so that legitimate voters are not removed from the rolls by bureaucratic errors or last-minute mistakes that cannot be quickly corrected.\n\nOnly U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in presidential and state elections.\n\nMassachusetts GOP Chairwoman Amy Carnevale told the Herald that she believes “safeguarding elections … should be a priority for all elected officials.”\n\n“It is disappointing that the Massachusetts attorney general would not support the straightforward effort to ensure basic constitutional protections are in place to ensure election integrity,” Carnevale said in a statement on Friday, “and increase confidence that voting is conducted in a safe secure and legal manner.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report","summary":"Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell is being slammed for not supporting Virginia’s successful effort to remove non-citizens from the voter rolls.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/11/03/massachusetts-ag-slammed-for-not-supporting-virginias-effort-to-remove-non-citizens-as-voters/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mpbellnl003.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:18:21","author":"Lance Reynolds","authors":["Lance Reynolds"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":262178554,"title":"Gary Barlow makes rare comment about his kids and why they have chosen not to follow in his footsteps despite showbiz being 'good to him' after raking in a whopping '£90M'","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Nov 4th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpain's 'mass grave' underground car parks give up their terrible secrets: As water is pumped out, rescuers fear disaster's true death toll is being downplayed and they are counting bodies 'by the hundred' - as floods spread to NEW holiday hotspots\n\nDawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek, 47, reveals colorectal cancer diagnosis\n\nIs Kamala Harris REALLY surging?

We ended up getting a black cab, because the crew had gone, we went back to Manchester which was a good hours drive.\n'It was in the darkness of the cab that we kind of fell for each other really, and kissed.'\nIt comes after their daughter Chloe revealed that her parents have 'really struggled' at times during their 38-year marriage.\nThe couple married then welcomed children Jack and Chloe, while also carving out a successful presenting career together, fronting shows including This Morning and their very own teatime magazine show. \n\nIt comes after their daughter Chloe revealed that her parents have 'really struggled' at times during their 38-year marriage (Pictured in 2013)\n\nThe couple married then welcomed children Jack and Chloe, while also carving out a successful presenting career together, fronting shows including This Morning and their very own teatime magazine show (Pictured in 2020)\nAnd in a new interview, daughter Chloe, 37 - who recently split from husband James Haskell - opened up about how her parents have navigated their four-decade long relationship as she divulged the secret to their long-lasting union. \nWhen asked how her folks had sustained such a lengthy marriage, she told Closer magazine: 'They would honestly say the same thing - that the secret to them having such a long marriage is to not get divorced.\n'They’ve been together for over 40 years and during that time there have been periods where they have really struggled, but they kept going and stayed together. I don’t think it was ever bad enough for them to split.'\nThe personal trainer went on to praise the pair for setting a 'pretty gold standard' before noting that she 'hit the jackpot' when it came to parents.\nDespite their successful union, Chloe admitted that she never felt any 'pressure' to continue with her own marriage because of her parents.\nBlackpoolRichard Madeley\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRichard Madeley reveals he and wife Judy Finnigan sleep in separate beds as he makes candid confession about their 38-year marriage\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nDawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek, 47, reveals colorectal cancer diagnosis\n\nBroke the news with fans on Sunday \n\nMrs Hinch is pregnant!

the vote there or in other battleground states likely to determine the winner.\n\nOpinion polls, both nationally and in the seven closely divided states, show Trump locked in a tight race with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the countdown to election day on Tuesday.\n\nTrump continues to falsely claim his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud in multiple states that Trump lost, while he and his supporters have spread baseless claims about this election in Pennsylvania.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today \n\nSimilar rhetoric about voter fraud after the 2020 vote led to a violent mob of Trump supporters attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, seeking to halt or sway the congressional count of the electoral votes that determine who becomes president.\n\n“This is sowing the seeds for attempts to overturn an election result that cuts against Donald Trump,” said Kyle Miller, a Pennsylvania policy strategist for the advocacy group Protect Democracy.\n\n“We saw it in 2020 and I think the lesson Trump and his allies have learned since is that they have to sow these ideas early.”\n\nTrump has stepped up his unfounded allegations that probes into suspect voter registration forms are proof of voter fraud.\n\nSome of his supporters alleged voter suppression when long lines formed to receive mail-in ballots.\n\nState officials and democracy advocates said the incidents showed a system working as intended.\n\nA judge extended the mail-in ballot deadline by three days in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, after the former US president’s campaign sued over claims that some voters were turned away before a Tuesday deadline.\n\nElection officials discovered potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster and neighbouring York counties, prompting investigations by local law enforcement.\n\nThere is no evidence the applications have led or will lead to illegal votes.\n\n“This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,” Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania’s top elections official, told reporters.\n\nTrump tells his rallies to expect a big victory on Tuesday, saying he could only envision losing “if it was a corrupt election”.\n\nHis claims have raised concerns that he is preparing to again blame a potential loss in Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven states likely to decide the result of the election, on voter fraud.\n\nIn a social media post on Thursday, he said: “We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania” and demanded criminal prosecutions.\n\nA senior Harris campaign official on Thursday said Trump’s claims were an example of the former president trying to “sow doubt in our elections and institutions when he’s afraid he can’t win”.\n\nShould Trump win the vote fairly, all the talk of fraud might dissipate quickly.\n\nBut the United States’ unique method of choosing a president, rooted in the 1789 Constitution, provides openings for Trump and his supporters to seek to undermine or delay election results at the local, state and national level.\n\nIn 2020, the Trump team attempted 60 court cases alleging fraud in multiple states, all without success.\n\nBut the experience has prepared lawyers from both parties for another attempt, each side sharpening their knowledge of election law.\n\nShould Trump followers overturn or delay any unfavourable state results long enough through the courts or legislative obstruction, they could prevent a duly elected Harris from taking office and tilt the result to Trump.\n\nSome US states are warning county and local officials not to intervene illegally or refuse to certify results.\n\nBut the final arbiter in such a case would be the nine-member US Supreme Court.\n\nWith six conservative justices, three of them appointed by Trump, the court has already granted the former president a victory in his bid to seek criminal immunity from acts committed as president.","url":"https://7news.com.au/politics/us-election/fears-trump-could-try-to-overturn-us-election-results-c-16627673","image":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-16627673/638a737cb71cdf6c02983d246e6017c65e90af6f-16x9-x0y318w6086h3423.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-04

anguish over Trump’s tariff plans","text":"Taichung, Taiwan – When Li Wei took over the running of his father’s glass-making business in northern China’s Cangzhou in 2020, he immediately set about optimising the firm’s operations.\n\nLi moved Hebei Yiyue Glass Products’ sole factory from its city location to a site outside Cangzhou, providing better access to important road networks and more space to expand the facility.\n\nAt the same time, Li changed the primary focus of the company from selling glass components to customers in China to exporting finished glass products to customers abroad.\n\nToday, he oversees a successful export business that sells cups, pots and jars throughout the world and employs twice as many workers as when he took over.\n\nMuch of Li’s success is owed to the demand for his products in the United States, which in recent years has been the destination for as much as 80 percent of his company’s exports.\n\nBut now, Li and his colleagues are concerned that their success could all come crashing down if former US President Donald Trump is re-elected to the White House on November 5.\n\nTrump, who is running neck and neck with Vice President Kamala Harris in a race that is too close to call, has floated plans for tariffs of 60 percent or more on all goods heading to the US from China.\n\nEconomists have dubbed Trump’s plans “Tariff War 2.0”, after the Republican imposed tariffs as high as 25 percent on a range of Chinese goods during his first term in office, prompting Beijing to announce its own tariffs in turn.\n\n“Such a large increase in tariffs by the United States will definitely have a great impact on me and my business,” Li told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It will result in our products not being competitive, and at the very least our sales in the US will drop sharply.”\n\nSince Trump’s announcement, Li has been working 12-hour days to identify other export destinations that could offset a downturn in his US business.\n\nSo far, he has not been able to find a substitute for the world’s largest market.\n\n“I’m very busy trying to find solutions, but some days the situation feels terrible,” he said. “Often, I don’t like to think about it.”\n\nGary Ng, a senior economist with investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, said that Chinese exporters have serious cause for concern if Trump re-enters the White House and follows through on his plans.\n\n“With tariff rates at 60 percent, many Chinese manufacturers would no longer be competitive or able to turn a profit from their exports to the US market,” Ng told Al Jazeera.\n\n“For the Chinese companies that are particularly exposed to the US market, this would be problematic, and they could face a lot of pressure.”\n\nAmong exporters already feeling the pressure is Sotech, a producer of advanced electronic components based in Shanghai, according to company sales manager Dong Sion.\n\n“I was shocked,” Dong told Al Jazeera, referring to the moment she first heard about Trump’s proposals.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Sotech’s products, which include smart glasses, are exported overseas, with about 30 percent of those exports going to the US.\n\n“If 60 percent tariffs are imposed then it could disrupt our US business or even end it completely,” Dong said.\n\n“And we would be forced to cut staff.”\n\nFor some Chinese companies, additional tariffs could prove to be the fatal blow at a time of already challenging conditions in the world’s second-largest economy, said Allan Von Mehren, chief analyst and China economist at Danske Bank.\n\n“It would have big repercussions in China,” Von Mehren told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe US is by far the top destination for China’s exports, taking in more than $400bn worth of its goods each year.\n\nWith so much trade at risk, UBS has estimated that imposing a 60 percent tariff, on top of existing tariffs, would lower China’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth by 2.5 percentage points over the next 12 months.\n\nSuch a hit would come at an inopportune time for the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nAn ailing property sector, low consumer confidence and household spending well below the global average are all weighing on growth, while the country’s traditional investment-fuelled, export-led development model is struggling to pick up the slack.\n\nFacing such headwinds, Chinese authorities are widely seen as unlikely to hit the government’s growth target of about 5 percent – a challenge that will only get harder if Chinese exporters lose US market access due to new tariffs.\n\nLily Wang, a recent university graduate who works at Li Wei’s glass-making company outside Cangzhou, said she is afraid that new tariffs combined with the poor state of the Chinese economy will lead to a surge in unemployed workers and worsening working conditions for those who are employed.\n\n“Chinese employers are cutting a lot of things already, and if trade with the US declines, I’m worried that it will get even worse,” Wang told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe actual damage to the Chinese economy from the tariffs is likely to depend on companies’ ability to adapt, Ng said.\n\n“Some companies might try to diversify their export structure or move their production to other countries and then export to the US from there,” he said.\n\nSome Chinese firms have already taken such measures.\n\nAt Hebei Cangzhou New Century International Trade, a construction materials company in Hebei province that sends about 40 percent of its exports to the US, the management is considering teaming up with manufacturers in Indonesia.\n\n“A 60 percent tariff rate cannot be covered by our export profits,” Vice President Lucy Zhang told Al Jazeera.\n\n“So, we are looking into ways to indirectly export to the US instead.”\n\nAt the same time, the Chinese government has been working on nurturing new markets for Chinese exporters.\n\nIn September, Beijing hosted 50 African nations for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which aimed to boost African imports of Chinese products, particularly solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nChina is Africa’s biggest trading partner, as well as the leading trade partner of most South American nations.\n\n“Beijing has known for a while now that relations with the US were not going to significantly improve any time soon and has tried to gain better access for its companies in countries where the bilateral relations are friendlier,” Von Mehren said.\n\nDespite China expanding trade with friendlier nations, it is unclear whether a replacement exists for the vast volumes of Chinese goods going to the US.\n\nIn some cases, US restrictions on Chinese imports have been quickly emulated in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn May, US President Joe Biden’s administration announced that tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles would be raised to 100 percent, effectively shutting the door to the US market.\n\nThe European Union announced tariffs as high as 38.1 percent on Chinese EVs the following month.\n\nSince then, Turkey and Canada have followed suit with similar measures.\n\n“As some countries take actions against Chinese exports, a concern can quickly set in among other countries that a Chinese surplus will be dumped on their markets causing them to take action as well,” Von Mehren said.\n\nTrump has also suggested he would impose steep tariffs on Mexico, where Chinese EV companies are considering building new production facilities to circumvent tariffs.\n\n“All I’m doing is saying ‘I’ll put 200 or 500, I don’t care.’ I’ll put a number where they can’t sell one car,” Trump said earlier this month during an interview with Fox News.\n\nChina has responded to the various trade measures in kind, launching anti-dumping investigations into European pork and Canadian canola, for example, and imposing export controls on rare elements used in the production of semiconductors.\n\nWhile directed at China, Trump’s tariff hikes would also likely be keenly felt in the US.\n\nIn an analysis published in September, the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that the measures would cause a 0.4 percent rise in inflation in 2025 and 0.23 percent loss in GDP by 2027.\n\nThe rise in inflation and GDP losses would double if Beijing retaliates, the think tank said.\n\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC, said there would be no winners from a new trade war.\n\n“Artificial restrictions or protectionism will only disrupt normal trade flows and the stability of the production and supply chain which serves the interests of no one,” Liu told Al Jazeera.\n\nBack in Hebei, Li Wei struggles to see an upside for consumers or workers in Trump’s plans.\n\n“But I don’t know – those in power do what they want,” he said.\n\n“And the rest of us pay the price.”","summary":"Republican candidate&#039;s plans to slap tariffs of 60 percent or more on

Kamala Harris Endorsement Song, “Yes She Can”","text":"Will.i.am on Sunday released a song and music video endorsing Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president.\n\n The Black Eyes Peas singer released the tune, dubbed “Yes She Can,” two days before the election, in which Harris is facing off against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n The lyrics to the song include: “Mama, what’s wrong with America? Why can’t we get along in America? Something’s going on in America. People entertained by the predator.” \n\n He goes on to sing that America used to be united but is now “just divided” as footage from the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is shown.\n\n “We all immigrants different characters but together, you know, we could break down the barriers so registers and vote for your life,” the lyrics continue. “Do it for your daughters and your sons and your wife. If you a woman then vote for your rights, and don’t let them take away your right. We could be better than we ever been. We about to have a woman president.”\n\n The chorus repeats “yes she can,” while the video also shows scenes of people voting at the polls, a shot of the Statue of Liberty and a girl holding an American flag waving in the breeze. Another image shows people protesting outside the Capitol with signs reading “Bans off our bodies.”\n\n Will.i.am posted the video on YouTube and on social media. On Instagram, he included the caption that read, in part: “This is a heartfelt anthem celebrating Kamala Harris and the power of every people… With Election Day just around the corner, i wanted to score the movement, and create a call to action, and a promise of what we can achieve together… Join me as we shine a spotlight not only on the journey of Kamala Harris and the change thats coming, but also on the everyday heroes and #PowerfulWoman who breathe life into the world. 🙌🏾 This is a celebration of resilience, hope, and unstoppable spirit…” \n\n He added that the song and video were meant to celebrate mothers, single mothers, stepmothers, sisters, aunts, nieces, wives, best friends, “fearless warriors, queens, princesses, presidents, CEO’s [sic], doctors, nurses, coders, scientists, astronauts, researchers, preachers, care takers, law makers [sic], nurturers, teachers, tutors, professors, entrepreneurs, bosses and the doorway to LIFE that women are.”\n\n The song might be considered a sequel of sorts to will.i.am’s 2008 song (and video) “Yes We Can,” which helped mobilize voters for Barack Obama.","summary":"\"We could break down the barriers so registers and vote for your life,\" he sings. \"Do it for your daughters and your sons and your wife.\"","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/watch-video-will-i-am-kamala-harris-song-yes-she-can-1236052659/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/will.i.am_-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:07:14","author":"Kimberly Nordyke","authors":["Kimberly Nordyke"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.195},{"id":262179094,"title":"Polls close tomorrow night - so when will we know the result of the US general election?","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Bush and Al Gore.\n\nFlorida’s votes gave Bush 271 electoral votes, only one more than the 270 required to win the Electoral College.\n\nWhile the situation wasn’t just as dramatic in 2020, it was still a four day wait before US media were confident in declaring Joe Biden to be the next President of the United States.\n\nPeople watch videoscreen in New York's Times Square as Joe Biden gives acceptance speech from Delaware on 7 November, 2020.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nWhen the media is confident that a trailing candidate no longer has a pathway to victory, it will declare a winner.\n\nIn the 2020 election, the Associated Press declared Joe Biden the winner four days after Election Day at 11:26am Eastern Time on Saturday, 7 November.\n\nHowever, in the early hours after polling day in 2020, the Associated Press called Michigan and Wisconsin for Biden, which brought him to the brink of an Electoral College majority but not over the threshold.\n\nSpeaking to The Journal, Scott Lucas, Professor of American Studies at UCD’s Clinton Institute, noted that while it was four days before a “definitive” answer could be provided in 2020, “we actually knew by about five or six o’clock in the morning” who would be the winner.\n\n“Trump came out at 2.30am and said he won the election, and that’s because he knew that it might swing against him in the states of Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia,” said Lucas.\n\nTrump making a statement to the nation as his supporters look on in the East Room of the White House on election night in 2020.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nTrump went on to lose these three states in 2020.\n\nArizona indicted a number of Trump’s advisers, including former New York mayor Rudi Giuliani, over an alleged scheme to flip his defeat in the state and overturn the 2020 election result.\n\nIt also emerged that Trump called Georgia’s election chief to ask him to “find” enough voted overturn Biden’s 2020 win in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill the projection timeline be different this time around?\n\nOne of the reasons why it took so long to declare the results in some states in 2020 was the increase in mail-in voting as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMail-in ballots take longer to count and verify than in-person voting and some states did not allow for mail-in votes to be pre-processed – such as removing ballots from envelopes – before election day.\n\nSeveral key states were unprepared for the dramatic increase in mail-in ballots – mail-in and absentee voting accounted for 46% of votes cast in 2020, up from 26% in the mid-term election of 2018.\n\nMail-in ballots being placed into trays in the sorting room at the Orange County Supervisor of Elections office on 26 October, 2020Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nThis resulted in so-called “mirages” in 2020.\n\nDemocrats were far more likely to vote by mail than Republicans and this created a situation where one candidate appeared to have a massive lead, only for their rival to surge later thanks to mail-in votes.\n\nTrump seized upon these “mirages” in 2020 and claimed that mail-in ballots were “rigged”.\n\nBut this time round, there will be fewer mail-in ballots and some key states, such as Michigan, have changed their laws to allow preprocessing of mail-in ballots before election day.\n\nSo when can we expect the race to be called?\n\nLike in 2020, it could take days before the US media is confident in projecting a winner.\n\nPolls in the seven key swing states will close between midnight and 3am Irish time on 6 November.\n\nThese seven states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – hold the keys to the Oval Office.\n\nTo get elected, either candidate needs to reach the magic number of 270 Electoral College votes out of the 538 on offer.\n\nEach state has a different number of Electoral College votes on offer, which is calculated by adding the number of each state’s elected representatives in the House, which varies according to population, to the number of senators (two per state).\n\nSome states consistently vote either for the Democrat or Republican party in presidential elections and their Electoral College votes are baked into each candidate’s pathway to reaching 270. \n\nBut swing states could be won by either candidate and have the power to decide the election.\n\nThe polls will close at midnight Irish time in Georgia, with North Carolina closing following at 12.30am.\n\nIf Harris does well in Georgia and North Carolina, it could mean the race won’t be decided by the usually slower-counting states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nKamala Harris delivers remarks during campaign event at the Ellipse near the White House in Washington, 29 Oct., 2024.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nHowever, if it looks like Trump will win in Georgia and North Carolina, Harris will require wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and that means we’ll be in for a longer wait to know who the next US president will be.\n\nThe polls close at 1am Irish time in Michigan and Pennsylvania, 2am in Wisconsin and Arizona, and 3am in Nevada.\n\nThe Associated Press notes that “it’s not uncommon for it to take a few days – and in rare instances, a few weeks – to reach that point” where a winner can be declared.\n\nIt took a few weeks in 2000, and a few days in 2020, and the results in swing states could determine how long the wait will be this time round.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these

But we trust women.\"\n\nThe comments by Trump come as he has struggled to connect with women voters and as Harris courts women in both parties with a message centered on freedom. She's making the pitch that women should be free to make their own decisions about their bodies and that if Trump is elected, more restrictions will follow.\n\nTrump appointed three of the justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who formed the conservative majority that overturned federal abortion rights. As the fallout from the 2022 decision spreads , he has taken to claiming at public events and in social media posts that he would “protect women” and ensure they wouldn’t be “thinking about abortion.”\n\nAt a rally Wednesday evening near Green Bay, Wisconsin, Trump told his supporters that aides had urged him to stop using the phrase because it was “inappropriate.”\n\nThen he added a new bit to the protector line. He said he told his aides: “Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I am going to protect them.”\n\nHarris said the remark was part of a pattern of troubling statements by Trump.\n\n“This is just the latest on a long series of reveals by the former president of how he thinks about women and their agency,\" she said.\n\nHarris tied Trump’s comments to his approach to reproductive rights, but Trump generally speaks more of protecting women from criminals, terrorists and foreign adversaries, in keeping with the bleak picture he paints of a country in decline.\n\n“I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things,” Trump said during a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\nHe seemed to tie in abortion when he first used the “protector” language in a Truth Social post and at a rally in Pennsylvania on Sept. 23. He assured the women who would be “protected” that they \"will no longer be thinking about abortion.”\n\nBefore Trump headlined a rally in Henderson, Nevada, on Thursday night, he responded to a top Harris campaign surrogate's claim that the former president does not surround himself with strong, intelligent women.\n\nMark Cuban said as a guest on ABC's “The View\" earlier Thursday that, “You never see” Trump “around strong, intelligent women — ever.”\n\nTrump, on X, posted that Cuban was “very wrong,” and lashed out at him as “a fool\" and a \"MAJOR LOSER.\"\n\n“All strong women, and women in general, should be very angry about this weak man's statement,\" Trump's post read.\n\nThe dispute showed signs of further entrenching each candidate's supporters.\n\nIt was not only women who described Trump's remarks as offensive. At the Harris rally in Phoenix, Edison Kinlicheenie, 50, said he sees Trump more as a threat than a protector, noting that the former president has a track record of preying on women .\n\n“I have a wife and a daughter, so I wouldn’t let no predator like that come around\" them, Kinlicheenie said.\n\nAt a Trump rally in Albuquerque, Sarah Pyle, 41, cited the opposition to allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's events to portray Trump as someone who helps women.\n\n“I don’t want my girls to grow up in a world like this,” the Albuquerque mother said, referring to the controversy. “We fought for women’s rights for so long, and now we’re giving them back to men. It makes no sense.”\n\nMore broadly, Trump and Republicans have struggled with how to talk about abortion rights, particularly as women around the nation are grappling with obtaining proper medical care because of abortion restrictions that have had implications far beyond the ability to end an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nTrump has given contradictory answers about his position on abortion, at some points saying that women should be punished for having abortions and showcasing the justices he appointed. During his successful 2016 campaign, he told voters that if he were elected, he would appoint justices to the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and said he was “pro-life.”\n\nBut in recent weeks he's promised to veto a national abortion ban, after repeatedly refusing to make such a pledge. He's said the states should regulate care and said some laws were “too tough.”\n\nSince 2022, the patchwork of state laws on abortion has created uneven medical care. Some women have died . Others have bled in emergency room parking lots or became critically ill from sepsis as doctors in states with strict abortion bans send pregnant women away until they are sick enough to warrant medical care. That includes women who never intended to end pregnancies. Both infant and maternal mortality has risen.\n\nHarris’ campaign has highlighted Trump’s statements around women. In one campaign ad, a woman who became gravely ill with sepsis after a pregnancy complication stands in front of a mirror looking at a large scar on her abdomen, as audio plays of Trump’s comments about protecting women.\n\nHarris hopes abortion will be a strong motivator for women at the ballot box.\n\nIn early voting so far, 1.2 million more women than men have voted across the seven battleground states, according to data from analytics firm TargetSmart.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily translate into Democratic gains. But in the 2020 presidential election, there was a 9 percentage point difference between men and women in support for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, according to AP VoteCast , a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nThe Democratic ticket was supported by 55% of women and 46% of men. That was essentially unchanged from the 2018 midterms, when VoteCast found a 10-point gender gap, with 58% of women and 48% of men backing Democrats in congressional races.

Polls show the race is a toss-up, with the health of the economy the top priority for voters, who have grumbled about high food and housing costs. The economy has stayed resilient despite 5.25 percentage points of interest rate increases in 2022 and 2023 from the Federal Reserve to tame inflation.\n\n\"The economy is firing on all cylinders and unless there is a large external shock or domestic policy error, it is poised to close out the year on a strong note,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.8 percentannualized rate last quarter the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would advance at a 3.0 percent pace.\n\nThe slight miss reflected a widening of the trade deficit as businesses boosted imports to satisfy robust demand, while inventory accumulation was pared back.\n\nThe pace of expansion was well above what U.S. central bank officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8 percent. A measure of domestic demand that excludes government spending, trade and inventories increased at a 3.2 percent rate compared to the 2.7 percent pace logged in the second quarter.\n\nThe economy grew at a 3.0 percent pace in the April-June quarter.\n\nThe BEA said it was impossible to estimate the impact of Hurricane Helene, which devastated large areas of the U.S. Southeast in September, noting that the destruction of fixed assets, such as residential and nonresidential structures, did not directly affect GDP or personal income.\n\nIt, however, estimated that Helene resulted in losses of $39.0 billion in privately-owned fixed assets and $2.0 billion in state and local government-owned fixed assets. The report added to annual revisions published last month that indicated the economy was much stronger than had been previously estimated. The revisions almost erased the gap between GDP and gross domestic income, an alternative measure of growth, through the second quarter.\n\nPrior to the revisions, some economists had argued that gap suggested economic activity was being overestimated. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.7 percent pace. That was the fastest rate since the first quarter of 2023 and was up from the 2.8 percent pace notched in the second quarter. It added 2.46 percentage points to GDP growth, the most in one and a half years.\n\nSpending was boosted by outlays on both goods and services, including prescription medication, motor vehicles, doctor visits as well as dining out and hotel and motel stays.\n\nConsumption is being underpinned by a resilient labor market as well as a rise in household net worth, thanks to a stock market boom and higher house prices. Personal income increased $221.3 billion last quarter, with wages accounting for the rise. That followed a $315.7 billion gain in the April-June quarter. The saving rate fell to 4.8 percent from 5.2 percent in the second quarter.\n\nEconomists were unfazed by the moderation in income growth, noting a recent pattern of the data being revised sharply higher. There are, however, concerns that growth is mostly being driven by middle- and upper-income households, which have more flexibility and substitutability of consumption. A moderation in spending from the third quarter's robust pace is expected.\n\n\"Households continue to face their fair share of challenges with still-high prices at the top of the list, but that doesn't appear to be deterring them from spending,\" said Jay Bryson chief economist at Wells Fargo.\n\nStocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, as did U.S. Treasury prices.\n\nInflation subsiding\n\nBut inflation has cooled down significantly, offering relief for households, especially lower-income families.\n\nThe price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures inflation in the U.S. economy, advanced at a 1.8 percent rate. That was the smallest gain since the fourth quarter of 2023 and followed a 2.4 percent rate of increase in the second quarter. The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding the volatile food and energy components, which is followed closely by the U.S. central bank, rose at a 2.2 percent rate. That was the smallest rise in core inflation in nearly a year and a sharp deceleration from the 2.8 percent pace in the April-June quarter. The slowdown in inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target has allowed the central bank to ease policy. Last month it kicked off that cycle with an unusually large half-percentage-point rate cut, the first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020. The Fed's policy rate is now set in the 4.75 percent-5.00 percent range.\n\nEconomists did not expect the strength in domestic demand to deter the Fed from cutting rates again next week and in December. But they cautioned that the trend, if sustained, could steer the central bank to a more gradual policy easing path than it signaled last month.\n\nMuch will depend on the labor market. Economists expect job growth took a big step back in October, restrained by a strike at Boeing as well as Helene and Hurricane Milton, which slammed Florida early this month.\n\n\"If the data continues to come in stronger than anticipated, however, the Fed could start floating trial balloons about the possibility of skipping a rate cut in December,\" said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment surged at a 11.1 percent rate, the quickest since the second quarter of 2023, powered by the aircraft category. Investment in software, however, slowed. Outlays on structures, such as factories, declined.\n\nGovernment spending accelerated, boosted by defense outlays.\n\nBut the pace of inventory accumulation slowed to a $60.2 billion rate from a $71.7 pace in the second quarter, and subtracted 0.17 percentage point from GDP. The trade deficit widened amid rising imports, which were also likely driven by businesses front-loading merchandise in anticipation of higher tariffs and a dockworkers strike that proved to be short-lived.\n\nResidential investment, which includes homebuilding and sales, contracted for a second straight quarter.\n\nEconomists expect the Boeing strike and hurricanes to curb growth in the fourth quarter, with the outcome of the election next week shaping the outlook for 2025.\n\n\"We anticipate a modest deceleration in GDP growth,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. \"Potential shifts in policy next year could impact taxes, government spending and regulation.\" (Reuters)","summary":"The U.S. economy grew solidly in the third quarter, with consumer spending increasing at its fastest pace in one and a half years and inflation slowing sharply, continuing to defy forecasts of a recession and outperforming its global peers...","url":"https://nation.lk/online/us-consumers-keep-economy-on-solid-ground-ahead-of-election-281837.html","image":"https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/dc344577c3be455f9774595390116ce7.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-04 00:00:43","author":"Beazer Homes Usa","authors":["Beazer Homes Usa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":262178640,"title":"Dollar Weakens as US Polls Signal No Clear Leader: Markets Wrap","text":"Shares in Australia climbed while equity contracts for Hong Kong were slightly lower.

Japanese markets are closed for a holiday, which means there will be no Treasuries trading in Asian hours.\n\nThe weakening of the greenback was a sign to some that investors may be walking back confidence in a victory for Donald Trump. One element of the so-called Trump trade favors higher Treasury yields and a stronger US dollar.\n\n“To the extent there was something to the ‘Trump trade’ last week, it is beating a bit of a retreat this morning,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney.\n\nWall Street tried not to read too much into jobs data Friday showing US hiring advanced at the slowest pace since 2020 in October while the unemployment rate remained low.

She also confirmed, two days before Election Day, that she had “just filled out” her mail-in ballot and it was “on its way to California.”\n\n“I am not going to talk about the vote on that. Because honestly it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,” said Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and U.S. senator before she was elected vice president in 2020.\n\nThe decision by the Democratic nominee for president not to publicly stake out a position on the high-profile initiative could leave her open to criticism from Republican Donald Trump that she is being soft on crime and from some left-leaning voters who would like to see her speak out forcefully against what they perceive as draconian anticrime efforts.\n\nThe initiative, if passed, would make the crime of shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders and increase penalties for some drug charges, including those involving the synthetic opioid fentanyl. It also would give judges the authority to order people with multiple drug charges to get treatment.\n\nProponents said the initiative is necessary to close loopholes in existing laws that have made it challenging for law enforcement to punish shoplifters and drug dealers.\n\nOpponents, including Democratic state leaders and social justice groups, said the proposal would disproportionately imprison poor people and those with substance use issues rather than target ringleaders who hire large groups of people to steal goods for them to resell online.\n\nCalifornia’s approach to crime is a central issue in this election cycle.\n\nBeyond the ballot measure, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, is in a difficult reelection fight against challengers who say she has allowed the city to spiral out of control.\n\nThe moderate Democratic mayor faces four main challengers on the Nov. 5 ballot, all fellow Democrats, who say Breed has squandered her six years in office. They say she allowed San Francisco to descend into chaos and blamed others for her inability to rein in homelessness and erratic street behavior, all while burglarized businesses pleaded for help.\n\nMeanwhile, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price faces a recall election, and Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón is running against a rival who has criticized the incumbent’s progressive approach to crime and punishment.\n\nCrime data shows the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles saw a steady increase in shoplifting between 2021 and 2022, according to a study by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nAcross the state, shoplifting rates rose during the same time period but were still lower than the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, while commercial burglaries and robberies have become more prevalent in urban counties, the study says.\n\nHarris, in the final days of the 2024 campaign, has urging Americans in battleground states to make a voting plan to get themselves, friends and loved ones to the polls.\n\nBut the vice president, and her campaign team, until her comments Sunday, had avoided speaking in detail about when she would cast her ballot and had sidestepped questions about how she would vote on the California measure.\n\nLast month, she suggested to reporters that she would disclose her position on the ballot measure.\n\n“I’ve not voted yet and I’ve actually not read it yet,” Harris told reporters at the end of an Oct. 16 campaign stop in Detroit. “But I’ll let you know.”","summary":"The initiative, if passed, would make the crime of shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders and increase penalties for some drug charges.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/11/03/kamala-harris-vote-california-ballot-measure-criminal-justice-reform-reversal/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24308673820069-e1730677302832.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 23:54:40","author":"Aamer Madhani,Darlene Superville,The Associated Press","authors":["Aamer Madhani","Darlene Superville","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":262176902,"title":"The Showdown New Polls Reveal State Of Election Race Between Donald Trump And Kamala Harris","text":"7-Day Paper Delivery \n + Full Digital Access \n \n Features\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7-Day Paper Delivery \n + Full Digital Access \n \n Features\n \n \n \n \n $20/ WEEK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n $20/ WEEK\n \n \n ($80 min. cost) charged every 4 weeks* \n \n \n ($80 min. cost) charged every 4 weeks* \n *Read the fine print\n \n \n \n THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW\n \n Full Digital Access + 7-Day Paper Delivery $80 charged every 4 weeks.

Tony Evers told volunteers at the Waukesha County Democratic Party headquarters, revving them up before they leave to knock on doors to get out the vote. With Democrats and Republicans so evenly divided he urgently reminds them, “Every vote is going to count.”\n\nA few hours before the Evers visit Saturday, actress Jennifer Garner also stopped by to rally the troops as they prepared to canvass voters in the closing days of the election where Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a deadlock.\n\n“There is a difference,” said Garner, who’s been stumping for Harris, “between voting Republican and voting for someone who is actively wanting to tear our country apart.”\n\nI’m in the city of Waukesha and dropped by the county Democratic headquarters because this political turf near Milwaukee is the battleground within the Wisconsin battleground.\n\nThere are three Republican counties — Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington — dubbed the “WOW” counties, where Democrats have been making gains the past few years.\n\nWisconsin, with 10 Electoral College votes, is one of seven swing states whose voters will decide whether Harris or Trump win the White House. It’s purple because Wisconsin went for Joe Biden in 2020 and Donald Trump in 2016 — with less than 1% of the vote determining the outcome.\n\n And unlike solid blue Illinois, with no major contests, our neighbors to the north have been the targets of intense presidential campaigning — in person and in a barrage of video ads paid for by campaigns and outside groups.\n\nKeeping down the GOP vote in the “WOW” counties is as crucial for Democrats as pumping turnout in the Democratic strongholds of Madison and Milwaukee.\n\nIn 2020, Biden lost Waukesha County, drawing 39% of the vote. But that’s improving on the 35% of the vote Hillary Clinton got in the county in 2016.\n\nThe Waukesha County Democratic Party operates out of an old house a few blocks off Main Street. On Oct. 28, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, was at a coffee shop on Main Street campaigning with Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly, a longtime Republican, now an independent, who is endorsing Harris.\n\nAnd it was on Main Street that I interviewed a woman I spotted wearing a “,la” button on her denim jacket. If you don’t get it — say it — “comma-la.”\n\nCathy Milosch, 62, who is retired, lives near Waukesha. She backed Clinton in 2016. I asked her why things were so divided here.\n\n“I find it very confusing,” she said. “I have friends who are Republican, and I try to talk to them about why they feel the way they do. And I think that what I find is they either listen to a different group of news than what I listen to; [or] they’ll get a lot of their information on the internet.”\n\nMilosch said what she considers “common sense” when it comes to Trump’s flaws (racism, sexism, criminal charges, constant lies, insults, etc.), “I feel like they’re not seeing it. It’s like they’re on a totally different plane of information.”\n\nI asked her how, if Trump wins again, it would affect her personally.\n\n“I think that there’ll be a lot of anxiety of the unknown. You know, is he going to come after all the Democrats that have donated? This election is the first time I’ve ever donated to an election in my life.” \n\nMilosch said she made seven or eight small donations to the Harris campaign — $25 to $30 — totaling about $150 or $175. “If Trump were in office, I just think it is going to be chaos.\n\n “I think that it’s going to be inflation, I think we’re going be in a recession by next year or the middle of next year because of the things that he wants to do. I think that people are going to stop spending money. I’m just fearful what the future brings,” Milosch said.\n\nI got a totally different take when I interviewed two Trump backers. Jerry Breske, 53, owns a construction company, and his fiancee, Brenda Dekan, 47, is a manager at a decorative panel manufacturer. We spoke inside Joey’s Cafe, on Main Street.\n\nThis is Breske’s third vote for Trump.\n\nWhy? Breske said, “He is a businessman, and he’s not the typical politician … he was getting us back on our feet, energy independent, and getting paid what we were due from other countries that we helped protect, the ones that we typically would give money to and still protect them, and they wouldn’t hold up their end of the bargain. That’s why, that’s one of the main reasons why I vote for Trump.”\n\nI asked him if any of the Trump controversies gave him pause.\n\nBreske was forgiving. “We’re all sinners. Well, there was one that wasn’t, Jesus Christ, but there’s been no other human that has not sinned.. … I think people take a lot of stuff that he says out of context. He is a very bright individual, very high IQ, very funny. And sometimes when he’s talking off the cuff, it might come across as rash … the people that want to look at it in a bad way are the ones that just don’t like him.”\n\n He continued: “If people only understood Trump better, I think they would really come to love him and pray that he becomes our president.” Breske’s bottom line: “We need to fix the country. Inflation is way out of whack, and it happened in the last four years.”\n\nDekan said she voted for Trump in 2020 and Clinton in 2016.\n\nShe’s for Trump, for among other reasons because, “I am making the most I’ve ever made pay wise, and I’m living check to check. I shouldn’t have to do that. It’s a struggle. It’s a struggle. I believe that we’re not safe right now, and I believe that he’s got our country’s best interest.”\n\nWhen asked how Trump would change her life, Dekan said, “When Trump is president, I feel like I can afford things again.”\n\nI asked Gov. Evers about Wisconsin being a swing state. “I don’t see it as a benefit or deficit. I just think that is the way Wisconsin is,” he replied.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/11/03/kamala-harris-donald-trump-battleground-wisconsin-swing-state-2024-election-politics","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14e3700/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0c%2F06%2Facba11744eaba5c4aab78243dd84%2Fimg-","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 23:47:48","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.376},{"id":262178556,"title":"Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas cosy up as they join Hugh Grant and Hugh Bonneville at star-studded London premiere of Paddington In Peru","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Nov 4th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpain's 'mass grave' underground car parks give up their terrible secrets: As water is pumped out, rescuers fear disaster's true death toll is being downplayed and they are counting bodies 'by the hundred' - as floods spread to NEW holiday hotspots\n\nDawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek, 47, reveals colorectal cancer diagnosis\n\nIs Kamala Harris REALLY surging?

who plays The Reverend Mother - showed off her sophisticated sense of style in the pink outfit which she wore with simple black heels to boost her height. \n\nOlivia Colman and Antonio Banderas cosied up as they led the famous faces at star-studded Paddington In Peru premiere in London on Sunday night \n\nThe actress, 50, stunned in a pink jumpsuit for the event in Leicester Square where she put her arm around the actor, 64\nShe accessorised with a statement red clutch bag and earrings and wore her brunette tresses in a short, cropped style.\nBy her side Antonio - who plays Hunter Cabot in the highly-anticipated film - looked smart in a navy suit and buttoned jumper. \nDownton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville, 60, looked dapper in a bright blue suit and red tie, while Hugh Grant, 64, opted for a tweed jacket and grey jumper.\nThe premiere comes after it was revealed that Queen Elizabeth II will make a surprise cameo in the Hollywood blockbuster.\nThe late monarch's cameo will feature a brief glimpse of her having afternoon tea with Paddington - which is taken from a short video that was made as part of her 2022 Platinum Jubilee celebrations.\nIn order to obtain this special moment for the feature movie - an approval from Buckingham Palace was needed, with the Royal Family 'very happy for it to happen'.\nRon Halpern, head of global productions at France's StudioCanal assured it came 'with the consent and agreement of the royal household', according to Variety.\nPaddington In Peru is set to be released November 8 in UK theatres, while Columbia Pictures will release it in the U.S. on 17 January 2025.\n'[The royal family] were actually very happy for it to happen,' producer Rosie Alison told the publication. \n\nOlivia - who plays The Reverend Mother - showed off her sophisticated sense of style in the pink outfit which she wore with simple black heels to boost her height\n\nBy her side Antonio - who plays Hunter Cabot in the highly-anticipated film - looked smart in a navy suit and buttoned jumper\n\nShe accessorised with a statement red clutch bag and earrings and wore her brunette tresses in a short, cropped style\n\nHugh Grant, 64, opted for a tweed jacket and grey jumper as he arrived at the premiere in London\n\nThe premiere comes after it was revealed that Queen Elizabeth II will make a surprise cameo in the Hollywood blockbuster\n\nDownton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville, 60, looked dapper in a bright blue suit and red tie\n\nHe stood out from the crowd in the bold ensemble\n\nEmily Mortimer has stepped into the role of Mrs. Brown and looked stunning in a sheer pink gown\n\nBen Whishaw who voices the bear himself wore a quirky brown suit\n\nThe cast all posed together\n'But we don't like to make a big deal of it, because Paddington's obviously a very modest fellow.' \nMeanwhile The Crown favourite Olivia revealed she was over the moon and 'signed without hesitation'. \nThe actress will transform into a nun to play the Reverend Mother in the franchise. \n'Paddington is just the best person in the whole wide world,' she said thrilled. \n'Imagine if everyone was like Paddington, wouldn't that be lovely?'\nLast month, it was revealed that Paddington has been granted an official UK passport from the Home Office.\nThe co-producer of the upcoming third instalment in the film series revealed the Peruvian-born character was given a passport for his travels in the upcoming movie.\nRob Silva told Radio Times: 'We wrote to the Home Office, asking if we could get a replica, and they actually issued Paddington with an official passport – there's only one of these.\n'You wouldn't think the Home Office would have a sense of humour, but under official observations, they've just listed him as Bear. \nThe passport also includes Paddington's birthdate, June 25, his surname Brown and his gender as well as his British nationality and South American country Peru as his birthplace.\nThe film follows the iconic bear, brought to life through animation and voiced by Ben Whishaw, as he travels abroad to visit Aunt Lucy in his homeland.\nDirected by Dougal Wilson, it sees Hugh Bonneville return as Mr. Brown and Imelda Staunton will once again play Aunt Lucy. \nWhishaw explained that taking Paddington to Peru will give audiences a different side of the beloved character.\nThe actor told Empire: 'He connects with his country, and his bearishness.\n'It's the thing that makes him relatable, strangely. On the one hand, he's learned how to be polite and civil and do the correct British thing. \n'And on the other, he's a bear who's clumsy and leaves chaos in his wake. \n'That's why children like him, because children are in the same position.'\nHowever fans were left shocked as they realised Sally Hawkins is not returning as Mrs. Brown, and has instead been recast.\nEmily Mortimer, who is best known for starring in HBO's The Newsroom, has stepped into the role as the family set off on their latest adventure.\nTalking about her decision to step away from the film, Sally previously explained: 'For me it has felt the right time to hand the reins over to another, and one can’t get much better than the truly wonderful Emily Mortimer, she is extraordinarily special.\n'She will embody the essence of Mary Brown and yet make it utterly her own. However, I am, and will always be in love with Paddington’s world.\n'I already greatly miss my on and off-screen family — the experience of making the first two films has truly been some of the best and most creative times I have had in the world of film.'\nShe added: 'They both gave me so much joy. I will forever hold them so very close to my heart indeed.'\nAs the trailer begins, Paddington struggles to get to grips with the photo booth as he attempts to pose for his passport photo.\nRemoving the marmalade sandwich he always makes sure to keep in his hat for when he is feeling peckish, Paddington leaves the booth with some rather chaotic snaps after he loses control of the spinning chair.\n\nStrictly's JB Gill attended with his daughter\n\nThe film also stars Julie Walters, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, Carla Tous and Jim Broadbent (seen)\n\nActress Carla Tous wore a busty white dress\n\nMadeleine Harris attends the Paddington In Peru world premiere in Leicester Square\n\nCast member Ben Miller and Jessica Parker pose at the premiere\n\nRosie Alison wore a black dress and glitzy jacket \n\nMinister of Foreign Trade and Tourism of Peru Úrsula Desilú León also attended in a flowery suit\n\nThe late monarch's cameo will feature a brief glimpse of her having afternoon tea with Paddington \n\nPaddington 3 will hit cinemas on November 8, 2024 \n\nLater on as the family arrive at the Home for Retired Bears, the Reverend Mother breaks the news that Aunt Lucy's whereabout are unknown.\n'I am afraid she has set off on some sort of quest deep in the jungle, and we have no idea where she is,' the actress explains.\nDetermined to find her, Paddington adds: 'Aunt Lucy found me when I was a cub, and now I have to find her. We have to try'.\nThe film also stars Antonio, Julie Walters, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, Carla Tous and Jim Broadbent.\nPaddington 3 will hit cinemas on November 8, 2024. \nLondonHugh BonnevilleHugh Grant\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOlivia Colman and Antonio Banderas cosy up as they join Hugh Grant and Hugh Bonneville at star-studded London premiere of Paddington In Peru\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nDawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek, 47, reveals colorectal cancer diagnosis\n\nBroke the news with fans on Sunday \n\nMrs Hinch is pregnant!

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, wrote in her opinion piece in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n“The two biggest problems in health care: Millions of people can’t afford the care they need, and millions of people don’t have access to care they need. And neither candidate is addressing these two problems in any serious way,” John C. Goodman, health economist and health policy expert, told The Epoch Times.\n\nThough the United States spends more on health care than any other developed country—about $4.5 trillion annually—it still lags in key health outcomes.\n\nThe country has a life expectancy of around 77 years, which is lower than most other developed nations, and 60 percent of all American adults live with at least one chronic health condition, such as heart disease, diabetes, or obesity.\n\nA focus for Vice President Kamala Harris in her campaign was to support seniors through long-term home-care services. Former President Donald Trump, on the other hand, said he would like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who supports reducing chronic diseases and improving food safety, to “go wild on health.”\n\nIn his first term, Trump implemented a voluntary model for Medicare Part D enrollees to cap insulin costs at $35 a month. He also introduced the “Most Favored Nation” rule, aiming to tie Medicare payments for certain drugs to the lowest prices paid by other developed countries. Furthermore, he introduced a rebate rule aimed at lowering drug costs, which awarded drug discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy rather than to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).\n\nAdditionally, Trump proposed a drug reimportation plan, allowing states to import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada. His administration also focused on transparency by requiring that pharmaceutical companies list drug prices in TV advertisements. He also issued an executive order to encourage domestic manufacturing of essential medications.\n\nSome of these policies were never implemented, and the Biden administration overruled most of them, with the exception of the insulin drug cap, hospital price transparency, and the executive order to encourage domestic drug manufacturing.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has expanded on Trump’s $35 insulin cap, making the cap permanent through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which also introduced a $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D drug spending.\n\nThe IRA granted Medicare the authority to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies, starting with 10 drugs in 2025.\n\nHarris has campaigned on making these price caps universal for all Americans. Glied said this would be doable for all public programs under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare.\n\nGoodman disagreed, saying that both insurers and employers would oppose it.\n\nCatastrophic coverage in Part D is a safety net that kicks in when people meet their out-of-pocket spending limit for drug expenditures.\n\nThe government currently funds 80 percent of the coverage. However, with the IRA, the government will now fund only 20 percent. Private insurance will cover the rest.\n\nThe Obama administration required people who do not have Medicare or employer-sponsored health insurance to purchase ACA-compliant health plans, or they would be penalized monthly.\n\nWhile Obamacare has low health premiums for some people who are low-income, allowing more people to gain access to health care, its above-average out-of-pocket costs disadvantage people who are really sick, Goodman said.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration attempted to repeal the ACA in 2017, the effort failed.\n\n“I certainly think that the ACA is here to stay. I think that repeal remains the fool’s errand,” Katy Talento, an epidemiologist and previous veteran health policy advisor to the Trump administration, told The Epoch Times.\n\nDuring his first term, in an effort to reduce costs, Trump encouraged the sale of short-term insurance plans not compliant with the ACA, which typically covered fewer medical conditions at lower costs. Trump also reduced the penalty for not enrolling in the ACA to zero.\n\nHis administration also cut funding for advertising and outreach, leading to a decline in ACA enrollment from a peak of 12.7 million to an average of 11.4 million to 11.8 million by the end of his term.\n\nThe Biden administration reversed most of these changes, and Harris would likely maintain this course if elected. The vice president has pledged to expand and strengthen the ACA.\n\nShe has promised to make permanent the temporary tax credits introduced in 2021 through the American Rescue Plan, which lowered health care premiums by an average of $800 a year.\n\nThese enhanced subsidies played a significant role in increasing ACA enrollments by over 2 million. Before 2021, subsidies were available only to those earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. The American Rescue Plan removed this cap to include higher-income Americans.\n\n“What’s happening in the Obamacare exchange is that they’re giving insurance away almost for free. So if you have an average income, your premium is probably zero,” Goodman said.\n\nThe current premium subsidies are also being paid for with borrowed money, increasing national debt. However, these subsidies are set to expire in 2025.\n\nHarris has campaigned to add long-term home-care benefits to Medicare.\n\nCurrently, Medicare Parts A and B do not cover most long-term home-care services, such as custodial care or daily assistance with activities like bathing or eating. Instead, Medicare focuses on short-term medical care after hospitalization.\n\n“Medicare has changed its benefit package at various times—for example, adding prescription drug coverage (Part D) in 2003. And Medicare already covers this population for all of their health care throughout their lives, and already covers home care in the short run, so it is certainly feasible for Medicare to cover long-term home care,” Glied told The Epoch Times.\n\nStephen Parente, professor of finance and Minnesota Insurance Industry chair of health finance, told The Epoch Times that it could be difficult for Medicare to make such a change.\n\n“Adding home health benefits isn’t a simple rule change,” Parente said. “You might actually have to really have 60 votes [in the Senate] to change.” However, he noted that if Democrats secure a congressional majority, “anything’s on the table.”\n\nTrump announced on Oct. 27 at a rally at Madison Square Garden that he would support a tax credit for caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one. This should not affect Medicare services.\n\nHarris’s campaign also supports adding vision and hearing services for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nTrump hasn’t provided detailed Medicare or health care policies but has vowed not to cut Medicare funding.\n\nAccording to Parente, this vagueness might be part of a campaign strategy.\n\n“Health care has never been an issue that Republicans have ever won,” he said. “So it’s like, why put something out there that may get you in trouble?”\n\nMedicare Advantage (Part C), which provides benefits through private companies, could also be affected by the election.\n\nGoodman said Republicans tend to favor Medicare Advantage, seeing it as a way to drive competition and lower costs. Glied said that Democrats tend to reduce funding for Medicare Advantage.\n\nHarris has proposed expanding Medicaid access, suggesting 12 months of continuous Medicaid eligibility for postpartum women and children.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump introduced work requirements for Medicaid, which some health care experts blamed for reducing enrollment.\n\nLow-income women with children and disabled people automatically get Medicaid, Goodman said, so the work requirements were mainly intended to reduce dependence on the government.\n\nSome Republicans have also proposed changing Medicaid’s funding to a block-grant model.\n\nThe current model does not set a limit for state Medicaid funding, and there are also limitations on how states are allowed to use that money. A block grant can limit state expenditure and also give states more freedom in how they use Medicaid funding.\n\nHis campaign has pledged to form a commission investigating the cause of chronic diseases in children.\n\nKennedy said that Trump promised he would get control over federal health agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH). Kennedy has expressed a desire to “clean up” these agencies, which he has criticized as being influenced by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nKennedy has advocated for banning pesticides, seed oils, and ultra-processed foods, and reconsidering vaccine safety to promote better health outcomes.\n\nAt his campaign speech in Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27, Trump said he would let RFK “go wild on health,” food, and medicines.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, federal agencies were directed to expand abortion access and counseling services. President Joe Biden has signed three executive orders to ensure access to abortion pills.\n\nHarris has echoed this approach, vowing never to allow a national abortion ban to become law and pledging to sign a bill that would secure abortion access nationwide.\n\nTrump has said that he does not support a national ban and that he believes abortion policy should be decided by the states, aligning with the U.S. Supreme Court’s stance.\n\n“Trump is not looking to expand abortion access. He’s not looking to do a ton on that issue because he believes that it should be left to the voters and the states,” Talento said.\n\nHowever, since the Biden administration expanded abortion access through federal powers, Talento said that if Trump wins the election, he may reverse some of Biden’s executive orders that allowed women abortion access through federal programs.","summary":"The two presidential candidates agree that Americans are paying too much for drugs.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/medicare-chronic-disease-and-drug-prices-where-trump-and-harris-stand-on-health-policy-5751175","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/02/id5752939-Untitled_Artwork-8-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 23:45:04","author":"Marina Zhang","authors":["Marina Zhang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.101},{"id":262176674,"title":"Albanese backs Rudd as ambassador ahead of US poll","text":"Anthony Albanese has rejected suggestions Australia's ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd would be removed from the post if Donald Trump regains the White House.\n\nAs the US election enters its final days, the prime minister reiterated Australia would continue to work closely with American officials regardless of who won the poll.\n\nWhile concerns had previously been raised about Mr Rudd remaining as ambassador to the US after former criticism of Mr Trump, Mr Albanese backed the work being carried out in Washington.\n\n\"Australia decides who our ambassador is, and Mr Rudd is doing a terrific job,\" he told ABC Radio on Monday.\n\n\"We engage with people across the US political system.

There was an urgency to do it then to vote for Trump,” Sassoon said.\n\nThe woman explained that she meticulously fashioned her “trashy” conservative couture last week to make a point after Biden said in a campaign call with the Voto Latino group, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his [Trump’s] supporters.”\n\nBiden was trying to be clever in referencing comic Tony Hinchcliffe making a “floating island of garbage” joke about Puerto Rico during a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, but the president failed miserably.\n\n“One of the women checking me in said, ‘Oh, the garbage comment was days ago,’” Sassoon said of a poll worker at her polling place, the Eleanor Roosevelt High School, adding that she was able to fire off her own rejoinder: “Guess what? It still stinks.”\n\nThe poll worker “couldn’t help herself – she was making fun of me,” said Sassoon, adding that the woman in her “50s or 60s” was “trivializing” Biden’s hurtful barb.\n\nA lawyer assisting the RNC overseeing election integrity told The Post that the poll worker’s comment sounded “very inappropriate.”\n\n“That worker clearly was expressing her own personal viewpoint onto a voter in the polling site,” the lawyer said.\n\nSassoon said that besides the poll worker’s comment, “I got way more love than hate.\n\n“Passers-by thanked me for being brave,” she said.\n\n“Only one woman screamed out, ‘You better not need an abortion.’ ” \n\nSassoon said she shot back, “That’s in the hands of the state, not the president.”","summary":"A Brit who says she became a US citizen to vote for Donald Trump was cheered when she wore a trash bag to the polls last week to protest President Biden calling MAGA supporters “garbage.’’ MAGA Manhattanite Sophie Sassoon, a former fashion-industry worker, donned a black garbage bag cinched by a blazing-red Hermes belt and accompanied &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Exclusive | NYC voter bags perfect response to Biden trashing MAGA backers: ‘People were cheering’ appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/us-news/exclusive-nyc-voter-bags-perfect-response-to-biden-trashing-maga-backers-people-were-cheering/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/brit-says-us-citizen-vote-92990976.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 23:38:08","author":"Evelyn Blackwell","authors":["Evelyn Blackwell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":262176480,"title":"Harris urges voters not to be fooled by Trump’s claims electoral system is rigged","text":"By DARLENE SUPERVILLE and BILL BARROW, Associated Press\n\nDETROIT (AP) — On the last Sunday before Election Day, Democrat Kamala Harris said God offers a “divine plan strong enough to heal division” and urged voters not to be fooled by Donald Trump’s disparagement of the electoral system that he falsely claims is rigged against him.\n\nThe vice president offered the latest iteration of her closing argument in Michigan, where she began her day at the pulpit of a Black church in Detroit. From there, she embarked on multiple additional stops in the state, part of the Democratic “blue wall” in the Midwest considered her smoothest potential path to an Electoral College majority.\n\nHarris avoided direct mention of Trump during her 11-minute talk at Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ. But her comments nonetheless served as a clear juxtaposition with the former president and Republican nominee.\n\n“There are those who seek to deepen division, sow hate, spread fear and cause chaos,” she said. She spoke at the same time Trump was in Pennsylvania declaring the U.S. a “failed nation” and saying that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after the 2020 election, which he denies losing to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nAs Trump referred to Harris’ party as “demonic,” Harris quoted the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah and told her friendly audience she saw “a nation determined to turn the page on hate and division and chart a new way forward,”\n\nAfter the service, Harris pushed back at Trump’s characterizations of U.S. elections, telling reporters that his comments are “meant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country.” Those “good systems” were in place in 2020, Harris said, and “he lost.”\n\nThe vice president said she trusts the upcoming vote tally and urged voters, “in particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for this tactic, which I think includes suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won’t matter.”\n\nSeparately, Harris nodded to the significant population of Arab Americans in Michigan, many of whom are angry at the Biden administration for its continuation of the U.S. alliance with Israel as the Netanyahu government presses its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\n“I have been very clear that the level of death of innocent Palestinians is unconscionable,” Harris told reporters. “We need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out. And as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end.”\n\nHarris, who is Baptist, has addressed a Black congregation each of the last four Sundays — a nod to how important Black voters are in Michigan and several other battleground states.\n\nAfter church, Harris greeted customers and picked up lunch at Kuzzo’s Chicken and Waffles, where she had collard greens at the Detroit restaurant owned by former Detroit Lions player Ron Bartell, a Detroit native. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, among other officials, joined Harris for the stop. Later, Harris stopped by Elam Barber Shop, a Black-owned business in Pontiac, where she took part in a moderated conversation with local leaders and Black men.\n\nMichigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, is critical to Harris’ fortunes.

(AP) — Donald Trump gave a profane and conspiracy-laden speech two days before the presidential election, talking about reporters being shot and suggesting he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nIn remarks Sunday that bore no resemblance to his standard speech in the campaign’s closing stretch, the former president repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of the vote and resurrected old grievances about being prosecuted after trying to overturn his defeat four years ago. Trump intensified his verbal attacks against a “grossly incompetent” national leadership and the American media, steering his rally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at one point on to the topic of violence against members of the press.\n\nThe GOP nominee for the White House noted the ballistic glass placed in front of him at events after a gunman’s assassination attempt in July at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump talked about places where he saw openings in that protection.\n\n“I have this piece of glass here,” he said. “But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much.”\n\nIt was the second time in recent days that Trump has talked about guns being pointed at people he considers enemies. He suggested former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic, wouldn’t be willing to support foreign wars if she had “nine barrels shooting at her.”\n\nWith less than 48 hours before Election Day, Trump continues to promote falsehoods about elections and argue that he can only lose to Democrat Kamala Harris if he is cheated, even though polls suggest a tight race.\n\nSome of his allies, notably former chief strategist Steve Bannon, have encouraged him to prematurely declare victory on Tuesday even if the race is too early to call. That’s what Trump did four years ago, kicking off a process of fighting the election results that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nFor much of this year, Trump has run a relatively disciplined campaign that emphasized the issues and voters his aides believe could deliver him victory, even as he clung to false theories about voter fraud and went on frequent digressions stirring controversy. But that discipline is increasingly collapsing.\n\nTrump in recent weeks has joked about golfer Arnold Palmer’s genitalia, continued using gendered or sexist language in his efforts to win over women and staged a rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden that included crude and racist insults that dominated headlines.\n\nTrump co-campaign manager Susie Wiles, long credited with bringing order to his often-chaotic political operation, watched the former president silently from off stage Sunday.\n\nHis campaign later sought to clarify his meaning in talking about the media.\n\n“President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about,” campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. “The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else.”\n\nHarris was campaigning Sunday in Michigan, where she told a predominately Black church congregation in Detroit that God offers America a “divine plan strong enough to heal division.”\n\nThe two major candidates offered starkly different tones with the campaign almost at an end, as Harris said voters can reject “chaos, fear and hate.”\n\nTrump usually veers from subject to subject, a discursive style he has labeled “the weave.” But outside the Lancaster airport, he went on long tangents and hardly mentioned his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris.\n\nTrump referred to John Bolton, his former national security adviser and now a strident critic, as a “dumb son of a b—.” And he repeated familiar and debunked theories about voter fraud, alleging that Democrats could only win by cheating. Public polls indicate a tight and competitive race across the battleground states that will determine the Electoral College outcome.\n\n“It’s a crooked country,” Trump said. “And we’re going to make it straight. We’re going to make it straight.”\n\nHarris pushed back at Trump’s characterizations of U.S. elections, telling reporters after the church service that Trump’s comments are “meant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country.” Those “good systems” were in place in 2020, Harris said, and “he lost.”\n\nThe vice president said she trusts the upcoming vote tally and urged voters, “in particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for this tactic, which I think includes, suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won’t matter.”\n\n“Trump’s unhinged ramblings and dangerous rhetoric confirm what those closest to him have already told us: he is completely unfit to lead and would put our democracy and the rule of law at risk if given a chance,” Alex Floyd, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement, referring to former Trump aides who have warned against returning him to the White House, including retired military officers who said he’s a fascist.\n\nTrump, for his part, acknowledged that he was sidestepping his usual approach with his conspiratorial speech. He repeatedly talked about disregarding the advice of his aides, repeating their feedback in a mocking voice and insisting that he had to talk about election fraud despite their objections.\n\nTrump at one point suggested that he wouldn’t deliver this version of his speech again: “I hope you’ve enjoyed this,” he said, “because I’m only doing this one time.”\n\nIndeed, his next speech a few hours later at an airport in Kinston, North Carolina, drifted between prepared remarks and familiar stories. Trump praised David McCormick, the businessman running for Senate in Pennsylvania, appearing to briefly lose track of his location but quickly recovering.\n\n“Where’s David? Is he around some place?” Trump said. “You know we just left him. He’s a great guy.”\n\nSome rallygoers began leaving almost immediately. One of them was Whitney Riley, 60, who said she desperately wanted to stay but had another event. She noted Trump started late.\n\n“I got to see him land. I got to see him open,” said Riley, wearing Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hat and an American flag scarf. “And that’ll have to be enough.”\n\nSuperville reported from Detroit, Barrow from Washington and Cooper from Phoenix.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

[+] ballot for the 2024 New Hampshire primary in Concord, N.H., on Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023. Castro, who has filed multiple lawsuits contending the 14th Amendment bars former President Donald Trump's candidacy, wrote: \"Freedom comes from our Constitution. Without that we fall.\" (AP Photo/Holly Ramer)\nAssociated Press\n\nJohn Anthony Castro's greatest claim to fame is probably his run for the 2024 Republican nomination for President. Using his status as a candidates for standing he filed lawsuits to have Donald Trump removed from the ballot on Fourteenth Amendment Section 3 grounds. Those cases did not go anywhere.\n\nThe case that did go somewhere is the United States of America v John Anthony Castro in the United States District Court For the Northern District of Texas in Fort Worth. The indictment filed January 3, 2024 charged Castro with 33 counts of \"Aiding and Assisting in the Preparation and Presentation of a False and Fraudulent Return\". Castro opted to be tried by the judge rather than a jury. Judge Terry Means, who was appointed by the elder George Bush, found Castro guilty on all 33 counts. On October 30, 2024 Judge Means sentenced Castro to 188 months in prison followed by one year of supervised release. A condition of the supervised release is the payment of restitution in the amount of $277,243.\n\nThe Tax Practice\n\nI first learned about John Anthony Castro's tax practice in 2020 when I covered a decision of the Court of Claims in the case of Alan C. Dixon. The refund claim was on a fairly obscure topic, the US tax treatment of the Australian Superannuation Fund for Australian nationals working in the United States. The refund claim was denied because the amended returns they were based on were not signed by Mr. Dixon. They were signed by Castro who did not have a power of attorney allowing him to sign returns. He wrote me that the decision would be appealed and gave me an argument that I didn't quite comprehend. I see that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit turned down the appeal.\n\nCastro had built a mini practice around the superannuation issue and we might see in it a foreshadowing of what was to come. Here he is explaining the issue\n\nThe key element comes early in the video. Castro is explaining why his firm's position is \"so starkly different from the rest of the industry\". As you probably infer, that position is more taxpayer friendly.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warns Gmail, Outlook, AOL, Yahoo Users—Hackers Gain Access To Accounts\n\nSamsung’s Update Decision—Bad News For Millions Of Galaxy S24 And S23 Owners\n\nTrump Vs. Harris 2024 Polls: Harris Leads In 2 Surveys, Tie In 3 Others—As Race Tightens\n\nCastro's firm was a \"virtual practice\" with offices in Orlando FL, Mansfield TX and Washington DC. The technique he used, as outlined in an interaction with an under cover agent (UC) was to tell the potential client what there refund would be based on their documents if they used another preparer. He would then offer to do their return his way and split the increased refund. He did this with the UC turning $373 into $6,007 of which his share was $2,999. He did this by manufacturing $29,339 in deductions. The deductions did not come from UC. UC did not get to see the return before it was filed.\n\nWhen the \"victim-taxpayers\" as the indictment refers to them got wind of the fictitious deduction, Castro stonewalled them. The indictment lists the type and amount of expenses that are outlined in the indictment for each of the 33 counts. Each count is a different taxpayer. He seemed to favor employee business expenses, other Schedule A deductions and Schedule C.\n\nInterestingly there are no Australian superannuation counts.\n\nThe Defense\n\nIn the defense trial brief Castro argued that he had satisfied the \"good-faith\" \"reasonable basis\" tax reporting standard on some of the positions that were questions. Then there were the software errors, data entry errors and other preparer errors.\n\nAfter his conviction he followed up with a letter to Judge Means. He started out by writing that he vividly recalled a dream that had instructed him to go for a bench trial, because the could trust the judge's judgement. He then discussed two of the witnesses, who were \"client-victims, having skeletons in their closet that were suppressed. He offered some apology - \"Although disclosed to the authorities, I failed to explain to clients that were not in a position to understand and provide informed consent to such a novel and complex legal interpretation\".\n\nThe Sentence\n\nI thought the sentence was overly harsh and had trouble reconciling it with the guidelines. When it comes to tax crimes the big factor in what level you are at is the tax loss and $277,243 isn't enough to get you to more than 15 years. Peter Goldberger, an attorney who focuses on appeals and other post-conviction aspects of federal criminal cases pointed out what I had missed. In arguing the tax loss for sentencing purposes IRS extrapolated the 33 clients to his entire client base which brought the loss to over $15 million.\n\nI regularly see cases of tax preparers performing shenanigans like those Castro was convicted of and what the government is seeking is an injunction that will force them to take up another line of work. What is different about the ones who instead end up facing forfeiting their liability? Castro has argued that it his legal attacks on once and possibly future president Trump that have dictated his harsh treatment. I have to leave that as an open question.\n\nMore significant is the lesson this teaches about tax practice. If you rely on tax professionals to help you stay compliant while minimizing your tax, you will find that there is always somebody who claims they can get you a better result. To do this legitimately it is best to start before the tax year is over, when there are more things you can do that will affect your tax liability. If your return is done by an average tax preparer and you have it reviewed by a \"superior\" tax preparer, i.e. somebody who knows the tax law much better, it is likely that the latter will come up with something to consider unless your situation is extremely simple. The thing is that extra effort may well reveal something that means you are possibly underpaying rather than overpaying. Somebody who promises you that they can get a better result for you may be running an operation like Castro was convicted of running.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Look at the size of this sucker,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nTrump’s campaign team was also quick to defend his comments about the media, in which he said “to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much.”\n\nThey claimed he was “actually looking out for the welfare” of the press.\n\n“President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the media constantly talks and jokes about,” campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. “The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the media being harmed, or anything else.”\n\nDuring the speech, a car horn also went off interrupting Trump.\n\n“Do you hear that? It’s right in the field where you might have a sniper. And I have no glass here,” Trump said motioning towards the gasping the glass. “I have glass here. There’s nothing over there.”\n\n“I’m hearing that horn. That could be any minute now. What the hell do I know? I must be wrong,” he said. “It probably was Biden or the other one that said screw em’ don’t give him the glass.”","summary":"The former president grumbled about the protective glass as he rallied in Pennsylvania with just days left before election","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-glass-rally-complaint-election-b2640687.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/03/23/GettyImages-2182026074.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xJwYTK2A-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-03 23:32:15","author":"Graeme Massie","authors":["Graeme Massie"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.504}]}
