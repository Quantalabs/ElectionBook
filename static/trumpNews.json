It's not clear if the Department of Education will interpret Title IX law the same way when incoming President Donald Trump's administration installs new officials in the near future.\n\nThe NCAA and its power conferences have agreed to allow each school to share up to $20.5 million in direct payments to its athletes via name, image and likeness deals as one of the terms of a pending antitrust settlement. Many schools from those power conferences have developed plans to distribute the majority of that money to athletes in sports that generate the most revenue -- mostly football and men's basketball players.\n\nIn some cases, athletic directors have publicly shared that they intend to provide upward of 75% of that money to their football players.\n\nHowever, the Office for Civil Rights -- the division of the Department of Education that enforces Title IX law -- said in its memo Thursday that those future payments should be considered \"athletic financial assistance\" and therefore must be shared proportionally between men and women athletes.\n\n\"When a school provides athletic financial assistance in forms other than scholarships or grants, including compensation for the use of a student-athlete's NIL, such assistance also must be made proportionately available to male and female athletes,\" the memo said.\n\nTitle IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs. The law requires that schools provide opportunities to play a varsity sport that are proportional to the student body's overall gender makeup. It also requires schools to provide financial assistance that is in proportion to the number of students of each sex who play sports on campus. If 50% of a school's athletes are women, then 50% of the school's financial aid for athletes must be allotted to women.\n\nThe memo is not as clear in providing guidance on how payments from booster collectives closely associated with their schools are impacted by Title IX law. It states that the department does not consider money provided by a third party in an NIL deal as athletic financial assistance like the future revenue sharing payments or scholarship dollars. But if money from private sources ends up creating a disparity in an athletic program, it is possible that NIL agreements could \"trigger a school's Title IX obligations.\"\n\nMale and female athletes also deserve equivalent publicity, including in sports information personnel, the amount and quality of promotion, and even in social media postings. If a school fails to provide equitable publicity, those students risk losing out on NIL opportunities, the memo states. ESPN reported a little over a year ago that 55 athletic departments -- or 84% of the then-Power 5 -- mentioned men's teams more often than women's teams on their main accounts on what was then Twitter, and women's teams were more likely to have to share social media managers with other teams.\n\nWhile the Department of Education has the authority to punish schools for failing to meet Title IX requirements, historically all cases regarding how the law applies to college sports have come from athletes who sue their school and allege unequal treatment. There are multiple pending Title IX lawsuits related to NIL compensation from third parties. The memo published during the final two days of this department's time in power could provide some fodder for future potential lawsuits if any athletes sue their school over the way future direct payments are made to athletes.\n\n\"I'd be astonished if schools that have announced they are planning something other than proportional distribution continue with those plans,\" said attorney Arthur Bryant, who is the midst of a Title IX lawsuit against the University of Oregon. \"They would be knowingly and intentionally planning to violate the law.\"\n\nBryant said he thinks the clarifying language laid out by the department also has the potential to derail the pending antitrust settlement. A hearing to finalize that settlement is scheduled for April.","summary":"The direct payment plans that many major college athletic departments are making for athletes would violate Title IX law, according to a Department of Education memo.","url":"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/43443976/dept-education-says-title-ix-applies-payments-athletes","image":"https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/0116/r1439447_1296x729_16-9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:59:05","author":"Dan Murphy,Paula Lavigne","authors":["Dan Murphy","Paula Lavigne"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":280967816,"title":"TikTok's fight against going dark gains support from key US lawmakers - Reuters","text":"SummaryCompaniesTrump administration mulls TikTok divestiture extensionTikTok preparing to shut US operations amid federal banSupreme Court says it may issue rulings on FridaySenator Schumer says TikTok should get time to find buyer\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - TikTok's fortunes took a positive turn on Thursday as a growing number of U.S. officials said its Chinese owner should have more time to sell that app and stop it from being banned ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House.\n\nTrump's incoming national security adviser said the new Republican administration will keep the social media app used by 170 million Americans alive in the U.S. if there is a viable deal and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer urged President Joe Biden to extend by 90 days a looming deadline to shut it down on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nA law passed in April mandates TikTok's owner, ByteDance, divest TikTok's U.S. assets by Sunday to a non-Chinese buyer, or be banned on national security concerns.\n\n\"We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,\" U.S. Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News, pointing to a provision in the law allowing for a 90-day extension if there is \"significant progress\" toward a divestiture.\n\n\"Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going,\" said Waltz, who was picked by Trump to be his national security adviser.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday absent a divestiture, overturn the law or pause it to give the justices more time to make a decision.\n\nThe court said it may issue rulings on Friday, but as is customary, did not state which case or cases would be decided.\n\nTrump once supported a ban on the app but changed his stance last year. His shift came amid growing signs of support for his presidential campaign among tech executives and overtures from Republican donor Jeff Yass, who owns a big share of ByteDance.\n\nIn a sign of warming ties between Trump and TikTok, the video app's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will attend the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 and be seated on the dais among other high-profile invitees, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nBIPARTISAN SHIFT\n\n\"It's clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,” Schumer said on the Senate floor, adding that Democrats tried to pass a bill extending the deadline to find a solution to 270 days.\n\nItem 1 of 2 The TikTok app logo and a forbidden sign are seen in this illustration taken January 16, 2025.

It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress.\n\nTikTok did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, \"President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there's no better deal maker than Donald Trump.\"\n\n'TALKS A BIG GAME'\n\nStill, several Republicans and Democrats remain concerned about Chinese ownership of the app, worried the Chinese government could use it as a tool to collect data on U.S. citizens and to spread propaganda to the public.\n\n\"Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok - just like many Republicans voted to do,\" Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote on the social media platform X. \"But now he's inviting TikTok's CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?\"\n\nThe prospect of a TikTok ban has already triggered some users to seek alternatives, with Chinese social media app RedNote gaining nearly 3 million U.S. users in one day earlier this week, according to analytics firm Similarweb.\n\nReuters reported that TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nA White House official told Reuters on Wednesday that Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the U.S. Supreme Court fails to act. The official added that Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok.\n\nPrivately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States.\n\nReporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Nathan Layne in West Palm Beach, Florida; Editing by Chris Sanders, Chizu Nomiyama, Will Dunham and Matthew Lewis\n\nXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights","summary":"TikTok's fight against going dark gains support from key US lawmakers  Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-will-keep-tiktok-going-dark-if-deal-is-table-adviser-says-2025-01-16/","image":"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZZP5FB33ANIYHA3HBPLNPNURB4.jpg?auth=87aef4d9baa74fd4b8fd8c59ff81f4006c37d3cdef64be743487ddce275125eb&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true","video":"https://ajo.prod.reuters.tv/v3/playlist/683125/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:52:00","author":"David Shepardson","authors":["David Shepardson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":280967202,"title":"What to expect from Trump and his administration on climate policy","text":"What to expect from Trump and his administration on climate policy\n President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency faced a confirmation hearing on Thursday.

The quake also injured about 43,000 people and damaged or destroyed roughly 640,000 homes.\n\nTOKYO - The Japanese government started a process Friday to compensate victims of forced sterilization surgery under a now-defunct eugenics protection law, aiming to provide remedy to those who have not joined lawsuits against the state.\n\nThe move comes as a law took effect to provide damages to those affected by what is seen as the worst human rights violation in the country's postwar history.\n\nOSAKA - Nintendo Co. said Thursday it will release the successor to its Switch game console, which has become one of its best-selling consoles, sometime this year.\n\nThe Japanese gaming company unveiled an image and video preview of its new model, the Nintendo Switch 2. Further details will be announced in a video to be released on April 2.\n\nSouth Korea court backs detention of president\n\nSEOUL - A South Korean court on Thursday decided the ongoing detention of President Yoon Suk Yeol is legally grounded, local media reported, a move that could lead investigators to seek a formal arrest warrant on suspicion that he incited insurrection.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court made the judgment after Yoon's defense team asked it to review the legality of detaining the president, who faces the allegation over his declaration of martial law last month.\n\nLOS ANGELES - A prizewinning Japanese author who lost her home in the recent wildfires in Los Angeles expressed dismay that the life she once knew is now over.\n\n\"Everything from the past has disappeared,\" said Fumiko Kometani, 94, stunned by her losses in the ongoing fires that have ravaged multiple areas in and near the city.\n\nTOKYO - A former MUFG Bank employee who was arrested for stealing gold bars from customer safe deposit boxes is believed to have circumvented an access control system and undertaken the thefts when the bank was both open and closed, an investigative source said Thursday.\n\nYukari Imamura, 46, has told investigators that she turned off the system's power source before entering the safe deposit box room, the source said, a move she likely hoped would conceal her actions.\n\nTOKYO - Sumo grand champion Terunofuji, the only current yokozuna, has decided to retire after an injury-plagued career, a Japan Sumo Association source said Thursday.\n\nThe Mongolian-born 33-year-old, a 10-time winner in the elite makuuchi division, cut short his latest comeback following his second loss at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo, where he forfeited his bout on Thursday to end with a 2-3 record.\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state on Wednesday warned China not to further destabilize the Indo-Pacific region, including areas around Taiwan and the Philippines, so that Washington and Beijing can keep cooperating to avoid conflict.\n\nIn a confirmation hearing for the post, Florida Sen.

Instead, he will likely leave it to his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, to decide what to do about the ban, according to ABC News.TikTok users in the meantime started a mass migration to the Chinese-owned Xiaohongshu, known in English as RedNote (although the literal translation is \"Little Red Book\") as an act of protest against the U.S. government, effectively saying that if the concern is that TikTok is letting China harvest American citizen data, they'll simply cut out the middleman.What To KnowA number of petitions have popped up over the past few days as some lawmakers have appeared to change their minds about the ban, citing concerns about small businesses and freedom of speech for the roughly 170 million users—arguments made before the bill passed and had largely been ignored by lawmakers in favor of concerns over national security.Petitions Pop Up to Stop the Ban of TikTokA few petitions in support of stopping the ban popped up, including one on Change.org that has amassed 357,278 verified signatures as of Thursday evening.\"We petition that the United States government work with TikTok and its parent company ByteDance to solve their concerns without taking away an app that provides so much enjoyment, education, and community for millions of Americans,\" petition organizers wrote. \"We must act now to let our politicians know that they cannot and should not control what we can see, hear, and share.\"The (ACLU) also has a petition urging those concerned about the ban to message their senators and demand they don't ban TikTok because it violates the First Amendment right of American citizens.Action Network, an \"open platform that empowers individuals and groups to organize for progressive causes,\" also has an outreach program that provides a template message to send to elected officials, although it uses more extreme language and claims a TikTok ban will \"reinforce xenophobic tropes and silence millions of people.\"Khanna's Legislation to Halt Ban of TikTokKhanna, who has been among the consistent and vocal supporters of TikTok—and one of the 58 representatives who voted against the ban in the first place—started a petition this week while also backing legislation calling for a 270-day extension on the ban to allow parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok or for Trump to determine what he wants to do about it.\"Over 170 million Americans use TikTok to connect with others, run small businesses, gain knowledge and information, and so much more. Banning TikTok, especially without concrete evidence of foreign interference, threatens our constitutionally protected freedom of speech and impacts the livelihoods of content creators and small businesses who rely on this unique platform,\" Khanna wrote in his petition, stressing that \"banning TikTok isn't the answer.\"The legislation, co-sponsored by Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Cory Booker of California (all of whom are Democrats), was introduced on January 14, with arguments from Markey and Khanna on the floor of their respective houses to urge a vote on the matter.But it appears that lawmakers are waiting to see what the Supreme Court ultimately decides before taking any additional action. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Thursday that his party introduced a bill on Wednesday night to extend the deadline, but that Senate Republicans blocked the bill, calling it a \"stunning\" move.\"We will continue to work to find a responsible solution to keeping TikTok going, protect Americans' livelihoods, and protect against CCP surveillance. We must and we can do all three,\" Schumer said.What People Are SayingA White House spokesperson told Newsweek: \"Our position on this has been clear: TikTok should continue to operate but under American ownership. Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement.\"Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California told Newsweek: \"My petition opposing the TikTok ban has over 480,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. It shows how deeply concerned Americans are about their small businesses, livelihoods, and free speech being taken away. The pressure is working. We must stand up for the 170 million Americans on the app and stop the ban.\"What Happens Next?Trump is said to be considering a range of options, including an executive order to circumvent the order or would consider a \"viable\" deal for the app, according to Reuters.\"We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,\" Representative Mike Waltz of Florida, Trump's pick for national security adviser, told Fox News on Thursday. He said the act that would enforce the ban allows a 90-day extension if there is \"significant progress\" toward a sale.\"Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going,\" Waltz added.Update, 01/16/25 at 7:38 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Representative Ro Khanna.","summary":"With the ban on TikTok just days away, some legislators and many TikTok users have pushed for Congress to change its mind.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/petitions-legislation-stop-ban-tiktok-ro-khanna-2016468","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2566803/tiktok-ban-washington-dc-congress.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:35:27","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":280968246,"title":"Lammy and Nandy launch ‘soft power council’ to boost UK on global stage","text":"Leading figures across the arts, culture and sport will be brought together as part of a new “soft power council” aimed at transforming Britain’s role on the global stage.\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy and Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy will jointly chair the group which the Government says is designed to drive growth and security by making the most of the country’s cultural exports.\n\nIt is understood the council will seek to work alongside institutions like the royal family, which counts US President-elect Donald Trump among its admirers and is seen as one of Britain’s biggest soft power assets, to boost influence internationally.\n\nThe Foreign Office said the body would bring together “experts from across culture, sport, the creative industries and geopolitics”.\n\nIt will seek ways for these sectors to work closer with Whitehall to help revive the economy and improve security, for example through Government campaigns and a “systematic” approach to cultural and sporting calendars.\n\nMr Lammy said: “Soft power is fundamental to the UK’s impact and reputation around the world.

Bolsonaro—dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics”—was indicted in November for plotting an alleged coup to stay in power after Brazilian voters opted for his opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the country’s 2022 presidential election. It is unlikely, however, that he’ll make it to see his firebrand American counterpart sworn in next week. Bolsonaro’s passport was taken as part of the probe into the alleged coup, and Brazil’s attorney general recommended that his request to go abroad for Trump’s inauguration be denied. Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice and Bolsonaro critic, decided Thursday that Bolsonaro should not be allowed to travel to Washington, D.C. The former Brazilian leader hinted to the Times that he believes Trump’s influence on global politics might help him stay out of jail. “Frankly, I wouldn’t mind if there were an anti-Viagra, something with the opposite effect,” Trump, now 78, told Playboy in 2004, the year he turned 58. “I’m not bragging. I’m just lucky. I don’t need it.”","summary":"Marko Djurica / Marko Djurica via ReutersPresident-elect Donald Trump is slated to have one of the coldest Inauguration Days in 40 years, according to CNN. The outlet reports that when Trump swears-in on Jan. 20 at noon, the temperature is expected to be in the low-20s (around 20 degrees below normal) with winds reaching 10 to 20 mph. Although rain and snow are expected to pour the day prior, Inauguration Day is looking clear, though wind gusts up to 30 mph will make for freezing conditions. On the late former President Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration in 1985, CNN reports that noon temperatures were at 7 degrees. Meanwhile, in former President Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009, temperatures were at 28 degrees. The anticipated temperatures for Trump’s second inauguration would make it the coldest Inauguration Day since Reagan’s. The expected cold is a result of Arctic air that’s slated to spill south from Canada late this week and drop temperatures to below normal across a multitude of states.\n\nRea","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trumps-inauguration-day-slated-to-be-coldest-in-40-years/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/QNBEF75RTBDSHJV2XD44L6ZYUQ.JPG?smart=true&auth=00e24faa52ee91ba4b5a659f7df3f3ca5566cf1f7fad6b8c9c8b88b4440bfd52&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:30:16","author":"Yasmeen Hamadeh","authors":["Yasmeen Hamadeh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":280966198,"title":"Even Republicans aren’t happy about House speaker’s latest cave to Trump","text":"House Republicans are disapproving of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to remove Rep.

Greg Abbott's border crackdown, is expected to be appointed Border Patrol chief after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, two sources familiar with the move told CBS News Thursday.Banks would replace current Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens, a 28-year veteran career official at the agency. Owens is set to retire from government service in April, two U.S. officials told CBS News.In an internal message sent to agents Thursday and obtained by CBS News, Owens said the opportunity to serve as Border Patrol chief was \"the highest honor I have ever received.\"\"Looking ahead, I will leave with a profound sense of optimism about its future and that of our country,\" Owens wrote. \"I will take comfort knowing that you are on our frontline, standing between the innocent and the evil.\"Banks' appointment would be a departure from the general practice of Border Patrol having leaders that are career government officials, not political appointees.A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, Banks has been a key player in Texas' aggressive effort to counter what the state has argued is the Biden administration's failure to secure the southern border amid record levels of migrant crossings.Since March 2021, Texas has bussed tens of thousands of migrants to major Democratic-led U.S. cities, deployed the National Guard to fortify the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and assigned troopers to arrest migrants on criminal trespassing charges. It also tried to enact its own immigration law to arrest and jail migrants suspected of entering the country illegally, though that measure is currently held up in court.As Border Patrol chief, Banks would oversee the agents in green uniforms responsible for apprehending migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally between official entry points, or those who reach Florida and other coastal sectors by sea. Over the past years, discontent among rank-and-file agents has grown over disagreements with the Biden administration's immigration policies.One U.S. official said Banks is expected to join the second Trump administration in some capacity soon after Trump is inaugurated, alongside Rodney Scott, who the president-elect has tapped to be his CBP commissioner.Scott was a Border Patrol chief himself, appointed under the first Trump administration, until he was ousted by the Biden administration in the spring of 2021. As CBP commissioner, Scott would oversee Border Patrol, but also customs and immigration officials at airports, sea ports and land crossings. That position requires Senate confirmation.Beyond Banks and Scott, the incoming Trump administration also plans to install Tom Homan, a longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, as its border czar, a new White House position. Homan is expected to play a key role in carrying out what Trump has promised will be the largest deportation operation in American history.During the first three years of the Biden administration, CBP reported record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, and officials struggled at times to contain mass illegal crossings. But unlawful border crossings have since plunged to a four-year low due to asylum limits President Biden enacted in June, and Mexico's efforts to stop migrants from trekking north.","summary":"Mike Banks, who has spearheaded Texas Gov.

The fires have killed dozens of people, while tens of thousands of homes and other structures have burned to the ground.While Congress typically grants aid for major natural disasters without debate, Johnson suggested earlier this week that \"there should probably be conditions\" on aid for California's emergency, while hinting that funds might be tied to Trump's demand for an increase to the federal debt limit.What To KnowNewsom shared a video captioned as a \"message\" to Johnson on Thursday to X, formerly Twitter. Taken from an interview with progressive influencer Brian Tyler Cohen, the governor says in the video that California would \"never\" place conditions on supporting Johnson's home state of Louisiana during a disaster.\"We'd never condition it,\" Newsom says. \"With the debt ceiling bill, [to] see if we can get tax cuts for billionaires and corporation that don't need it, and then put at risk the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans that happen to live in California—Speaker Johnson and Mr. president-elect, millions of your supporters are out here.\"\"They need your help, they need your empathy, they need your care,\" he continues. \"Whatever compassion you can express, as opposed to condemnation and divisive language that has aided and abetted nothing but mis and disinformation that's flamed fear and flamed a lot of anxiety for folks that are just simply trying to recover.\"Johnson responded to the video one hour later by posting the following on X:\"Instead of making highly produced clap back videos with social media influencers, you should get to work helping Californians. You're the leader of a state in crisis, and you should finally start acting like it.\"In response to Newsweek's request for comment on Johnson's post, Newsom's Director of Communications Izzy Gardon said in a statement that \"the Governor is focused on protecting people, not playing politics, and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need.\"What People Are SayingTrump, speaking about using the California emergency to pass his agenda in a single bill during an interview on Thursday with conservative pundit Dan Bongino: \"I'd like to see one bill... If you add Los Angeles into it, then you can really do one, big, beautiful bill. Because, frankly, they want that so badly. They want the money to go out there so badly. And I don't think we should do a bill until Los Angeles is included. And when Los Angeles is included, we get everything we want.\"Newsom, commenting on Republican demands to put conditions on aid during an interview with MSNBC host and former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki earlier this week: \"If that's leadership, I have a different definition... That's the face of leadership in the United States of America? Conditioning aid to the American people in need? Politicizing this tragic moment? I'll spare any more commentary on it, I just have to say I would encourage these people—they're human beings, they're parents, I respect that—come out here, visit with these folks and let's have a conversation after that.\"What Happens NextFirefighters are continuing to battle multiple major fires in Southern California and recovery efforts are ongoing. Trump will be sworn into office for his second term on Monday, at which point both houses of Congress and the White House will be controlled by Republicans.

And in the lead-up to his inauguration, Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have agreed to pause hostilities in Gaza, where more than 46,700 Palestinians have been killed in the last 15 months.\n\nBut Luqman says she doesn’t feel vindicated, even though Trump has claimed credit for pushing the ceasefire deal over the line.\n\nInstead, she’s outraged at outgoing United States President Joe Biden for failing to finalise the agreement months earlier.\n\n“I’m just even more angry because Trump, who is not even in office, did a little arm-twisting, and the ceasefire agreement was done right away,” Luqman told Al Jazeera. “This could have happened sooner. It’s so sad, all those extra lives lost.”\n\nShe added that the way the agreement was reached “solidified Biden’s legacy as Genocide Joe”, a nickname that links the Democratic leader to the Israeli abuses in Gaza.\n\nAfter overwhelmingly backing Democrats in previous elections, many Arab American voters turned against the party and its candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, in November’s race because of their support for Israel’s war.\n\nWhile many Arab voters say it is too early to celebrate the fragile ceasefire agreement, they stress that Trump’s intervention shows that they were right to abandon Harris.\n\nThe shift in Arab American voting preferences was especially apparent in the swing state of Michigan.\n\nIn predominantly Arab neighbourhoods on the east side of the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Harris received less than 20 percent of the votes. The majority of residents either cast their ballots for Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\nWhile Harris argued that she and Biden had been working “tirelessly” to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, the vice president also pledged to continue arming Israel without any conditions.\n\nThe Biden administration also vetoed four United Nations Security Council resolutions that would have called for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nTrump’s role\n\nAmer Ghalib, the Yemeni American mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, was among those who endorsed Trump last year, even appearing at his rallies.\n\nHe explained that negotiating a ceasefire in Gaza was the top demand of the former president’s Arab and Muslim supporters.\n\n“He knew that it was a fair and humane request,” Ghalib told Al Jazeera in a statement.\n\n“We supported him and asked for ceasefire, peace, fighting Islamophobia, fair representation for Muslims in his administration and promoting and protecting faith and family values and safe education for our kids. He has shown some signs of moving forward to deliver on every one of his promises.”\n\nBoth Trump and Biden claimed credit for the ceasefire agreement on Wednesday, with the incoming president asserting that the “epic” deal would not have been reached had he not won the elections in November.\n\nIt is difficult, however, to assess the extent of Trump’s role in behind-the-scenes diplomacy.\n\nBut several Israeli media reports have indicated that Trump was decisive in getting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to the pact, which will lead to the release of Israeli captives in Gaza as well as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nTrump sent his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with mediators in Qatar and Netanyahu in Israel last week.\n\nOn Thursday, the US president-elect appeared to confirm Israeli accounts that Witkoff pushed Netanyahu to accept the agreement.\n\nHe shared on social media a Times of Israel article quoting an unidentified Arab official as saying: “Trump envoy swayed Netanyahu more in one meeting than Biden did all year.”\n\nNotably, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani thanked Witkoff by name when announcing the deal on Wednesday.\n\n‘All hell’ breaking loose\n\nTrump had warned earlier this month that “all hell will break out” if the Israeli captives are not released by the time he takes office on January 20.\n\nSome analysts saw the message as a threat to Hamas. But the Palestinian group had repeatedly said that it would accept the ceasefire deal laid out by Biden in May, which included a prisoner exchange and a permanent end to the war.\n\nIt was Netanyahu who publicly stated on several occasions that his government intends to continue the war.\n\nStill, Biden administration officials — including Secretary of State Antony Blinken — have insisted that Hamas has been blocking the agreement.\n\nHala Rharrit, a former US diplomat who resigned last year over the Biden administration’s handling of the war, said the deal announced on Wednesday is the same proposal that had been on the table since May.\n\nRharrit told Al Jazeera that the Biden administration’s months-long failure to finalise the agreement was a “matter of political will”.\n\n“If there was not a change in administration, I think we would have kept on hearing the exact same rhetoric of ‘We’re working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire,'” Rharrit said.\n\nShe added that there would have been no shift had Harris gotten elected, but Trump’s victory created the incentive to make the ceasefire deal happen.\n\nConcerns about agreement\n\nAlthough Wednesday’s announcement sparked jubilation in Gaza, Arab American advocates are cautious about celebrating just yet.\n\nIt is not clear whether Israel will honour the deal, which does not take effect until Sunday. In neighbouring Lebanon, a US-brokered ceasefire agreement in November has failed to stop daily Israeli attacks.\n\nIsrael has also killed dozens of people in Gaza, including at least 21 children, since the deal was announced.\n\nSuehaila Amen, an Arab American community advocate in Michigan, said she hopes the ceasefire will come to fruition, but stressed that it is difficult to take the word of US and Israeli politicians.\n\nStill, she said an agreement reached after Trump’s intervention is further indictment of Biden’s unwillingness to get Israel to end the war.\n\n“For many within the community, pushing back against the Biden administration for their continuous funding of a genocide — as well as turning a blind eye to the verified and documented human rights violations — continues to be something we stand by,” Amen told Al Jazeera.\n\nAmen said voters are “well aware” that Trump helped complete the ceasefire deal.\n\n“As Biden leaves with a bloody legacy of genocide to his name, our work continues to ensure our rights are protected and no further harm or harassment ensues towards the Arab and Muslim American community, from the White House and on down,” she said.\n\n‘We hope it will not be temporary’\n\nThe way Walid Fidama sees it, the former president made “concrete promises” to end the war in Gaza when he met with Arab and Muslim advocates before the elections. A lifelong Democrat, the Yemeni American ultimately cast his vote for Trump in November.\n\n“We are happy that he helped with the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, and we hope it will not just be temporary,” Fidama told Al Jazeera.\n\n“We want the agreement to take full effect and allow displaced people to return to their homes.”\n\nBut some members of the Arab American community are sceptical that Trump will bring lasting peace to the Middle East, as he promised on the campaign trail. After all, Trump has filled his incoming cabinet with staunchly pro-Israel aides, including Senator Marco Rubio, his nominee for secretary of state.\n\nAnd during his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump made a series of policy shifts that bolstered the Netanyahu government, including by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nLuqman said she is under no illusion that the Republican establishment will distance itself from Israel, but ending the atrocities in Gaza “immediately in order to save more lives” was her top concern.\n\n“I’m not going to support Marco Rubio. But at the same time, I’m really conscientious that there aren’t many good options,” Luqman said.","summary":"Incoming US president suggests that he pressured Israel to take the deal, which is supposed to go into effect on Sunday.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/trumps-role-in-gaza-ceasefire-fuels-arab-american-anger-with-biden?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-16T072808Z_1903860166_RC2UACAGXJDE_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-1737049125.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:18:07","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.819},{"id":280962206,"title":"US trade envoy finds China shipbuilding policies 'actionable'","text":"The US Trade Representative said Thursday that its probe into China's practices in the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors found that Beijing's \"targeted dominance\" warranted action.\n\nThe conclusion comes after the USTR launched an investigation last year, responding to a petition by five unions.\n\n\"Beijing's targeted dominance of these sectors undermines fair, market-oriented competition, increases economic security risks, and is the greatest barrier to revitalization of US industries,\" USTR Katherine Tai said in a statement.\n\nTai added that the findings, under Section 301 of the Trade Act, \"set the stage for urgent action to invest in America and strengthen our supply chains.\"\n\nA Section 301 investigation was a key tool President-elect Donald Trump's first administration used to justify tariff hikes on Chinese goods.\n\nBeijing has previously criticized the US investigation as being \"full of false accusations.\"\n\nBut Tai said Thursday that the United States builds fewer than five ships each year -- a sharp decline from in the 1970s -- while China builds more than 1,700.\n\nThe USTR investigation found China's efforts to dominate the sector \"unreasonable\" as it displaces foreign firms and creates dependencies on the world's second biggest economy.\n\nThe USTR added that Beijing also has \"extraordinary control over its economic actors and these sectors.\"\n\nBut a decision on what actions to take would be considered in the next stage of the probe.\n\nOn Thursday, Alliance for American Manufacturing president Scott Paul applauded the pursuit of the investigation.\n\n\"Failing to take decisive action will leave our shipbuilding capabilities at the mercy of Beijing's persistent predatory market distortions,\" Paul said.\n\n© Agence France-Presse\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"The US Trade Representative said Thursday that its probe into China's practices in the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors found that Beijing's \"targeted dominance\" warranted action.

Instead, it announced that Marcos Jnr would be represented by his envoy to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, who is also the president’s cousin.\nMarcos Jnr has been trying to get close to Trump since his election win in early November.\nCompeting with other foreign leaders for Trump’s attention, he had to wait two weeks before Trump took his brief congratulatory phone call on November 19. Marcos Jnr also told reporters on the same day he planned to meet Trump “as soon as I can”.\nRomualdez flew to Florida during the New Year holiday and played a round of golf at the Trump International Golf Club.\nIn his January 5 column for the Philippine Star, he said he was pleased to speak with Trump, congratulating him on his victory and “was looking forward to working once again with his administration”.\nHe also noted in his column that it was he and his team that arranged the November phone call, during which Trump asked Marcos Jnr about his mother, former first lady Imelda Marcos, whom Trump remembered meeting “many times” in New York.\nNo announcement has been made about Trump inviting Marcos Jnr despite the ambassador’s talks, which starkly contrasts Chinese President Xi Jinping, who received a personal and public invitation to the inauguration in December.\n\nNo deliberate snub\nSociology professor Walden Bello took a measured view. “I would not say that Marcos Jnr was deliberately snubbed,” he told This Week in Asia.\nHe also downplayed the ambassador’s meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago: “The last few weeks, Trump has been practically just receiving one delegation after another.”\nHe pointed out that, traditionally, foreign leaders are not invited to US presidential inaugurations. “If you say Marcos Jnr was snubbed, then you would also have to say that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were also snubbed.”\nTrump issued invitations to his “far-right, ideological buddies” like Hungary’s Viktor Orban, Argentina’s Javier Milei and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, “prioritising people that Trump is really close to [and] idolises”, Bello added.\n\nWhy invite Xi?\nBello said Trump’s invitation to Xi indicates his desire to strike a deal, especially in trade and technology.\nHe suggested that if an agreement involved reducing the US military presence in the Indo-Pacific, the US might adopt a lesser profile in the region while still maintaining a rhetoric of engagement with the Asia-Pacific, while describing Trump’s defence and security policy for the Indo-Pacific as “very fluid”.\nBello, who predicted a Trump victory, said, “[Trump] is playing to that part of his base that is isolationist, meaning very, very suspicious of continued US political and military engagements abroad”, and is focused on “rebuilding the core of the US empire, which is basically North America”.\nAs for Xi, who said he was not attending the inauguration, Bello believes Trump sees Xi as a fellow strong authoritarian leader.\n\nCabinet of China hawks\nDespite uncertainties about Trump’s position on the Indo-Pacific, many figures tapped to be in his cabinet have expressed strong support for countering China’s influence in the region.\nDuring his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Trump’s Secretary of State nominee, Marco Rubio, told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China “needs to stop messing around with Taiwan and the Philippines,” because it is diverting US attention in undesirable ways.\nRubio added that if Beijing was genuinely serious about stabilising US-China ties, it should avoid any rash or irrational actions, because “we have commitments to the Philippines, and we have commitments to Taiwan that we intend to keep”.\nHowever, Bello cautioned against taking Rubio’s comments at face value, arguing that members of Trump’s cabinet may have their own ideas, they will ultimately “do what Trump wants”.\n\nHe also criticised Marcos Jnr’s decision to hold a Zoom meeting with outgoing President Joe Biden and Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on January 13, and to take a phone call from Vice-President Kamala Harris on January 14, days before Trump assumed power, emphasising Trump has a personal approach to foreign policy, and “doesn’t like Biden”.\nMarcos Jnr’s office did not release a statement about the January 13 Zoom meeting with Biden and Ishiba, but the White House said they discussed “trilateral maritime security and economic cooperation”, highlighting China’s “dangerous and unlawful behaviour” in the South China Sea. The White House handout said Biden called for a partnership “built to last”.\nHowever, Bello said the incoming US president is “unpredictable” and “nothing constrained Trump to respect the partnership” established by Biden with Tokyo and Manila.","summary":"Trump’s Indo-Pacific strategy in doubt after president-elect personally invited Chinese President Xi Jinping.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3295106/did-trump-snub-philippines-marcos-jnr-not-inviting-him-his-inauguration","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/17/ff68951e-7889-4497-8553-67a420b1cdb3_52f10b68.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:11:39","author":"Raissa Robles","authors":["Raissa Robles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.024},{"id":280963558,"title":"Could Elon Musk lead to more challenges for India?","text":"President-elect Donald Trump is less than a week away from being sworn in and has promised a flurry of activity from day one.\n\nA key policy — one that worries global investors, yet is also seen as beneficial to India — has been Trump’s promise of stinging tariffs on all imports from China.\n\nEconomists expect India will benefit from a U.S.-China trade spat as American firms will attempt to diversify their supply chains.\n\n“There are several ways in which this could all play out, but it is possible that India and Indonesia prove to be the biggest and most immediate winners from Trump’s tariffs – they do not appear to be in Trump’s crosshairs, have fairly low geopolitical risks, and have large and rapidly growing domestic markets,” said Shilan Shah and Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics.\n\nHowever, many analysts also forecast that U.S. manufacturing is unlikely to be revived due to tariffs alone. Instead, import taxes are likely to lead to a spike in inflation without economic growth – one that Trump will want to avoid.\n\n“Trump has witnessed how corrosive inflation was to the Biden administration’s electoral support, and he’ll need a disinflationary offset to the inflation that may come from tariffs and immigration restrictions,” said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie.\n\nRecent whispers from Washington suggest that tariffs are unlikely to be broad. Scott Bessent, hedge fund billionaire and Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary is also expected to spell out his vision for U.S. trade policy today during his Senate confirmation hearing that reinforces the idea of targeted duties.\n\nYet, it’s another billionaire – Elon Musk – who is likely to have an outsized influence on America’s trade policy with China, which could be detrimental to India’s economic growth.\n\nMusk, as the head of Tesla, has enormous economic exposure to China through the automaker and will want trade policy between the two superpowers to be settled as soon as possible rather than let tensions rise.\n\nThere’s also the possibility that the Chinese government sees Musk as an operator who could help ease tensions between Beijing and Washington. China is now reportedly considering a plan that would have Musk, who also owns social media platform X, acquire TikTok’s U.S. operations to keep the app from being effectively banned. TikTok has denied the reports and says it will not sell its U.S. operation.\n\nWhile Musk isn’t alone in having business interests in China, he is among the future president’s inner circle of close advisors and could potentially play a crucial role in a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\n“It would undoubtedly be a negative outcome for India should the U.S. broker a deal with China,” said Gaurav Narain, portfolio manager at the London-listed India Capital Growth Fund. “Companies are clearly exploring alternatives to China, which presents a significant opportunity for India.”\n\n“However, should a deal be brokered, the urgency to find an alternative would disappear as China remains more cost-competitive and boasts a full supply chain,” Narain added.\n\nThe Tesla chief has also been previously public about his gripe with India’s “highest in the world by far” tariffs on auto imports. Far from being supportive of India, Musk, now having Trump’s ear, could reignite trade tensions between India and the U.S. over India’s import duties.\n\nIn an attempt to woo Musk and also to partly deflect attention away from its own tariff policy, the Indian government temporarily lowered import duties for electric vehicles to 15% in 2024, after maintaining them at 100% over multiple decades.\n\nHowever, economists suggest that Trump has surrounded himself with enough China hawks that even when a trade deal is struck, it will only lead to businesses delaying their transition out of China, rather than stopping it entirely.\n\n“I think it just may be that the case of that investment coming [into India] slows because companies look at it and think, ‘Oh, we’ve got another four years’,” said Michael Langham, India economist at asset manager abrdn. “I don’t see companies thinking so short term as to not plan ahead for what is a longer-term trend, and that being the diversification of supply chains.”\n\nOthers also suggest that aside from trade tariffs imposed by Trump during his first administration, the Covid-19 pandemic has also contributed to the corporate strategy of moving away from China.\n\n“I think the reasons why companies are relocating their supply chain are much deeper and, therefore are likely to continue,” Sonal Varma, India chief economist for Nomura told CNBC in an interview late December. “The trade imbalance between the U.S. and China, I think is a small part of, actually what is a bigger issue,” Verma added.\n\nThere’s also evidence that Musk hasn’t always gotten his way with Trump either.\n\nThe Tesla chief backed Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, as a pick for Treasury Secretary. Yet Trump instead chose billionaire hedge fund manager Bessent to lead the finance department of the U.S. government.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets with Elon Musk in the U.S.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Could Elon Musk lead to more challenges for India? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/asia/could-elon-musk-lead-to-more-challenges-for-india/","image":"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:10:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":280959006,"title":"Mel Gibson reveals his 'surprise' as Donald Trump names three actors as White House envoys","text":"Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight have been announced as special envoys to the White House, acting as ambassadors for Hollywood.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump revealed their new positions, which have been created for this administration, on his own social media website Truth Social, sharing that he hoped they would help to bring the \"great but very troubled\" Hollywood back \"stronger than ever\".\n\n\"It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!\"\n\n\"I got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised,\" Mel said in a statement to HELLO! \n\n\"Nevertheless, I heed the call.

Thank you all.'\n\nScanlan - who used to swim at the University of Pennsylvania alongside Thomas - has become an activist for the Independent Women's Forum which seeks to ban transgender women from girls' sports. \n\nWhile testifying before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government in June, Scanlan put forward the issue of transgender athletes competing in women's sports.\n\nShe urged lawmakers to put women's physical safety first when making decisions about women-only spaces like locker rooms - having previously confessed to having 'nightmares for weeks' after sharing a changing room with trans-athletes.\n\nHaving reportedly been a victim of sexual assault in a bathroom as a 16-year-old, Scanlan shared that Thomas' presence brought up previous trauma from her adolescence.\n\nEarlier this week, Lara Trump insisted her father-in-law, President-Elect Donald Trump, is a 'champion of women' and said she wouldn't be where she is today without him. \n\nLara, 42, is gearing up to stand alongside Trump at his second inauguration later this month, but she's not done working in her role of championing Trump to all Americans, including female voters. \n\n'This is a man who cares about women,' Lara, who is married to Trump's son Eric, reassured the New York Post. \n\n'And I tell you that as a woman who came into this family … from a background where I had no ability to relate to the Trump family — meaning a business family whose name people knew around the world.\n\n'Donald Trump helped me get to where I am today. And he’s a constant champion for women with whom he surrounds himself.' \n\nTo further her point, she praised on how Trump has plenty of 'great examples of strong women' around him, including his incoming Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, cabinet picks Kristi Noem and Linda McMahon, and Attorney Alina Habba. \n\n'I think that’s what people who get to know Donald Trump appreciates [how] he doesn’t care what you look like, he doesn’t care about your religion, he doesn’t care about your gender, he doesn’t care who you love,' she told The Post. \n\n'He cares about whether or not you are going to be able to perform a job to your best ability. It’s something I appreciate as a woman because I never want someone to give me a job because of my gender.' \n\nDuring early voting, plenty of women pulled up to the polls and voted against the then-Republican nominee, causing tensions in the Trump camp. \n\nSince 2016, Trump has widened his lead with men, but has failed to equally gain women voters. \n\nDays before the November election, he had a 22-point lead among male voters over Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nHowever, Harris, who lost the popular vote by 2.2 million, had a 14-point lead with women voters ahead of the 2024 race, a DailyMail.com/JL Partners poll showed. \n\nHarris had even attacked Trump on his views on women during a stop in Phoenix, Arizona, on her campaign trail, telling the crowd: 'He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. But we [at Harris-Walz] trust women.' \n\nTrump had leaned into the divide, focusing his attention on podcasts with overwhelmingly male audiences, including ones his son Barron suggested. \n\nDespite Harris' lost, Lara believes she will see a woman president in her lifetime, but doesn't want her to be elected simply based on her gender - a problem she believes derailed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. \n\n'Hillary Clinton tried to tell everyone that they should vote for her because she was a woman: \"Don’t you want to see a woman as president?\"' she said.\n\n'There are a lot of women I can think of right now who I would consider voting for for president. But the second you break it down and use that as the reason people should vote for you, I think you lose a lot of people.' \n\n'I actually believe our first female president will be a Republican,' Lara, who recently rejected going for a seat in the Senate, said.","summary":"Activist Paula Scanlan riled up social media after posting about how she was 'waiting to lose all my rights' under Donald Trump .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14294239/woman-rights-donald-trump-office-truth-post-paula-scanlan.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/17/00/94190479-0-image-m-20_1737072466080.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:08:38","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

A coveted position.\n\nMembers of the Regional Independents Group. L to R Kevin 'Boxer' Moran TD Noel Grealish TD Gillian Toole TD Michael Lowry TD Marian Harkin TD Barry Heneghan TD Sean Canney TDRollingNews.ie\n\nRollingNews.ie\n\nHe will have the ear of the two most powerful figures in the State and will be in a position to directly influence government policy in a way other TDs could only dream of. \n\nSo who is Seán Canney, the man who is – to shoehorn a Hamilton reference in here – now in the room where it happens? \n\nPolitical career\n\nCanney’s time in national politics has largely been without controversy.\n\nHe was first elected to the Dáil in 2016 and has been an Independent for his entire political career.\n\nCanney describes his vision for Ireland as one where “our children and grandchildren can build a decent life for themselves, where all people are treated equally and where our society looks after the most vulnerable”.\n\nOn his website, he states that this can be done through policies that empower people and communities.\n\nCanney, who has campaigned to abolish the means test on the carers’ allowance, has been described as a “champion” for carers’ rights throughout his time as a TD.\n\nThis was the phrase used by Family Carers Ireland’s spokesperson, Catherine Cox when speaking about Canney yesterday on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. \n\nIn recent Dáil contributions, he has spoken about harsher sentencing for those that commit sexual offences, telling the Dáil last year:\n\n“We need to consider how that is treated and how the people who perpetrate these crimes, who are a danger to society, can reoffend, get bail and be out in society.” \n\nDuring a motion on gender-based violence, Canney called for a cross-Oireachtas committee to be established on the issue, which he said should be chaired by the justice minister.\n\nSuch a committee could bring about change, “not just on a tokenistic basis, but on a basis that we might deliver effective measures that will stand up with the bravery women have shown and have continued to speak about”, he said. \n\nOn other issues, Canney was opposed to repealing the eighth amendment and has spoken at anti-abortion events in recent years.\n\nIn 2021, he co-sponsored a bill to provide for pain relief for the foetus in certain cases of termination of pregnancy. The bill was defeated by a Dáil vote.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Canney co-sponsored a bill with TDs Catherine Connolly and Peadar Toíbín that sought a public inquiry into the management of nursing homes during the crisis.\n\nIn 2023, the Galway East TD co-sponsored a bill that sought to amend the Gender Recognition Act 2015 to make provisions for single-sex accommodation in prisons. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore becoming a TD, Canney unsuccessfully ran for a Dáil seat in 2011 and sat on Galway County Council for a decade from 2004 to 2014. \n\nHe was also mayor of County Galway in 2007 to 2008.\n\nFlash forward to his entry into the national arena and Canney found himself immediately in the fold of power. \n\nThis current round of government formation talks was not his first rodeo, with Canney participating in the same discussions in 2016 as a member of the Independent Alliance. \n\nBudget Day 2018. Members of the Independence Alliance (L to R) Minister of State for Disability Finian McGrath, Sean Canney TD, Minister for Transport Shane Ross, John Halligan TD and Kevin Boxer Moran TDRollingNews.ie\n\nRollingNews.ie\n\nThat time around, formation talks lasted 70 days and culminated in the Independent Alliance going into government with Enda Kenny’s Fine Gael. \n\nAs part of the deal, the Independent Alliance was given the role of minister of state for the OPW and flood relief and it was agreed that it would alternate between Canney and Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran (who is also a member of the Regional Independents Group this time around).\n\nCanney took up the post first – it is understood this decision was made via a literal coin flip. \n\nThe handover was done one year later and by all accounts was a cordial affair, at the time Moran told The Journal that the torch was passed at an event in his local pub in Athlone. \n\nThings, however, did not stay cordial for long. Somewhat unbelievably there was confusion over who would hold the position for the third year. \n\nCanney was of the understanding that the position would rotate again, but the rest of the Independent Alliance decided that Moran would stay in the role for the remainder of the government’s term. \n\nQueue huge row. \n\nThe group called on Canney to clarify his position, giving him a deadline to make his position known.\n\nSeán Canney and Kevin 'Boxer' Moran in 2016RollingNews.ie\n\nRollingNews.ie\n\nHis position was clear: he was out. Canney announced he was leaving the Independent Alliance in May 2018 but would still support the government on issues of confidence and budgetary matters. \n\nFlash forward a few months, to October 2018, and Canney was back in a junior ministerial position having been appointed a minister of state in the Department of Rural and Community Development by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.\n\nThere he was responsible for Community Development, Natural Resources and Digital Development. He remained in that role until the formation of a new government in June 2020.\n\nWhile in government, Canney pushed to scrap mandatory retirement policies.\n\nIn this recent election, the issues he identified as important were: farming, housing, health care, carers, infrastructure, public transport and disability matters.\n\nSpeaking on Newstalk Breakfast last month, Canney identified housing as a particular concern of his. \n\nHe rejected the notion that Independents deal solely in “parish pump politics” but did mention local issues like traffic congestion in Galway and the lack of public transport in the county. He has been an advocate for the delivery of the Western Rail Corridor. \n\nHe has been outspoken about his view that the issues facing his constituents in Galway East are replicated across the country. \n\n“Just because I am an Independent TD it doesn’t mean I am parochial.\n\n“The national interest serves the local interest as well,” he told Primetime this week. \n\nOutside of politics\n\nBrought up on a family farm in Belcare, Tuam, Canney is married and is the father of three children, Kenneth, Shane and the late David. \n\nBefore entering national politics, Canney was a quantity surveyor and lectured in that and construction economics at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. \n\nOutside of work, he is involved in Gaelic football and is a member of Corofin GAA where he served as its assistant secretary for a number of years.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nJane Matthews\n\nView 3 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Who is Independent TD Seán Canney, the new man in the room where it happens? ”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Who is Independent TD Seán Canney, the new man in the room where it happens? ”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. LaBolt got a leg in the door when he interned for Schakowsky after his freshman year at Middlebury College. He remembered that in our first encounter, we were outside the Capitol at an event with Illinois members and he handed me a press release — and I told him I was not going to use it.\n\nAs a kid he took classes at The Players Workshop (originally The Players Workshop of The Second City) and did some improv in college. That training, LaBolt said “helps in every job…because it’s about preparing for the unexpected and rolling with it.”\n\n LaBolt got that unexpected early morning call on New Year’s Day after a man in New Orleans drove his pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people. LaBolt immediately started working on the White House response. Then came the Los Angeles wild fires, scrambling the plans for Biden’s final weeks in office, packed with legacy speeches and what would have Biden’s the last foreign trip, to Rome to see Pope Francis at the Vatican, canceled because of the blazes. And hours before Biden’s farewell address on Wednesday night, the president was addressing the nation to announce the Hamas-Israel ceasefire/hostage release deal. \n\nSaid LaBolt, “You really have to be ready for anything to happen any day, no matter what your proactive plan.”\n\nThe following are edited excerpts from our conversation:\n\nCompare, contrast the communication styles of Biden, Obama and Emanuel: \n\n“With Obama, I would say narrative and personal. With Rahm, I would say staccato and short lists, everything being a list of three.” Biden is “rooted in his personal and family narrative... he doesn’t stick to the script. He likes to tell stories.”\n\nOn the challenge of getting the Biden’s positive economic message out:\n\n“Information consumption has changed. It’s really diffuse. We know that, for example, the 20 million Americans that watch the network evening news every night, who tend to be 65 and older, were very aware of everything that the president did and accomplished and very supportive of the president.\n\n“But there’s more than 300 million Americans, and so you have to go everywhere to get your message out. The president did. He did lots of podcasts and lots of engagements with digital creators and influencers. We hosted them here at the White House, but the average interview just isn’t seen or consumed by that many people.\n\n“And so that’s an increasing challenge of these jobs. He went out there, traveled states across the country to talk about, all the significant achievements in terms of allowing Medicare to negotiate down the cost of prescription drugs and cap the annual out of pocket on prescription drugs to $2,000 a year, and bring home industries that were thriving overseas, such as clean energy and semiconductors. And to revive manufacturing and reverse the trend where manufacturing was going offshore. He communicated about those things pretty much every single day.”\n\n “What he said is that he took on long term challenges and many of those things, those factories will be built, infrastructure will be rebuilt over the course of years. It’s not immediate. So I think people will really see the dividends of this administration for decades to come. But you know that was those are not things that are felt immediately, because they take time to implement.” \n\nBiden’s messaging on multiple platforms: \n\n“ The job of communications director is really to direct the orchestra, and it’s got to rely on all sorts of different platforms and means of communicating. You’ve got to produce and put out your own, your own content and videos. \n\n“You’ve got to put the president out and on television. You’ve got to put him out on radio and on streaming audio. You’ve got to have him engage with YouTube shows and creators and influencers. You know, he still does print. He still does, a number of the legacy media outlets, but you’ve got to flood the zone, and you have to do it that keeps in mind the diverse ways in which people across the country receive their information.” \n\nThings that stand out: \n\n“There were all sorts of things that I was a part of in this job that stand out. Some of it was just, fun, light engagements and appearances that went a long way, like the president’s appearance on Seth Meyers’ earlier this year.\n\n“Some of it was historic, like being able to go to the 80th anniversary of D-Day this year, which may be one of the last times that the veterans who served there could participate. And helping to structure the events and interviews around that, as the president went and visited the American cemetery and ceremonies there. \n\n“Some of it was making sure that we had effective crisis response, whether it was hurricanes or fires or terrorist attacks, that the team was always ready to go and was always ready to communicate the round the clock effort that the president and the Homeland Security team was leading to respond to events in real time and make sure people knew the government was working for them.”\n\n “So there’s, there are a number of things that will stand out….working for a president who has been doing this for a long time, who’s got a close relationship with so many leaders on the Hill and in foreign capitals around the world, and learning from him was a real privilege as well.” \n\nWhat’s next: \n\nLaBolt was a partner at Bully Pulpit International and living in San Francisco when he joined the Biden administration. His dad lives in Edgewater on Chicago’s North Side with a brother in LaGrange. Said LaBolt, “I’m still figuring out next steps.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2025/01/16/white-house-communications-chief-ben-labolt-lagrange-biden","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05b30e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x856+0+72/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3c%2F75%2F2885e96947469255f9f91f8d207d%2Fimg-13","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:01:08","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.135},{"id":280961162,"title":"Lammy and Nandy launch ‘soft power council’ to boost UK on global stage","text":"Leading figures across the arts, culture and sport will be brought together as part of a new “soft power council” aimed at transforming Britain’s role on the global stage.\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy and Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy will jointly chair the group which the Government says is designed to drive growth and security by making the most of the country’s cultural exports.\n\nIt is understood the council will seek to work alongside institutions like the royal family, one of Britain’s biggest soft power assets of which US President-elect Donald Trump is a known admirer, to boost influence internationally.\n\nThe Foreign Office said the body would bring together “experts from across culture, sport, the creative industries and geopolitics”.\n\nIt will seek ways for these sectors to work closer with Government to help revive the economy and improve security, for example through Government campaigns and a systematic approach to cultural and sporting calendars.\n\nMr Lammy said: “Soft power is fundamental to the UK’s impact and reputation around the world. I am often struck by the enormous love and respect which our music, sport, education and institutions generate on every continent.\n\n“But we have not taken a sufficiently strategic approach to these huge assets as a country.

Any effort to bring Alberta into a Team Canada approach would have to take these factors into account. \n\nCanada’s top export to the United States is energy products, mostly oil and gas. Almost all of the crude oil that Canada exports goes to the U.S., and most of it comes from Alberta. Alberta exports about 80 per cent of the crude oil it produces.\n\nAlthough it’s not Canada’s largest province, Alberta is Canada’s largest exporter to the U.S. That means the province’s economy is more exposed to the Trump’s tariff threats than any other province. \n\nCrude oil exports to the U.S. are important both to the Albertan economy and to the provincial government’s finances. In 2024-25, royalties from bitumen are projected to be worth $15.6 billion to the Alberta government. Put another way, 20 per cent of the revenues the Alberta government expects to take in this fiscal year are from this source. This does not take into account revenue from corporate and income tax from the industry. \n\nInternal politics\n\nAlberta has a long history of ties to the U.S. Historian Nelson Wiseman has argued that American settlers who came to Alberta early in the 20th century shaped the province’s political culture along the lines of America’s rugged individualism. The rise of the oil industry created new ties between Alberta and Texas. \n\nPrior to the 2024 election, Albertans were more likely than other Canadians to say that they would vote for Trump if they could vote in the American election. According to a Leger survey, 29 per cent of Albertans would have voted for Trump as compared to 21 per cent of Canadians.\n\nRecent polling data from the Angus Reid Institute shows that the vast majority of Albertans (82 per cent) reject the idea of becoming the 51st state. Although this is a large majority, it is smaller than in the rest of the country at 90 per cent.\n\n Read more:\n Requiem for Canada? Regional tensions, changing demographics may fuel Trump's annexation hopes\n\nThis means the number of voters who would view Smith’s visit to Mar-a-Lago positively is higher in Alberta than in other provinces. Given Smith’s populist orientation, it is reasonable to think her core supporters would be inclined to view the visit favourably. \n\nBeefs with Ottawa\n\nThere is a long history of regional alienation in Alberta, dating back to 1905 when it became a province. Control over natural resources has been a persistent conflict between Alberta and Ottawa. These conflicts heightened in the early 1980s over the National Energy Program. \n\nSince the election of Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government in 2015, there has been significant conflict over the province’s ability to build pipelines, the carbon tax and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n Read more:\n Why Alberta would be foolish to abandon carbon policy\n\nSmith ran for her party’s leadership in 2022 on a platform of passing a Sovereignty Act to empower the province to refrain from enforcing federal laws. The legislation she eventually passed could not accomplish this within the rule of law, but did set out a framework for conflicts with Ottawa. \n\nThe day after announcing that she would not sign on to the Team Canada approach, Smith released a social media statement that revisited several long-standing grievances with the federal government, including failure to ensure pipelines were built, efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and to treat Alberta taxpayers with respect when they contributed to equalization. \n\nIs there common ground?\n\nHaving the largest exporting province outside the Team Canada approach against Trump doesn’t position the country well to negotiate with a second Trump administration. \n\nPublic disputes over whether Canada would limit exports to the U.S. have revealed at least part of Canada’s negotiating position. \n\nCould Alberta be brought into the fold? The decades-long animosity between Alberta and the federal government makes it difficult to imagine. When a new prime minister tackles these challenges, it will be essential to take into account the economic and political circumstances that have brought Canada to this point.\n\nLisa Young does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.","summary":"The largest exporting province rejecting a ‘Team Canada’ approach against Donald Trump doesn’t position the country well to negotiate with a second Trump administration.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/why-alberta-s-danielle-smith-is-rejecting-the-team-canada-approach-to-trump-s-tariff-threats-292080.html","image":"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/247421/count.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:00:08","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.084},{"id":280957946,"title":"Sun to set on B.C.’s economic outperformance among provinces","text":"When B.C. Premier David Eby campaigned in the lead-up to the province's October election, he touted how well B.C.’s economy was performing compared with peers.\n\nThat outperformance could be about to change.\n\nBC Stats data shows B.C.’s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.4 per cent in 2023—faster than any other province.\n\nData for 2024 is not yet available but economists say a period of underperformance is likely to start in 2025.\n\nCentral 1 Credit Union chief economist Bryan Yu told BIV that B.C.’s economic outperformance is threatened by workers having completed large capital projects.\n\n“Our GDP is about 11 per cent higher than pre-pandemic and the number for Canada as a whole is about six per cent,” he said to underscore how well the province has done, compared with counterparts across the country.\n\nHe listed the Site C Dam and LNG Canada’s project in Kitimat as two mega-projects that have created substantial employment and productivity in recent years.\n\nThose initiatives are now largely complete.\n\nThe good news is that the projects will generate a bump in exports, and that will help B.C.’s economy, but that stimulus is not likely to equal the economic stimulus that the projects created when they were being built, he said.\n\nYu does not see any projects on the horizon that are large enough able to pick up the slack, although there will be capital spending on hospitals, SkyTrain extensions and other capital-works projects, he said.\n\nThe province needs those projects to keep its labour market steady.\n\nB.C.’s unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage points to 5.7 per cent in November, compared to the same month a year earlier. It then rose again to six per cent in December. Good news is that this is below the Canadian average of 6.7 per cent in December but the national unemployment rate is trending in the other direction. It declined by 0.1 percentage points, compared with the month before.. \n\nPrivate-sector job growth is a particular concern.\n\n“The public sector continued to expand,” Yu said.\n\n“Weakness in the labour market has been a private-sector-oriented story.”\n\nHe said he expects B.C.’s economy to expand by close to 2.5 per cent in each of 2025 and 2026, following what he estimated was more tepid GDP growth of 1.5 per cent in 2024.\n\n“The labour market is forecast to generate employment growth of 1.5 to two per cent, with an unemployment rate below six per cent,” he said.\n\n“However, risk remains to the downside, given the unknowns of U.S. trade policy,” he said, referring to U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump’s threats to invoke tariffs on Canadian imports.\n\nThat could spark retaliatory tariffs against such products as orange juice, sinks, toilets, steel and other products. \n\nJohn Anderson, CEO of Coquitlam-based Oppenheimer Group told BIV that were Canada to levy a 25-per-cent tariff on all American fruits and vegetables, the net impact on Canadian consumer prices would be much less than 25 per cent.\n\nNonetheless, Trump shows no sign of letting up on his taunts that Canada would make a great 51st state.\n\nWhen he was asked at a Jan. 7 press conference if he would use military force to annex Canada, he answered “No, economic force, because Canada and the U.S., that would really be something.”\n\nTrump has complained that his country is “subsidizing” Canada various amounts per year—sometimes by US$100 billion, other times by US$200 billion —due to Americans buying more Canadian products than vice-versa.\n\nIt is unclear what all he is including in those calculations. \n\nU.S. government data shows the U.S. ran a US$64.3 billion trade deficit with Canada in 2023. In the first 11 months of 2024, its trade deficit with Canada was almost US$55 billion.\n\nThis is not the U.S. government paying that money to Canada, however. It is U.S. importers and residents freely choosing to buy Canadian goods.\n\nRegardless, that trade-balance disparity may be enough to aggravate a tariff-related trade war.\n\n“This is not the talk of a friend and economic partner,” Yu said in a LinkedIn post. “If this is the next four years, Canada needs to diversify our energy and resource exports markets across the Atlantic and Pacific, increase internal trade and loosen barriers, increase skilled immigration and bulk up our military.”\n\nTapped-out consumer could hit B.C. economy\n\nB.C.’s economy could face another hit as consumers pull back on spending.\n\nData indicates that B.C. consumers are reining in their spending more than counterparts across the country.\n\nRetail spending in the province dipped by about 0.5 per cent in 2024, compared with 2023, with real per-capita spending down closer to 3.5 per cent, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nThat is weaker than most provincial peers, Yu said.\n\nThe country’s number cruncher found that, in December, B.C. restaurant revenue was growing at a far slower rate than in other large provinces. The province’s 2.67-per-cent growth was better than only Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island.\n\nGiven that this growth rate in dollars spent at restaurants was around the same as the rate of inflation during the year, there was little or no growth in the number of customers, or items ordered.\n\nAnd consideration an increase in population, sales at restaurants were down on a per-capita basis.\n\nIndustry advocates, such as BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association CEO Ian Tostenson and restaurant owners such as Romers principal Kelly Gordon, told BIV that diners have learned to expect discounts.\n\nThe consumer mentality has shifted to be more focused on happy hours, they said.\n\nRestaurants often become nearly empty when happy hours end, Tostenson said.\n\nLackluster spending on alcohol and cannabis provides more evidence that B.C. consumers feel tapped out.\n\nLegal cannabis wholesales in B.C. in the quarter that ended in September increased by 7.4 per cent—the slowest rate seen in any of the 10 quarters for which the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch (BCLDB) has released data.\n\nAlcohol wholesales have seen absolute declines in each of the past four quarters, year-over-year, up to September, according to BCLDB data.\n\nYu said he expects consumer spending to pick up in 2025 in part because “wage growth is robust.”\n\nDIG360 principal David Ian Gray told BIV that consumers are more cost conscious than they were a year ago because of higher real price levels: The cumulative effects of years of higher-than-average inflation outpacing wage growth, even though that is starting to turn around.\n\nWhile some consumers may be flush with cash and eager to spend it on items like Taylor Swift concert tickets, most B.C. consumers are feeling the pinch, he said.\n\nThe shift in sentiment is seen through indicators such as the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’ (CFIB) business confidence surveys.\n\nThe CFIB in November found B.C. small business owners were the least confident among owners in Canada that their ventures will perform better three months into the future.\n\nThey were also the second-least confident, after only Newfoundland, that their businesses will perform better in 12 months.\n\nThose low confidence levels are particularly striking because B.C. small business owners historically tend to be more confident than counterparts in the rest of Canada, B.C.-based CFIB policy analyst Emily Boston told BIV.","summary":"Completion of economy-boosting mega-projects, shy consumer spending and potential U.S. tariffs are clouding the provincial forecast","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/economy-law-politics/sun-to-set-on-bcs-economic-outperformance-among-provinces-10082788","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/site-c-dam-submitted.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-17 00:00:00","author":"Glen Korstrom","authors":["Glen Korstrom"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":280959218,"title":"Tibetan refugees tell stories of loss, but also resilience and hope","text":"In 2008 I started working on a nonfiction book about Tibetan refugees I met in India, where I was a reporter for the Financial Times. In March 2008, when protests in Tibet turned violent, I was sent to cover a press conference that the Dalai Lama was giving in Dharamsala, the northern Indian town where he lives in exile. The Tibetan spiritual leader spoke about the turmoil in Tibet and pleaded for calm.\n\nDuring that first visit to Dharamsala, I was amazed by the Tibetans I met and the Himalayan hill town that had become their home. Some were forced to flee their homeland because of persecution. Others were born in India but had a strong sense of Tibetan identity while straddling the two cultures of their ancestral and adopted homes. The question of how identity forms completely intrigued me.\n\nIt took 14 years to get the book published. But when it was finally released in late 2023, issues about immigration and refugees were more timely and urgent than ever.\n\nThe book won the Chicago Writers Association’s Book of the Year prize for traditional nonfiction. I will touch on that relevance at an awards ceremony in Chicago on Jan. 18.\n\nAlthough Tibet and India are far from Chicago, themes of migration and living between worlds are universal. The challenges of adapting to new homes while retaining and reframing identity and culture are common to many Americans, even those who don’t know the experiences of past generations.\n\nIn recent years, the plight of migrants has been one of Chicago’s most pressing issues.\n\nMore than 51,000 asylum seekers and migrants, mostly from Venezuela, have arrived in Chicago since 2022. Some are now at risk of being deported, as President-elect Donald Trump has threatened.\n\nThe world is grappling with historic levels of migration. An estimated 122.6 million people worldwide were forced to flee their homes, said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That includes 43.7 million refugees.\n\nWar and instability have recently displaced millions in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, Congo, Myanmar and more countries. Since 2015, more than 7.7 million people have left Venezuela, according to the UN High Commissioner. About 6.5 million arrived mostly in South American countries such as Colombia, but thousands arrived in U.S. cities struggling to offer support.\n\nBringing Tibetan culture to new lands\n\nHow do people adjust — or not — as they forge new lives? It is difficult to get deeper insight into that, and refugees too often they are reduced to faceless statistics. In my book, I sought to humanize the experience of Tibetans. How did they decide to leave families they would never see again? How did they clandestinely walk for 27 days over icy mountains? How did they adjust to life in exile? What happened when their journeys unexpectedly continued beyond India? Three Tibetans I met in India got asylum in Australia and Belgium. One emigrated to the U.S., which made for a surprising final chapter. Similar questions can be asked of Chicago’s new arrivals.\n\nI wrote about how tens of thousands of Tibetans fled to India after 1959 when China took over their homeland. When they arrived, these refugees were destitute and traumatized. Scores died and suffered from disease, malnutrition and injuries from arduous journeys.\n\nFrom that calamitous start, Tibetan settlements were established across India over decades. And the diaspora has spread around the world. Life in exile is by no means perfect; problems and challenges persist. Yet it is remarkable how Tibetans have transplanted their culture to new lands, even while their home is under threat by China’s authoritarian government.\n\nAt the Tibetan Alliance of Chicago’s community center in Evanston, children learn Tibetan language, music and dance in a way that is not allowed in their homeland. Tibetans commune and celebrate festivals there.\n\nI got lost on my first trip to the community center, which is tucked behind an Afghan restaurant. But I realized I was in the right place when I spotted Tibetan men playing cricket — adopted from India — in a nearby park. Even in a Chicago suburb, Tibetan culture is alive in all its hybrid forms.\n\nSomeone once remarked that my book must be “depressing” since it’s about refugees. I was taken aback. While there is sadness and tragedy in the stories of many Tibetans, I was truly impressed by their resilience and spirit. I hope the book captures that.\n\nTheir stories are not depressing, but rather, inspiring and hopeful, in spite of hardship. That’s why I didn’t give up trying to publish the book. I strongly believed their stories should be shared with the world.\n\nThe Tibetan refugees I wrote about are ordinary people who don’t get the spotlight, yet they are extraordinary with remarkable stories. That is surely also the case for many refugees whose new lives in Chicago — and other adopted homes — are still in their first chapters.\n\nAmy Yee is a business and economy reporter for the Sun-Times.

How do you love your country and support and normalize somebody who’s a convicted felon and, in my opinion, wants to destroy the country?\"Underwood has yet to comment publicly on the backlash, but the debate left The View’s co-hosts sharply divided.

That’s another story.”Unmoved, Behar doubled down. “I’d never perform at Trump’s inauguration,” she declared, leaving no doubt about her stance.\n\nWith emotions running high, ABC is scrambling to keep the peace. “Carrie wants to stay focused on her music and her work,” adds the source. \n\n“She’s not interested in being dragged into political drama, and the network is doing everything they can to shield her from it.”But keeping The View’s strong personalities in check is no small feat. “These women are not used to being told what they can and can’t say,” the insider notes. “There’s definitely some resentment.”\n\nFor now, Carrie remains tight-lipped, while ABC works overtime to protect their new star.

Even as Israel’s cabinet delayed until Jan. 17 its vote to ratify the complex deal, Blinken said he is “very confident this is moving forward.” \n\nThe U.S., Qatar and Egypt helped broker the deal, which followed negotiations that had many starts and stops in 2024. Representatives of the Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump worked together to advance the agreement, and both leaders took credit for the expected return of an estimated 100 Israeli hostages – both living and dead – and a complete ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAmy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation, spoke with Gregory F. Treverton, who served as the chairperson of the U.S. National Intelligence Council during the Obama administration, to better understand what the United States’ role in this agreement says about American influence in the Middle East. \n\nWhat is unusual, if anything, about the role of the US in this deal?\n\nSo far, the U.S. has not had very much influence in attempts to end the conflict. One reason is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears allergic to taking advice from the U.S. What is striking now is that some combination of Donald Trump coming to power and Joe Biden leaving office has made a difference – and possibly made Netanyahu more willing to take political risks with his governing coalition and to sign on to the deal. \n\nIt is more or less the same kind of deal that the U.S. presented in May 2024. So, it is hard to know whether Trump moved the dial by his past threats to punish Hamas and by pressuring Netanyahu, or whether Hamas felt like it has been weakened and lacks outside support from weakened allies like Iran. Or a combination of these factors.\n\nWe also know that there are some last-minute hiccups with the deal, so it isn’t over yet. But there is real progress and hope, and that reflects a lot of the Biden administration’s hard work over the past 15 months. \n\nThe proposed deal has three phases that will last more than four months. Because it starts doesn’t mean it will get to the end. And the agreed end is very, very vague, with a revamped Palestinian Authority taking over Gaza – something Netanyahu has said he doesn’t want. \n\nThe deal has been brokered largely by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. There is not a serious international monitor of the deal beyond the political pressure of these countries. \n\nWhat do you make of Trump’s and Biden’s teams working together on this?\n\nIt is not unprecedented. Typically, during ordinary transitions between administrations, there is a lot of cooperation and working together. \n\nWhat is unusual is that you would perhaps not have expected this kind of collaboration, given the hostility between Trump and Biden and their teams. Biden has said that his administration and the Trump team have been “speaking as one team.” In that sense, it is a bright spot in U.S. politics as of late and returns to a more normal pattern in U.S. foreign policy where there has been cooperation between outgoing and incoming administrations. \n\nIt is unusual that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s designated Middle East special envoy, went on his own to meet with Netanyahu in January and reportedly influenced Netanyahu’s decision to accept a deal that he previously rejected. Many special envoys require confirmation by the Senate, though they can hold the post temporarily without it. They also need security clearances, so that limits some of the things they can do. \n\nWhat else is notable about the US role in the deal?\n\nIt is striking that for all his efforts, Biden seemed to have so little influence on Netanyahu. This has been very difficult for Biden politically. He wanted to get a ceasefire deal done, but he also wanted to stop the suffering in Gaza and didn’t want to look like he was giving Israel a blank check to do whatever it wanted. \n\nIn the process, the U.S. has been labeled as partially responsible for the tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths, which some people would call a genocide. This has done a lot of damage to the United States’ global reputation, and that will take some time to repair. \n\nTrump is entirely unpredictable. He may continue to pressure Netanyahu or he may decide that Netanyahu can do whatever he wants. \n\nWhat does this deal tell us about the standing of the US in the Middle East?\n\nIn some ways, I think it shows the United States’ diminished influence on the Middle East. On the other hand, the geopolitics of other regional conflicts and political changes, like the fall of the Assad government in Syria and the weakening of Hezbollah and Iran over the past year or so, have given certain opportunities to Israel, and therefore the U.S. This includes continuing the Abraham Accords, an agreement the Trump administration helped negotiate in 2020 to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. \n\nThe Saudis have been clear that they won’t make an agreement with Israel if there is not a state or something else designated for the Palestinians. It may turn out that this current deal, if implemented, offers enough for the Palestinians for the Saudis to also make an agreement with Israel.","summary":"Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are taking credit for the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven as the ban approached, the company continued to pitch advertisers on new features, like a tool launching in test form on Thursday that would make it easier to create, modify and add advertisements in bulk, according to an email from this week described to Reuters.\n\nIt also planned to host a booth at the upcoming World Economic Forum meeting of political and business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, next week, after holding cocktail parties at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month.\n\nMeanwhile, brands and content creators alike were downloading their data en masse in case the app becomes inaccessible as of Sunday, hoping to salvage at least some of the fruits of their labor.\n\nOne influencer, who hawks cereal and beauty products in her videos, posted on Tuesday advising her nearly 16,000 followers on how to save their videos.\n\n“Here’s how to download your TikTok data so you don’t lose literally everything you’ve had from the past five years,” said Maria Slate, grimacing, as the words “it’s fine I’m fine” displayed over her head.\n\nThe sentiment was a marked change from the dominant mood last month, when advertisers told Reuters they were in no rush to shift their marketing budgets off TikTok despite a U.S. appeals court upholding the law requiring a divestment or ban.\n\nAs of Jan. 8, ad spending on TikTok was set to increase 57 per cent in the first two months of 2025, according to Guideline.ai, a research firm that tracks forward booking data from major ad agencies.\n\nTikTok has become a powerful tool for advertisers looking to reach young Americans in particular in recent years, growing to 20 per cent of U.S. social media ad spending from only 2 per cent in 2020, its first full year of operation in the United States, Guideline.ai said.\n\nPart of that power has come from the platform's cultivation of influencers and online shopping culture, which has made it a reliable driver of e-commerce sales.\n\nE-Marketer, another research firm, forecast late last year that some 43.8 per cent of U.S. TikTok users would have made a purchase on the platform by the end of 2024, a higher share than on Meta-owned services Facebook and Instagram.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/advertisers-hair-fire-brace-us-tiktok-ban-4864346","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--XxBHkBtx--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-01-16t234449z_1_lynxmpel0f11f_rtroptp_3_usa-china-tiktok.jpg?itok=v","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 23:44:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":280967660,"title":"A judge in Texas rules 3 other states can challenge access to abortion pill mifepristone nationwide - The Associated Press","text":"A judge in Texas ruled Thursday that three other states can move ahead with their effort to roll back federal rules and make it harder for people across the U.S. to access the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nThe states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri made the request in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. The only judge based there is Matthew Kacsmaryk, a nominee of former President Donald Trump who previously ruled in favor of a challenge to the pill’s approval.\n\nThe states want the federal Food and Drug Administration to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone and require that it be used only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy instead of the current limit of 10 weeks. They also want to require three in-person doctor office visits instead of none to get the drug.\n\nThat’s because, the states argue, efforts to provide access to the pills “undermine state abortion laws and frustrate state law enforcement,” according to court documents.\n\nMeanwhile, Kacsmaryk said they shouldn’t be automatically discounted from suing in Texas just because they’re outside the state. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that the case should have been settled when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously preserved access to mifepristone last year, where the justices issued a narrow ruling finding that abortion opponents who first filed the case lacked the legal right to sue. \n\nKacsmaryk’s decision “has left the door open for extremist politicians to continue attacking medication abortion in his courtroom,” the ACLU said. \n\nThe ruling comes days before Trump begins his second term as president, so his administration will likely be representing the FDA in the case. Trump has repeatedly said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government, though he’s also stressed on the campaign trail that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion in 2022.\n\nIn the years since, abortion opponents have increasingly targeted abortion pills, largely due to most U.S. abortions being carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures. So far, at least four states — Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee — have seen Republicans introduce bills aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.\n\nPreviously, Kacsmaryk sided with a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations that wanted the FDA to be forced to rescind entirely its approval of mifepristone in 2000. \n\nYet the states are pursuing a narrower challenge. Rather than target the approval entirely, they sought to undo a series of FDA updates that have eased access.\n\nBut while the states’ leaders are pushing to severely limit access to the drugs, voters in Missouri sent a different message in November when they approved a ballot measure to undo one of the nation’s strictest bans. In Idaho, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy. In Kansas, abortion is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy.\n\nAcross the U.S., 13 states under Republican legislative control bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four more ban it after the first six weeks — before women often know they’re pregnant.\n\nSome Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws seeking to shield from investigations and prosecutions the doctors who prescribe the pills via telehealth appointments and mail them to patients in states with bans. Those prescriptions are a major reason a study found that residents of states with bans are getting abortions in about the same numbers as they were before the bans were in place.\n\nMifepristone is usually used in combination with a second drug for medication abortion, which has accounted for more than three-fifths of all abortions in the U.S. since the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. \n\nThe drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they’re pregnant. Studies have found they’re generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.\n\nWhitehurst reported from Washington.

I spent hours poring over the tapes to identify the smallest weaknesses in my game and determine what I could do to improve,” Turner told members of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee at his confirmation hearing.\n\nImproving the department by making it more efficient and maximizing the efficient use of its resources was a refrain Turner returned to throughout the hearing. \n\nThe panel’s chairman, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., opened the proceedings by noting that housing “isn’t just about shelter.”\n\n“Housing is about opportunity, and it is about stability. Housing creates the foundation for achieving the American dream.” But he noted that the data is clear: “The American dream of homeownership is slipping further and further away.” \n\nThe South Carolina senator noted that Turner had been the executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during President Donald Trump’s first term. In that position, Turner assisted with the Opportunity Zones initiative, which Scott had authored. The program, enacted through Trump’s tax cuts legislation, directed private investment into devastated communities with federal tax incentives. \n\nIn his opening statement at the hearing, Turner discussed how he had worked as a dishwasher while in high school, and he noted his background as a child of divorce. He emphasized that the challenges HUD seeks to address were personal for him. \n\n“They’re not just things I hear about and read about. These are experiences that members of my family and I have seen and lived. And that perspective is something I can bring to the table,” Turner declared to the committee, clearly moved by his testimony. \n\nA topic of much discussion during the hearing was the housing crisis in the United States. The nominee highlighted how owning a home was key to building intergenerational wealth. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked Turner why he thought housing costs were so high, he cited a lack of supply of homes. “We need about 7 million new housing units in America,” he said. \n\nTurner committed to making the most of HUD’s budget. \n\nIn one of the most moving parts of the hearing, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., recalled growing up in a trailer park. He said that being the head of a federal department requires intercepting bad ideas. \n\n“One bad idea is just throwing money after something without trying to figure out how to fix the plumbing in HUD,” Tillis said. He asked if he could get Turner’s commitment to do an audit of HUD, which Turner agreed to. \n\nFreshman Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, noted that as many as 12 million illegal immigrants have entered the country since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021 and asked how illegal migration affected the housing crisis. Turner referenced a HUD report that illegal migration had contributed significantly to housing supply-and-demand issues. “It’s a huge burden,” he said. \n\nTurner said localities are best equipped to address the housing problems they face. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., mused about a potential congressional plan to incentivize localities and state governments to build more housing. Turner responded by noting that “incentives do a lot” and that “competition always brings out the best.” \n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., asked about how tariffs on imported lumber might affect housing construction. Turner demurred from criticizing the tariffs placed on softwood by either the Trump or Biden administrations, pointing out that imposing or not imposing tariffs was the responsibility of the president and Congress. \n\nSen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., asked about the Biden administration’s emphasis on “equity” at HUD. “Do you think HUD should be holding grant applicants hostage to a [diversity, equity and inclusion] agenda?” he asked. Turner replied that the government shouldn’t hold grant applicants “hostage to anything.” He agreed to looking into those Biden administration HUD regulations. \n\nAnother member of the committee, Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., told The Daily Signal in a statement that “Scott Turner is a strong pick for secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and I look forward to working with him. His experience working in the housing space is exactly what America needs right now. Our country is facing a serious affordable housing crisis. Inflation, high costs, and low inventory have put homeownership even further out of reach. \n\n“Exacerbating that crisis is the fact that 24% of the cost of building a new home is from government regulation. Whether it’s buying a home or succeeding in business, it is critical we ensure families across our nation can achieve their own personal American dream. Scott Turner is ready to be a part of that, and he will do a phenomenal job of instituting President Trump’s agenda,” Britt said.\n\nTurner’s hearing was much less contentious than those this week of some other Trump nominees selected to head federal departments. Some senators welcomed the nominee with a discussion of football, given his previous career.","summary":"Scott Turner, nominated to be secretary of Housing and Urban Development, on Thursday likened his proposed approach to leading the federal agency to his days...

Georgia presents Republicans with perhaps their best opportunity to flip a seat currently held by Democrats.A popular governor, Kemp is viewed as Republicans' strongest potential recruit for the race. Georgia is a key battleground that only narrowly backed President-elect Donald Trump last year, and it's likely to stay competitive in the foreseeable future.What To KnowThe WPA Intelligence/Club for Growth poll showed Kemp with a 6-point lead over Ossoff. However, the incumbent senator held a more significant lead over other potential rivals, Politico reported Thursday afternoon.Fourteen percent of voters were undecided, according to Politico. The poll surveyed 500 likely Senate voters conducted in mid-January. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.While the poll points to a close race, it's still early—there are nearly two years before the first votes will be cast in the midterms. Democrats are hopeful there will be a \"blue wave\" in 2026 if Trump's approval drops after the first few months of his presidency, as most presidents typically see a temporary honeymoon period after their election.Kemp distanced himself from Trump after 2020, when he was critical of the president-elect's alleged efforts at overturning Georgia's election results when Biden carried the state—though he did endorse Trump last year. Political experts point to his Trump criticism as helping bolster his popularity in a deeply divided state.He hasn't said whether he plans to run in the Senate race and has been floated as a possible 2028 presidential candidate.Other polls haven't been conducted on the race, but recent surveys suggest Kemp and Ossoff enjoy popularity among Georgia voters.A Quinnipiac poll from last year found 55 percent of Georgia voters approving of Kemp, while only 31 percent disapproved of his performance. Meanwhile, 47 percent said they approved of Ossoff, with 32 percent disapproving.Fourteen percent didn't say whether they approved of Kemp, while 22 percent didn't offer an opinion of Ossoff. That poll surveyed 1,203 Georgia voters from May 30 to June 3, 2024, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.Kemp was reelected in 2022, defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams by over seven points (53 percent to 46 percent). Ossoff, meanwhile, won his Senate election in 2020, unseating former GOP Senator David Perdue with just a 1.2-point margin of victory.How Red Was Georgia In 2024?Trump flipped Georgia back to Republicans in 2024, winning the Peach State by about two points (50.7 percent to 48.5 percent). Biden carried it four years earlier by less than half a percentage point (49.47 percent to 49.24 percent).While Georgia shifted back to Republicans, there were still some signs for Democrats to stay optimistic about the state in the future. In 2020, it voted about 4.3 points to the right of the country. Last year, it only voted 0.7 points to the right of the country overall.That change was primarily due to Atlanta's suburbs continuing to move leftward, defying national trends. Kemp's key to victory in 2026 will be to hold down solid margins in places like Cobb and Gwinnett counties, former Republican strongholds that have shifted to Democrats.Who Else May Run In Key Georgia Senate Race?The new poll found other Republicans would start off the campaign in a weaker position than Kemp.Ossoff led Representative Buddy Carter by 13 points, Representative Mike Collins by 10 points, Insurance Commissioner John King by 16 points, Representative Rich McCormick by 11 points and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger by 14 points.What People Are SayingRepublican consultant Brian Robinson to Atlanta news station WAGA in December when asked if Kemp could run for president: \"Absolutely, I think he certainly has built a profile that puts him in that conversation. His favorability ratings in a purple state are something that national onlookers and big donors are going to keep an eye on.\"Strategist Fred Hicks to The Hill: \"It's not clear what Georgia is right now other than a battleground state, an expensive battleground state, and one that will serve, I think, as a sort of an opening bell, if you will, for 2028.\"What Happens NextThe Georgia 2026 Senate election is set to be held on November 3, 2026. Potential candidates will likely start announcing their campaigns this year.","summary":"A new poll showed Kemp leading Ossoff in the key battleground state's 2026 Senate race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/brian-kemp-jon-ossoff-georgia-senate-poll-2016453","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2566784/brian-kemp-jon-ossoff-georgia-senate-poll.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 23:40:31","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":280957272,"title":"Trump and bitcoin: BlackRock predicts another historic year for crypto","text":"Bitcoin should rip higher under President-elect Donald Trump, according to BlackRock's ETF chief.\n\nSamara Cohen, the firm's ETF and index instruments chief investment officer, thinks cryptocurrency deregulation will \"absolutely\" propel bitcoin to another historic year.\n\n\"There will be progress made on… FIT21 [\"Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.] There will be progress made on stable coins.

Instead, in the 82-year-old’s Oval Office denouement, he leaves a nation divided, a party in tatters and the American people questioning the self-described institutionalist’s respect for the rule of law. Many Democrats are blaming Biden for handing the White House to Donald Trump, criticizing the aging politician for staying in office too long and reeling after he pardoned his son. Exacerbating the frustrations, Biden recently expressed doubt about his ability to serve another four years after dismissing voters’ concerns about that very issue as he sought re-election. The president harbors similar resentment toward members of his own party. After the November election, he privately mused about the idea of pardoning Trump as a magnanimous move, according to a person directly familiar with his comments, though it’s not clear he seriously considered it. A White House official said “to our knowledge, this was not raised.” At the same time, Biden is not on speaking terms with some of his closest allies. It is all an inglorious coda to five decades in public office. “The Joe Biden story is one of the great tragedies of American politics. I really mean that. He should be having a glorious, well deserved, highly acclaimed retirement. And he’s not,” veteran Democratic political strategist James Carville said. “It’s hard to blame anybody but him.” Biden plans to write another book, providing him with the opportunity to tell his version of his presidency and its conclusion. Despite public polls showing in 2023 that Democratic voters did not want him to run again, he went forward anyway, with the backing of party insiders. He was later forced to step aside in July following a cataclysmic debate that seemed to expose his cognitive state. His late departure gave Vice President Kamala Harris just 107 days to build an ultimately unsuccessful campaign against Trump. Throughout his presidency, Biden granted fewer interviews than his recent predecessors and is ending his term the same way: He does not plan to hold the traditional final formal news conference. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Biden is proud of the number of interviews and impromptu question-and-answer sessions he’s held with reporters. In the White House, the mood feels “like a morgue,” according to a person who recently met with officials there. Biden leaves office feeling he contributed significant wins for the country that Americans don’t appreciate. Privately, he has vacillated from feeling melancholy to resigned to angry to wistful as he reflects on his legacy, two people close to him said. “He’s totally dejected and the people around him are, as well,” another person close to the president said.One White House official attributed the glum atmosphere to Trump’s impending return to the Oval Office and noted that Biden’s aides warmly reacted with cheers when he surprised them at a staff party earlier this week. Another White House official depicted personnel as holding back on emotions until Jan. 20 actually arrives. “It’s hard to reflect, it’s hard for it to sink in that we’re done here — until we’re actually done and out the gates with our stuff,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. That’s their mood … it hasn’t sunk in for people who are still here yet because we’re working until the last minute.” A uniter's many fractured friendships Once the elder statesman who was to serve as a bridge to the next generation of leadership, Biden departs with an array of fractured relationships. He is estranged from some of the people who were once among his most powerful allies. He harbors, along with first lady Jill Biden, a simmering resentment toward former President Barack Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several former aides, including Bob Bauer and Anita Dunn, all of whom he believes either failed him or pushed him out of the 2024 race, according to several people close to him. Biden hasn’t spoken in months to Dunn, a former top adviser who was among the few notable Democrats willing to back him if he decided to mount a 2016 campaign to challenge Hillary Clinton for the party’s nomination, according to multiple people familiar with the dynamic. Dunn departed the White House during the summer as part of the fallout from Biden’s June debate performance. Biden’s relationship with Bauer, his longtime personal lawyer who is married to Dunn, also has deteriorated since the debate and tensions related to the criminal trials of his son Hunter Biden, the people familiar with the situation said. Neither Bauer nor Dunn attended a large black-tie dinner the Bidens hosted in November to thank longtime supporters. And Bauer will no longer represent Biden once he leaves office, three people familiar with the decision said. Asked about this deterioration of his relationship with Dunn and Bauer, a Biden aide said, “Anita and Bob are well regarded and loyal to the president.” While Biden and Pelosi have crossed paths at social events since she pushed for him to end his candidacy in July, they have not had a substantive conversation, according to a Pelosi aide. “That relationship is permanently damaged,” a person close to Biden said. Biden has not expressed his frustrations with Obama directly to him, a person familiar with their conversations said. One former top Obama aide who publicly argued after the June debate that Biden should drop out pointedly noted this week that Biden recently named aircraft carriers after former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, he has not offered any similar honor to Obama. “Barack H. Obama did not get a f---ing personnel carrier named after him,” Ben Rhodes said on the podcast “Pod Save The World.” Before he left office, Obama surprised Biden by awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in an emotional White House ceremony. Asked about the president’s frustrations with Pelosi and Obama, Bates, the White House spokesperson, said in a statement, “President Biden’s focus is squarely on making as big of a difference as he can in the lives of American families — not events from the campaign.” Family drama crashes into the White House Biden went back on his promise to protect the norms he said undergirded the nation’s stability by pardoning his Hunter Biden on federal gun and tax charges. The president blamed “raw politics” for his son’s prosecution, saying it “infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,” tapping the kind of language Trump often uses. Biden was surprised, and angered, by Democrats’ criticism of the pardon, according to multiple people familiar with his reaction. Dunn was among those who publicly criticized the move. Throughout his term, Biden felt the tug of war between his White House inner circle and his family members. Some of his family felt at times that the president was not being served well by his team, which has included Dunn, former top White House aide and then campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon and longtime close advisers Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon. That was particularly the case as the 2024 campaign got into full swing and Biden’s approval rating continued to sag while Trump gained ground among voters. Biden didn’t make changes to his team until after he dropped out of the 2024 race. In the weeks and months after that gut-wrenching decision, anger intensified from some of his family members toward his closest aides. In some instances, it flowed both ways. Dunn and Bauer resented being unceremoniously cast out of the president’s inner circle and blamed two Biden family members in particular for that — Hunter Biden and Jill Biden. Aspects of the family drama could continue into the next administration. Some members of the president’s staff are bracing for possible congressional investigations into Hunter Biden’s pardon and accusations, denied by the White House, that administration officials covered up the extent of Biden’s mental decline. The unsung hero Biden has argued that he set up the country for long-term economic success after shepherding major pieces of legislation through Congress — even if Americans don’t feel the benefits now. He also sees his efforts to unite U.S. allies around Ukraine after Russia’s invasion as a critical foreign policy achievement. In a major development Wednesday, Israel and Hamas struck a deal for a ceasefire after 15 months of devastating war in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. Biden worked to achieve a ceasefire deal for months, but he now shares some credit for it with Trump, given their two teams coordinated on the round of negotiations that secured the agreement. When reporters asked Biden at a Wednesday news conference whether he or Trump deserves credit for the ceasefire, Biden turned and smiled: “Is that a joke?” Bates, the White House spokesperson, said of the president’s record in office: “President Biden put his unique qualification and his whole heart into delivering for the American people, and the results are the strongest record of any modern administration.” Critics have relentlessly hit Biden for softening border policies early on in his administration, prompting a surge in illegal crossings. While he later tightened controls at the border, public opinion had already swung against him. Some Democrats said Biden missed the mark early on when it came to the economy. He should have spent more time railing against greedy corporations rather than trying to convince the public the economy really was better than it thought, said Pete Giangreco, a veteran in presidential Democratic politics. “There was always this internal struggle from the day he walked into the White House: Was he Joe from Scranton, the populist, union guy? Or is he Joe the senator from Delaware, which is corporate friendly?” Giangreco said. “He could never make up his mind who he was. If he had been Joe from Scranton from day one and stayed Joe from Scranton from day one, it might have been a different outcome.” Biden paid a political price for the pandemic-era policies of the last two presidencies, said Lynn Vavreck, an American politics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Many voters became accustomed to the subsidies the Trump and the Biden administrations doled out and then watched prices go up as the subsidies ran out — a double whammy that hit when Trump was long gone from office. “They believed that they were better off financially during the Trump presidency,” Vavreck said. “That is probably true for very, very many people because of those government stimulus payments and all of the support” for aid programs. But another longtime ally, prominent Democratic donor John Morgan, said that Biden is right to feel bitter by the lack of fanfare around his presidency, pointing to massive investments in infrastructure, a booming stock market, low unemployment and for having navigated the pandemic “masterfully.” “Objectively, I believe it was a great presidency. You know they believe it. You can hear it in the president’s voice,’” Morgan said. “You look at all the statistics and it’s like: ‘Why aren’t you all carrying me on your shoulders?’” In the immediate term, it has all done little to move the public. Biden is poised to leave office with a 36% approval rating, according to a CNN poll released Wednesday. Low approval numbers dogged him throughout his presidency and now he’s particularly smarting over leaving office without his standing with Americans having improved, according to two people familiar with the matter. In an alternate universe, one in which Biden would have stepped aside as the Democratic nominee in 2023, the president would have ridden waves of accolades in his final weeks, cutting ribbons at airports named in his honor or banking hundreds of millions of dollars for an Ivy League policy center in his name, Carville suggested. “Joe Biden had many successful acts in his life. Unfortunately, you get remembered for your last act,” Carville said. “Right now, he’s remembered as the guy who stayed too long.”","summary":"President Joe Biden leaves behind a complicated legacy of legislative wins, economic gains and fractured relationships and grievances within his own party.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/joe-biden-ends-5-decades-public-life-one-greatest-tragedies-american-p-rcna183989","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241212-biden-family-ch-1232-722c16.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 23:36:04","author":"Carol E.

Even if prices remain unchanged, carmakers would face a squeeze on profitability.\n\nThe United States currently imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on Japanese cars, 2 percent on buses, and 25 percent on trucks, while Japan imposes no auto tariffs of its own.\n\n\"It is a highly competitive market, but it is also a market easier to make money compared to other markets due to its massive size,\" Seiji Sugiura, senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory Co., said of the U.S. market.\n\nProducing vehicles in Japan rather than at local plants for the world's second-largest auto market after China makes business sense. Japanese automakers have benefited significantly from the yen's recent slide to multi-decade lows against the U.S. dollar.\n\nA weaker yen makes Japan-made vehicles more price-competitive overseas and increases income earned abroad when converted back into Japanese currency.\n\nHowever, analysts say Trump's higher import duties are likely to significantly offset the currency advantage and reduce profits, particularly for Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.\n\nSubaru and Mazda export about 50 percent and 70 percent of their vehicles sold in the U.S. market from Japan, respectively, compared with over 20 percent for Toyota and less than 1 percent for Honda.\n\nOperating profit could decline by 35 percent at Subaru and 33 percent at Mazda in the fiscal year ending March 2026 due to the additional levies, analysts at Nomura Securities Co. said in a report released in September.\n\n\"This is not a problem one company can solve alone,\" Mazda President Masahiro Moro said at a November press conference on the company's latest earnings, referring to the tariff plan. He noted that Mazda would closely monitor changes in U.S. trade policy under the new administration. The company operates a plant in the state of Alabama that was jointly established with Toyota.\n\nSubaru said it is considering boosting production capacity at its plant in the state of Indiana to lessen the impact of the tariffs.\n\nThe situation may be more complicated for Mazda, as it also produces vehicles in Mexico for the U.S. market, another target of Trump's tariffs.\n\nTrump has announced plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, effective from his first day in office after being sworn in on Monday.\n\nAbout 30 percent of Honda vehicles sold in the United States are sourced from Canada and Mexico. Toyota also produces vehicles in both neighboring countries for the U.S. market, while Nissan ships about 40 percent of its Mexico-made vehicles to the United States, with all benefiting from a free trade agreement among the three nations.\n\nJapan's two largest automakers, Toyota and Honda, have greater production capacity in the United States than other Japanese manufacturers. However, Trump's proposed 25 percent tariff is likely to prompt them to reassess their global production strategies, analysts said.\n\nHonda may consider relocating production out of Mexico, depending on the duration of any new tariffs, Honda Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama said at a November press conference on the company's latest earnings.\n\n\"We cannot move production out of Mexico right away,\" Aoyama said. But the company is aware that \"there is going to be a big impact\" from the tariff plan, he said.\n\nJin Tang, senior principal researcher at Mizuho Bank, said Japanese automakers should prioritize improving profitability, such as through cost-cutting measures, as Trump's plan is expected to impact sales of vehicles from Canada and Mexico.\n\n\"It is possible that they lower their production volumes or reduce the number of models they build\" in Mexico and Canada to mitigate the impact of the plan, he said.\n\nNissan, which exports more vehicles from Mexico than any other Japanese automaker, is in greater need of external support to withstand the new levies.\n\nThe carmaker is scaling back its global production capacity as part of restructuring after falling into a loss in the July-September quarter due in part to sluggish U.S. sales.\n\nJapan's third-largest automaker by volume announced in December plans to merge with its second-largest rival, Honda. Analysts say the merger could offer a solution by allowing the two companies to utilize each other's plants, share expenses for developing next-generation electric vehicles and bolster their product lineups by providing complementary models.\n\nHonda will consider supplying hybrid vehicles to Nissan, Honda President Toshihiro Mibe said at a December press conference announcing the merger plan. This would allow Nissan to enter the U.S. hybrid market and meet the growing demand for gasoline-electric models.\n\n\"Nissan is not the only company that will be hit by the tariffs, but they could further deteriorate the harsh business environment it is facing in the United States,\" said Sanshiro Fukao, executive fellow at the Itochu Research Institute.\n\nRelated coverage","summary":"With only days remaining before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office amid his threats of tariffs, Japanese automakers are preparing to explore new partnerships and revamp supply chains to stay competitive in the vital U.S. market.\n\n\nAmong Japanese industries, the auto sector is expected to face the highest risk from the incoming president's proposal to impose 10 to 20 percent tariffs on all U.S. imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead full story here","url":"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/01/199191377dfb-focus-japan-carmakers-brace-for-trump-tariffs-with-tie-ups-supply-shifts.html","image":"https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/5f45ecb1b98cccc93d79c90586a34f3a/photo_l.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 23:35:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"JP","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":280955448,"title":"Jessica Alba Finally Comes Clean About Split From Husband Cash Warren","text":"Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, 69, joked in an interview published Thursday that receiving an invite to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration next week cured his impotence. “I’m feeling like a kid again with Trump’s invite,” he told The New York Times. “I’m fired up. I’m not even taking Viagra anymore.” Trump’s gesture is something to be proud of, right? Who’s Trump? The most important guy in the world.” Like Trump, the right-wing leader has been accused of trying to overturn an election he lost. Bolsonaro—dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics”—was indicted in November for plotting an alleged coup to stay in power after Brazilian voters opted for his opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the country’s 2022 presidential election. It is unlikely, however, that he’ll make it to see his firebrand American counterpart sworn in next week. Bolsonaro’s passport was taken as part of the probe into the alleged coup, and Brazil’s attorney general recommended that his request to go abroad for Trump’s inauguration be denied. Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice and Bolsonaro critic, decided Thursday that Bolsonaro should not be allowed to travel to Washington, D.C. The former Brazilian leader hinted to the Times that he believes Trump’s influence on global politics might help him stay out of jail. “Frankly, I wouldn’t mind if there were an anti-Viagra, something with the opposite effect,” Trump, now 78, told Playboy in 2004, the year he turned 58. “I’m not bragging.

Alberta’s Danielle Smith is rejecting the Team Canada approach to Trump’s tariff threats","text":"Alberta Premier Danielle Smith finds herself at the centre of controversy because of her refusal to be part of a “Team Canada” approach to Donald Trump’s tariff threats. \n\nWhile other provincial premiers have signed on to a common approach, Smith visited the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to make the case against tariffs — at least those affecting the Alberta oil and gas industry.\n\nShe refused to join the other first ministers in signing a statement committing to a unified approach.\n\nShe’s also signalled her disapproval of proposals to restrict energy exports or to impose an export tax on them if Trump exempts them from the tariffs. \n\nThis has angered many Canadians, including some Albertans. \n\nAlberta oil exports\n\nSmith’s maverick approach reflects Alberta’s unique economic circumstances, its internal politics and its longstanding conflicts with the federal government. Any effort to bring Alberta into a Team Canada approach would have to take these factors into account. \n\nCanada’s top export to the United States is energy products, mostly oil and gas. Almost all of the crude oil that Canada exports goes to the U.S., and most of it comes from Alberta. Alberta exports about 80 per cent of the crude oil it produces.\n\nAlthough it’s not Canada’s largest province, Alberta is Canada’s largest exporter to the U.S. That means the province’s economy is more exposed to the Trump’s tariff threats than any other province. \n\nCrude oil exports to the U.S. are important both to the Albertan economy and to the provincial government’s finances. In 2024-25, royalties from bitumen are projected to be worth $15.6 billion to the Alberta government. Put another way, 20 per cent of the revenues the Alberta government expects to take in this fiscal year are from this source. This does not take into account revenue from corporate and income tax from the industry. \n\nInternal politics\n\nAlberta has a long history of ties to the U.S. Historian Nelson Wiseman has argued that American settlers who came to Alberta early in the 20th century shaped the province’s political culture along the lines of America’s rugged individualism. The rise of the oil industry created new ties between Alberta and Texas. \n\nPrior to the 2024 election, Albertans were more likely than other Canadians to say that they would vote for Trump if they could vote in the American election. According to a Leger survey, 29 per cent of Albertans would have voted for Trump as compared to 21 per cent of Canadians.\n\nRecent polling data from the Angus Reid Institute shows that the vast majority of Albertans (82 per cent) reject the idea of becoming the 51st state. Although this is a large majority, it is smaller than in the rest of the country at 90 per cent.\n\n Read more:\n Requiem for Canada? Regional tensions, changing demographics may fuel Trump's annexation hopes\n\nThis means the number of voters who would view Smith’s visit to Mar-a-Lago positively is higher in Alberta than in other provinces. Given Smith’s populist orientation, it is reasonable to think her core supporters would be inclined to view the visit favourably. \n\nBeefs with Ottawa\n\nThere is a long history of regional alienation in Alberta, dating back to 1905 when it became a province. Control over natural resources has been a persistent conflict between Alberta and Ottawa. These conflicts heightened in the early 1980s over the National Energy Program. \n\nSince the election of Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government in 2015, there has been significant conflict over the province’s ability to build pipelines, the carbon tax and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n Read more:\n Why Alberta would be foolish to abandon carbon policy\n\nSmith ran for her party’s leadership in 2022 on a platform of passing a Sovereignty Act to empower the province to refrain from enforcing federal laws. The legislation she eventually passed could not accomplish this within the rule of law, but did set out a framework for conflicts with Ottawa. \n\nThe day after announcing that she would not sign on to the Team Canada approach, Smith released a social media statement that revisited several long-standing grievances with the federal government, including failure to ensure pipelines were built, efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and to treat Alberta taxpayers with respect when they contributed to equalization. \n\nIs there common ground?\n\nHaving the largest exporting province outside the Team Canada approach against Trump doesn’t position the country well to negotiate with a second Trump administration. \n\nPublic disputes over whether Canada would limit exports to the U.S. have revealed at least part of Canada’s negotiating position. \n\nCould Alberta be brought into the fold? The decades-long animosity between Alberta and the federal government makes it difficult to imagine. When a new prime minister tackles these challenges, it will be essential to take into account the economic and political circumstances that have brought Canada to this point.","summary":"The largest exporting province rejecting a ‘Team Canada’ approach against Donald Trump doesn’t position the country well to negotiate with a second Trump administration.","url":"https://theconversation.com/why-albertas-danielle-smith-is-rejecting-the-team-canada-approach-to-trumps-tariff-threats-247421","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/643082/original/file-20250116-15-u94934.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C25%2C8417%2C4208&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 23:32:33","author":"Lisa Young,Professor of Political Science,University of Calgary","authors":["Lisa Young","Professor of Political Science","University of Calgary"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.084},{"id":280955310,"title":"Amad Diallo's 12-minute hat-trick rescues Man United against Southampton","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Stock Photo\n\nAmad Diallo's 12-minute hat-trick rescues Man United against Southampton\n\nIn this evening’s other Premier League game, Brighton beat Ipswich Town 2-0.\n\n9.55pm, 16 Jan 2025\n\nShare options\n\nAMAD DIALLO scored a sensational 12-minute hat-trick to save Manchester United’s blushes in a 3-1 win against Premier League basement club Southampton on Thursday.\n\nRuben Amorim’s side looked set for a fourth straight league defeat at home before the forward turned the match on his head at a raucous Old Trafford.\n\nHe levelled in the 82nd minute before putting United ahead eight minutes later, rounding off in style with a third goal deep into stoppage time.\n\nIt was cruel luck on a Saints side battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst side in Premier League history.\n\nIvan Juric’s team had deservedly taken the lead through Manuel Ugarte’s own goal towards the end of the first half and had numerous chances to extend their lead.\n\nUnited secured a morale-boosting FA Cup win at Arsenal on Sunday, which followed a battling 2-2 draw at league leaders Liverpool.\n\nBut they had a point to prove to their long-suffering home fans after three straight Premier League defeats underlined the huge rebuilding task facing new manager Amorim.\n\nThe visitors settled quickly and the lively Kamaldeen Sulemana forced Andre Onana into a smart save after surging into the penalty area.\n\nDespite their slow start, the home side should have been ahead in the 20th minute following a flowing move down the left but Alejandro Garnacho skewed wide after being found by Rasmus Hojlund.\n\nSouthampton, who travelled to Old Trafford with only one league win all season, were playing with confidence and zip.\n\nOnana produced a brilliant double save to deny Tyler Dibling with an outstretched hand before quickly getting up to deny Mateus Fernandes from point-blank range.\n\nThe visitors scored the goal they thoroughly deserved in the 43rd minute after the United defence made a hash of a corner.\n\nMatheus Fernandes’s delivery was flicked on at the near post by Dibling and the ball went in off Ugarte’s back.\n\nAmorim raised eyebrows at half-time by bringing on the under-performing Antony for Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nGhana winger Sulemana, giving Leny Yoro a torrid time on the right side of United’s defence, burst through again, only to be denied by a block from the scrambling Matthijs de Ligt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmorim then hauled off Ugarte and Hojlund, replaced by Toby Collyer and Joshua Zirkzee as he sent a stinging message to his under-performing stars.\n\nSulemana raced past Yoro again and sent a shot agonisingly wide of the post.\n\nAntony was responsible for an astonishing miss shortly before the hour mark, failing to get any purchase on a Garnacho cross.\n\nUnited were now building up a head of steam despite the lingering threat from Southampton.\n\nUnited finally got the breakthrough in the 82nd minute when Zirkzee spread the ball to Amad and he ran at the defence.\n\nHis first shot was blocked but he made no mistake with his second, blasting past Aaron Ramsdale in the Southampton goal.\n\nBut he was not finished yet.\n\nEight minutes later he got on the end of a cute dinked pass from substitute Christian Eriksen before taking advantage of a mistake from the Southampton defence to complete his hat-trick.\n\nThe win lifts United to 12th in the table and leaves Southampton 10 points from safety.\n\nElsewhere, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter fired Brighton to their first Premier League win since November as they sank Ipswich 2-0 at Portman Road.\n\nMitoma scored his fourth goal of the season and Rutter hit his third in two matches as Fabian Hurzeler’s side climbed back into the top half of the table, having been winless in their previous eight league matches.\n\nIpswich had jumped out of the relegation zone without kicking a ball after Wolves’ heavy defeat at Newcastle on Wednesday night.\n\nBut they are back in it on goals scored after fluffing their lines at home again.\n\nKieran McKenna’s side picked up their first Portman Road win against Chelsea last time out, but they have amassed just four points from their other 10 home games this season.\n\n– © AFP 2025\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association\n\nWritten by AFP and originally published on The 42 whose

The landmark initiative comes at a pivotal moment, ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s second inauguration, underscoring the growing alignment between the world’s two largest democracies, the IGF said in a press release.The event provided a platform for candid and informal conversations on the shared priorities and challenges shaping US-India relations, with a particular focus on geopolitics, security, defence, and economic cooperation. Topics included President Trump’s populist approach, electoral shifts in the US, and the influential role of the Indian diaspora. The dialogue also addressed the US economic landscape, exploring opportunities in digital infrastructure, technology, innovation, and foreign investment, while highlighting ways to strengthen bilateral collaboration.“Democracies work best when democracies work together,” remarked Manoj Ladwa, Founder and Chairman of India Global Forum, in his opening address to the gathering. “Today, we are here not just to discuss policies or trends but to actively shape the synergies between India and the United States – two of the world’s greatest democracies, working together to navigate a complex and rapidly changing global landscape,” the release added.The event was attended by Jacob Helberg, the Designated Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment in the new administration besides other key policymakers.Discussions were guided by a lineup of prominent voices including Ajit Pai, the former Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission of the United States, who shared his observations from working under President Trump’s first administration, noting how Trump 2.0 will have different implications for big tech, crypto, and regulation, as well as his personal insights on the newly created DOGE agency.Adding a broader geopolitical lens, Dhruva Jaishankar, Executive Director of ORF America and author of Vishwa Shastra: India and the World, discussed improved cooperation between the US and India, what to expect under a Trump presidency, and India’s strategic priorities, the release said.Decision Desk’s Scott Tranter joined the IGF Business Delegation to do a deep dive into the data behind the 2024 elections and his predictions for key policy trends over the next four years.Speaking on natural synergies on defence procurement, energy, and global supply chains, a former National Security Official in the first Trump administration spoke about how the US and India could push the envelope to strengthen bilateral ties.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2025/01/india-global-forum-launches-in-us-ahead-of-trumps-inauguration/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ANI-20250116231848.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-16 23:30:51","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.55},{"id":280954034,"title":"Trump treasury nominee slammed for opposing minimum wage increase","text":"Scott Bessent, Donald Trump’s nominee to be secretary of treasury, is being criticized for opposing an increase of the federal minimum wage at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday.\n\nBessent was being questioned by progressive Sen.
