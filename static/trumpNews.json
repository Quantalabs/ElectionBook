We can’t stand you. You’re a shit Vice President.”\n\nTrump added the catchphrase from his bygone television show “The Apprentice” to cheers: “Kamala, you’re fired,” he said. “Get the hell out of here.”\n\nTrump told the crowd that profanity helps him put emphasis on his arguments, but the more pointed attack also underscores a recent heightening of personal invective in a tight race that is in its final weeks. At a rally on Wednesday, he called Harris “a horrible person” and “not a smart person.”\n\nNBC News reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.\n\nHarris, campaigning in Atlanta Saturday, ripped Trump for meandering in his public remarks. “He tends to go off script and ramble and generally for the life of him cannot finish a thought,” she said. “And he has called it the weave. But I think we here call it nonsense.”\n\nTrump spent the first 10 minutes of his roughly 90-minute speech telling stories about Palmer, the late professional golfer for whom the airport was named. At one point, he suggested that Palmer had unusually large genitalia.\n\n“He was strong and tough, and I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there they said, ‘Oh my God. That’s unbelievable,'” Trump said.\n\nThe Harris campaign quickly pounced on the anecdote. One Harris campaign spokesperson, Sarafina Chitika, suggested that someone should do a “wellness check” on the former president while another, Matt Corridoni, posted on X that Trump was “Having a totally normal one.”\n\nAn NBC News poll earlier this month showed Harris and Trump tied at 48 percent apiece nationally, while state polls in Pennsylvania and other battlegrounds have consistently placed them within the margin of error of each other.\n\nHarris portrayed Trump Saturday as too tired for the job they both seek, a partisan reversal of Republican claims that President Joe Biden is incapacitated. Trump, for his part, called Biden “mentally deficient” Saturday.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race this summer and helped Harris lock down the Democratic nomination with his endorsement after he stumbled badly in a debate against Trump\n\n“Now he’s ducking debates and canceling interviews because of exhaustion,” Harris said. Trump canceled an interview with NBC News’ Senior Business Correspondent Christine Romans that was scheduled to tape on Monday; his campaign said it would reschedule but had not yet done so as of Friday afternoon.\n\nHe also backed down from a CNBC interview and a planned appearance at a National Rifle Association event in recent days.\n\nOn Friday, during an exchange with reporters in Michigan, Harris took a cleaner swing at Trump over his energy level.\n\n“Being president of the United States is probably one of the hardest jobs in the world,” Harris said. “And so, we really do need to ask if he’s exhausted being on the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump called rival Kamala Harris a &#8220;s&#8212; vice president&#8221;&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-insults-harris-by-calling-her-a-terrible-vice-president-amidst-escalating-personal-attacks/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Trump-calls-Harris-a-s-vice-president-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 00:17:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":260350128,"title":"Trump’s plan to deport millions of immigrants would cost hundreds of billions, CBS News analysis shows","text":"In the last month of the presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump is doubling down on his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation effort in American history. \n\nIn Reading, Pennsylvania, last week, Trump drew fervent applause from a rally crowd after saying he would “get these people out” and “deport them so rapidly.” In Aurora, Colorado, on Friday, Trump told rallygoers he would “rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded and conquered.” \n\nImmigration researchers, lawyers, and economists have pointed to immense constitutional, humanitarian and economic problems posed by Trump’s oft-repeated pledge. But beyond the anticipated damage to immigrant families, communities and local economies, the roundup and deportation of some 11 million people is near impossible to bankroll, according to an analysis of U.S. budget and immigration court data by CBS News. \n\nEven if Congress approved the hundreds of billions of dollars in spending, deporting every undocumented immigrant living in the U.S. would take far longer than four years, the analysis finds.\n\nCBS News’ analysis of immigration system data found:\n\n Apprehending and deporting just 1 million people could cost taxpayers about $20 billion. Deporting 11 million people over four years would cost more than 20 times what the nation spent a year over the last five years on deporting people living in the U.S. Most of that would be new funding that would have to be approved by a majority of both chambers of Congress. Assuming Trump did get the funding and could rapidly expand the staffing in immigration enforcement and courts, the backlog of cases would grow — not decrease — by millions of cases based on what’s happened in the last two administrations. Trump’s own administration, despite promising to deport millions in 2016, deported 325,660 people during the fiscal years he was in office. \n\nThe cost of deportation to taxpayers\n\nOver the last five fiscal years, it cost an estimated average of $19,599 to deport one person, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data. That figure is based on budget allocations for each step of the deportation process: the apprehension of an undocumented immigrant living in the U.S., detention, the immigration court process and transport out of the country. \n\nFrom 2021 to 2023, as migrant crossings at the southern border reached record highs, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deployed roughly a sixth of its workforce typically dedicated to deportation to the border to assist Customs and Border Patrol. (Crossings have since declined.)\n\nICE also diverted resources to removals under Title 42, an emergency health authority enacted during the pandemic that allowed border patrol to turn away migrants attempting to cross the border. Fewer people were deported from the interior of the U.S. during those years than in prior years, which drove up the cost per deportation. \n\nBut even when Trump was president and the number of border crossings was lower than they were during the post-pandemic spike, the cost of deporting one person was still $14,614. To deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants estimated to be living in the U.S. at that time would have cost between $40 billion to $54 billion a year over the next presidential term — up to $216 billion total. ICE was allocated only $9 billion last year.\n\nEven the lower end of that annual estimate, $40 billion, is enough to provide 20 million families each with a Child Tax Credit each year, and is more than double the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s entire budget. Over four years, the sum — $160 to $216 billion — is comparable to the cost of constructing around half a million new homes across the country. \n\nA similar analysis from the American Immigration Council put the total cost of deporting 11 million people even higher, at $315 billion.\n\n“It can’t possibly be anywhere near 11 million”\n\nTrump has said that local law enforcement will help with mass deportation since “they know their names, they know their serial numbers.” Experts say it’s not so simple. \n\n“One of the assumptions in the Trump proposal is that those local police and sheriffs are going to cooperate,” said Abigail Andrews, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego. “We know from the last couple of decades that one of the major ways for cities and states to dissent around immigration processes has been for the police to cooperate or not cooperate with ICE.” \n\nTrump has said he would deploy the National Guard to identify and detain immigrants who have entered illegally. That plan could face legal barriers, since the law prohibits the use of federal troops for civilian law enforcement unless authorized by Congress. Trump responded to this by arguing that undocumented immigrants “aren’t civilians.” \n\nEnforcement agents could also end up racially profiling citizens and noncitizens alike in an attempt to identify undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. \n\n“There’s no way to do this without major civil liberties violations,” said Donald Kerwin, editor and founder of the Journal on Migration and Human Security. “At the end of the day, it can’t possibly be anywhere near 11 million.”\n\nTrump promised a mass deportation when he ran for office in 2016, but during the fiscal years that ran through his term, ICE deported only 325,660 people from the interior of the U.S.\n\nA mass deportation, depending on its scale, likely wouldn’t be complete in four years, either. Immigration courts in the U.S. currently face a backlog of 3.7 million cases, according to records obtained by Syracuse University. It would take the immigration court system eight more years and 700 additional judges — almost double its existing workforce — to eliminate the existing backlog entirely, according to a study by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThose who receive a “notice to appear” in immigration court can be scheduled for court dates years into the future. \n\nUsing a tool developed by Kerwin and his son, independent researcher Brendan Kerwin, CBS News estimated that the backlog of immigration cases would be 13.5 million by FY 2028 if the courts received 11 million new cases. \n\nThe tool takes into account the rate at which immigration judges process cases, the number of new cases each year, and the number of judges hired. The Executive Office of Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, planned for 150 new judges in the 2024 fiscal year. If the government hired 150 new judges each year for the next four years, sending 11 million undocumented immigrants notices to appear would leave the courts with a 13.5 million case backlog by FY 2028. \n\nTrump could take steps to eliminate that legal process for some immigrants, which could lead to a smaller backlog. Under a 1996 law, those who were apprehended within 100 miles of the border within two weeks of their illegal crossing could be deported without a court hearing. The Trump administration previously expanded that law to apply to the entire country and any undocumented immigrants who entered illegally and had been living in the U.S. for less than two years. \n\nMass deportations would reduce jobs\n\nBeyond the costs outlined above, deporting millions of migrants could also negatively impact the U.S. economy and job market. \n\nOne study found that Obama’s Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, not only pulled those immigrants from the workforce but had a ripple effect of decreasing the employment and hourly wages of U.S.-born people as well. Scaling their findings, the researchers estimated that for every 1 million unauthorized workers deported, 88,000 native-born jobs would be lost. \n\nAn analysis from the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics released last month reached similar conclusions. Researchers found that a mass deportation of even just 1.3 million undocumented immigrants would lower GDP and reduce employment in the U.S. by 0.8% by 2028. A larger mass deportation of over 8 million immigrants would have a larger effect, lowering employment to 5.1% below the current baseline. \n\nUndocumented immigrants also paid $59.4 billion in federal taxes and $37.3 billion to state and local taxes, according to a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. More than a third of those went to Medicaid, Social Security and unemployment insurance. \n\nOver 4 million families could be separated\n\nMass deportation would not only reduce jobs for citizens, but impact family members who are citizens. There are roughly 4.1 million mixed-status families living in the U.S., according to data from the Pew Research Center. About 4.4 million U.S.-born children live with an undocumented parent.\n\nChildren whose parents are deported “often leave school, they end up with trauma, mental health challenges, behavioral problems,” said Andrews, the U.C. San Diego researcher. “Spouses often have to deal with not only the incredible emotional cost of having their partner deported but also with the economic cost of having to relocate or having to take on another job.”\n\nAnd the immigrants facing deportation, Andrews said, “end up extremely disoriented and in an existential limbo.”\n\n“The economic cost will be extremely high, but the social, emotional, and community costs will also be extraordinarily high,” she added.","summary":"In the last month of the presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump is doubling down on his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation effort in American history.  In Reading, Pennsylvania, last week, Trump drew fervent applause from a rally crowd after saying he would &#8220;get these people out&#8221; and &#8220;deport them so rapidly.&#8221; &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump&#8217;s plan to deport millions of immigrants would cost hundreds of billions, CBS News analysis shows appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/trumps-plan-to-deport-millions-of-immigrants-would-cost-hundreds-of-billions-cbs-news-analysis-shows/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/17/50331822-6476-4d05-8865-28966cf3449f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e4fec3d615759f2888f56afe5688af42/gettyimages-2177574945.jpg?v=edba3a63b5392b4c81ae19d894992d91","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 00:15:10","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":260350276,"title":"Oasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will be 'kept apart' in 'military style operation' on reunion tour with 'separate dressing rooms and transport' amid long running feud","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 20th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam didn't want to die, he didn't have to: Star had great plans for future and he should have been saved on the night of his death, says source close to family\n\nOlympic cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy reveals that his cancer is terminal - and he has just 'two to four years left'\n\nNew SNP chief was forced to apologise over sickening post attacking Kate and royals\n\nLauryn Goodman 'reported Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner to the police over shocking WhatsApp messages'\n\nAN WILSON: Why Charles should call the bluff of these drongo and ungracious Aussies and announce he'll quit as their head of state, by the late Queen's biographer\n\nLIZ JONES: I so wanted Meghan to be fulfilled.

Wouldn’t take his phone calls anymore while at the White House, and he went rogue,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “A weak and pathetic ‘bully,’ he’s got nothing going.” But he capped off the run of insults by attacking something Trump truly values: his target’s golf game, just like he did while debating Joe Biden earlier this year. “Really low clubhead speed, a total non-athlete!”\n\nWhile speaking at a rally held in support of Kamala Harris on Thursday, Cuban slammed Trump’s understanding of business. “I’ve learned a lot about business, including how tariffs work,” Cuban said. Trump appears to “thinks that China pays for them,” adding, “This is same guy that thought that Mexico would pay for the wall.”\n\nWith the post, Trump included a clip of vocal supporter and yet another fellow billionaire Elon Musk speaking at a campaign event in support of Trump on Friday. Musk inserted himself into the conversation about Cuban, telling attendees, “I saw an interview with Mark Cuban and, what’s-her-name again, Rachel Maddow… but I couldn’t tell which was which.”\n\nCuban spoke to Maddow on Tuesday about his past dealings with Trump. The pair initially got along well — in 2015, Cuban contemplated being Trump’s vice president during his first presidential campaign. But the relationship soured after Cuban “fairly quickly realized that Trump was was very much not the best thing to happen to politics, and it’s been a very long time since he said anything nice about Trump and his political prospects,” Maddow said.\n\nCuban had no plan to break that streak Tuesday night. He told Maddow, “There’s really no good reason to vote for Donald Trump as the business candidate” and added, “You know, in doing business, whether you’re a small company or very large company, you want stability. You don’t want to wake up one morning as the CEO of John Deere and find out all of the sudden you’ve got a 200% tariff.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly vocalized support for tariffs that could top 60% on goods imported from China. He has argued that the higher import tax will bring increased revenue to the United States and allow him to cut tax rates without inflation rising. The plan has been panned and described as “dangerous.”\n\nApparently offended by Cuban’s continued criticism of him and praise for Harris, Trump also shared a link to a Fox News article from August about a poll Cuban conducted among his followers on X. Cuban asked, “Whose persona and character would you like to see young children grow up to have?” Trump won the poll 68.9% to 31.2% on the Musk-owned platform.","summary":"The GOP candidate calls his former ally a \"weak and pathetic 'bully'\" as the fellow billionaire endorses Harris, also sharing video of Elon Musk comparing Cuban's look to Rachel Maddow\n\n\nThe post Donald Trump Mocks ‘Loser’ Mark Cuban&#8217;s Golf Game: &#8216;Really Low Clubhead Speed, a Total Non-Athlete!&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-says-loser-mark-cuban-went-rogue/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/donald-trump-georgia.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 00:11:21","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":260350352,"title":"Dave Ramsey, a Radio Host, Shows Support for Donald Trump: ‘No One Can Silence Me’","text":"“I’m looking at ideas and which ideas land on which side of the aisle.

The former president began by praising Palmer’s career and describing his previous conversations with him.“There were a few golfers that you could say may be slightly better, a few, not many,” he said. “But there was nobody that had his magic.”\n\nBut the former president’s anecdote quickly devolved as he discussed some intimate details about the golfing icon.\n\n“This is a guy that was all man,” Trump said. “He took showers with the other pros, they came out of there, they said, ‘Oh my God, that’s unbelievable.’ I had to say it.”\n\n“I had to tell you the shower part because it’s true,” he added.\n\nSocial media users were quick to mock the former president for the anecdote.\n\n“According to the most recent NYT/Siena poll, the top three issues for swing voters include: 1. Inflation 2. abortion 3. The size of Arnold Palmer’s schlong,” podcast host Dan Pfeiffer wrote on X.\n\n“But don’t call them weird,” author Jennifer Taub posted, alluding to Kamala Harris’s moniker for the former president and his running mate, JD Vance.\n\nOthers commented on the crude nature of the comment.\n\n“Real dinner table stuff,” one X user said.\n\n“Clicked ‘Arnold Palmer’ to see if something was trending about the tea,” another user wrote. “It was the furthest thing from tea.”\n\nPalmer was born in Latrobe in 1929. Nicknamed “The King,” Palmer is one of the most iconic golf players in US history. Palmer diied in 2016 at 87 years old in Pittsburgh.\n\nTrump is leading Harris by just one point in Pennsylvania, the latest Emerson College poll reveals. As Trump discussed Palmer in the key swing state, Harris was campaigning with Usher in Atlanta. The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment.","summary":"‘But don’t call them weird,’ one X user quipped","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-arnold-palmer-pennsylvania-rally-b2632238.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/20/00/SEI226283660.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 00:02:27","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.036},{"id":260349626,"title":"Empty excellencies","text":"Your Excellency. His Excellency. Her Excellency.\n\nTo attend or observe a public event in Nigeria is to witness a farce. First, you are immediately immersed in an institution described as “protocols.”\n\nThat is when a speaker, such as the master of ceremony or the chairman or official speaker launches into an endless rigmarole in which every supposedly important person present is identified by title and name.\n\nSometimes, some people are not even present, but they are sufficiently “excellent” to be captured in the speech anyway. Such “protocols” can last two or three pages or about 15 minutes of an ego roll call. And very often, when the speaker has finished, to his attention is brought further names, and back to the microphone he goes.\n\nHis Excellency. Her Excellency. Their Excellencies. Your Excellency. These “protocols” are sometimes abridged by speakers who try to head off criticism of failing to capture anyone and everyone who is supposedly important by saying, “All protocols observed.”\n\nThe honour, “Excellence” or “Excellency” was originally used in the Catholic Church for Bishops and Archbishops, and then for such high government officials as governors and diplomats.\n\nIn Nigeria, it has captured the imagination and worship of politicians who are fascinated by the concept—but rarely the substance or challenge—of excellence.\n\nExcellence does not mean you are highly regarded: it is something you earn. It relates to preeminence in character, learning or achievement, as it speaks to your distinction in some specific regard. You cannot buy it, borrow it, or have it bestowed on you or upon someone else.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, politicians crave it. Both elected and appointed officials, many of whom buy or speculate in chieftaincy and honorary academic titles, want it appended to their names. This is responsible for the long “protocols” at every public event, our love of titles mixing with our desire for high-sounding adjectives, no matter how falsified.\n\nThis is how the hunger for “excellency,” as a title, has gripped Nigeria.\n\nRemember one Muhammadu Buhari during his state visit to the United States in 2018?\n\nAt the White House, the Nigerian leader kept addressing his American counterpart as “Your Excellency.” Mr Donald Trump was at once surprised and fascinated.\n\n“I could get used to this,” he remarked joyfully about a title in which Mr Buhari bathed every day back in Nigeria. The adulation did not stop him from calling Buhari lifeless, as we found out.\n\nBuhari has no relationship with excellence. Ahead of the election which brought him to power in 2015, he was publicly embarrassed after it was discovered that in place of his academic certificates, he had submitted only an affidavit to the electoral commission, lying about his credentials.\n\n“All my academic qualifications documents, as filled in my presidential form, president APC/001/2015, are currently with the secretary, military board, as of the time of presenting this affidavit.”\n\nThe army publicly denied that claim, and Buhari’s deception lasted into his quest for a second term.\n\nOf perhaps greater importance, Buhari’s entire presence in Nigerian politics rested on his self-marketing that he was incorruptible and would rid Nigeria of corruption. On the contrary, his eight years exposed him as being ethically and administratively worse than those he had lambasted since 1985 when he was ousted from power as head of state. \n\nIt had taken him 20 years of insisting that he was “excellent” and the only one who could fix Nigeria to return to the throne, only to be exposed for his emptiness and to leave the country in an unprecedented stench after eight years.\n\nConsider, then, how many present and former federal and state officials Nigerians celebrate and praise daily in the country as “Excellency.”\n\nBut there is nothing in the country that is excellent. If there is, it has most probably just been constructed or erected and not yet tested by time, a challenge that humbles all pretenders.\n\nExcellence is achievable. It should even be desirable. When it is achieved, respectable institutions award or declare it on those who have earned it. In society, people also celebrate people who, by conduct or achievement, demonstrate excellence through genuine and sustained commitment to the community.\n\nSome public officials, unfortunately, serve their extremely narrow and selfish interests. They appear to resent anything that genuinely uplifts the people or serves the public interest.\n\nThis is what excellence is about. It implies a spirit and mindset that is higher than the individual: appointing the best expertise available—not simply relatives or convenient persons nearby or convenient—to develop and implement public policy. It involves deploying deep reserves of personal character.\n\nThe quandary that Nigeria is in arises from officials consistently refusing to adopt this mentality in the service of the people. We want to be considered icons and praised as special when everyone can see that we are not.\n\nWe want to be celebrated as “excellent” even when we have very low or no standards. Our supply of officials willing to do or say the right thing dwindles with our national prospects. Look at our policies. Look at infrastructure. Look at the judiciary. Look at the civil service. The security services. The legislature. Education. Sports.\n\nContrast each and any one of those with the lifestyle and conduct of officials and their inner circles. First Lady Remi Tinubu, who is alleged to be a pastor, taunts Nigeria’s poor and starving with tales of how rich her family was and is. The president spends lavishly at home and abroad to guarantee his luxury, while he preaches sacrifice for citizens who have nothing left. But Nigeria has never been more miserable, or in greater danger, than in his hands.\n\nStill, we call him Excellency. Despite his record—or lack of it—as a person. Despite an abysmal presidency in which Nigeria has become unrecognisable for all the wrong reasons.\n\nMany states are in even worse shape. Still, we call each governor “Excellency” even when we know there is no one more sinister, incompetent, or corrupt. The governor spends his tenure largely in Abuja, playing political games and coordinating his ill-gotten wealth, his state perpetually underperforming.\n\nStill, we call him Excellency. But Excellency is neither in their conduct nor in the constitution. He wants to be called ‘Executive Governor,’ which flatters his ego but does not appear in the constitution either.\n\nYour Excellency? Excellent as in what?\n\nHis Excellency? How does pretence double as performance? When and where did your governor earn his excellence?\n\nThe truth is that Nigeria, where she is not running on platitudes, is running on empty. We must stop inflating empty and incompetent people with hot air and then wonder why they are such lightweights. They should be satisfied with their names and official titles.\n\nYou want praise? Earn it!","summary":"Your Excellency. His Excellency. Her Excellency. To attend or observe a public event in Nigeria is to witness a farce.

A quota is one-sixth of the vote or 16.7%.\n\nFor Saturday’s election, the ABC is calling\nten Labor seats, eight Liberals, two Greens, one Independent for Canberra (IfC) and one other independent, with three still undecided. \n\nLabor has won a seventh consecutive term, having governed in the ACT since 2001, often in coalition with the Greens. At the 2022 federal election, the ACT gave Labor a 67–33 two-party win, easily the most pro-Labor jurisdiction. This strong left lean makes it difficult for the Liberals to win ACT elections.\n\nVote shares were 34.5% Labor (down 3.3% since the 2020 election), 33.0% Liberals (down 0.9%), 12.5% Greens (down 1.0%), 8.5% Independents for Canberra (new) and 11.5% for all Others (down 3.3%). Postal votes have not yet been counted, and these should help the Liberals.\n\nNearly all pre-poll votes and some election day votes were cast electronically. Provisional preference distributions for these votes were published on election night, with paper ballots to be added to these electronic votes in the coming days.\n\nAnalysis of each of the five electorates follows. The final seat result will probably be ten Labor (steady since 2020), ten Liberals (up one), three Greens (down three), one IfC (new) and one other independent (up one). If this occurs, Labor and the Greens will retain their combined majority with 13 of the 25 seats.\n\nIn Brindabella, the Liberals won 2.57 quotas, Labor 2.05, the Greens 0.55 and IfC 0.45. Analyst Kevin Bonham says the Liberals are likely to win the last seat after postals are counted.\n\nIn Ginninderra, Labor has 2.26 quotas, the Liberals 1.52, the Greens 0.89 and IfC 0.45. Bonham says the Greens and Liberals easily win the final two seats on the provisional distribution.\n\nIn Kurrajong, Labor has 2.20 quotas, the Liberals 1.41, the Greens 1.07 and IfC 0.83. IfC easily wins the last seat on the provisional distribution.\n\nIn Murrumbidgee, the Liberals have 2.06 quotas, Labor 2.02, independent Fiona Carrick 0.78 and the Greens 0.57. Carrick easily wins the last seat.\n\nIn Yerrabi, the Liberals have 2.19 quotas, Labor 1.86, the Greens 0.71 and IfC 0.58. The Greens easily defeat IfC on the provisional distribution.\n\nHarris dips in polls, but US presidential contest remains tight\n\nThe United States presidential election will be held on November 5. In analyst Nate Silver’s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.1–46.8, a gain for Trump since last Monday, when Harris led by 49.3–46.5. Harris’ national lead peaked on October 2, when she led by 49.4–45.9.\n\nJoe Biden’s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2–41.2.\n\nThe US president isn’t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner-takes-all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total).\n\nRelative to the national popular vote, the Electoral College is biased to Trump, with Harris needing at least a two-point popular vote win to be the narrow Electoral College favourite in Silver’s model.\n\nIn Silver’s state poll aggregates, Harris leads by just 0.4 points in Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes) and Wisconsin (ten). She leads by about one point in Michigan (15 electoral votes) and Nevada (six). Trump leads by 0.8 points in North Carolina (16 electoral votes), 1.4 points in Georgia (16) and 1.8 points in Arizona (11).\n\nIf Harris holds her current leads in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada, she likely wins the Electoral College by at least 276–262. But Harris’ margins in these states are now very narrow.\n\nWhile Silver’s model is still effectively a 50–50 toss-up, Trump is now the slight favourite with a 51% chance to win the Electoral College, up from 48% last Monday. Harris’ Electoral College win probability had peaked at 58% on September 27. There’s a 26% chance that Harris wins the popular vote but loses the Electoral College.\n\nWhile Trump was the favourite in Silver’s model between late August and mid-September, this is his first lead in FiveThirtyEight since early August.\n\nSilver said on Friday that current economic conditions imply Harris should win the national popular vote by about one point, so the contest is trending towards this outcome. But Trump would be likely to win the Electoral College with just a one-point Harris advantage in the popular vote.\n\nLiberals lose Pittwater to teal at NSW state byelections\n\nByelections occurred Saturday in the New South Wales state Liberal-held seats of Epping, Hornsby and Pittwater. Labor did not contest any of these byelections. In Pittwater, The Poll Bludger’s projections give teal independent Jacqui Scruby a 54.1–45.9 lead over the Liberals, a 4.8% swing to Scruby since the 2023 state election.\n\nCurrent primary votes are 53.7% Scruby (up 17.3%), 42.4% Liberals (down 2.6%) and 3.9% for a Libertarian. The Greens had won 6.8% in 2023, but did not contest, presumably to stop left-wing votes exhausting under NSW’s optional preferential system.\n\nThe other two byelections were easy Liberal holds, with the Liberals beating the Greens by 61.6–38.4 in Hornsby (58.0–42.0 against Labor in 2023). The Liberals won Epping by 65.8–34.2 against the Greens (54.8–45.2 against Labor in 2023).\n\nFederal Morgan poll and NT redistribution\n\nA national Morgan poll, conducted October 7–13 from a sample of 1,697, had a 50–50 tie, unchanged from the September 30 to October 6 Morgan poll.\n\nPrimary votes were 37.5% Coalition (steady), 30% Labor (down 1.5), 14% Greens (up 1.5), 6% One Nation (up 0.5), 9% independents (steady) and 3.5% others (down 0.5).\n\nThe headline figure uses respondent preferences. By 2022 election preference flows, Labor led by 51–49, a one-point gain for the Coalition.\n\nThe Northern Territory has two federal electorates: Lingiari and Solomon. It had been seven years since the last NT redistribution, so a new redistribution was required, and this was released Friday. \n\nABC election analyst Antony Green said Labor’s margin in Lingiari was increased from 0.9% to 1.7%, but decreased in Solomon from 9.4% to 8.4%. This is a draft redistribution, but there are not expected to be any changes before finalisation.","summary":"The ACT election has yielded yet another Labor win, with the party holding office in the ACT since 2001.","url":"https://theconversation.com/labor-retains-office-at-act-election-us-presidential-election-remains-on-a-knifes-edge-241678","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/626766/original/file-20241019-15-20hr00.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=12%2C667%2C8033%2C4016&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 23:08:51","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.021},{"id":260347386,"title":"Dominion Calls Out 'Lies' Amid New Elon Musk, Marjorie Taylor Greene Claims","text":"Dominion Voting Systems, which manufactures voting machines used across the U.S., says it is prepared to counter \"lies\" and \"seek accountability from those who spread them\" regarding its voting systems and election integrity following a revival of 2020 conspiracy claims from Elon Musk and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.In the past few years, Dominion has been at the center of several election integrity conspiracy theories. In 2020, supporters of former President Donald Trump falsely claimed that Dominion machines had \"flipped\" votes from Trump to President Joe Biden. Others claimed the machines deleted Trump votes altogether.Despite the claims being repeatedly debunked, Representative Greene and tech billionaire Musk separately cast doubt on Dominion systems in speeches this week.Dominion has filed dozens of lawsuits against individuals and media organizations that have spread the misinformation. Fox News settled one suit for $787.5 million.In a Saturday update on its webpage titled \"Setting the Record Straight: Facts About Dominion,\" the company reiterated that the claim has been \"repeatedly debunked.\" It also noted that \"a record-breaking 1.1 million voters in the state of Georgia\" have cast their ballots using Dominion machines. Georgia is a key battleground state in the tight 2024 presidential election.The update comes the day after Greene, a Trump loyalist, said during an interview with Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that \"someone\" saw their Trump vote change after casting a ballot on a Dominion machine this year in Georgia. She also wrote on social media that it happened in her district in Whitfield County, Georgia.\"They marked Donald Trump and they marked who they were voting for the rest of the way down their ballot on the machine,\" Greene said. \"When this voter printed their ballot and they looked, it had changed. It was not Donald Trump, it was not me and it was not the other ones they had voted for. It had switched.\"\"So they had to start over, and they went through it several times and it kept on making the same error,\" she continued. \"It kept on switching the votes.... It sounds similar to what we heard in 2020.\"A Dominion spokesperson told Newsweek on Friday that the company \"has been the target of ongoing defamation, including long-debunked claims\" like the one Greene pushed on Friday.In the Saturday update, Dominion wrote on its website, \"The false claim that voting machines can switch votes has been repeatedly debunked. As both state and local election authorities have confirmed, the issue reported in Whitfield County was due to voter error. The county provided the voter with an opportunity to mark and print a new ballot with their correct choices and the issue was quickly resolved.\"Newsweek has reached out to Greene's campaign for comment via email on Saturday.At his first solo event supporting Trump's presidential campaign on Thursday, Musk responded to a question about election fraud, sarcastically remarking it must be a coincidence that Dominion voting machines were used in Philadelphia and Maricopa County, Arizona, two battleground states won by President Joe Biden in 2020.Dominion issued a statement following the event, clarifying that its machines were not used in Philadelphia. \"These are not matters of opinion. They are verifiable facts,\" Dominion said in its statement.Dominion voting systems are certified by the U.S. government.","summary":"Dominion Voting Systems says its can counter election integrity \"lies,\" having repeatedly debunked 2020 claims about its systems.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/dominion-lies-elon-musk-marjorie-taylor-greene-claims-1971743","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499520/dominion-voting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 23:02:58","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.388},{"id":260347590,"title":"Gov. Tim Walz calls Democratic ticket 'underdog' at Chicago fundraiser, sharpens attacks on Trump-Vance","text":"Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz on Saturday told a packed room of Chicago donors that Democrats are the “underdog” with 17 days until Election Day — as he ramped up his attacks on former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Minnesota governor flew to Chicago, along with his daughter, Hope, for a nearly three-hour visit to stump before top donors in a packed Park Hyatt Chicago banquet room before heading to another campaign reception in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe reception came ahead of a high-dollar private fundraiser for the Harris Victory Fund — hosted by Gov. JB Pritzker and MK Pritzker — with former President Barack Obama and Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy on Monday.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson also plans to travel to Detroit on Sunday to deliver remarks in support of Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign at three historically Black churches.\n\nDitching the more casual plaid garb he’s has been wearing to rallies, Walz, in a blazer, no tie and slacks, on Saturday stressed the importance of winning key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. He vowed that Democrats will win North Carolina.\n\nStill, he told a room full of donors and elected officials: “We’re the underdog.”\n\n“This thing is gonna be close,” Walz said. “That’s the way our country is.”\n\nWalz thanked supporters for funds that are going directly toward supporting campaign efforts in must-win battleground states. And the governor also continued to sharpen his attacks on Trump as he takes on what his campaign has called a “more aggressive” approach to campaigning following his televised debate with Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee.\n\n“It’s pretty clear the tired, divisive and old rhetoric of Donald Trump matches the tired, divisive and old Donald Trump,” Walz said. “That there is nothing more there. There’s nothing but hate. There’s nothing but division. There is no solution.”\n\nAs Harris and Walz try to reach out to independent and undecided voters in TV, radio and podcast interviews, Trump has backed out of two key interviews this month. Walz accused the former president of hiding.\n\n“Where’s Donald Trump?” Walz said. “Look, she and I are one interview away from being regulars on Fox News.”\n\nWalz appeared on “Fox News Sunday” two weekends in a row, seeking to speak to undecided voters.\n\nThe Democrat on Saturday told supporters that Trump is “unfit, as somebody said, for any office, let alone the presidency.”\n\n“He’s unfit for the goodness of what this country can be,” Walz said. But the option is he is not going to be president of the United States.”\n\nIllinois Democratic power players met Walz when he arrived at O’Hare Airport, including Johnson, Sen. Dick Durbin, U.S. Reps. Danny Davis, Bill Foster, Robin Kelly, Jan Schakowsky and state Comptroller Susana Mendoza.\n\nBesides the greeters, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan was among supporters spotted at the fundraiser.\n\nWalz is traveling to Michigan, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York through Monday. The campaign also announced that Harris will join former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Monday for events across the suburbs in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2024/10/19/tim-walz-chicago-kamala-harris-election-2024-obama-pritzker-democrats-vote-politics-money","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b4566e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2Fb2%2Fd55f416b4ef6a6a9292534396fe1%2Fimg-","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:58:30","author":"Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":260347384,"title":"Lizzo Claps Back at Donald Trump's Detroit Insults","text":"Singer Lizzo responded on Saturday to an insult made by former President Donald Trump about how his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris would make the whole country \"like Detroit.\"While speaking to the Detroit Economic Club on October 10, the Republican nominee warned guests about a possible Harris administration, \"The whole country is going to be like, you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. You're going to have a mess on your hands.\"The hitmaker seemingly responded to the jab against her beloved city during an appearance at a Harris campaign event in Detroit on Saturday, \"I'm so proud to be from this city. You know, they say if Kamala wins, then the whole country will be like Detroit. Ok. Proud like Detroit! Resilient like Detroit! We're talking about the same Detroit that innovated the auto industry and the music industry, so put some respect on Detroit's name!\"\"If you ask me if America's ready for its first woman president? I only got one thing to say, it's about damn time!\" Lizzo added, referencing her 2022 hit song \"About Damn Time.\"When reached for comment by Newsweek, Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said via email late Saturday afternoon, \"Who's Lizzo?\"Harris previously responded to Trump's Detroit remarks on the campaign trail in Las Vegas.\"My opponent, Donald Trump, yet again has trashed another great American city when he was in Detroit, which is just a further piece of evidence on a very long list of why he is unfit to be president of the United States,\" she said on October 10.Trump visited Detroit Friday night where he called Detroit a \"beautiful city\" and blamed Harris and Democrats for \"wreaking havoc\" on it.\"Your beautiful place, your beautiful city\" was \"decimated as if by a foreign army,\" he said at a campaign rally. \"I will put Detroit first. I will put Michigan first. I will put America first.\"Over 1 million people in Michigan have already voted by mail in the November 5 election. Michigan is one of a few key swing states needed to win this election.Harris and Trump are running neck and neck in Michigan.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy Niomi Harris For Mailonline \n Published:23:36 BST, 19 October 2024 |Updated:23:41 BST, 19 October 2024 \n\nLauryn Goodman reportedly called the police on Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner over her shocking WhatsApp messages.\nThe influencer, 33, who was embroiled in a paternity scandal after the footballer secretly fathered her two children, alerted the authorities after the WAG, 33, allegedly said she wanted Lauryn 'dead' amid their ongoing feud. \nAnnie also branded Lauryn 'a s**g' and was said to have added in a furious text: 'She is going to be hated by the time I've finished.' \nA source told The Sun: 'Friends had told Lauryn about the \"I want her dead\" threat so she decided to put it on record with the police in case anything happened with her and her two children.'\nThe alleged texts were said to have been sent after Lauryn's son, Kairo, was born in 2020. \n\nLauryn Goodman reportedly called the police on Kyle Walker 's wife Annie Kilner over her shocking WhatsApp messages\n\nThe influencer, 33, alerted the authorities after the WAG, 33, [pictured] allegedly said she wanted Lauryn 'dead' amid their ongoing feud\nThe publication reports that Lauryn learned of the abusive texts in December before going on to report them to Cheshire Police in January. \n\n Kyle Walker's 'upset' wife Annie Kilner told WAG pal she 'wanted Lauryn Goodman dead' \nShe was reportedly told by officers that the issue was a 'conditional threat' and that she would have to take any further action through civil courts.\nThe report against Annie was said to have been kept on file, but she wasn't spoken to by the police. \nMailOnline have contacted representatives of Lauryn for comment.\nMeanwhile, a source told MailOnline that Annie is 'completely innocent' amid the situation and that any words said by her were not said 'with intent'.\nThe source explained: 'Annie doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry at Lauryn’s relentless need for public attention over this whole sorry saga.\n'Fortunately, she has a good sense of humour and a close circle of genuine friends, supportive family and a lot of public backing, which shines through whenever Lauryn tries to spread negativity about her. Annie is completely innocent in all of this.\n'The texts were sent back in 2020, in shock after discovering what Lauryn did, it’s mad that her friends even have to say this but they were never said with any intent. \n\nLauren was embroiled in a paternity scandal after footballer Kyle [pictured] secretly fathered her two children behind wife Annie's back\n\nAnnie also branded Lauryn 'a s**g' and was said to have added in a furious text: 'She is going to be hated by the time I've finished'\n\nFriends had told Lauryn about the \"I want her dead\" threat so she decided to put it on record with the police in case anything happened with her and her two children' \n'It’s clear to any logical person that it was just said in a fit of rage - during a private conversation between two friends who both expressed their shock and anger about the situation and the people involved.'\n\n Lauryn Goodman 'hires WAG Nicola McLean as manager in a bid to launch TV career off scandal' \nThey continued: 'As usual with Lauryn, her story doesn’t add up. Why reach out to the police after four years and no other ‘threats’ since that one, especially as she and Annie had recently had a fairly open, non-threatening conversation after Lauryn had ‘quickly told her’ that Kyle was the father of her second child.\n'Both Kyle and Annie, along with their friends, family, and a large portion of the public, are wondering when this petty drama will end so everyone can get back on track and enjoy their lives and respective children. It’s horrible that the kids have to keep reading this.'\nIt comes after Annie on Wednesday that Annie served the England star with divorce papers because she 'just can't forgive him for what he's done to her'. \nThe mother-of-four has instructed lawyers to begin legal proceedings as she prepares to fight for half of the Manchester City defender's £27million fortune.\nThe documents were served to him 10 days ago, and MailOnline understands Kyle had moved back into their family home in Cheshire - but not into Annie's bed.\nThe 34-year-old footballer, who earns an estimated £175,000 a week, is said to have been sleeping separately from Annie in a room on the third floor of the house.\n\nA source told MailOnline that Annie is 'completely innocent' amid the situation and that any words said by her were not said 'with intent' \n\nIt comes after Kyle's wife Annie Kilner instructed lawyers to begin legal proceedings as she prepares to fight for half of the Manchester City defender's £27million fortune \nThe couple separated last December after Walker was revealed to have fathered a second child with model Lauryn, who texted Annie to reveal the news.\nAs their tumultuous relationship hit a new low, a source told MailOnline: 'Things are as bad between them as they have ever been. It wasn't like a normal marriage.\n'They have barely been speaking to each other. She is divorcing Kyle because she just can't forgive him for what he's done to her. She can't get over it. She has tried. \n'Kyle seems to have accepted it's over. He's been happier in the last week or so. Like the weight of the world's been lifted from his shoulders.'\nChildhood sweethearts Kyle and Annie met in Sheffield as teenagers but the footballer has been embroiled in a series of sex scandals over the years.\nKyle WalkerAnnie KilnerLauryn Goodman\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLauryn Goodman 'reported Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner to the police over shocking WhatsApp messages'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVELiam Payne was forced to extend his trip to Argentina after his visa application to remain in the US was refused due to drug abuse\n\nStrictly fans left cringing by Wynne Evans and Katya's Jones' 'awkward' return to the dance floor following THAT 'hand incident' \n\nEXCLUSIVELiam Payne 'did not take his own life and could have been saved' says source close to family in bombshell new claim\n\nEXCLUSIVEThe seven-year-old who will inherit Liam Payne's vast fortune: Incredible sum he left Bear is revealed by KATIE HIND \n\nLauryn Goodman 'reported Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner to the police over shocking WhatsApp messages'\n\nLooking to manage your weight more effectively and feel fuller for longer?

He is expected to watch the game from a suite with Brown and Bell as well as elected officials.Brown is a controversial figure in the world of football. He has been arrested for allegedly not paying child support and also faced an arrest warrant over domestic battery allegations.

The revelation came during a conversation with Gabriel Sherman, writer of the newly released film The Apprentice, which explores Trump's rise to power and his relationship with Cohn, the infamous lawyer and fixer.Asked by Sherman if he believed he ended up filling Cohn's role for Trump, Cohen responded unequivocally: \"One hundred percent. And, in fact, I met Roy when I was a young kid when I was working in a place in Brooklyn.\"Cohn, who first gained notoriety as Senator Joseph McCarthy's chief counsel during the anti-communist hearings in Congress in the 1950s, later became a powerful New York lawyer with ties to politicians, mobsters and celebrities.He mentored the young Trump in the 1970s, teaching him aggressive legal and public relations tactics that would become hallmarks of Trump's business and political career.The timing of Cohen's admission is particularly noteworthy, coming in the wake of Trump's recent legal troubles.On May 30, a jury convicted Trump on all 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to hush money paid to former adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Daniels claimed she and Trump had sex in 2006 and that she accepted $130,000 in hush money from Cohen before the 2016 election.Trump has consistently denied any sexual involvement with Daniels, who detailed her alleged encounter with the former president in a 2018 CBS News interview. The conviction came while Trump was the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, before his confirmation at the Republican National Convention.Cohen's own legal troubles ended his role as Trump's personal attorney and fixer. He pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including campaign finance violations related to the hush money payment, and served three years in federal prison.His fall from grace mirrors, in some ways, the fate of Cohn, who was disbarred six weeks before his death in 1986 for ethical misdeeds, including stealing money from and defrauding clients.In a recent development, Cohen is now seeking damages from Trump and other federal officials who allegedly conspired to keep him in prison as punishment for writing about Trump in his memoir. Cohen's counsel, Jon-Michael Dougherty, filed a brief to the Supreme Court on October 2, asking the justices to accept the case.The brief says that Trump blocked Cohen's prison release, arguing that the government revoked Cohen's approved release to home confinement as punishment for his speech criticizing the president.\"The issue is whether the government can revoke a prisoner's approved release to home confinement as punishment for his speech criticizing the president and to prevent further such speech,\" Dougherty wrote. He compared the importance of the case to the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage in the Obergefell v. Hodges case.This legal action comes after a federal appeals court rejected Cohen's attempt to revive his lawsuit against Trump, former Attorney General Bill Barr and other Justice Department officials for allegedly retaliating against him for promoting his anti-Trump memoir.Meanwhile, The Apprentice, released on October 11, has angered the former president. Trump lashed out at the film on his social media platform, Truth Social, calling it a \"FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie\" and a \"cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job.\"Trump's campaign communications director, Steven Cheung, said in an email to Newsweek that the film was \"pure malicious defamation\" and accused the filmmakers of fabricating scenes and creating fake stories.Sherman maintains that all scenes in the movie are based on records of real events.","summary":"Cohen says he filled Cohn's role for Trump, as a new film explores the former president's relationship with the infamous lawyer.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/michael-cohen-admits-roy-cohn-donald-trump-apprentice-writer-1971731","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499502/roy-cohn-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:40:17","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":260346500,"title":"Michael Cohen Predicts Swing State That Will Be 'Called Early'","text":"Michael Cohen says Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state in the presidential election, will be \"called early\" for Vice President Kamala Harris, in a new episode of his podcast.Cohen, now a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump, previously worked as his lawyer and testified against him in his criminal hush money trial in May.During a Saturday \"Mea Culpa\" podcast episode on the left-leaning outlet MeidasTouch Network, Cohen spoke with Gabriel Sherman, the writer of \"The Apprentice\" biopic.The film, directed by Ali Abbasi, tells a version of Trump's life in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on his relationships with mentor Roy Cohn and his first wife, Ivana Trump.Trump has expressed his disapproval of the movie on his Truth Socia platform, writing \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,'\" he wrote.About forty minutes into their conversation, Sherman reflects on national polling in the presidential election, noting that most polls show Harris leading Trump in the popular vote, but \"if you look at the swing state polls, they're much closer, particularly in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\"Harris and Trump continue to fluctuate and edge out one another in swing state polls, often with leads within the margin of errors.While nationwide and aggregate polls gauge voter sentiment, the presidential election is ultimately decided by individual states and their Electoral College votes.To win the presidency, a candidate must secure 270 electoral votes, which doesn't always align with the national popular vote.State-specific victories are crucial to securing electoral votes, as seen in the 2016 election, when former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the presidency by failing to reach 270 Electoral College votes.\"I think he [Trump] loses by a bigger margin than what you think. I believe Pennsylvania will be called early in the race, because I believe that the people of Pennsylvania, and the Black community of Pennsylvania and Gen Z I think they [expletive] hate him,\" Cohen said.Pennsylvania, which boasts 19 Electoral College votes—more than any other swing state—could determine the outcome of the election. An early call is likely to signal who wins the presidency.Harris' clearest path to victory next month would be to win the three \"blue wall\" battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, barring any shock results elsewhere. Trump's most efficient path to 270 Electoral College votes would be to win the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia while flipping Pennsylvania.Cohen continued, \"My feeling is that the same now applies with Michigan,\" citing union support for Harris, although while Harris is backed by the United Auto Workers, the Teamsters and the International Association of Fire Fighters have notably declined to endorse either candidate this election.Cohen said he believes there are many people who are just agreeing with their family members in support of Trump's candidacy, \"But then they get to the polls and then they do the exact opposite,\" implying they will vote for Harris.Sherman replied, \"But in 2016 there was the 'secret' Trump vote that went the other way, right?\" In 2016, majority of polls predicted Clinton to win the White House; however, in part due to a number of silent, \"secret\" Trump voters, he pulled ahead on election night. Cohen said he believed this time they would go \"the opposite way,\" and vote for Harris.\"I do not believe that Trump will accept the defeat, he will continue because that's the grift, that's all he has got left,\" he said.Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email on Saturday.Concerns have grown over the possibility that, if Trump loses, he might reject the results, as Trump did not accept the 2020 election results, claiming was stolen from him, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud.He has repeatedly said he would accept the 2024 results only if it's a \"fair and free election,\" raising doubts about the integrity of the process.The state has extraordinary tight margins, much narrower than some national aggregate polls that show Harris with a 2-percentage point lead.The New York Times' Pennsylvania aggregate poll has Harris ahead of Trump, 49 to 48 percent while The Hill's aggregate polling puts Harris at 48.7 percent and Trump at 48.3 percent in the state.FiveThirtyEight shows a much closer race, with a 0.1 percent margin in the Keystone State with Harris slightly leading at 47.9 percent and Trump at 47.7 percent.","summary":"Michael Cohen believes Donald Trump will lose the election, with key swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan going to Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/michael-cohen-donald-trump-lose-election-swing-states-1971730","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499480/michael-cohen.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:39:21","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":260346206,"title":"Kamala Harris joined by Lizzo at campaign event; Donald Trump rallies in Pennsylvania – live","text":"Usher, an influential R&B musician and bedrock of Atlanta’s musical contributions, spoke briefly to a crowd of about 10,000 Saturday at Lakewood Amphitheater in Atlanta assembled for a campaign rally for Kamala Harris with Barack Obama.\n\nUsher did not perform, though he has two concerts scheduled in Atlanta this weekend.

They are.’\n\nBrown then went on to take aim at Democratic candidates Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, even branding the latter ‘tampon Tim’. \n\n‘Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, you really know they wanna put tampons in the boys’ bathroom,’ he added. ‘Is that crazy? That’s really insane right. \n\n‘And by the way, tampon Tim Walz, he isn’t a real football coach. He could never guard me.’\n\nThe Super Bowl winner arrived alongside fellow former Steeler, Le’Veon Bell, who donned a t-shirt featuring photos of Trump and opponent Kamala Harris with the slogan, ‘Trump or the Tramp?’ \n\nThe pair of former footballers greeted the crowd as they posed for selfies with the supporters waiting in line to enter the rally just under three hours before it is slated to begin. \n\nBrown had hinted he would be making a speech earlier this week in a social media post, which contained a screenshot of an email allegedly from Trump’s campaign. \n\n‘Time to help make REAL Change,’ he wrote alongside the photo. ‘Time to make a Difference. It is Time.’\n\nBrown has been outspoken of his support of the 45th president online, most recently accusing NBC of plotting against fellow Trump supporter Elon Musk at a Steelers game earlier this month. \n\nThe X chief had whipped Pittsburgh fans into a frenzy as he attended a prime-time game at Acrisure Stadium – a day after joining Donald Trump on stage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nDespite the 53-year-old’s attendance at the Steelers’ Week 5 matchup, Musk failed to receive the Taylor Swift treatment as NBC’s coverage didn’t appear to show him in the stands.\n\nBrown claimed the network intentionally avoiding Musk on its broadcast as a form of media censorship against Trump’s campaign.\n\n‘Another reason to get out in Vote,’ he posted. ‘Media censoring is real and will only get worse unless change.’ \n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that NBC did intentionally avoid showing Musk as Brown alleged. DailyMail.com contacted NBC Sports for comment. \n\nBrown first publicly endorsed Trump in May and even vowed to help him celebrate a second term.\n\n‘I’ll endorse Trump,’ Brown told Outkick. ‘I never met him. I have admiration for his business moves and I study his dad, Fred Trump.\n\n‘But I think Donald Trump is a good businessman, he comes from a good family and he’s been a good president.\n\nHe added: ‘You know he likes black people running campaigns, preferably football players. So Donald Trump, you heard it right here from the mouth of AB man: inauguration, send me my bag or whatever…’\n\nBrown also praised Trump for the ‘great things’ he had done ‘for a lot of my brothers in the music industry.’\n\nEven in retirement, the 35-year-old has rarely been out of the headlines due to financial issues and a string of controversial outbursts on social media which has seen him taunt the likes of Caitlin Clark and Tom Brady. \n\nJust last month, he taunted Taylor Swift amid her romance with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce. \n\nThe former wideout referred to Swift’s anatomy before appearing to suggest that Kelce should date a black woman. \n\nPrior to that, he wrote alongside a photo of Taylor and Brittany Mahomes hugging each other: ‘White People for Trump’. \n\nIt came after Brittany, the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick and close friend of the popstar, faced backlash for liking a Trump-related post. \n\nIn March, he shared what seemed to be an AI-generated cartoon image of himself in a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey, kissing the songstress , who is wearing a light blue cheerleader’s uniform.\n\n‘Move over Jizelle, what these Swifties talkin bout? #CTESPN,’ he wrote alongside the image on X, formerly known as Twitter, referring to Tom Brady’s ex-wife Gisele Bundchen.\n\nBrown appeared to be attempting to rile up Taylor’s fans, known as ‘Swifties’, who are renowned for their fierce loyalty and protectiveness of the Anti-Hero hitmaker.\n\nThe cartoon isn’t the first time Brown has used doctored images to bait a fellow NFL star as he previously used Gisele as a means to troll his former friend and teammate Brady. \n\nBrady had encouraged the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to acquire the embattled Brown in 2020 amid accusations of sexual assault and harassment, which he has since settled out of court. He even allowed Brown to stay with him in preparation for the season.\n\nA year earlier, Brady had pushed for the New England Patriots to sign Brown, only to have the team cut him after one game when the sexual misconduct allegation first surfaced.\n\nBut Brown has attacked his former teammate with the troubled star continuously blaming Brady for the end of his career.\n\nBrown antagonized Brady over his divorce from Gisele in 2022. He frequently posted photoshopped photos, suggesting that he’s having a romantic relationship with Brady’s ex.","summary":"Former NFL star Antonio Brown has continued to show his support for&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/antonio-brown-attends-donald-trumps-rally-in-pennsylvania-to-show-continued-backing-for-ex-president/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Antonio-Brown-arrives-at-Donald-Trump-rally-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:29:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":260346416,"title":"Interest On US National Debt Tops 'Astounding' $1 Trillion For First Time","text":"Interest on the U.S. national debt topped $1 trillion for the first time during fiscal 2024, as the annual budget deficit reached its highest level except during the COVID-19 pandemic.Figures released Friday by the Treasury Department show the federal government spent a $1.13 trillion on gross interest payments to holders of T-bills, notes, bonds and other securities during the 12 months that ended September.30.The record outlay represents an increase of $254 billion, or 29 percent, over fiscal 2023, which the Treasury Department said was \"largely due to higher interest rates\" set by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation.In a prepared statement, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that inflation had \"fallen more than two thirds from its peak while the labor market remains strong.\"Yellen also said outgoing President Joe Biden's proposed fiscal 2025 budget \"reduces the deficit by $3 trillion by asking corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share, while preserving our important investments in our country's future.\"The House and Senate have yet to pass budget bills and the federal government is now being financed through December 20 under terms of a continuing resolution approved last month.The head of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget think tank called the nearly $900 billion in net interest payments on the debt \"just a truly astounding figure.\"\"That's more than we spent on national defense, Medicare, and children at the federal level,\" committee president Maya MacGuineas said in a prepared statement. \"The national debt is on track to reach a record share of the economy in just two years, a sobering milestone for both the next Congress and whoever wins the presidency in November.\"Campaign promises made by Vice President Kamala Harris would add an estimated $3.5 trillion to the debt through 2035, while former President Donald Trump would more than double that amount to $7.5 trillion, according to the committee.The constantly growing national debt is now $35.8 trillion and equivalent to more than 122.3% of the nation's gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Debt Clock website.MacGuineas also blasted the government for spending $6.75 trillion during fiscal 2024, up 8 percent and resulting in a $1.83 trillion deficit.MacGuineas said the size of the budget gap meant that the government \"borrowed a whopping $5 billion on average every day.\"\"We're borrowing nearly double the amount we borrowed annually before the pandemic, and this is projected to grow indefinitely.

Michigan’s online “voting dashboard” indicated that, by Saturday morning, more than 1 million mail-in ballots had been received.\n\nIt was one of several strong showings across the country, indicating a possible surge in voter enthusiasm. States like North Carolina and Georgia have notched records for early-voting turnout this week, according to officials.\n\nThe chief operating officer for Georgia’s secretary of state, Gabriel Sterling, posted on social media that turnout continues to be high. Georgia’s first day of early voting was Tuesday.\n\n“Congratulations to the counties and especially our great Georgia voters. Y’all have broken another RECORD. Biggest turnout ever for a General Election Saturday,” Sterling wrote.\n\nWhile experts caution against extrapolating too much from the numbers, political analysts note that Democrats have traditionally seen a boost from large early turnouts.\n\nHarris sought to build on this year’s momentum during her weekend campaign stops.\n\n“Georgia started early voting, broke historic records. North Carolina started early voting, broke historic records in North Carolina. Now, who is the capital of producing records?” she told supporters in Detroit, with a winking reference to the city’s music industry.\n\n“So we are going to break some records here in Detroit today.”\n\nAddressing war in Gaza\n\nDuring her visit to Michigan, Harris also took the opportunity to repeat her call for a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has led a yearlong military campaign, killing more than 42,500 Palestinians.\n\nUS support for Israel and its war has eroded support for Democrats among Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan.\n\nThe state boasts the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the country, and it also the home of a national protest movement against the administration of President Joe Biden over its stance on the war.\n\nHarris, who has also been a recipient of that criticism, voiced hope that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza might usher in an end to hostilities.\n\n“This creates an opening that I believe we must take full advantage of — to dedicate ourselves to ending this war and bringing the hostages home,” Harris told reporters in Detroit.\n\nShe added that Middle East policy has long been a difficult issue for the US.\n\n“It has never been easy,” Harris said. “But that doesn’t mean we give up.”\n\nRazzing Trump\n\nAt her campaign rally in Detroit, Harris addressed supporters in front of “Detroit Votes Early” signs — and she and other speakers used their platform to slap back at Republican criticisms of the city.\n\nEarlier in the month, Trump cast Detroit in an unflattering light, telling the Detroit Economic Club that another Democratic president would render the entire country like the “Motor City”.\n\n“Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president,” Trump said of Harris, calling Detroit “a mess”.\n\nHarris, by contrast, took the stage on Saturday in a T-shirt that read “Detroit vs Everybody”, a slogan that has adorned clothing lines and rap songs.\n\nLizzo, meanwhile, addressed Trump’s comments more bluntly. “I’m so proud to be from this city,” she told the crowd. “You know, they say if Kamala wins, then the whole country will be like Detroit. Proud like Detroit. Resilient like Detroit.”\n\n“Put some respect on Detroit’s name,” she added.\n\nCelebrity support\n\nAnalysts in general say that the Democratic Party has been more successful in rallying star power to its cause this election cycle.\n\nHarris not only enjoys the endorsement of figures like Lizzo and Usher, but celebrities like Taylor Swift, Oprah and George Clooney have also announced their support for her since she became the presidential candidate in July.\n\nIt is not clear, however, if celebrity support actually makes a difference in a campaign. More than 76 percent of voters polled recently by Quinnipiac University said Swift’s endorsement would not affect their ballots.\n\nThe same goes for Republicans. Two-thirds of those surveyed said entrepreneur Elon Musk’s recent support for Trump would not affect their vote either.\n\nBut Democrats are nevertheless banking on the glitter of its star power.\n\nThis upcoming week, for instance, former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama are hitting the campaign trail, with only two weeks to go before the election.\n\nIt will be the first time Michelle has done the rally circuit. Barack, meanwhile, made his first campaign-trail appearance in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, earlier this month.\n\nBoth Harris and Trump are trying to squeak ahead in the crucial last few weeks of campaigning. Polling averages show the two are basically tied in the lead-up to the vote.","summary":"As Harris continues her tour through US swing states, musicians Usher and Lizzo campaign on her behalf.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/kamala-harriss-campaign-flexes-celebrity-support-in-detroit-and-atlanta?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-19T200643Z_1633001034_RC2VNAAYZMNC_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-HARRIS-1729374762.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:10:50","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.158},{"id":260344818,"title":"‘Weak and pathetic’: Trump seethes as Mark Cuban campaigns for Harris","text":"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday railed against fellow billionaire Mark Cuban, who has been vigorously campaigning for his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“Mark Cuban is a Loser,” Trump wrote in a Saturday Truth Social post. “Wouldn’t take his phone calls anymore while at the White House, and he went rogue. A weak and pathetic ‘bully,’ he’s got nothing going.

As part of an in-depth series, Jevans Nyabiage takes a look at whether Africa is expecting a president with African heritage to benefit the continent.\nWiping away tears, US Vice-President Kamala Harris walked around Cape Coast Castle on a visit to Ghana last year. The centuries-old fort has a tortured history as a holding prison for slaves before they were forced onto ships to sail to the Americas.\n“The horror of what happened here must always be remembered,” Harris said during the emotional tour. “History must be learned.”\nAcross hundreds of years, African people were kidnapped, tortured, starved and crowded onto ships at Cape Coast Castle for the long and dangerous ocean voyage to the Americas and the Caribbean.\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian-born mother and a Jamaican-born father, used the visit to speak of her connection to the African continent – also talking about her time as a young girl visiting Zambian capital Lusaka, where her grandfather lived.\n“Because of this history, this continent, of course, has a special significance for me personally as the first black vice-president of the United States of America,” she said.\nWhile Harris’ black heritage may be winning over African-American voters in the race with former president Donald Trump for the White House, any hope that her potential win would also see drastic change in US policy towards the African continent is a matter for debate, according to observers.\nIn fact, they say, if Africa has learned anything from recent history, it is that regardless of who is sitting in the Oval Office, Africa will be set firmly in the “periphery” of their US foreign policy vision.\n\nX.N. Iraki, an economics professor at the University of Nairobi, said Africans had come to realise that the US president may not change Africa as much as expected.\n“Obama didn’t change Africa that much and we can’t talk of Obama’s dividends. Yet Obama was closer to Africa than Harris,” Iraki said of former US president Barack Obama, the son of a white American mother and a black Kenyan father.\nLooking at Harris and Trump, he said both candidates’ policies took care of American interests and were unlikely to change much for African countries.\n“Despite Trump being outspoken, with ‘s***holes’, it’s unlikely that there will be a drastic shift in American policy towards Africa, unless as a reaction to China,” Iraki said, referring to remarks then-president Trump made in 2018, in which he called Haiti, El Salvador and African countries “s***holes”.\nMeanwhile, since US President Joe Biden left the race and Harris became the Democratic presidential candidate, her support among black registered voters has increased significantly, according to Francis Owusu, a professor of community and regional planning at Iowa State University. He referenced the results of a September poll by Pew Research Centre which showed that 84 per cent of black voters would vote for Harris.\nAlthough most African-Americans historically vote for the Democratic Party during presidential elections, they are not a monolithic voting bloc. Neither were they one-issue voters, he said.\nHowever, he said, the Harris poll figure was lower than the 92 per cent of black Americans who voted for Joe Biden in 2020.\nConversely, if Trump won, Africa would anticipate a continuation of his previous laissez-faire approach towards the continent, according to Gustavo de Carvalho, a senior researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs.\nHis ‘America first’ agenda and inclination towards isolationism suggest that Africa would not be a priority in his foreign policy\nGustavo de Carvalho, senior researcher\nDuring Trump’s previous term from 2017 to 2021, US policy towards Africa was put on the back burner, as “America first” rhetoric took centre stage.\n“His America first agenda and inclination towards isolationism suggest that Africa would not be a priority in his foreign policy,” de Carvalho said. “This could potentially widen the gap in US-Africa relations, especially in light of the growing influence of China.”\nHe said Trump’s past rhetoric and lack of engagement with the continent could further erode trust among its leaders, diminishing US leverage in Africa, which has already been in decline.\nBut if Trump’s approach to Africa would be defined by disinterest, Harris’ approach would be likely to follow Biden’s – treating African countries as pawns in a geopolitical tug of war, according to de Carvalho.\nHarris had little foreign policy experience before becoming vice-president in 2021. If she wins in November, she is expected to carry on Biden’s established Africa policy, which is largely focused on countering growing Chinese and Russian influence through US investment and funding for infrastructure, agriculture, health and security.\nBut it is a policy fraught with risks.\n“This transactional dynamic has the potential to weaken long-term partnerships with African states,” de Carvalho said.\n\nIt was the Biden administration that partnered with Group of Seven (G7) nations to launch the US$600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) – to challenge China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\nAs part of PGII, Washington is bankrolling the refurbishment of the 1,300km (800-mile) Lobito Corridor railway, which runs from the port of Lobito, on the Angolan Atlantic Ocean coast, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and within reach of northwest Zambia. The US is also mobilising funding for a greenfield railway extension to copper-rich Zambia. Tanzania has recently signed a deal with the US, allowing the extension of the railway to the Indian coast of Tanzania.\nThe White House says it has since mobilised about US$3 billion for the Lobito Corridor – Washington’s largest infrastructure financing in Africa for decades. Biden was set to visit Angola on October 13-15, but the trip was cancelled.\nAfrica also hopes to renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), set to expire in 2025, which was established in 2000 by then-president Bill Clinton to provide duty-free access to the US market for African products – important for growing trade and investment ties.\nBut since 2009, China has been Africa’s largest trading partner. China is also Africa’s largest bilateral lender, funding belt and road mega-projects such as ports, highways and hydropower dams.\nAt the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in Beijing in September, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged US$51 billion in investment in Africa over three years.\nMeanwhile, during US-Africa Leaders summit in Washington in 2022, Biden pledged US$55 billion in financing and investment to Africa over three years. It was one of the most expansive US commitments to Africa ever seen.\nWith Beijing’s influence in Africa firmly established, the US has also ramped up visits by senior officials, including the secretary of state, treasury secretary, first lady – and Harris’ 2023 visit in her capacity as vice-president.\nHer tour of Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia last year aimed to not only strengthen relations with African countries but to promote open societies with a particular focus on women’s empowerment and LGBTQ rights.\n“A push for LGBTQ rights by the Harris administration will continue to be a sore point in the relationship,” Owusu of Iowa State University said.\n\nSteven Gruzd, a programme head at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), a think tank in Johannesburg, said a second Trump term would be likely to ignore Africa and its concerns, or see it purely in terms of security and rivalry with China and Russia.\nOn the other hand, a Harris presidency “would represent continuity with the Biden administration”, according to Gruzd.\n“But I still do not expect African issues to be near the top of her agenda either – especially with wars in the Middle East and Ukraine,” he said.\nThe US is such a significant player in the global economic and security architecture that most African leaders would always want to be on good terms with whoever was in the White House, according to W. Gyude Moore, a non-resident fellow at the Washington-based Centre for Global Development and a former -public works minister in Liberia.\n“Comparing the Trump administration and the Biden-Harris approaches to Africa, it would follow that most Africans will hold higher hopes for more substantive engagement from Harris than Trump,” Moore said, adding that both candidates had centred their campaigns around domestic politics and, when veering into international affairs, China and the Middle East were the main focus.\n“There is not much bandwidth dedicated to Africa or Africa-specific policies. Our best bet is to assume that a Harris administration will be similar to the Biden administration in its approach to Africa,” Moore said. “Under a second Trump administration, it would appear that we will see more of the same as the first Trump administration.”\n\nCarlos Lopes, a professor at the Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, said many Africans and members of the diaspora recognised that Washington’s approach was largely driven by geostrategic interests rather than any genuine partnership model.\n“The perception is that Harris, like her predecessors, will not bring any transformative changes to the US-Africa relationship,” Lopes said.\nHe said this scepticism was amplified by the continuity in policy between Democratic and Republican administrations, where Africa often becomes a focus only when it aligns with US security or economic concerns, rather than as a priority for its own developmental or political aspirations.\n“Harris, therefore, may not carry the same hope and expectations as president Obama once did. Even Obama disappointed, which makes Africans cautious about her potential impact,” Lopes said.\nRecently, Lopes said, the US relations with Africa had been characterised by a dual focus on security – particularly through a militarised lens that emerged post-September 11 under President George W. Bush – and countering China’s influence in the region.\n“Whether it’s Trump or Harris, Africa remains on the periphery of US foreign policy priorities, with the actual impact likely to be minimal,” Lopes said.","summary":"Regardless of who wins the coming US presidential election, it is unlikely to change much for African countries, experts say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3281950/harris-or-trump-what-do-us-presidential-candidates-offer-africa","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/19/e8ecb6f7-07bc-4afd-b14c-3fdc64a9e955_d4c9734f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:00:08","author":"Jevans Nyabiage","authors":["Jevans Nyabiage"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":260344894,"title":"Donald Trump Was Banned From a Victoria's Secret Shoot Held at His Own Resort: \"You Can't Come...\"","text":"As a New York businessman in the 1990s, Donald Trump was a heartthrob and even had a reputation for getting uncomfortably close to curvy models. A book by Lauren Sherman and Chantal cites a Dutch model who recalls when Victoria's Secret approached Trump to shoot their campaign at his Mar-a-Lago resort, they banned him from looking at the glitz and glam. \n\nFrederique van der Wal, the Dutch model who knew Trump socially, put one condition, \"I said, the only thing is, you have to sign a contract that you can't come [to watch the shoot].\" The book further confirms that European beauty posed at Mar-a-Lago doorway but Trump was \"not lingering around,\" as per Daily Mail. Van der Wal's request to Trump suggests he fancied models back then. Meanwhile, some young models shared their incidents when he owned the Miss USA beauty pageants. For instance, former Miss Arizona Tasha Dixon complained that Trump would enter her dressing room when she was a contestant in 2001 when she had nothing on. \"He just came strolling right in,\" she recalled in 2016. \"There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.\" \n\nFormer Miss New Hampshire Bridget Sullivan echoed the same complaint to BuzzFeed News in May 2016 that it was \"shocking\" for her to see Trump casually coming in and invading their privacy while they were still getting ready to hit the runway. \"The time that he walked through the dressing rooms was really shocking. We were all naked,\" Sullivan said.\n\nLater, Trump corroborated these claims in 2005 on The Howard Stern Show saying that he carelessly walked backstage while the models were still getting changed. \"I'll tell you the funniest is that I'll go backstage before a show and everyone's getting dressed,\" the ex-president told Stern. \n\nThe 78-year-old explained, \"No men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. … 'Is everyone OK?' You know, they're standing there with no clothes. 'Is everybody OK?' And you see these incredible-looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that.\" \n\nIn the 1990s, being the heir to a multi-millionaire empire, Trump had access to high-profile soirees. He even hosted several competitions involving young, aspiring models who traveled from around the world. For instance, in 1991, he sponsored Casablancas's competition. He opened the gates of his lavish, chateau-style hotel into the main venue, accommodated the models, and was among the 10 other judges. \n\nHe hosted the competition again in 1992. The young models were boarded in an elite cruise. One of the girls on board was Shawna Lee, then a 14-year-old from a small town outside Toronto, who recalled that the contestants were encouraged to go downstairs and dance for Trump one by one. Lee recalled, \"A woman at the agency was pushing me. I said to her, 'I don't see why me going down the stairs and dancing has anything to do with me becoming a model.' I knew in my gut it wasn't right. This wasn't being judged or part of the competition – it was for their entertainment,\" per The Guardian.","summary":"Donald Trump hosted and sponsored a competition in 1992 where the young models were encouraged to dance for him one by one.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-was-banned-from-a-victorias-secret-shoot-held-at-his-own-resort-you-cant-come","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/720667/uploads/b309d7c0-8d0e-11ef-9748-a1e3f2dc69e9_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:00:00","author":"INQUISITR,Juwairiya Shariq","authors":["INQUISITR","Juwairiya Shariq"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":260344614,"title":"Day in Photos: G7 Summit Protest, Train Derailment, and Fallen Cyclist","text":"Residents participate in early voting at a community center in Detroit, Mich., on Oct. 19, 2024.

What about this? Oh, y’all under attack,’” Wood said. “Men are being under attack … there always seems to be a new fear log to throw on the fire of ‘why you should vote for me.’ As a man, I want to know what’s under attack. I’m feeling good.”\n\n“Men have been oppressed for a long time,” Abby Phillip cut in. “I mean look, maybe he’s right though, that this is really what his campaign is about.”\n\nShermichael Singleton pointed to voter trends as a possible explanation for Trump’s message. “Since the end of President Obama’s second term, you’ve seen men slowly leaving the Democratic Party. I think there is an argument to make that some Democratic intellectuals have talked a lot about men being more vulnerable when I think men naturally are more stoic, more competitive.”\n\nTrump’s messaging is a callback to ideas surrounding “traditional masculinity,” Singleton added. “I think a lot of men will look at — I think a lot of conservative men will look at the Democrats… I think the critique would be from Republicans that Democrats are arguing for a new manliness, and Republicans will say, ‘No, we are protecting traditional masculinity.’ And I think there’s an argument to be made there.”\n\n“PoliticsGirl” creator Leigh McGowan entered the conversation as someone who “is married to a man, is raising a man, and is not a man” as she made her case. “First of all, I think it’s hilarious. We’re talking about manhood when women are the ones being attacked across the country, I find that hilarious. We’re the ones whose rights are under attack,” McGowan began.\n\n“But secondly, I think it goes back to how you define a man… I think that we have bred out of men a lot of their instincts that they have when they’re young,” she continued. “When you’re young, you have these close friendships, you have all of these relationships with other people, and then as you get older, you’re supposed to keep it all in and keep it all together. And that’s probably why men end up shooting people, shooting themselves, why there’s an epidemic of loneliness.”\n\n“There is a different way for men to react in our world that is not so alone, that is not so stoic, that is not so buttoned up. And we could open up the world to that, and then we would maybe not be having to talk about the death of manhood,” McGowan continued.\n\nTrump’s thoughts on manhood and maleness represent the “hypermasculine cult of personality,” MSNBC’s Ja’han Jones wrote in early October. In such a system, “men are encouraged to remain stoic, inflict harm on others and ignore experts in favor of the advice of tough-talking podcasters.” The risks of this type of masculinity are many, including higher rates of suicide and deaths by guns.\n\n“And the MAGA movement has done a great deal to discourage men from receiving the mental health care and attention they need to thrive,” Jones added. “We see this in the right-wing attack on suicide prevention programs and ‘social and emotional learning’ programs in school, which experts have used to help boys better process their emotions. Evidence shows that fear and stigmatization make men less likely to receive the mental health care they need.”\n\nYou can watch the roundtable from CNN in the video above.","summary":"Leigh McGowan adds on CNN that an alternate path for men needs to be shown to the world — “then we would maybe not be having to talk about the death of manhood”\n\n\nThe post Roy Wood Jr. Questions Trump&#8217;s Insistence That Men Are Under Attack: &#8216;I&#8217;m Feeling Good&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/roy-wood-jr-questions-trump-men-under-attack/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/roy-wood-jr-masculinity.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:54:24","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":260344176,"title":"Trump Calls VP Harris’s Common Allergies ‘Deeply Serious Conditions’","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump (L) posted on Truth Social about US Vice President Kamala ... [+] Harris's (R) history of allergies. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nOn October 15, Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump offered shall we say a rather rash assessment of the health of his Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. Three days prior, Joshua Simmons, MD, the physician to the Vice President, had released a letter listing his medical assessment of Harris. In response to this, former President Trump posted the following on Truth Social: “I have just seen Kamala’s Report, and it is not good. According to her Doctor’s Report, she suffers from ‘urticaria,’ defined as ‘a rash of round, red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling.’” Yep, Trump was buzzing about Harris having hives, which is basically what urticaria is.\n\nTrump’s reaction ran on with something that hit right on the nose (and eyes): “She also has ‘allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis,’ a very messy and dangerous situation. These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.” You can see the rest of his Truth Social post here:\n\nFrom Truth Social\nFrom Truth Social\n\nYikes, a very messy and dangerous situation? Deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning? Should all of this cause concern? It’s gotta be truth, right, because it is on something called Truth Social. Well, let’s take a medical, scientific look at what these conditions really are.\n\nOK, no one can deny that having a runny nose can be a very messy situation. You’ve got to get tissues, sometimes a lot of tissues. And if you leave these tissues crumpled up all over the place like on the floor, then it could get messy and dangerous as someone could slip and fall.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhat To Know About Liam Payne’s Death: Cowell, Cole And Shawn Mendes React\n\nMicrosoft Windows Deadline—10 Days To Update Or Stop Using Your PC\n\nTesla Cybertruck Gets Massive Price Cut For Both AWD And Cyberbeast\n\nAllergic rhinitis is basically when you have an irritated—often red, itchy and runny— nose from allergies. Rhinitis starts with the Greek root “rhino,” which in this case is not a political term but rather stands for “nose” as in that thing in the middle of your face. It ends with the suffix “itis,” which stands for inflammation. Therefore, rhinitis simply means inflammation of the nose, meaning the inside of the nose.\n\nAllergic rhinitis a very common condition. It typically results from an allergic reaction to something floating in the air like pollen, dust, mold, skin flakes from different animals or some kind of cologne like one branded by a Presidential candidate.\n\nIs this a “deeply serious condition” like, oh, how about Covid-19? You know, that thing that some politicians were trying to minimize in 2020. Umm, you don’t often hear someone say, “We took her to the hospital but she didn’t make it because her nose just kept running form allergies?” Sure, allergic rhinitis in some cases can cause result in symptoms that impeded daily activities. But in many situations, people can make lifestyle modifications to avoid the allergens like buying an air purifier. They also may use some combination of over-the-counter medications like antihistamines, decongestants and nasal corticosteroid sprays to manage the symptoms. If symptoms remain unmanageable, they may see a doctor for more involved treatments such as allergy shots.\n\nThe same kind of medical management applies to allergic conjunctivitis. That’s also an allergic reaction, except the eyes have it. The conjunctiva is a thin and clear membrane that lines the inside of your eyelid and the white part of your eye. Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of this membrane, which can lead to red, itchy and watery eyes.\n\nYou know what else can result from allergies? Urticaria, which is a medical term for hives. Around 20 percent of people will suffer urticaria at some point in their lives, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Hives are when you develop red or skin-colored rashes that are itchy and raised. They can have little bumps, otherwise known as wheals. These rashes tend to blanch—meaning turn white—when pressed.\n\nNow, while urticaria can be “whealy” uncomfortable, you don’t tend to hear people say, “Oh, she can’t do that job because of urticaria,” unless the job is something like working in a latex factory or modeling latex outfits when the allergic trigger is latex. Typically, people will deal with urticaria by avoiding what happens to be triggers for them such as foods like peanuts, eggs, nuts and shellfish, medications, insect stings or bites, temperature changes, physical activity, sun exposure, infections, pet dander or pollen. Anti-histamines and steroid cremes may help too. As with allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, a doctor can help identify the triggers and determine how to best manage symptoms.\n\nOne thing that’s clear from Simmons’ letter is that Harris has had a history of allergies. The letter indicated that, “Her allergic symptoms primarily consist of allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis and have previously been well-managed with over-the-counter and prescription medications such as Allegra (fexofenadine), Atrovent (ipratropium bromide) nasal spray and Pataday (olopatadine) eye drops.” He also wrote, “The urticaria are sporadic and transient and do not seem to be triggered by a particular exposure nor are they associated with other symptoms.” The letter emphasized that these symptoms have responded well to common medications and that “she has never experienced severe symptoms, angioedema, or anaphylaxis.”\n\nSo all in all, what Simmons wrote about Harris’s allergies doesn’t really deserve that much of a reaction, so to speak.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Brown spent the majority of his career in Pittsburgh as a star for the Steelers, before a controversial exit from the team. He returned to the city to a cheering crowd as he \"looks to make a positive difference.\" The former All-Pro wide receiver took the stage at a rally to deliver a speech on behalf of Trump, while mocking Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. \"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, did you really know they want to put tampons in the boys' bathroom?\" Brown asked the crowd. \"That's really insane, right?\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Walz, the governor of Minnesota since 2019, earned the nickname \"Tampon Tim\" from Republican opponents in 2023 after Walz signed a Minnesota law that mandates tampons be provided free of charge in public schools \"to all menstruating students in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12,\" including male students. The Harris-Walz campaign has also made an effort to tie Walz's stint as an assistant coach of the Mankato West High School football team in Minnesota in the 1990s to his candidacy. During Walz's tenure as an assistant on the staff, the team won a state championship in 1999. But Brown showed no respect for the former assistant's short coaching career during his speech Saturday. \"And, by the way, Tampon Tim Walz, he isn't a real football coach. He could never guard me,\" Brown said. \"Business will be booming going against Tampon Tim Walz.\" Brown even brought to the stage former Steelers teammate Le'Veon Bell, who showed his support for Trump with a T-shirt. Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl champion, played the first nine years of his career in Pittsburgh, before a feud with former quarterback Ben Roethlisberger resulted in him being traded to the Raiders in 2019. During Saturday's speech, Brown gave a shoutout to Roethlisberger, saying he was still his \"favorite quarterback.\" Brown was out of the NFL for most of 2019 and the start of the 2020 season after a string of controversies in 2019, including allegations of sexual assault. But Brown returned to join Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, helping the Buccaneers win the 2021 Super Bowl during the COVID-19 pandemic. Brown's career with Tampa Bay ended after he threw his equipment into the crowd during a game against the New York Jets in Week 17 of the 2021 season. He hasn't played in the NFL since. Multiple arrest warrants have been issued since then for Brown, who has devoted his time to controversial social media activity and forming his own unofficial brand he calls \"CTESPN,\" which he says is meant to explore the traumas that athletes have been through. Brown has suggested he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), due to repeated brain injuries from football, and that his erratic behavior is a result of the disease. FORMER NFL STAR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER ANTONIO BROWN JOINS VOTER-REGISTRATION EFFORT IN KEY SWING STATE CTE is a degenerative brain disease that can develop after repeated concussions or other traumatic brain injuries. The disease can cause behavioral and mood problems and difficulty thinking and can also lead to dementia. However, CTE can only be diagnosed with a brain autopsy after someone has died. Many of Brown's fans live in western Pennsylvania and could cast critical votes in November. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Brown has been a vocal supporter of former President Trump throughout the current election cycle. The former football star said in May he would endorse Trump during an interview with OutKick's Nick Adams, praising the former president's background and contributions to figures in the hip-hop industry. \"I've never met him. I've got admiration for his business moves, and I study his dad, Fred Trump. But I think Donald Trump is a good businessman and come[s] from a good family and has been a good president,\" Brown said. \"I think he does some great things for my brothers in the music industry in regards to Lil Wayne, Kodak [Black].\" Brown has frequently expressed his support for Trump through memes and more straightforward political messaging on his social media platforms. After the assassination attempt on Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July, Brown commended the former president for his resilience. \"Cue up Many Men by 50 and we gonna win the presidency in a landslide F---ing Legend of the Decade,\" Brown wrote on X. Brown announced he would be joining the voter registration effort in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, Oct. 4. He has ramped up his pro-Trump messaging on social media since then and has even met with Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and Donald Trump Jr. A new Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters finds Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by two points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. Trump’s most loyal followers include men, Whites without a college degree, independents and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July.

Members of the group live in over 190 countries, according to its website.The Windsor, Canada, chapter of Democrats Abroad, based near the border between Michigan and Canada, has canvassed voters in the Detroit-Windsor area, hitting 1,000 doors ahead of the final weeks and with plans to hit another 1,500 before November.\"We have been getting a great deal of support and encouragement and very little resistance,\" David Shelton of the Windsor Chapter told columnist Jason Sattler, a member of the USA Today Board of Contributors from 2017 to 2021. \"I find this notable because we are 'cold knocking' at every door on the streets we select.\"Democrats Abroad believes that Windsor could have over 20,000 eligible American voters. The group points to the previous presidential election, in which states such as Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin were decided by tens of thousands of votes.Democrats Abroad UK has rolled out its own initiative to try to tap the 200,000 or more voters living in London and other major British cities. The group has put up ads in bus stops and other high-traffic areas, but it has also looked to digital initiatives to reach voters and let them know they have a say in their homeland's election, according to The Guardian.The group has also looked to tap overseas university students, with many studying in Oxford, Cambridge or St. Andrews.Trump has made overtures to these voters, offering tax breaks to Americans living overseas during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club earlier this month.\"You have to make sure that you are registered and you are going to vote because I'm going to take very good care of you,\" he said in a video posted by Republicans Overseas CEO Solomon Yue.However, the Republican Party has filed a series of lawsuits in battleground states aimed at isolating the overseas votes. A lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania demands that courts set aside all overseas ballots—including those from military voters—for additional verification, according to ABC News.\"We are already hearing military voters from all states who feel discouraged from participating, if they have concern that their ballot won't even be counted,\" Sarah Streyder, who is stationed in England because her husband serves in the Space Force, told reporters.State officials have said the lawsuits represent nothing more than \"an attempt to confuse and frighten people ahead of an important election,\" assuring that any ballots sent out are eligible.","summary":"Both political parties look to eligible U.S. voters living abroad, including those in Canada.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-republicans-court-overseas-voters-election-1971720","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499496/voting-polling-location.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:34:10","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":260344058,"title":"Kamala Harris, Lizzo Praise Detroit Ahead of Atlanta Rally With Usher","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris appeared with Lizzo on Saturday (Oct. 19) in the singer’s hometown of Detroit, marking the beginning of in-person voting and lavishing the city with praise after Republican nominee Donald Trump recently disparaged it.\n\n “All the best things were made in Detroit. Coney Dogs, Faygo and Lizzo,” the singer joked to a rally crowd, pointing to herself after listing off the meat-on-a-stick and soda that the city is famous for.\n\n She said it was time to “put some respect on Detroit’s name” noting that the city had revolutionized the auto and music industries and adding that she’d already cast her ballot for Harris since voting early was “a power move.”\n\n Heaps of praise for the Motor City came after Trump, the former president, insulted it during a recent campaign stop. And Harris continued the theme, saying of her campaign, “Like the people of Detroit, we have grit, we have excellence, we have history.”\n\n Arms wide open as she took the stage, Harris let the crowd see she was wearing under her blazer a “Detroit vs. Everybody” T-shirt that the owner of the business that produces them gave her during a previous stop in the city earlier in the week. She also moved around the stage during her speech with a hand-held mic, not using a teleprompter.\n\n More than 1 million Michigan residents have already voted by mail in the Nov. 5 election, and Harris predicted that Detroit turnout for early voting would be strong. \n\n “Who is the capital of producing records?” Harris asked when imploring the crowd to set new highs for early voting tallies. “We are going to break some records here in Detroit today.” \n\n She slammed Trump as unstable: “Somebody just needs to watch his rallies, if you’re not really sure how to vote.” \n\n “We’re not going to get these 17 days back. On Election Day, we don’t want to have any regrets,” the vice president said.\n\n Lizzo also told the crowd, “Mrs. Commander-in-Chief has a nice ring to it.”\n\n “This is the swing state of all swing states, so every last vote here counts,” the singer said. Then, referencing her song of the same title, Lizzo added, “If you ask me if America is ready for its first woman president, I only have one thing to say: It’s about damn time!”\n\n Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement that Harris needed Lizzo “to hide the fact that Michiganders were feeling good under President Trump – real wages were higher, prices were lower, and everyone was better off.”\n\n Talona Johnson, a product manager from Rochester, Michigan, attended Harris’ rally and said that Harris “and her team are doing the things that are required to make sure that people are informed.”\n\n “I believe she’s telling the truth. She’s trying to help the people,” said Johnson, who said she planned to vote for Harris and saw women’s rights as her top concern.\n\n “I don’t necessarily agree with everything that she’s put out, but she’s better than the alternative.”\n\n In comments to reporters prior to the rally, Harris said she was in Detroit “to thank all the folks for the work they are doing to help organize and register people to vote, and get them out to vote today. She also called Detroit “a great American city” with “a lot of hard-working folks that have grit and ambition and deserve to be respected.”\n\n The vice president was asked about whether the Biden administration’s full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza might hurt her support in Michigan. Dearborn, near Detroit, is the largest city with an Arab majority in the nation.\n\n “It has never been easy,” Harris said of Middle East policy. “But that doesn’t mean we give up.”\n\n She will get more star power later Saturday when she holds a rally in Atlanta featuring another wildly popular singer, Usher.\n\n Early voting is also underway in Georgia. More than 1.2 million ballots have been cast, either in person or by mail. Democrats hope an expansive organizing effort will boost Harris against Trump in the campaign’s final weeks.\n\n Roderick Williams, 56, brought his three daughters to Harris’ Atlanta rally. His youngest daughter was born around the time former president Barack Obama entered office, and he hopes they can witness history again by seeing Harris become the first Black woman to be president.\n\n “It’s important for them to see that anything’s possible,” Williams said.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris appeared with Lizzo on Saturday (Oct. 19) in the singer’s hometown of Detroit, marking the beginning of in-person voting and lavishing the city with praise after Republican nominee Donald Trump recently disparaged it. “All the best things were made in Detroit.

It illustrates the long-term challenges faced by a hegemonic power as it plays a leading role in maintaining international order. The hegemon shoulders the burden of providing global public goods at great cost.\nOver time, however, the cost of sustaining the international status quo can exceed the benefits, creating a discrepancy between the hegemon’s power and its commitments. In such a situation, the hegemonic power can face the dilemma of balancing the provision of global public goods and constraints on its resources. The Gilpin dilemma also applies to the shifting influence in the international monetary system.\nThe 2024 US presidential election is likely to be one of the most fiercely contested in recent American history. This also fundamentally reflects the challenges the country faces in navigating its strategic choices amid the Gilpin dilemma.\nWhile both major political parties aim to preserve US hegemony and safeguard core national interests, their divergent strategies are likely to produce different outcomes. Democratic Party nominee and US Vice-President Kamala Harris is expected to largely continue US President Joe Biden’s multilateral approach, aiming to uphold the existing global order and maintain the role of public goods provider.\nIn contrast, the unilateralism of former US president Donald Trump – the Republican Party’s nominee – seeks to scale back this role, highlighting a divergence in strategies on how to sustain US hegemony. The provision of global public goods spans political, economic and military dimensions, but at its core lies the calculus of maintaining the dominance of the US dollar and maximising the benefits of the dollar’s status while managing the costs of upholding this position.\n\nFrom the perspective of foreign and military policy, Biden advocates strengthening international cooperation with allies and reinforcing the US position in global institutions. His aim is to preserve the stability of the global financial system and support the dollar-centric international monetary framework. In contrast, Trump favours reducing US engagement in international organisations and key agreements.\nWhile Biden’s positioning in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a defender of international justice and order has provided a boost to the US dollar’s standing, his reliance on sanctions and a perceived double standard over Israel’s conduct in its war in Gaza have somewhat undermined the effectiveness of these efforts.\nHowever, Biden’s diplomatic and military strategy is likely to be more favourable for maintaining the dollar’s global status in the long run, as political and military alliances are indispensable for the formation of today’s US dollar hegemony.\nIn terms of trade and economic policy, Harris is expected to broadly adhere to the major policy directions of the Biden administration while Trump’s campaign platform includes a pledge to “keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency”. Even so, his specific economic policy orientation could inadvertently undermine the dollar’s status.\n\nFirst, on the fiscal policy front, Biden’s revised fiscal budget proposes an additional reduction of about US$3 trillion in the federal deficit in the next 10 years. In contrast, Trump promises sweeping tax cuts without meaningful reductions to social security spending.\nHe also proposes a universal 10 per cent tariff on imported goods, a 60 per cent or higher tariff on imports from China and even a “100 per cent tariff” on countries moving away from using the US dollar. While these measures might temporarily boost demand for dollars by driving up inflation, they could also exacerbate the US debt burden and push more countries away from relying on the dollar.\nSecond, Trump’s stance on immigration is markedly tougher. While immigration policy might not directly affect the dollar’s global standing, it could indirectly undermine its position by affecting the country’s economic growth, technological innovation, international relations and global capital flows.\nThird, the Biden administration’s strategy to diversify supply chains, promote climate cooperation and advance technological innovation aims to uphold sustainable global economic development, thereby indirectly supporting the dollar’s international status.\nIn contrast, Trump’s rejection of climate change, staunch backing of the fossil fuel industry and withdrawal from the Paris climate accord undermine US leadership on these critical issues, indirectly weakening the dollar’s standing on the global stage.\n\nFourth, on the subject of cryptocurrency, Harris is expected to introduce a regulatory framework for digital assets such as bitcoin. On the other hand, Trump’s looser approach to regulation of cryptocurrencies could accelerate the trend towards decentralisation.\nOverall, the Democratic Party’s strategy is more forward-looking in terms of preserving US dollar hegemony and managing the strategy of public goods provision. However, for a hegemonic power facing the prospect of close elections and the Gilpin dilemma, such predictions are fraught with uncertainty, especially considering the dynamic nature of policies and the intricacies of their impact.\nFor instance, Trump’s tariffs might raise the cost of imported goods, but if the US remains committed to diversifying supply chains across the globe, this could also unlock stronger economic growth and improve the trade balance, thereby being beneficial to the dollar’s power.\nMeanwhile, Biden’s meticulous layout of sanctions and strategic moves in Russia’s war in Ukraine requires a high degree of control over the situation. If not handled deftly, it could ultimately have a weakening effect on the dollar’s standing.","summary":"While Democrats and Republicans aim to maintain core US interests, their plans could produce wildly different economic outcomes.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3282577/how-harris-and-trump-will-seek-preserve-us-dollar-hegemony","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/17/497d800a-44fc-46a3-a5ba-46047a5fa161_b8714620.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:30:07","author":"Shanshan Li","authors":["Shanshan Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.374},{"id":260344566,"title":"Cuba making slow progress restarting power after second grid collapse","text":"Cuba's government said on Saturday it had made some progress in gradually re-establishing electrical service across the island, including to hospitals and parts of the capital Havana, after state-run media earlier reported the national grid had collapsed for a second time in 24 hours.\n\nMost of Cuba's 10 million people, however, remained without electricity on Saturday afternoon.\n\nTraffic lights were dark at intersections throughout Havana, and most commerce was halted. Long lines formed at state-subsidized shops where Cubans purchase bread and other staples.\n\nThe country's top electricity official, Lazaro Guerra, said grid operator UNE was working to raise enough capacity in the system to start several power plants and restore electricity to larger swathes of the country.\n\n\"I cannot assure you that we will be able to complete linking the system today, but we are estimating that there should be important progress today,\" Guerra said on a TV newscast.\n\nCubaDebate, one of the island's state-run media outlets, said on social media Saturday morning that UNE had reported another grid collapse.\n\nGuerra has not directly confirmed the second total collapse and referred instead to a smaller, more localized setback, creating confusion as to what had happened.\n\nCuba's electrical grid first failed around midday on Friday after one of the island's largest power plants shut down.\n\nEven before the grid's collapse, an electricity shortfall on Friday had forced the Communist-run government to send non-essential state workers home and cancel school for children as it sought to conserve fuel for power generation.\n\nLights began to flicker on in pockets of the island early Friday evening, offering hope that power would be restored.\n\nCuba's government has blamed weeks of worsening blackouts - often as long as 10 to 20 hours a day across much of the island - on deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand.\n\nStrong winds that began with Hurricane Milton last week had also complicated Cuba's ability to deliver scarce fuel from boats offshore to feed its power plants, officials have said.\n\nHurricane Oscar, north of the Dominican Republic, threatened to bring heavy rains and strong winds to parts of northeastern Cuba in the coming days, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nCuba also blames the U.S. trade embargo, as well as sanctions under former President Donald Trump, for ongoing difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate and maintain its oil-fired plants.\n\n\"There are those who sing victory and join the ambition of seeing Cuba on its knees with the interruption of the electrical system,\" said foreign vice minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio on X on Saturday.\n\n\"They support the ruthless U.S. aggression ... We respond with the talent and commitment of our (grid) workers and executives.\"\n\nThe United States on Friday denied any role in Cuba's grid collapse.\n\nCuban officials have said even if the immediate grid collapse is resolved, the electricity crisis will continue.\n\nCuba produces little of its own crude oil, and fuel deliveries to the island have dropped significantly this year, as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once important suppliers, have reduced their exports to Cuba.\n\nAlly Venezuela slashed by half its deliveries of subsidized fuel to Cuba this year, forcing the island to search for more costly oil on the spot market.\n\nSome Cubans, accustomed to hardship, said they were taking the crisis in stride.\n\nRené Duarte, 60, strolled through Old Havana on a rainy Saturday morning to get fresh air, he said, after a night of little sleep.\n\n\"We're used to taking everything in stride, because we have no other choice,\" he said.\n\nFollowing Hurricane Ian in September 2022, Cuba's grid collapsed, leaving the entire country without power for several days.\n\nAuthorities eventually re-established service, but not before protests broke out in various cities, including Havana.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Cuba's government said on Saturday it had made some progress in gradually re-establishing electrical service across the island, including to hospitals and parts of the capital Havana, after…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/cuba-making-slow-progress-re-starting-power-after-second-grid-collapse","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/07/b9/682a8f60f4b0f14fa1cbf4564730a018c93c/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:18:52","author":"Dave Sherwood,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Dave Sherwood","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":260349316,"title":"Giovanni Pernice set to 'return to Strictly Come Dancing for 20th anniversary special' after being cleared of majority of bullying allegations in BBC probe","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 20th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam didn't want to die, he didn't have to: Star had great plans for future and he should have been saved on the night of his death, says source close to family\n\nOlympic cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy reveals that his cancer is terminal - and he has just 'two to four years left'\n\nNew SNP chief was forced to apologise over sickening post attacking Kate and royals\n\nLauryn Goodman 'reported Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner to the police over shocking WhatsApp messages'\n\nAN WILSON: Why Charles should call the bluff of these drongo and ungracious Aussies and announce he'll quit as their head of state, by the late Queen's biographer\n\nLIZ JONES: I so wanted Meghan to be fulfilled.

Coney Dogs, Faygo and Lizzo,” the singer joked to a rally crowd, pointing to herself after listing off the meat-on-a-stick and soda that the city is famous for.\n\nShe said it was time to “put some respect on Detroit’s name” noting that the city had revolutionized the auto and music industries and adding that she'd already cast her ballot for Harris since voting early was “a power move.”\n\nHeaps of praise for the Motor City came after Trump, the former president, insulted it during a recent campaign stop. And Harris continued the theme, saying of her campaign, \"Like the people of Detroit, we have grit, we have excellence, we have history.”\n\nArms wide open as she took the stage, Harris let the crowd see she was wearing under her blazer a “Detroit vs. Everybody” T-shirt that the owner of the business that produces them gave her during a previous stop in the city earlier in the week. She also moved around the stage during her speech with a hand-held mic, not using a teleprompter.\n\nMore than 1 million Michigan residents have already voted by mail in the Nov 5 election, and Harris predicted that Detroit turnout for early voting would be strong.\n\n“Who is the capital of producing records?\" Harris asked when imploring the crowd to set new highs for early voting tallies. \"We are going to break some records here in Detroit today.”\n\nShe slammed Trump as unstable: “Somebody just needs to watch his rallies, if you’re not really sure how to vote.”\n\n“We’re not going to get these 17 days back. On Election Day, we don’t want to have any regrets,\" the vice president said.\n\nLizzo also told the crowd, \"Mrs. Commander-in-Chief has a nice ring to it.”\n\n“This is the swing state of all swing states, so every last vote here counts,\" the singer said. Then, referencing her song of the same title, Lizzo added, “If you ask me if America is ready for its first woman president, I only have one thing to say: “It’s about damn time!”\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement that Harris needed Lizzo “to hide the fact that Michiganders were feeling good under President Trump – real wages were higher, prices were lower, and everyone was better off.”\n\nTalona Johnson, a product manager from Rochester, Michigan, attended Harris rally and said that Harris “and her team are doing the things that are required to make sure that people are informed.\"\n\n“I believe she’s telling the truth. She’s trying to help the people,\" said Johnson, who said she planned to vote for Harris and saw women’s rights as her top concern.\n\n\"I don’t necessarily agree with everything that she’s put out, but she’s better than the alternative,”\n\nIn comments to reporters prior to the rally, Harris said she was in Detroit “to thank all the folks for the work they are doing to help organize and register people to vote, and get them out to vote today. She also called Detroit “a great American city” with “a lot of hard-working folks that have grit and ambition and deserve to be respected.”\n\nThe vice president was asked about whether the Biden administration's full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza might hurt her support in Michigan. Dearborn, near Detroit, is the largest city with an Arab majority in the nation.\n\n“It has never been easy,\" Harris said of Middle East policy. \"But that doesn’t mean we give up.”\n\nShe will get more star power later Saturday when she holds a rally in Atlanta featuring another wildly popular singer, Usher.\n\nEarly voting is also underway in Georgia. More than 1.2 million ballots have been cast, either in person or by mail.\n\nDemocrats hope an expansive organizing effort will boost Harris against Trump in the campaign's final weeks.\n\nAssociated Press writers Matt Brown in Detroit and Will Weissert and Fatima Hussein in Washington contributed.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

One of the people familiar confirmed the documents’ authenticity.\n\n\r\n The leak is “deeply concerning,” a U.S. official told CNN.\n\n\r\n\r\n The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\r\n\n\r\n The documents, dated Oct, 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.”\n\n\r\n They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the U.S. and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\n\r\n They describe preparations Israel appears to be making for a strike against Iran. One of the documents, which says it was compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, says the plans involve Israel moving munitions around.\n\n\r\n Another document says it is sourced to the National Security Agency and outlines Israeli air force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles, also believed to be in preparation for a strike on Iran. CNN is not quoting directly from or showing the documents.\n\n\r\n A U.S. official said the investigation is examining who had access to the alleged Pentagon document. Any such leak would automatically trigger an investigation by the FBI alongside the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies. The FBI declined to comment.\n\n\r\n The leak comes at an extremely sensitive moment in U.S.-Israeli relations and is bound to anger the Israelis, who have been preparing to strike Iran in response to Iran’s missile barrage on Oct. 1.\n\n\r\n “If it is true that Israeli tactical plans to respond to Iran’s attack on Oct. 1 have been leaked, it is a serious breach,” said Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and a retired CIA officer.\n\n\r\n Mulroy added that “the future coordination between the U.S. and Israel could be challenged as well.

A decimated car industry. A top ten city in crime statistics.'\n\nOne other commented: 'So Lizzo just told us the entire country will go to hell just like Detroit if we vote for Kamala!'\n\nAfter the clip was widely shared on X, another said: 'That was a Trump endorsement if I've ever had one. Lol.'\n\nThe singer burst into her song 'About Damn Time' during the event after those who gathered at the rally shouted out that they couldn't hear her. \n\nShe appeared with the Vice President to host an event urging those in Michigan to get out and vote as the city's first day of early voting started. \n\nHarris urged her supporters to put in an all-out effort aimed at winning on Election Day Nov. 5.\n\nShe said: 'And what I think we all know is, on Election Day, we don't want to have any regrets about what we could have done these next 17 days, and on November 5.'\n\nSpeaking with reporters, she added: 'Donald Trump has proven himself to be increasingly unstable and unfit and he is trying to take us backward.'\n\nDetroit had boasted around 1.8 million residents in the 1950s, but numbers shrunk as tens of thousands of white residents fled to the suburbs, followed years later by the Black middle class. \n\nThese hardships spilled over into the 21st century as the auto industry shrunk and jobs dried up. \n\nJust over a decade ago, the city filed for federal bankruptcy protection after a years-long financial crisis. \n\nWith debts topping $18 billion, the city could no longer pay its bills and was unable to provide basic services to its residents.\n\nThis sent thousands flocking elsewhere, and the city suffered an unprecedented population decline.

Coney Dogs, Faygo and Lizzo,” the singer joked to a rally crowd, pointing to herself after listing off the meat-on-a-stick and soda that the city is famous for.\n\n She said it was time to “put some respect on Detroit’s name” noting that the city had revolutionized the auto and music industries and adding that she’d already cast her ballot for Harris since voting early was “a power move.”\n\n Heaps of praise for the Motor City came after Trump, the former president, insulted it during a recent campaign stop. And Harris continued the theme, saying of her campaign, “Like the people of Detroit, we have grit, we have excellence, we have history.”\n\n Arms wide open as she took the stage, Harris let the crowd see she was wearing under her blazer a “Detroit vs. Everybody” T-shirt that the owner of the business that produces them gave her during a previous stop in the city earlier in the week. She also moved around the stage during her speech with a hand-held mic, not using a teleprompter.\n\n More than 1 million Michigan residents have already voted by mail in the Nov. 5 election, and Harris predicted that Detroit turnout for early voting would be strong. \n\n “Who is the capital of producing records?” Harris asked when imploring the crowd to set new highs for early voting tallies. “We are going to break some records here in Detroit today.” \n\n She slammed Trump as unstable: “Somebody just needs to watch his rallies, if you’re not really sure how to vote.” \n\n “We’re not going to get these 17 days back. On Election Day, we don’t want to have any regrets,” the vice president said.\n\n Lizzo also told the crowd, “Mrs. Commander-in-Chief has a nice ring to it.”\n\n “This is the swing state of all swing states, so every last vote here counts,” the singer said. Then, referencing her song of the same title, Lizzo added, “If you ask me if America is ready for its first woman president, I only have one thing to say: It’s about damn time!”\n\n Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement that Harris needed Lizzo “to hide the fact that Michiganders were feeling good under President Trump – real wages were higher, prices were lower, and everyone was better off.”\n\n Talona Johnson, a product manager from Rochester, Michigan, attended Harris’ rally and said that Harris “and her team are doing the things that are required to make sure that people are informed.”\n\n “I believe she’s telling the truth. She’s trying to help the people,” said Johnson, who said she planned to vote for Harris and saw women’s rights as her top concern.\n\n “I don’t necessarily agree with everything that she’s put out, but she’s better than the alternative.”\n\n In comments to reporters prior to the rally, Harris said she was in Detroit “to thank all the folks for the work they are doing to help organize and register people to vote, and get them out to vote today. She also called Detroit “a great American city” with “a lot of hard-working folks that have grit and ambition and deserve to be respected.”\n\n The vice president was asked about whether the Biden administration’s full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza might hurt her support in Michigan. Dearborn, near Detroit, is the largest city with an Arab majority in the nation.\n\n “It has never been easy,” Harris said of Middle East policy. “But that doesn’t mean we give up.”\n\n She will get more star power later Saturday when she holds a rally in Atlanta featuring another wildly popular singer, Usher.\n\n Early voting is also underway in Georgia. More than 1.2 million ballots have been cast, either in person or by mail. Democrats hope an expansive organizing effort will boost Harris against Trump in the campaign’s final weeks.\n\n Roderick Williams, 56, brought his three daughters to Harris’ Atlanta rally. His youngest daughter was born around the time former president Barack Obama entered office, and he hopes they can witness history again by seeing Harris become the first Black woman to be president.\n\n “It’s important for them to see that anything’s possible,” Williams said.","summary":"They lavished Detroit with praise after Donald Trump recently disparaged it.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/kamala-harris-lizzo-detroit-1235805990/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-oct-17-2024-billboard-a-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:09:41","author":"Ashley Iasimone,Associated Press","authors":["Ashley Iasimone","Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.053},{"id":260341566,"title":"NTD Evening News (Oct. 19): Drone Targets Netanyahu’s House; Trump, Harris in Battleground States on Saturday","text":"Oct-19-2024\n\nIsraeli strikes pummelled Beirut’s southern suburbs on Saturday as Hezbollah fired salvos of rockets at northern Israel, with one drone directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s holiday home. \n\nDemocrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump hit the campaign trail on Saturday.

That is how much money Congress has directed toward election security in the U.S., providing funds for updated voting systems, cybersecurity defenses and cybersecurity staff, the Associated Press reported.\n\nTrump pushed the conspiracy theory accusing Dominion of deleting and flipping votes as part of a larger effort to overturn the 2020 election. The former president faces four felony counts including conspiracy to defraud and obstruction. Skepticism of U.S. voting systems and measures has underscored Trump’s presidential campaign, as he has repeatedly doubted the legitimacy of the 2020 election results and stoked fears of election fraud in the upcoming election. Public officials, studies and researchers have found voter fraud is “very rare” and that the last election was “the most secure in American history.”\n\nKey Background\n\nThe conspiracy theory about Dominion was also spread by top Trump allies such as right-wing attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, as well as Fox News, which settled a major defamation lawsuit from Dominion for $787.5 million in 2023. Dominion accused Fox of pushing the election fraud claims despite knowing they were false. Giuliani and Powell were also subpoenaed in the lawsuit. Fox did not apologize after the settlement, though it did “acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” Smartmatic, another electronic voting company, recently settled a similar case with conservative news outlet Newsmax. Terms of the settlement have not been disclosed, though an attorney for Smartmatic revealed in court Smartmatic sought to assert lost revenue opportunities valued at $369.8 million, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Vows ‘Long Term Prison Sentences’ For Election ‘Cheating’—Despite No Evidence Of Major Fraud (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

For his detractors, he is a disruptive, deceitful agent of chaos. But a more philosophical approach frames him as a key figure in an eldritch struggle with deep-seated forces of decay.\n\nEsoteric Trumpism is a profound, almost mystical interpretation of Donald Trump’s political journey, situating him not merely within the framework of contemporary politics but as a figure of cosmic and world-historical significance. This interpretation posits that Trump’s rise and continued influence reflect deeper metaphysical catalysts at play in the twilight of Western civilization, as predicted by the historiographer Oswald Spengler in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nAccording to Spengler’s cyclical theory of history, every great culture passes through stages of growth, flowering, and decline, ultimately transforming into a civilization. A civilization, in Spengler’s view, is the final, ossified stage of a culture – marked by materialism, a dystopian government apparatus, and stagnation – where the original creative spirit has faded. In this phase, democratic institutions begin to decay, leading to the rise of autocratic leaders, or Caesars, who assert their will as the last defenders of the civilization’s final flickers of vitality. Trump, in this narrative, appears as a Caesar of the West, struggling against the forces of chaos and entropy that threaten to engulf the remnants of the culture’s achievements. \n\nThe Swamp, in the context of Esoteric Trumpism, eclipses its conventional political metaphor as a term for entrenched, secretive, and subversive agencies. Instead, it takes on a life of its own, representing a primordial, chthonic entity whose tentacles have reached into the heart of American power. This is no mere political quagmire – it is an ancient force, predating the Republic itself, fueled by what can only be described as eldritch energies. Trump’s wrestle against this dark presence is painted in Lovecraftian tones, where the stakes are not just electoral victories or policy changes but the very soul of the nation. His presidency becomes a metaphysical battle, with Trump cast as a modern hero who, like Spengler’s envisioned Caesars, refuses to capitulate to the rot that envelops his civilization. Each executive order, every political maneuver, is understood as an audacious attempt to dismantle this machinery of the Great Old Ones that has operated unseen for centuries. Trump’s defiance is portrayed as a courageous, almost tragic stand against the inevitable. He fights not for personal gain but to stave off the encroaching darkness that looms over the West.\n\nAccording to the ontological philosopher Martin Heidegger, Dasein (literally “being-there”) refers to the distinctive mode of existence that characterizes human beings, defined by their capacity for self-awareness and their ability to recognize and engage with their own potentialities. Unlike other beings, humans are conscious of their own existence within a temporal and historical context, aware of both their limitations and their possibilities for action. Dasein is not merely being present in the world; it involves an active process of comprehending and deciphering one’s place in it, constantly shaping and being shaped by one’s surroundings. In this sense, Dasein is not at all individual, but completely intertwined with its historical and communal context, a being-in-the-world that is fundamentally shaped by its place within the continuum of history. Trump’s populism, when viewed through this lens, can be seen as an awakening of the collective Dasein of the American people. His rhetoric of reclaiming national identity and sovereignty is hence an invocation to realize an authentic existence, where individuals are no longer lost in the impersonal tyrannies of globalism and bureaucracy. Its appeal to the “forgotten men and women” taps into an existential angst, reconnecting individuals with their communal and historical nucleus, urging them to rise from the alienation of modern life and reassert their Being in the political arena.\n\nHeidegger speaks of Dasein as fundamentally concerned with its own temporality, aware of its eventual finitude, and driven by the need to authentically project itself into the future. Trump’s populism mirrors this structure of Dasein, where his call to “Make America Great Again” serves as a temporal bridge between a nostalgic past and a projected future that seeks to recover a lost essence. In the Heideggerian sense, Trump’s movement can be seen as a collective realization of the “thrownness” of the American people into an inauthentic globalist existence. His populist message offers a way to reclaim historical destiny, to step out of the “they-self” of anonymous, alienated existence, and into a more authentic mode of being.\n\nTrump also reflects the vision of the idealist philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose concept of the World Spirit represents the unfolding of universal reason through the historical process, where the self-consciousness of freedom manifests across different nations and epochs. The dialectical feature of the World Spirit reveals that nothing is permanent, for everything is in constant flux, striving toward higher realization. As Hegel affirms, “What is rational is actual, and what is actual is rational,” and Trump’s populism can be interpreted as an essential moment, a reassertion of America’s intrinsic spirit against the impositions of technocratic modernity. Trumpist populism reflects the nation’s effort to preserve its unique manifestation of the World Spirit, reinforcing patriotism as both a grounding force and a guiding principle in the ever-evolving historical process. Thus, Trump completed the system of German idealism.\n\nTrump’s economic nationalism and policies aimed at restoring American autarky – through tariffs, immigration controls, and the reduction of global dependencies – are emblematic of a dying civilization’s last effort to preserve itself. Spengler wrote that as civilizations enter their final stages, the state becomes primarily an economic object, with the competition for resources and sovereignty taking precedence over other concerns. Trump’s trade wars with China and his efforts to revive American industry are therefore not merely political strategies but the actions of a Caesar seeking to preserve his people’s material and cultural autonomy in the face of an encroaching global order. These actions reflect the Spenglerian picture of a civilization striving to maintain its vitality, even as it approaches its unstoppable downfall.\n\nIn Esoteric Trumpism, Trump is viewed not as an aberration but as a predetermined figure, a product of the historical moment. His strongman tendencies and his rejection of the liberal democratic norms of the post-war era are seen as necessary responses to the crumbling structures of Western governance. Esoteric Trumpism casts these traits not as flaws but as virtues in a leader confronting the end of a civilization. Like the Caesars of Rome, Trump’s rise is framed as the emergence of a new form of leadership suited to the challenges of a decomposing world.\n\nTrump’s confrontations with the globalist agenda, particularly in the realms of environmentalism and economic policy, further reflect Spenglerian themes. Spengler was harshly critical of modern technocratic society, warning of its dehumanizing effects. Trump’s rejection of climate change initiatives and his embrace of industrial growth can be seen as a reassertion of the Faustian spirit – a refusal to surrender to the passive, nihilistic tendencies that arise in late-stage civilizations. His emphasis on economic nationalism and energy independence reflects a desire to maintain control over nature and resources, in line with the Faustian quest for power that Spengler saw as characteristic of Western civilization.\n\nEsoteric Trumpism positions the Trump phenomenon as a crucial, albeit controversial, defense against the cultural and political putrefaction that has beset the West. Trump’s role goes beyond mere policy decisions and enters the domain of iconic leadership – a figurehead fighting against the hydra of dissolution that has been eroding Western civilization for decades. His rejection of “wokeism” and the extreme liberal agenda – which manifest in cultural policies advocating unchecked multiculturalism, radical gender ideologies, and the suppression of traditional values – exemplifies this broader conflict. Trump’s pushback against these ideologies – such as his opposition to Critical Race Theory in education and federal training programs, and his defense of free speech against social media censorship – signals a refusal to allow the “progressive” agenda to dissolve the cultural foundations of the West. The culture wars he has participated in are not mere skirmishes but symbolize a larger clash between the malevolent entities seeking to dismantle the core identity of Western civilization and the guardians, like Trump, who aim to preserve it.\n\nIn rejecting the narratives of the left, Trump represents a larger resistance to what many on the intellectual right view as an extreme liberal agenda that seeks to destabilize the traditional order. His first administration’s policies – such as reinstating a ban on transgender individuals in the military, denouncing left-wing violence in cities like Portland, and challenging the dominance of leftist academic thought – are framed as necessary acts to protect the West from succumbing to cultural and moral relativism. Trump as president is thus seen as an essential chapter in the grand historical struggle to save the West from itself. His legacy will not be defined by his electoral victories or defeats but by his role as the bulwark against the internal degeneration that, if left unchecked, would result in the end of Western civilization as we know it.\n\nTrump’s significance lies not in the man but in the archetype he embodies. The rise of such Caesarian leaders does not promise material success; their triumph is symbolic, not in policies but in their rebellion against a senile and rabid world order. Trumpism, even as Trump’s personal influence fades, will persist as a movement that channels the existential fears of a civilization in freefall, longing for a return to integrity and self-expression. The power of the archetype lies in its resonance with a people alienated by the deep state – Trump articulates their despair, even as his achievements remain modest. His role is to act as the last expression of Western vitality, not to reverse the downward spiral but to embody the final brave spirit of a people grasping for survival in a world disintegrating into frenzied insanity. Spengler leaves no room for optimism about the material success of such figures, yet the archetype persists, drawing its strength from the same impulses that herald the end of the West’s historical cycle.","summary":"The significance of the former and potential future US president is not in the man himself, but in the archetype he embodies \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/605850-trump-republican-us-president/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.10/article/6710f39485f5405abd3d3ce2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:06:39","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.102},{"id":260341202,"title":"Secret Service chief warns of Trump shooting report’s “impact on agency morale” in message to staff","text":"Washington — Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe told his workforce on Thursday that he is “deeply concerned” about the impact that an independent review panel’s findings about the July assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump will have on the agency’s morale, according to a copy of the internal message obtained by CBS News.\n\nIn an email to Secret Service employees, Rowe said that he has convened teams to discuss the findings of the bipartisan four-member panel. The report concluded that the agency suffers from “deep flaws” and called for it to undergo “fundamental reform” to carry out its mission of protecting top government officials around the world, including the sitting and former U.S. presidents. \n\nThe review, conducted at the direction of President Biden, was at times a scathing rebuke of the Secret Service and its culture. The panel’s members said there must be an overhaul of Secret Service leadership and a refocusing on its “core protective mission” to mitigate the issues it identified.\n\n“While I believe that the intention behind the panel’s recommendations is to improve the focus and performance of the Secret Service, I am deeply concerned about the unintended impact on agency morale, especially as so many of you are working extremely long hours, spending weeks away from your families, and giving so much to this agency and its mission,” Rowe said in the message addressed to the Secret Service’s workforce.\n\nIn the wake of the July 13 assassination attempt at Trump’s campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Secret Service boosted protection for the major presidential and vice presidential candidates. Rowe had previously warned that the agency’s “finite” resources are being stretched to their maximum.\n\nThe acting Secret Service chief also told agency employees that he has “reservations” about some of the panel’s recommendations, specifically those regarding a reorganization that would elevate the Office of Protective Operations, essentially demoting the Office of Investigations and other divisions.\n\nIn 1865, the Secret Service was formed to curb rampant counterfeiting and restore trust in the nation’s financial system. The agency moved from the Department of Treasury to the Department of Homeland Security following a post-9/11 restructuring, and its investigative arm has evolved to probe cases spanning from sophisticated ransomware attacks and identity fraud to money laundering.\n\nBut the panel noted its “extreme skepticism” that many of the Secret Service’s investigative missions “meaningfully contribute” to its protective capability and “may materially distract from it.”\n\n“These are significant points that deserve careful consideration and discussion, particularly with those of you who are directly working within those spheres every day,” Rowe wrote.\n\nThe acting director said the Secret Service is taking the panel’s findings seriously.\n\nThe attack at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally placed the Secret Service under significant scrutiny, particularly regarding how gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to gain access to a rooftop so close to where the former president was speaking.\n\nTrump and two others were wounded in the shooting, and one rally attendee was killed.\n\nThe independent review panel is one of several groups investigating the shooting, joining the FBI, congressional committees and a bipartisan House task force. Its four members said in a letter accompanying their report that they identified “numerous mistakes” that led to the assassination attempt, as well as “deeper system issues that must be addressed with urgency.”\n\n“The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,” the members said. “Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again.”","summary":"Washington — Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe told his workforce on Thursday that he is &#8220;deeply concerned&#8221; about the impact that an independent review panel&#8217;s findings about the July assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump will have on the agency&#8217;s morale, according to a copy of the internal message obtained by CBS News. &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Secret Service chief warns of Trump shooting report&#8217;s &#8220;impact on agency morale&#8221; in message to staff appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/secret-service-chief-warns-of-trump-shooting-reports-impact-on-agency-morale-in-message-to-staff/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/17/ed955f23-50fc-4e5d-84a1-d5866400498e/thumbnail/1200x630g2/44772586425cb20f1f6237b8ff251f7d/gettyimages-2163935412.jpg?v=edba3a63b5392b4c81ae19d894992d91","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:06:04","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.167},{"id":260341432,"title":"Singer Zayn postpones U.S. tour after the death of his former bandmate Liam Payne","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories\n\n Heavy rain leads to flooding, road closures in Metro Vancouver\n\n A powerful atmospheric river caused street flooding in parts of Metro Vancouver Saturday, closing some roads and soaking voters headed to the polls in B.C.'s provincial election.\n\n Parents pull children from class over presentation at Halifax area school\n\n A number of parents at Oyster Pond Academy pulled their children from class Friday after learning about a gender identity presentation.\n\n Polls open in 2024 B.C. provincial election\n\n The polls are open in the 43rd British Columbia provincial general election, marking the conclusion of a four-week campaign period that saw a record number of ballots cast in advance.\n\n 'Absolutely force us to close': Saskatoon business seeking donations to pay $18K in fines\n\n Julianna Tan says her world was turned upside down when she got a letter this summer summoning her to court.\n\n Hurricane Oscar forms off the coast of the Bahamas\n\n Hurricane Oscar formed Saturday off the coast of the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

Long lines formed at state-subsidised shops where Cubans buy bread and other staples.\n\nThe country’s top electricity official, Lázaro Guerra, said the grid operator, UNE, was working to raise enough capacity in the system to start several power plants and restore electricity to larger swathes of the country.\n\n“I cannot assure you that we will be able to complete linking the system today, but we are estimating that there should be important progress today,” Guerra said on a TV newscast. The Guardian has verified that parts of the island are regaining electrical service.\n\nCuba was plunged into blackout for a second time on Saturday after its electrical grid collapsed again hours after authorities announced they had begun re-establishing service.\n\nCubaDebate, a state-run media outlet, said the grid operator, UNE, had reported the “total disconnection of the national electro-energetic system” and was working on re-establishing it.\n\nThe electrical grid first collapsed at about midday on Friday after one of the island’s largest power plants failed, leaving more than 10 million people without power.\n\nEven before the collapse, an electricity shortfall on Friday had forced Cuba’s communist-run government to send nonessential state workers home and cancel school classes as it sought to conserve fuel for generation. But lights began to flicker on in scattered pockets across the island early in the evening on Friday, offering some hope that power would be restored. UNE has not yet provided any details on what caused the grid to collapse again on Saturday, or how long it would take to re-establish service.\n\nThere have been weeks of worsening blackouts, often lasting 10-20 hours, across much of the island, which Cuba’s government has blamed on deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand. Strong winds that began with Hurricane Milton last week had also made it harder to deliver scarce fuel from boats offshore, officials have said.\n\nFuel deliveries to the island have dropped off significantly this year, as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once leading suppliers, have reduced their exports to Cuba. Venezuela slashed its deliveries of subsidised fuel by half this year, forcing the island to search for far more expensive oil on the spot market.\n\nCuba’s government also blames the US trade embargo, as well as sanctions imposed under the former US president Donald Trump, for its difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate and maintain its oil-fired plants. On Friday, the US denied any role in the grid collapse in Cuba.\n\nHurricane Oscar, which is forming north of the Dominican Republic, threatens to bring heavy rains and strong winds to parts of north-eastern Cuba in the coming days, the US National Hurricane Center said.","summary":"Authorities say they are gradually re-establishing electrical service across the island, including to hospitals\n\nCuba’s government said on Saturday it had made some progress in gradually re-establishing electrical service across the island, including to hospitals and parts of the capital, Havana, after state-run media earlier reported the national grid had collapsed for a second time in 24 hours.\n\nMost of Cuba’s 10 million people, however, remained without electricity on Saturday afternoon.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/cuba-suffers-second-power-blackout-electricity","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b1f7aa2dcbeb82b5eebe60941c59bcabbd7b598/0_185_5545_3327/master/5545.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 20:50:57","author":"Reuters in Havana","authors":["Reuters in Havana"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":260339972,"title":"Donald Trump V Kamala Harris Their Net Worth Compared","text":"7-Day Paper Delivery \n + Full Digital Access \n \n Features\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7-Day Paper Delivery \n + Full Digital Access \n \n Features\n \n \n \n \n $20/ WEEK\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n $20/ WEEK\n \n \n ($80 min. cost) charged every 4 weeks* \n \n \n ($80 min. cost) charged every 4 weeks* \n *Read the fine print\n \n \n \n THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW\n \n Full Digital Access + 7-Day Paper Delivery $80 charged every 4 weeks.

She rejected the argument by some that America was not ready for a woman president, saying, \"It's about damn time.\"\n\nA handful of swing states, where candidates from both parties have strong support, are likely to decide the election.\n\nHarris, the U.S. vice president, urged her supporters to put in an all-out effort to win.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"On Election Day, we don't want to have any regrets about what we could have done these next 17 days,\" she told about 300 voters who planned to march together to an early-voting site.\n\nShe said early voting had already set records in Georgia and North Carolina, and challenged Detroit - a city known for producing musical recordings - to follow suit.\n\nTrump, in an interview with Breitbart News, also expressed happiness about early voting after criticizing the practice in 2020.\n\nOf his voters, he said, \"we have to get 'em off the couch and take the potato chips away\" and get them to voting booths.\n\nHe announced plans to work briefly at a McDonald's fast-food restaurant in Pennsylvania on Sunday \"just for fun\" to mock Harris. The vice president says she worked at a McDonald's but Trump says he does not believe it.\n\nHarris' next stop was Atlanta, Georgia, for a rally with another music icon, pop singer Usher, who is currently headlining a three-date concert tour in the southern city. Early voting started in Georgia this week.\n\n\"Donald Trump has proven himself to be increasingly unstable and unfit and he is trying to take us backward,\" Harris told reporters in Detroit.\n\nHarris will need strong results in the majority non-white cities of Detroit and Atlanta and their surrounding suburbs to repeat U.S. President Joe Biden's 2020 wins in Michigan and Georgia.\n\nFormer President Trump, aboard his plane,did a flyby of his rally site in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, ahead of speaking there.\n\nHe is seeking to take advantage of what he felt was an improved position for him in opinion polls that show a deadlocked race. Some voters already have mail-in ballots in the state, which is the biggest prize on Election Day among battleground states and could tip the 2024 race.\n\nEarly voting also starts on Saturday in Nevada, where former President Barack Obama was expected to campaign for Harris in Las Vegas.\n\nBoth 2024 candidates spent Friday in closely contested Michigan, trading jabs about their fitness for office. Trump, 78, dismissed accusations from Harris that he was exhausted by the pace of the campaign's closing days. Harris turns 60 on Sunday.\n\nTrump said he had not canceled any events. But an Oct. 22 National Rifle Association of America event in Savannah, Georgia, that he had planned to attend, was canceled, according to organizers.\n\n\"I'm not even tired,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump dismissed Harris' calls for him to release his health records and said Harris should take a cognitive test.\n\nReporting by Steve Holland, Andrea Shalal and Trevor Hunnicutt; Writing by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Tom Hogue, Rod Nickel and Alistair Bell\n\nXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights","summary":"Harris and Trump court early voters; Usher, Lizzo join campaign trail  Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-trump-court-early-voters-usher-lizzo-campaign-trail-2024-10-19/","image":"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDVN22BTXRLFLKB6SGVBHVC4UM.jpg?auth=8eedb28cc2d192c5bff7ce1f44ac5908cf930a02d81b97ef47091a3bcb4c8c28&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 20:44:09","author":"Andrea Shalal,Steve Holland,Trevor Hunnicutt","authors":["Andrea Shalal","Steve Holland","Trevor Hunnicutt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":260343248,"title":"G7 Defence Ministers Concerned By Attacks On Peacekeepers, Vow Kyiv Support","text":"G7 defence ministers on Saturday met against the backdrop of multiple ongoing military conflicts, expressing concern over the escalation in Lebanon while pledging \"unwavering support\" for Ukraine.Italy, holding the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven countries, organised the body's first ministerial meeting dedicated to defence, staged in the southern city of Naples that is home to a NATO base.At the top of the agenda was Russia's war against Ukraine, now in its third year.\"We underscore our intent to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, including military assistance in the short and long term,\" read the G7 defence ministers' final statement that pledged \"unwavering support\".But the G7 defence ministers -- from Italy, France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Canada and the United States -- also warned of the dangers of further intensification in the Middle East, including in Lebanon, where the United Nations has blamed Israel for strikes on UN peacekeepers.\"We are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to UNIFIL's security,\" read a final statement from the ministers.They also called on Iran to stop supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met a Hamas representative in Istanbul on Saturday, according to the IRNA official news agency.The many, concurrent conflicts \"highlight a deteriorated security framework with forecasts for the near future that cannot be positive\", said Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto at the start of the one-day meeting.Those conflicts include instability in sub-Saharan Africa and growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.The summit came two days after Israel announced it had killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel that triggered the devastating retaliatory war in Gaza.Also in attendance were NATO chief Mark Rutte and the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. Both echoed the words of US President Joe Biden that the death of Sinwar could mark an opportunity to bring about the end of hostilities. \"Certainly after the killing of Yahya Sinwar, a new perspective is open and we have to use it in order to reach a ceasefire, to release the remaining hostages and to look for a political perspective,\" Borrell told journalists.The morning session included discussions over recent strikes on UN peacekeepers UNIFIL in Lebanon, where Israel is also at war with Hamas ally Hezbollah.Borrell suggested that the peacekeepers' mandate should be beefed up by the UN Security Council to give them more scope to act amid repeated attacks on their positions, which they blame on Israeli forces.\"They cannot act by themselves, it is certainly a limited role,\" he said. Earlier on Saturday, Borrell wrote on social media that \"a more robust mandate for UNIFIL\" was needed.In Lebanon on Friday, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni slammed as \"unacceptable\" the recent strikes on UNIFIL.Italy has around 1,000 troops in the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which has soldiers from more than 50 countries.The G7's pledge of continued support for Ukraine comes as the country enters its third winter at war.It is suffering battlefield losses in the east and faces the prospect of reduced US military support should Donald Trump be elected to the White House next month.Biden urged NATO allies during a visit to Berlin on Friday not to step down in backing Ukraine. Supporters of Kyiv \"cannot let up\", he said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Western allies to forge a winning strategy against Russia, on Thursday presented what he called a \"victory plan\" to the European Union and NATO.Its main thrust is a call for immediate NATO membership, deemed unfeasible by alliance members.It also seeks the clearance to strike military targets inside Russia with long-range weapons, and an undefined \"non-nuclear strategic deterrence package\" on Ukrainian territory. Another worry for Ukraine are reports, based on South Korean intelligence, that North Korea is deploying large numbers of troops to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. NATO was not as yet able to confirm that intelligence, Rutte said on Friday.Outside the meeting, in the streets of Naples, demonstrators carried Palestinian flags and the keffiyeh, a traditional scarf symbolising the Palestinian struggle against Israel. Some protesters clashed with police.","summary":"G7 defence ministers on Saturday met against the backdrop of multiple ongoing military conflicts, expressing concern over the escalation in Lebanon while pledging \"unwavering support\" for Ukraine.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/g7-defence-ministers-concerned-attacks-peacekeepers-vow-kyiv-support-1852583","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1862633/joining-g7-defence-ministers-summit-were-nato-chief-mark-rutte-eu-foreign-policy-chief-josep.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 20:42:20","author":"Alexandria Sage","authors":["Alexandria Sage"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.025}]}
