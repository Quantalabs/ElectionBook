Nine accepted the invitation, while Algeria, Nigeria, Turkey and Vietnam did not formally respond by the end of 2024.\nThe Russian government said “we expect that in the near future responses will come from” the other four.\nAlexander Vuving, a professor at the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies in Hawaii, said Vietnam’s hesitation stemmed from Hanoi’s “delicate ties” with the United States.\nVietnam is careful not to shut this opportunity down by joining a grouping that the US deems unfriendly\nAlexander Vuving, geopolitics professor\n“In [Hanoi’s] strategic calculation, its status as a Brics partner country must be weighed against its partnership with the US,” Vuving said, adding that the grouping might be seen not only as an alternative but also as a challenge to Washington.\nVuving added that Washington’s friendshoring policy presented Vietnam with the chance to emerge as a hub for hi-tech and semiconductor industries within global supply chains – an opportunity the Southeast Asian country was eager to seize.\n“Friendshoring” refers to the growing trade practice of focusing supply chain networks on countries regarded as political and economic allies.\n“Vietnam is careful not to shut this opportunity down by joining a grouping that the US deems unfriendly,” Vuving said, adding that whether Vietnam would confirm its status as a Brics partner would largely depend on Washington’s stance towards the group.\nThe group, established in 2009, originally comprised Brazil, Russia, India and China. It was given the Brics acronym after South Africa became a member in 2011. Last year, its membership expanded to include Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates.\nIn recent years, the grouping, which is aimed at seeking alternatives to Western-led institutions, has been leveraged by Beijing and Moscow to forge a multipolar world.\nWith its nine members and nine partners, Brics represents roughly half the global population and more than 41 per cent of the world’s GDP.\n\nAmong Southeast Asian countries, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar have also expressed interest in joining the bloc.\nBenny Teh Cheng Guan, an associate professor at the School of Social Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, said Vietnam had yet to decide and was taking “a more cautious approach” compared to the three other Southeast Asian states.\n“Considering that Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh did attend the Brics Summit in October last year, I believe Vietnam does have an interest to join,” Teh said.\nMuhammad Faizal Bin Abdul Rahman, a research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said Vietnam might be examining what policies a second Donald Trump administration would take against Brics.\nThe US president-elect has threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on the bloc if it were to create a rival currency to the US dollar. “The idea that the Brics Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER,” Trump wrote is a social media post late last year.\n“This could be a policy headache for Vietnam, which has agreed to grow security and defence cooperation with the US,” particularly under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership forged in 2023, Faizal said.\nIn a July article for The Jakarta Post, Faizal warned that China’s assertiveness in foreign policy and as an economic power “make it a dominant party in Brics” and that Asean countries that become Brics members “may find it difficult not to pander to China’s sensitivities relating to the South China Sea”.\n\nAsean refers to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Several bloc members, including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, have overlapping territorial claims with Beijing in the resource-rich waters of the South China Sea.\nFaizal told This Week in Asia, that if Asean and Brics clash on political-security agendas, Asean is likely to issue a statement of concern.\n“But underlying such a statement might be the continuation of a lack of unified position and policy paralysis on contentious regional security issues,” he said, adding that Asean has to prepare for a future where its member states place more weight on other multilateral groupings such as Brics.\nAdditionally, reforms are necessary for Asean to maintain its central role among member states, including ensuring that the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) is empowered to enhance its role in preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution, according to Faizal.\nARF is a key security platform in the Asia-Pacific, which includes the 10 Asean members and 10 Asean Dialogue Partners such as Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and the US. There are 27 members states in the ARF.\nFaizal added that the Asean Secretariat could also do more to by nudging member states to “think beyond their national interests and act more regional”.\nNoting that the Asean agenda was still central to its members who had expressed interest in joining Brics, Universiti Sains Malaysia’s Teh said that under Malaysia’s chairmanship of Asean this year, there was likely to be “an expansion of strategic collaborations” that “would be beneficial to the two organisations”.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293207/vietnams-strategic-hesitation-brics-highlights-delicate-us-ties-and-economic-considerations","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/02/60637ac4-df13-44be-ac78-fa93044081d0_8f3e1e5b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 01:03:12","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":0.094},{"id":277867150,"title":"Tesla sales dropped 1.1pc in 2024, first decline in 12 years","text":"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump’s victory on optimism Elon Musk’s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.\n\nTesla’s global vehicle sales rose 2.3 per cent in the final quarter thanks to 0 per cent financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk’s most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.\n\nThe Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1 per cent below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the US and elsewhere slowed.\n\nThe year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla’s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.\n\nThe fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla’s average sales price to fall to just over USD41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.\n\nThat doesn’t bode well for Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla’s stock fell more than 7 per cent Thursday.\n\nMusk donated more than USD250 million to Trump’s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50 per cent since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.\n\nIn 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50 per cent most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the US. In the US, analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.\n\nThe fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.\n\nFalling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.\n\nCompetition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company’s market share.\n\nDaniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock is still worth buying despite the sales drop.\n\n“We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company…instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,” wrote Ives. “And the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.”\n\nThe fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company’s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.\n\nAside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla’s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.\n\nTo meet Tesla management’s guidance of 20 per cent to 30 per cent annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid USD30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.\n\nTesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid USD30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.\n\n“At that point you’re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,” Goldstein said. “It takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.”\n\nJeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the US and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. “If they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,” he said.\n\nAlso, Musk’s support of Trump for US president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. “I suppose the choices that he’s made on the political front don’t line up with a good portion of his buyers’ profile,” Schuster said.\n\nIndustry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China’s BYD now have more to offer.\n\nAt present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the US. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the US, but they are still growing.\n\nThrough September, new EV sales rose 7.2 per cent to about 936,000 in the US, according to Motorintelligence.com. That’s slower growth than the 47 per cent increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year’s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.\n\nNearly all of Tesla’s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.\n\nTesla’s global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41 per cent last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world’s top selling EV maker.\n\nFourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year’s sales.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/tesla-sales-dropped-1-1pc-in-2024-first-decline-in-12-years/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP25002517790596.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 01:00:15","author":"Borneo Bulletin Ap Video","authors":["Borneo Bulletin Ap Video"],"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":277866248,"title":"US considers potential rules to restrict or bar Chinese drones","text":"WASHINGTON: The US Commerce Department said on Thursday it is considering new rules that would impose restrictions on Chinese drones that would restrict or ban them in the United States citing national security concerns. \n\nThe department said it was seeking public comments by March 4 on potential rules to safeguard the supply chain for drones, saying threats from China and Russia “may offer our adversaries the ability to remotely access and manipulate these devices, exposing sensitive US data.” \n\nChina accounts for the vast majority of US commercial drone sales. \n\nIn September, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the department could impose restrictions similar to those that would effectively ban Chinese vehicles from the United States and the focus will be on drones with Chinese and Russian equipment, chips and software. \n\nShe told Reuters in November she hopes to finalize the rules on Chinese vehicles by Jan. 20. \n\nA decision to write new rules restricting or banning Chinese drones will be made by the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who takes over on Jan. 20. \n\nWashington has taken a series of steps to crack down on Chinese drones over the last year. \n\nLast month, President Joe Biden signed legislation that could ban China-based DJI and Autel Robotics from selling new drone models in the US A unspecified US agency must determine within one year if drones from DJI or Autel Robotics pose unacceptable national security risks. \n\nDJI, the world’s largest drone manufacturer that sells more than half of all US commercial drones, said if no agency completes the study it would prevent the company from launching new products in the US \n\nIn September, the House of Representatives voted to bar new drones from DJI from operating in the US \n\nIn October, DJI sued the Defense Department for adding it to a list of companies allegedly working with Beijing’s military, saying the designation is wrong and has caused the company financial harm. \n\nDJI told Reuters in October that Customs and Border Protection was stopping imports of some DJI drones from entering the United States, citing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

A New Year’s Day drone strike by Russian forces on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, struck a multi-story apartment bloc and a National Bank of Ukraine building, killing two residents and injuring six others.\n\nDonetsk region. Since the start of 2025, two civilians have been killed by Russian attacks on Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk, according to regional governor Vadym Filashkin.\n\nKherson region. On Jan. 1, Russian shelling killed one resident of the region’s eponymous capital city of Kherson, in the country’s south.\n\nUkraine halted the transit of Russian natural gas through its territory on Jan. 1, after the expiration of its agreement with Gazprom, Russia's largest state-owned gas exporter. The decision cuts Moscow’s last remaining pipeline route to Europe. It supplied about 15 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas in 2024, and had been in operation for decades years. Despite recent lobbying for an extension by Slovakia, which continues to rely heavily on Russian gas imports, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has remained firm in rejecting any contract renewal. The European Commission has expressed confidence that its energy security would not be affected by the move, citing the shift by most of its members toward alternative sources and renewable energy to replace Russian energy supplies.\n\nIn 2024, Ukraine increased its electricity imports more than five-fold year-over-year, with Hungary supplying the largest share at nearly 40%. Other major suppliers were Slovakia, Romania, and Poland. The surge in imports was supported by European Union agreements, including an increase in import capacity from 1.7 to 2.1 gigawatts. This increase in imports proved essential as Kyiv faced 12 major Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, including missile barrages. Despite damage, Ukraine's energy grid has remained resilient, maintaining relative stability, though substantial efforts will be needed to fortify it in 2025.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n1 Dead And 15 Injured After Small Plane Crashes Into Warehouse In California\n\nUkraine’s Newest Leopard 2 Brigade Began Disintegrating Before It Reached The Front Line\n\nNew Orleans Truck Attack Suspect Identified—Here’s What We Know About Him\n\nA recent survey reveals a sharp decline in optimism among Ukrainians about their country's future. Conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, a private think tank, the survey shows a decrease in the share of Ukrainians who believe the nation will be prosperous and a member of the European Union within 10 years, from 73% in December 2023 to 57% in December 2024. At the same time, the share of respondents who anticipate a devastated economy in the next decade surged from 5% to 28%. The survey also indicates growing pessimism among Ukrainians about increasing internal political divisions, and a decrease in optimism about Ukraine's prospects as a united nation, from 69% to 53%. Despite this, optimism still outweighs pessimism, with a majority holding on to hope for the nation's future.\n\nIn 2024, Russia captured 1,252 square miles of Ukrainian territory—0.5% of Ukraine's total—at a staggering cost of more than 420,000 troops and $34 billion in equipment, according to an analysis by Forbes Ukraine. Ukraine managed to free 7% of its land area from occupation since the onset of the full-scale invasion, including 185 square miles in Russia's Kursk region, with Russia relying on foreign mercenaries and 10,000 North Korean troops by year-end.\n\nRussia escalated its air strikes, launching more than 1,700 missiles and drones on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, with record attacks in August. By year-end, monthly drone strikes hit unprecedented levels, using decoys to overwhelm defenses. Bolstered by Western aid, Ukraine withstood the pressure, but Russia's relentless weapons production enabled its continued assaults.\n\nThe United States provided $61.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine, but delays and political challenges eroded trust in President Biden, whose approval among Ukrainians dropped 27 points to 55.2%. Europe led in overall support, countering U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s narrative that Washington bears the main burden, as Ukraine navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.\n\nThe U.S. has delivered $3.4 billion in direct budgetary aid to Ukraine, the final tranche under the bipartisan Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act for 2024, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced on Dec. 30. Part of the G7’s (Group of Seven major industrialized nations) $50 billion revenue acceleration initiative backed by frozen Russian assets, this funding supports reforms in governance, law enforcement, and anti-corruption efforts. Since 2022, U.S. budgetary support of over $30 billion has stabilized Ukraine's government operations amid war, ensuring financial stability.\n\nAdditionally on Dec. 30, President Biden announced nearly $2.5 billion in security aid for Ukraine, including $1.25 billion in drawdowns from Pentagon stockpiles and $1.22 billion under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which funds supplies for Ukraine’s immediate battlefield needs and long-term defense capabilities.\n\nCulture Front.\n\nAmerican stars of Ukrainian descent — Academy Award and Emmy nominee, actress and director Vera Farmiga, and actress, singer, two-time Academy Award winner, and recipient of Emmy, Grammy, and Golden Globe awards Barbra Streisand — presented the story of Shedryk — a Christmas song known in the U.S. as the Carroll of the Bells, composed almost a hundred years ago by a Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych, who was assassinated by the Russian special services at his own home in 1921. Performers from various countries performed Shchedryk in 50 different locations. Farmiga and Streisand shared the story behind the composition to remind the world of Ukrainian heritage behind the famous Christmas song.\n\nBy Danylo Nosov, Karina L.

It’s the conclusion of a decades-long fight for a more equitable internet—and a harbinger of what may await other consumer protections in the years to come.\nIt’s easy to get lost in the technicalities of net neutrality, but the basic thing the Federal Communications Commission wanted was the power to prevent broadband providers from engaging in bandwidth discrimination, slowing speeds for certain customers or to certain sites. Those protections existed under the Obama administration but were rolled back shortly after Donald Trump took office in 2017. You probably won’t feel much near-term impact; we’re largely back to the status quo, and Spectrum is unlikely to immediately try slowing down YouTube to get you to watch its own cable news channels. But that’s also why the way the Sixth Circuit arrived at its decision may be even more alarming than the ruling itself.\nThe three-judge panel frequently cited Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, the recent Supreme Court decision that overturned a legal doctrine known as Chevron deference. Under Chevron, courts were required to defer to regulatory agencies when it came to deciding how relevant laws should be interpreted when their provisions were unclear. Now, courts are free to decide for themselves. And the Sixth Circuit did exactly that.\n“Unlike past challenges that the DC Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC’s reading of the statute,” the ruling reads. “Instead, our task is to determine ‘the best reading of the statute’ in the first instance.”\nIn other words, the court substituted the subject matter expertise of the FCC with its own.\n“It's a sad day for democracy when giant corporations can forum-shop for industry-friendly judges to strike down some of the most popular consumer protection rules in history,” says Evan Greer, director of the digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future. “The court citing Loper Bright here is an alarming harbinger of industry-friendly rulings to come.”\nAnd not just on issues affecting the broadband industry. The Sixth Circuit showed today how courts might use the end of Chevron deference to shape all sorts of policy, from tech to the environment to health care to pretty much any area where legislative ambiguity reigns.\nCritics of Chevron argued that Congress too often delegated the work of interpreting policies to unelected bureaucrats working for federal agencies, says John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Knowledge. “Now we have the alternative: The first panel of judges to hear an issue can set nationwide policy.”\nThere’s at least one way out of this imbalance of power, Bergmayer says: Congress can pass a bill that explicitly says agencies have the authority to interpret laws. That seems unlikely, though, in a GOP-led legislature that’s wary of—or outright hostile toward—the administrative state.\nAfter all, Congress also could have codified net neutrality as the law of the land rather than leaving it to the FCC. Outgoing FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, still hopes that it will. “Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,” Rosenworcel said in a statement. “With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.”\nThat certainly would have been preferable to forcing net neutrality to ride on a political seesaw for the past two decades, passing in and out of favor depending on who’s in charge. (Former FCC chair Ajit Pai, who rolled back net neutrality rules under Trump, hailed the Sixth Circuit’s opinion as “excellent.”) But unless and until that happens, the regulatory whiplash that takes place when a new party takes power will only fuel the courts’ willingness to take matters into their own hands—especially now that they have a green light from the Supreme Court. “Applying Loper Bright means we can end the FCC’s vacillations,” the Sixth Circuit opinion says.\nThere’s some good news in all this. In 2018, California passed its own net neutrality law that, after years of legal challenges, fully went into effect in 2021. Because the internet doesn’t stop at state borders, California’s law does offer some degree of protection to everyone in the US. “California’s law is quite good,” says Bergmayer. “It’s just that something nationwide would be better.”\nWhich means, at least, that some net neutrality protections still exist. They’re not as comprehensive as digital rights advocates hoped for and not as strong as the FCC would have granted, but it’s something. But as courts increasingly invoke Loper Bright, that won’t always be the case. The Sixth Court has shown how easily consumer and environmental safeguards can now be erased in an era when it takes only one court ruling to make them disappear.","summary":"While Americans might not mourn the loss of net neutrality, an appeals court’s ruling sets a troubling precedent for consumer protections in every industry.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/net-neutrality-ruling-dead/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/6776fee015e2568eb9706555/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/net-neutrality-959293770.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:48:31","author":"Brian Barrett","authors":["Brian Barrett"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":277867506,"title":"'I Was Wrong' — Democrat Strategist James Carville Accepts Defeat After Kamala Harris' Loss to Donald Trump, Urges Party to Use 'Podcasts and Influencers' to Get Message Out","text":"James Carville has finally conceded he was completely wrong about the election after Kamala Harris' shocking defeat to Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic strategist explained what exactly went wrong with the party's strategy and offered up a suggestion to get things back on track, RadarOnline.com can reveal.In a Democratic op-ed, Carville wrote: \"I thought Kamala Harris would win. I was wrong. While I’m sure we Democrats can argue that the loss wasn’t a landslide or take a little solace in our House performance, the most important thing for us now is to face that we were wrong and take action on the prevailing ‘why.'\"\n\nHe continued: \"We lost for one very simple reason: It was, it is and it always will be the economy, stupid. We have to begin 2025 with that truth as our political north star and not get distracted by anything else.\"\n\nCarville previously thought Harris would win because Trump is \"stone a-- nuts.\"\n\nThe 80-year-old not only admitted he was \"wrong,\" but also shared his thoughts on what the party needs to do to right the ship following the humiliating loss.He said: \"Mr. Trump, for the first time in his political career, decisively won by seizing a swath of middle-class and low-income voters focused on the economy. Democrats have flat-out lost the economic narrative. The only path to electoral salvation is to take it back,\" and added Democrats need to do away with focusing on Trump as voters clearly didn't care about the 78-year-old's wrongdoings \"if they cannot provide for themselves or their families.\"\n\nCarville added: \"This year, the Democratic Party leadership must convene and publish a creative, popular and bold economic agenda and proactively take back our economic turf. Go big, go populist, stick to economic progress – and force them to oppose what they cannot be for. In unison.\"\n\nCarville's idea? Changing the way Democrats get the message out by using podcasts, influencers and non-traditional media, as those platforms are a \"new media paradigm we now live in.\"The political consultant also blamed Harris' loss for her failure to separate herself from President Biden and his views. \n\nMeanwhile, Harris has yet to make her next big move in her political career following her presidential election loss in November. GOP political strategist Matt Gorman believes the 60-year-old will not be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2028.\n\n\"...

The bureau also is posting previously unreleased video of the suspect placing one of the bombs.A host of basic questions remains unanswered four years later. For starters, investigators haven’t determined if the suspect is a man or a woman. Nor have they established a clear link between the pipe bombs and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters.The FBI “can’t work on assumptions,\" said David Sundberg, assistant director in charge of the bureau's Washington field office.“Without being able to confirm the suspect’s identity, it is very hard to definitively establish motive,\" Sundberg told The Associated Press. “Therefore, it would be difficult for us to state that there is a link, although we can’t state there is not one.”RELATED STORY | Probe finds no evidence FBI incited violence at Jan. 6 riotIn the absence of harder evidence, Republican lawmakers and right-wing media outlets have promoted conspiracy theories about the pipe bombs. House Republicans also have criticized security lapses, questioning how law enforcement failed to detect the bombs for 17 hours.“We remain focused on conducting an investigation using all of the tools we have at our disposal,” Sundberg said. “But it is incumbent upon us to follow facts and evidence.”The FBI has assessed over 600 tips, reviewed about 39,000 video files and conducted more than 1,000 interviews over the past four years. Images show the suspect was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, a face mask, black gloves and a black and grey pair of Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes with a yellow logo. The person also wore or carried a backpack containing the bombs.Surveillance video captured the suspect placing the pipe bombs near the committees' offices between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5, 2021. Nobody was hurt before the bombs were rendered safe, but the FBI says both devices could have been lethal.Kamala Harris, then the Vice President-elect, was inside the DNC offices when the pipe bomb was found outside the building about 1:05 p.m. on Jan. 6. Before the bomb was deactivated, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's motorcade passed by the DNC building as she was evacuated from the Capitol, according to House Republicans.This week, the FBI is releasing a minute-long video that shows the suspect sitting on a park bench outside the DNC before placing the first bomb there at about 7:54 p.m. The suspect placed the second bomb about 8:16 p.m., in an alley behind the RNC, the FBI says.The FBI also is releasing closeup images of the type of Nike sneakers worn by the suspect. Fewer than 25,000 pairs of the same shoe were sold between August 2018 and January 2021, according to the FBI.“Based on attire, those are probably the most remarkable or distinctive feature when it comes to clothing the suspect wore,” Sundberg said. “We're hoping that somebody might recognize that.”The FBI used surveillance footage to track the suspect's movements through Capitol Hill on the night of Jan. 5. The suspect initially is captured on video at about 7:34 p.m. at the intersection of First Street and North Carolina Avenue. The suspect is last seen on camera around 8:18 p.m. heading east on Rumsey Court.“The suspect in this case did a very good job covering themselves up at a time that this would not be abnormal, so it didn’t raise any attention,” Sundberg said, referring to face masking during the COVID-19 pandemic.Video of the suspect was sporadically available and often of poor quality, according to Sundberg. The 17-hour gap between the planting and discovery of the pipe bombs made it more difficult to identify potential witnesses, he said.Authorities previously offered a reward of up to $500,000 for information leading to the suspect’s arrest and conviction.President-elect Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, repeatedly has vowed to pardon some or many of the rioters who stormed the Capitol. More than 1,500 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related crimes. About 1,100 have been convicted and sentenced. Over 700 defendants got terms of imprisonment ranging from a few days to 22 years.Sundberg said he doesn’t expect the change in administration to alter the course of the FBI’s pipe bomb investigation.“We don’t know who the suspect is,” he added. “And I expect that we will continue to work this case until its logical conclusion and we identify a suspect.”","summary":"The FBI is releasing more information about its investigation into the individual who planted pipe bombs the day before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/fbi-releases-new-video-of-a-suspect-planting-a-pipe-bomb-near-dnc-offices-on-eve-of-the-capitol-riot","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d60d467/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2156x1132+195+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F23%2F9f599e894ce78b3673e83351feb0%2Fscreenshot-2025-01-02-at-5-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:34:32","author":"AP via Scripps News","authors":["AP via Scripps News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":277863100,"title":"Steve Bannon Counters Donald Trump's CIA Demand: 'Part of the Problem'","text":"Steven Bannon pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump's demand for CIA involvement in investigating the two deadly New Year's Day attacks, saying on his podcast that the agency is \"a central part of the problem.\"Why It Matters Bannon, Trump ally and former White House chief strategist during the president-elect's first term, has also recently opposed Trump's support for H-1B visas for specialized foreign workers and earlier this year was critical of his shifting stance on TikTok. Bannon has also consistently raised concerns about top Trump adviser Elon Musk, citing his ties to China and telling the billionaire to \"sit in the back and study\" amid interparty tensions over the visas.Musk, owner of Tesla and SpaceX, has confirmed business ties to China, including a large Tesla Shanghai factory. He is set to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy and was mockingly called \"president\" by some Democrats after Musk led the charge against a Republican-backed government funding bill.What To Know Two fatal attacks occurred on New Year's Day, a terror blitz in New Orleans and a vehicle explosion in Las Vegas. The FBI in a Thursday news conference said that at the moment, there was \"no definitive link\" in the attacks.Trump said in a post to his Truth Social early Thursday morning: \"Our Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World! This is what happens when you have OPEN BORDERS, with weak, ineffective, and virtually nonexistent leadership. The DOJ, FBI, and Democrat state and local prosecutors have not done their job.\" The statement called for the CIA to \"get involved, NOW, before it is too late.\"Newsweek reached out to Trump's communications team for clarification on the comment via email on Thursday.In the Thursday morning episode of Bannon's War Room podcast, the host denounced Trump's recommendation: \"The CIA, Mr. President, is part of the problem, a serious part of the problem. And no, we don't want the CIA involved in anything domestically, they're involved too much domestically as is.\"He added: \"Mr. President, the CIA, I think, maybe I don't know, to the tenth power worse [than the FBI]. Not only they get everything wrong, they're working against the interests of folks here in the United States of America and the last thing we want is the CIA involved in anything domestically.\"Newsweek reached out to Bannon for comment via text message on Thursday.Bannon also said during the podcast: \"I have tremendous respect for John Ratcliffe,\" whom Trump nominated to lead the CIA and was director of national intelligence during the president-elect's first term.Around 3:15 a.m. Wednesday, authorities said, a man identified by the FBI as Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's partyers on Bourbon Street, then began shooting, killing 14 people and injuring about 30. He was pronounced dead at the scene after law enforcement returned fire, the FBI said in a Wednesday statement.The bureau is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism. Jabbar, 42, was a U.S. citizen from Texas who served in the U.S. Army. An ISIS flag was found in his truck, and he posted videos in support of the terrorist group.Later that morning, in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck filled with fireworks exploded outside the lobby of the Trump Hotel. The man inside, whom authorities have identified as Matthew Livelsberger, was killed and seven others were injured. Livelsberger was a highly decorated Army soldier. Two firearms were found inside the truck.What People Are Saying Several social media users are resharing a December 12, 2024, interview with Sarah Adams, former CIA officer, on The Shawn Ryan Show, when Adams said: \"I'm certain we'll either have embassy attacks in 2025 or the homeland attack, or both,\" by Al-Qaeda and ISIS.Musk wrote on X January 1: \"The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle for a terrorist attack. Cybertruck actually contained the explosion and directed the blast upwards. Not even the glass doors of the lobby were broken.\"Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry posted to X on January 1: \"A horrific act of violence took place on Bourbon Street earlier this morning. Please join Sharon and I in praying for all the victims and first responders on scene. I urge all near the scene to avoid the area.\"What Happens Next The FBI is asking anyone with information to contact the New Orleans Bureau via phone at 504-816-3000 or by emailing tips@fbi.gov.

What Happened? | Opinion","text":"The long-simmering debate over H-1B visas broke out into the mainstream over Christmas in a dispute that erupted over the appointment of Sriram Krishnan as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence to President-elect Donald Trump. Krishnan was born and raised in India and arrived in the U.S. via the L-1 visa when Microsoft transferred him from their India office, and he is a vocal supporter of expanding immigration, particularly from India. When his position was announced, Trump's MAGA base erupted in a firestorm of criticism, enraged with what they saw as a betrayal by the tech world's elite of the base. The criticism quickly expanded from Krishnan to three recent Silicon Valley converts to President Trump: Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who all voiced support for Krishnan, H-1B visas, and hiring foreign workers over American ones. What followed was a ten-day battle of words, as former allies became bitter opponents, and the issue of H-1B visas took center stage in a broader debate about the future of American industry and its relationship with tech giants.Of course, the working-class Americans who voted Trump into office on a promise to reduce immigration, legal and illegal, are right: Whether it's illegal migrants crossing the border or \"high-skilled\" tech workers, immigration hurts America's workers.It's indisputable that Silicon Valley's use of the H-1B visa program is not a mechanism to bring in the best and the brightest but a tool for obtaining cheap foreign labor. Over the years, the program was often exploited to replace American workers, some even forced to train their visa replacements before being laid off as part of their severance agreement. Musk and Sacks' defense failed to resonate because it was nonsense.The data reveals that H-1B visas are frequently used to bring in ordinary workers filling routine jobs at much lower wages than their American counterparts. Even Musk's own company, Tesla, has been using the visa to source cheap labor. Furthermore, a significant portion of the H-1B visa program's sponsorship comes from Indian IT outsourcing companies, which are not driving innovation but enabling U.S. companies to outsource entire departments to these outsourcing companies, who eventually offshore these U.S. jobs to low-labor cost countries like India.In short, U.S. companies, ranging from insurance and financial firms to Silicon Valley giants have found guest worker visa programs like the H-1B to be a convenient way to source cheap labor and maintain a compliant workforce. These workers are predominantly sourced from India, where both the workers and the Indian government benefit from the arrangement. Indian visa workers are often promised Green Card sponsorship in exchange for their loyalty to their employers, while the Indian government enjoys substantial remittances sent back by these workers, which constitute a significant portion of the country's GDP.Some of the tech elites claimed that America's dependency on foreign workers is due to America's failing education system. But this ignores that our country still produces the best and brightest talent, even within a flawed education system that poorly invests in far too many working-class American students. The U.S. consistently ranks near the top in international educational assessments for math and science, and new research shows that American computer science graduates are outperforming their counterparts from countries like China, Russia, and India, particularly when international students are excluded from the data. It's simply not true that there's a \"shortage\" of STEM talent in the U.S.All of which is to say, legal immigration is hurting Americans just as much as illegal immigration.During his 2016 campaign, Donald Trump was keenly aware of how legal immigration was being used by elites to suppress American wages and replace workers. On August 3, 2020, I met with him in the Cabinet Room along with twelve Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) IT workers whose jobs were in the process of being outsourced to H-1B visa-dependent consulting firms. During the meeting, President Trump fired the Chairman and one of the board directors of the TVA, and Jeff Lyash, its CEO, called the White House and informed Trump he would rescind his decision to outsource the jobs. And just like that, over 200 union IT jobs were saved.Additionally, he was the first president to make real H-1B visa reform happen, with a rule change that would have handed out H-1B visas based on the highest offered salary, not a random lottery. It was undone by the Biden administration.However, after certain tech elites joined his coalition, Trump's stance began to shift, creating a disconnect with his voter base. Trump has issued contradictory arguments, calling for the deportation of illegal immigrants while also advocating for increased legal immigration to fill jobs he claims will be returning. His \"staple-a-Green Card to a college diploma\" snafu on the ALL IN podcast sparked significant backlash, especially as Silicon Valley has ramped up H-1B visa use while undergoing mass layoffs.Both his base and many Americans across the political spectrum are seeing through the tech elites' arguments, and if Trump doesn't recognize this quickly, he risks reversing his own policy wins regarding the H-1B visa—and betraying the very Americans who put him in office.Kevin Lynn is the Executive Director of the Institute for Sound Public Policy and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"During his 2016 campaign, Donald Trump was keenly aware of how legal immigration was being used by elites to suppress American wages and replace workers.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-used-understand-that-legal-immigration-hurts-american-workers-too-what-happened-opinion-2008998","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2555453/elon-musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:21:27","author":"Kevin Lynn","authors":["Kevin Lynn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":277862424,"title":"Golden Globes set to kick off awards season with jolt of star power","text":"The Golden Globes will return Sunday with major star appeal thanks to a slew of big name nominees, including Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande and more. \n\nNominations for the 82nd awards ceremony were made last month. The show will be televised by CBS and streamed on Paramount+.\n\nHere’s key things to know about the ceremony:\n\nWho’s hosting the Golden Globes? \n\nComedian and actor Nikki Glaser was chosen to host next year’s ceremony.\n\nGlaser has made a name for herself as a riotously sharp wit, especially at roasts, including recently for Tom Brady, who she needled for his complex love life and his one-time advocacy of crypto. She earned an Emmy nomination for her latest special, “Someday You’ll Die” for HBO, which dealt with everything from offering to pay for her friends’ abortions to her darkest porn habits.\n\nGlaser cited Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Ricky Gervais as inspirations. She’ll follow last year’s host Jo Koy, who was slammed by critics for a fumbled opening monologue and a rushed pace throughout.\n\nWho’s nominated for Golden Globes this year? \n\nJacques Audiard’s audacious musical “Emilia Pérez,” about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery, leads all nominees with 10.\n\nThat put it ahead of other contenders like the musical smash “Wicked,” the papal thriller “Conclave” and the postwar epic “The Brutalist.”\n\n“The Apprentice,” about Donald Trump as a young man, also landed nominations for its two central performances, by Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn.\n\n“The Bear” leads all television nominees with five.\n\nWith his 11th nomination, Denzel Washington is the most-nominated Black performer at the Globes.\n\nSteve Martin is nominated for the four straight year in the best television actor in a musical or comedy series category for “Only Murders in the Building.” The nomination marks his ninth overall and could be his first-ever Globes win.\n\nThere are 26 first-time nominees including Grande, Dakota Fanning, Glaser, Seth Meyers, Zoe Saldaña and Pamela Anderson — who surprisingly earned a nod for “The Last Showgirl.”\n\nThe embattled Globes, which are no longer presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are still in comeback mode after years of scandal and organizational upheaval.\n\nYou can see a full list of nominees here: https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards\n\nWho is presenting? \n\nA ton of starry people: Andrew Garfield, Anthony Mackie, Anthony Ramos, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ariana DeBose, Aubrey Plaza, Auliʻi Cravalho, Awkwafina, Brandi Carlile, Catherine O’Hara, Colin Farrell, Colman Domingo, Demi Moore, Dwayne Johnson, Édgar Ramírez, Elton John, Gal Gadot, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Jennifer Coolidge, Kaley Cuoco, Kate Hudson, Kathy Bates, Ke Huy Quan, Kerry Washington, Margaret Qualley, Melissa McCarthy, Michael Keaton, Michelle Yeoh, Miles Teller, Mindy Kaling, Morris Chestnut, Nate Bargatze, Nicolas Cage, Rachel Brosnahan, Rob McElhenney, Salma Hayek Pinault, Sarah Paulson, Seth Rogen, Sharon Stone, Vin Diesel, Viola Davis and Zoë Kravitz.\n\nWhat are the Golden Globes? \n\nThe Globes are the first major ceremony of the awards season. They’re not exactly an Oscar bellwether, but they’re known for a few things: being a boozy, sometimes irreverent party and a glamourous gathering of the biggest television and film stars.\n\nA Globes win can help build momentum for a movie or actor’s Oscar campaign. As the first televised awards show of the year, they get ahead of similar ceremonies like the Screen Actors Guild and Critics Choice Awards and are nearly two months before the Oscars, which this year will be held on March 2.\n\nDouble nominees please \n\nStan, Kate Winslet and Selena Gomez are all double nominees.\n\nGomez is up for both best performance by a female actor in a supporting role for “Emilia Pérez” and best performance by a female actor in a television musical or comedy series for “Only Murders in the Building.”\n\nWinslet is nominated for both best performance by a female actor in a drama for “Lee” and best performance by a female actor in a limited anthology series for television for “The Regime.”\n\nStan earned a nod for both best performance by a male actor in a drama for “The Apprentice” and best performance by a male actor in a musical or comedy for “A Different Man.”\n\nWho will receive the Golden Globes’ Cecil B. DeMille award? \n\nViola Davis will be honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for her decorated career, starring in an array of powerful roles from “ Fences ” to “ The Woman King.”\n\nThe actor has won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as “The Help,” “ Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom ” and “Doubt,” while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama “How to Get Away with Murder.”\n\nThe DeMille Award has been bestowed to 69 of Hollywood’s greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Meryl Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.\n\nWho’s the next Carol Burnett award honoree? \n\nThe Golden Globes are raising a glass to former “Cheers” star Ted Danson by naming him the Carol Burnett Award honoree.\n\nDanson, a three-time Globes winner, has been a fixture on TV since he broke out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC’s comedy “Cheers.” His other credits include “The Good Place,” “Mr. Mayor,” “Fargo,” “CSI” and “CSI: Cyber,” “Damages” and “Becker.”\n\nDanson currently stars in Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside,” which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.\n\nThe Carol Burnett Award was inaugurated in 2019 and is presented to an honoree who has “made outstanding contributions to television on or off screen.”\n\nPast recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.\n\nDanson and Viola Davis will be praised at a gala dinner Friday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. For the first time, the Globes will host a separate event dedicated to both awards.\n\nWhat will stars eat at the Globes? \n\nThe Golden Globes, known as the “party of the year,” will bring back the celeb-beloved Nobu Restaurants group.\n\nChef Nobu Matsuhisa returns with several signature dishes, highlighted by The Gold Standard Roll — sushi that includes king crab inside, topped with salmon, gold flakes and caviar, and yuzu sauce on the side. The dish is served in the restaurant for $77.\n\nOther dishes from Matsuhisa include seaweed tacos, yellowtail jalapenos, sashimi salad, black cod and three pieces of tuna, white fish and salmon sushi.\n\n“This is kind of like harmony with the caviars and, jalapenos,” said Matsuhisa, who served signature Japanese food at the ceremony last year.","url":"https://www.agassizharrisonobserver.com/entertainment/golden-globes-set-to-kick-off-awards-season-with-jolt-of-star-power-7736983","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2025/01/web1_240102-cpw-golden-globes-2025-grande_1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:19:22","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.452},{"id":277862268,"title":"Explosive Arsenal Found in Rented Cybertruck; Las Vegas Blast Raises Safety Concerns and Turo Scrutiny","text":"Chilling photographs from the exploded Cybertruck, rented through the car-sharing app Turo, reveal a cache of crudely constructed explosives. These findings have heightened concerns about the vehicle's safety record and the potential risks associated with car-sharing platforms. The Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas during the New Year's celebration on 1st January 2025.The driver of the Cybertruck, manufactured by Elon Musk's Tesla, remains unidentified and perished in the devastating blast, which also left seven others injured. The truck bed, now a grim scene of destruction, contained charred fireworks, gas canisters, and camping fuel—remnants of a deadly arsenal.Hours earlier in New Orleans, a horrific incident unfolded as 42-year-old Shamsud Din Jabbar intentionally drove an electric vehicle into a crowd of pedestrians, leaving 15 dead and dozens injured, according to a report by DailyMail.Las Vegas Explosion: Chilling Details EmergeLaw enforcement sources have revealed a chilling detail: both the New Orleans vehicular attack and the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion involved vehicles rented through Turo, raising serious concerns about a possible connection.On Wednesday afternoon, police revealed they are actively investigating potential connections between the two attacks, leaving no possibility unexplored. 'Do I think it's a coincidence? I don't know,' Sheriff Kevin McMahill said. 'We're absolutely looking into any connections to New Orleans.'Turo Connection: A Disturbing Pattern?In a press conference, investigators revealed the Cybertruck was rented from Turo in Colorado and driven across state lines to Nevada early Wednesday morning. Just an hour later, the vehicle exploded outside the Trump International Hotel.In a statement released on Wednesday, Turo confirmed that the vehicles involved in both the Las Vegas explosion and the New Orleans attack were rented through their platform.'Our trust and safety team is actively partnering with law enforcement authorities to share any information that could be helpful in their investigations,' the statement reads.'We do not believe that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat, and we are not currently aware of any information that indicates the two incidents are related.'Police Unveil Shocking Photos Of Explosive-Packed CybertruckPhotographs from inside the charred Cybertruck revealed a chilling arsenal: fireworks, gas tanks, and camping fuel lay scattered in the truck bed. Investigators are still piecing together the exact detonation method, but sources familiar with the investigation believe the driver likely initiated the explosion.Sheriff McMahill confirmed that the driver's remains are still in the heavily damaged Cybertruck. While authorities have identified the individual who rented the vehicle, they are withholding that information from the public at this time.Officers also speculate that the driver might have deliberately chosen a car owned by Musk to make a statement, given the Tesla CEO's recent alliance with President-elect Donald Trump. 'It's a Tesla truck; we know Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it's the Trump Hotel, so there's obviously something to look at,' he said.Musk Breaks Silence On Cybertruck's Role In Las Vegas ExplosionThe tragic incident may have had a silver lining. Authorities concurred with Musk's earlier statement, suggesting the Cybertruck's robust design may have mitigated the blast's impact, potentially limiting casualties.'The fact this was a Cybertruck really limited the damage,' McMahill said. 'It made most of the damage go up rather than out. The front glass doors at the Trump Hotel were not even broken by that blast.'Hours earlier, Musk had said: 'Cybertruck is the worst possible choice for a car bomb, as its stainless steel armour will contain the blast better than any other commercial vehicle.' The £63821 ($80,000) electric vehicle erupted in a fiery blaze outside the hotel's revolving doors at approximately 8:40 a.m., tragically claiming one life and injuring seven others.Musk emphasised that the vehicle itself was not the source of the explosion. It's understood that the unnamed driver had rented the truck through the peer-to-peer car-sharing platform Turo.'Law enforcement currently believes it was most likely intentional,' he added. 'Both this Cybertruck and the F-150 suicide bomb in New Orleans were rented from Turo. Perhaps they are linked in some way.'Musk stated that 'Tesla vehicles transmit their state of health continuously,' indicating that his team had access to real-time data on the vehicle's mechanical condition before the explosion.A History of Explosions: Cybertruck's Troubled PastWhile this incident raises serious concerns about the potential misuse of technology, it's important to note that this is not the first time Cybertruck has been involved in an explosive incident.On 5th August 2024, a Cybertruck was involved in a fatal accident in Baytown, Texas. The vehicle collided with a concrete culvert, resulting in a fire that tragically claimed the driver's life. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation.Another tragic accident occurred on 4th December when a Tesla Cybertruck veered off the road, collided with a tree, and burst into flames. Three recent graduates of Piedmont High School, who were home from college for the Thanksgiving holiday, tragically lost their lives, according to a report by CBS News Bay Area.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/explosive-arsenal-found-rented-cybertruck-las-vegas-blast-raises-safety-concerns-turo-scrutiny-1729827","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1733917/tesla-cybertruck-explosion-outside-trump-tower.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:19:14","author":"Vinay Patel","authors":["Vinay Patel"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":277862264,"title":"Zelensky Vows Ukraine Will Do Everything In 2025 To Stop Russia","text":"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday vowed that his country would use 2025 to fight for an end to Russia's nearly three-year-long invasion by any means necessary.The Ukrainian leader's address caps a difficult year for the war-battered country which has been fending off a better-resourced Russian army for nearly three years.\"May 2025 be our year,\" Zelensky said in an address to the nation just before the clock struck midnight in Kyiv.\"We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war.\"Ukraine lost seven times more territory to Russia this year than in 2023, according to an AFP analysis, and is facing the possibility of a reduction in US military and political backing when Donald Trump takes over the White House.Incumbent US President Joe Biden's administration unveiled almost $6 billion in military and budget aid for Ukraine on Monday in a race to support Kyiv before Trump takes office in January.The Republican has promised to end the conflict in \"24 hours\" once in power, raising fears in Ukraine that it will be forced to give up all the land the Kremlin currently controls in exchange for peace.In his new year's address Zelensky said that Ukraine had to continue to fight to gain the upper hand -- both on the battlefield and ahead of any prospective peace talks.\"Every day in the coming year, I, and all of us, must fight for a Ukraine that is strong enough,\" the Ukrainian leader said.\"Because only such a Ukraine is respected and heard. Both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.\"But Zelensky appeared sanguine about Trump's return.\"I have no doubt that the new American President is willing and capable of achieving peace and ending (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's aggression,\" Zelensky said.In his own New Year's Eve address on Tuesday, Putin did not explicitly mention the war in Ukraine but praised Russia's soldiers for their \"courage and bravery\".\"You are true heroes who have undertaken the great military labour to defend Russia,\" he said.Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov paid tribute to \"fallen soldiers\" in his address, saying that they had died fighting \"Nazism\" -- a pretext Putin used to launch his invasion.Since that began in February 2022, Moscow has launched overnight aerial attacks on Ukraine almost every day.Those have targeted military and civilian infrastructure, including the power grid.Ukraine has stepped up its own attacks inside Russian territory in response, and urged its Western allies to supply more air defence systems.A Ukrainian drone strike in western Russia caused a fuel spill and fire at an oil depot, a Russian regional governor said earlier on Tuesday.Zelensky has urged his war-battered country's allies to help end the invasion and bring lasting peace in 2025.Those hopes were echoed to AFP on the streets of Kyiv ahead of the turn of the new year.\"I want peace to finally be obtained for Ukraine, for people to stop dying, for all our soldiers to return to their homes and celebrate next year and next Christmas with their families,\" said Kateryna Chemeryz, a teacher.\"It seems to me that everyone has one wish, one dream: that Ukraine will win, and all our territories are regained,\" said Tetiana, a civil servant who declined to give her family name.The incoming US president has vowed to end the war but has not outlined any roadmap and there are concerns a deal could come at the expense of Ukrainian territory.Zelensky has sought to build bridges with Trump and his team, amid fears the Republican could slow vital US military aid or halt it entirely.\"For me personally, there is some anxiety, because I was hoping for a different outcome,\" Chemeryz, the teacher, said of Trump's return to the White House.Tetiana was dismissive, saying Ukraine should work to determine its own fate \"without Trump or anyone else\".","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/zelensky-vows-ukraine-will-do-everything-2025-stop-russia-1729857","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1733997/ukraines-president-volodymyr-zelensky-said-ukraine-will-do-everything-stop-russia-end-war.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:19:14","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.057},{"id":277862266,"title":"Tesla Reports Lower 2024 Auto Deliveries, Missing Forecast","text":"Tesla reported a dip in full-year auto sales Thursday, missing a company forecast in a sign of rising electric vehicle competition in China and other markets.Elon Musk's EV company reported 495,570 fourth-quarter deliveries. While that represented a quarterly record, it lagged Wall Street estimates and resulted in full year-sales of just under 1.8 million vehicles.This was around one percent less than the 2023 sales, even as Tesla said in October that it expected a \"slight growth\" in vehicle deliveries for the year.Besides rising competition from producers like China's BYD and legacy auto companies, analysts pointed to a sluggish ramp-up of production of the futuristic Cybertruck.Shares of Tesla fell sharply following the release, cutting into the company's massive gains since the November 5 US presidential election.The sales figure caps a mixed 2024 for Tesla, a year in which Musk dove full-on into US electoral politics.He helped to deliver the presidency to Republican Donald Trump through massive contributions and the amplification of anti-immigrant and other Trump rhetoric on Musk's X platform, the former Twitter.But Tesla's profits through the first three quarters of 2024 fell 31 percent from the equivalent period of 2023, a reflection of moves to slash prices in the wake of slowing demand.Tesla has called the current period of moderating sales reflective of its position \"between two major growth waves,\" with the next period of volume increases due to advances in autonomy and the introduction of new vehicle products.The company has faced pressure to roll out new vehicles, with Wall Street particularly eager to see a lower-priced model. The Model 3 currently starts at around $30,000.Investors cheered a Musk statement in July that he plans a new, more affordable model in the first half of 2025, but the company has provided few details.CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson pointed to tepid deliveries of the Cybertruck, which customers first began receiving in November 2023.Tesla's press release Thursday did not break out sales for the vehicle, which were a component of \"other models.\" Deliveries in this category stod at just 85,133 for the year.Musk has previously described the Cybertruck's challenges as production-related, characterizing demand as robust. He has said he expects annual sales of 250,000 Cybertrucks in North America.But today's output appears to be well below Cybertruck's current installed capacity of above 125,000 per year, according to Tesla literature.\"The ramp up has been disappointing,\" said Nelson, adding that the figures raise questions about demand for the vehicle.Though still not common on US roads, the massive, brutal-looking Cybertruck has become perhaps Tesla's most emblematic vehicle, generating both adoration from Tesla fans and mockery on social media from critics.Authorities were investigating the explosion of a Cybertruck Wednesday outside Trump hotel in Las Vegas that killed one person.Shares of Tesla rose more than 60 percent between the November 5 election of Trump as president and the end of 2024, with the market certain that Musk's clout with the incoming administration will benefit Tesla initiatives in autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.\"The next step in this broader Tesla strategic vision begins is the autonomous and AI era which will be accelerated under a Trump White House,\" said analysts at Wedbush, which called Tesla's 2024 auto sales a secondary issue compared with Tesla's growth story.Tesla skeptics point to the on-the-ground progress of Alphabet-owned Waymo, which currently runs robotaxis in three US cities. A heavily-touted October launch event in Los Angeles showing off Tesla's autonomous robotaxi vehicles received mostly lackluster reviews.But Tesla bulls point to the company's progress in driver-assistance technologies, which is providing the company with data that it believes will ultimately lead to full autonomy.\"We still have a buy on the stock,\" said Nelson, who also foresees a rebound in sales next year. \"2025 is going to be a year where there's significant progress in developing the framework on autonomous driving. So that's a positive for the stock.\"Shares of Tesla sank 6.9 percent in early-afternoon trading.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/tesla-reports-lower-2024-auto-deliveries-missing-forecast-1729840","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1733929/cybertruck-arrived-more-significant-way-2024-sluggish-ramp-was-one-factors-teh-drop.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:19:14","author":"John Biers","authors":["John Biers"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":277862256,"title":"Musk Flummoxes Internet With 'Kekius Maximus' Persona","text":"Elon Musk adopted the moniker \"Kekius Maximus\" on X Tuesday, sparking speculation among his 210 million followers about his mysterious new handle that is a mash-up of an alt-right symbol, a memecoin, and the lead character of the movie \"Gladiator.\"Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and a confidant of US President-elect Donald Trump, also replaced his profile picture with one of \"Pepe the Frog,\" a popular cartoon character, wearing ancient Roman attire and holding a video game joystick.In typical Musk fashion, the billionaire tech mogul and owner of X -- formerly Twitter -- offered no explanation about the new username and avatar, but the move triggered immediate ripple effects.The change roiled the cryptocurrency world, sending the value of a memecoin -- a digital currency inspired by an internet meme -- with the same name skyrocketing.It also sent internet sleuths hunting for answers: Was the name change just for the laughs? Was there a hidden message? Was this another thinly-disguised attempt to jolt the crypto markets? More troublingly, was it a wink and a nod to online hate groups?Musk and X did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment.His new handle appears to be a blend of \"Maximus Decimus Meridius\" -- a Roman general played by Russell Crowe in the 2000 smash hit \"Gladiator\" -- and \"kek,\" an expression popular among the alt-right and internet trolls that is used as a variation of \"LOL,\" or laugh out loud.\"Kek\" is also a reference to a \"virtual white nationalist god,\" the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center told AFP, adding that Roman male images have been used by white nationalist groups such as Identity Evropa.Pepe the Frog was originally a cartoon character from the \"Boy's Club\" comic series, but during Trump's first presidential campaign it became associated with the alt-right and white supremacists, with the Anti-Defamation League dubbing it a \"hate symbol.\"\"The majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be, non-bigoted,\" the ADL wrote on its website.However, as it proliferated online, the meme was centered on \"racist, antisemitic or other bigoted themes,\" the ADL added.\"Manipulators can twist anything to give a wink and a nod to a sub-culture of online hate, while claiming ignorance,\" the SPLC said.\"The use of the meme and name are indicative of the continued online culture that claims hateful ideas are simply jokes. Hate is not a joke.\"Before changing his handle, Musk posted a teaser on X: \"Kekius Maximus will soon reach level 80 in hardcore PoE.\"PoE is an apparent reference to the popular \"Path of Exile 2\" video game.The billionaire is known to play the game, calling it a \"hall-of-famer\" earlier this month in a post on X.In the wake of Musk's handle change, the memecoin Kekius Maximus's value soared by more than 900 percent as of Tuesday evening, according to the site CoinGecko.The memecoin was trading at less than one-fifth of a dollar at around 0030 GMT.In the past, Musk has sent crypto prices on a rollercoaster ride with his social media commentary, but it was not immediately clear if he has any involvement in this particular memecoin.The billionaire, an advisor to the incoming Trump administration, has been tapped to run the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with reducing government spending.Musk's account on X has become increasingly influential -- and has often courted criticism for amplifying misinformation -- since his purchase of the platform for $44 billion in 2022.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/musk-flummoxes-internet-kekius-maximus-persona-1729858","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1733998/elon-musk-has-adopted-new-online-persona-sparking-flood-speculation-online.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:19:14","author":"Anuj Chopra","authors":["Anuj Chopra"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":277862022,"title":"Golden Globes set to kick off awards season with jolt of star power","text":"The Golden Globes will return Sunday with major star appeal thanks to a slew of big name nominees, including Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande and more. \n\nNominations for the 82nd awards ceremony were made last month. The show will be televised by CBS and streamed on Paramount+.\n\nHere’s key things to know about the ceremony:\n\nWho’s hosting the Golden Globes? \n\nComedian and actor Nikki Glaser was chosen to host next year’s ceremony.\n\nGlaser has made a name for herself as a riotously sharp wit, especially at roasts, including recently for Tom Brady, who she needled for his complex love life and his one-time advocacy of crypto. She earned an Emmy nomination for her latest special, “Someday You’ll Die” for HBO, which dealt with everything from offering to pay for her friends’ abortions to her darkest porn habits.\n\nGlaser cited Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Ricky Gervais as inspirations. She’ll follow last year’s host Jo Koy, who was slammed by critics for a fumbled opening monologue and a rushed pace throughout.\n\nWho’s nominated for Golden Globes this year? \n\nJacques Audiard’s audacious musical “Emilia Pérez,” about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery, leads all nominees with 10.\n\nThat put it ahead of other contenders like the musical smash “Wicked,” the papal thriller “Conclave” and the postwar epic “The Brutalist.”\n\n“The Apprentice,” about Donald Trump as a young man, also landed nominations for its two central performances, by Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn.\n\n“The Bear” leads all television nominees with five.\n\nWith his 11th nomination, Denzel Washington is the most-nominated Black performer at the Globes.\n\nSteve Martin is nominated for the four straight year in the best television actor in a musical or comedy series category for “Only Murders in the Building.” The nomination marks his ninth overall and could be his first-ever Globes win.\n\nThere are 26 first-time nominees including Grande, Dakota Fanning, Glaser, Seth Meyers, Zoe Saldaña and Pamela Anderson — who surprisingly earned a nod for “The Last Showgirl.”\n\nThe embattled Globes, which are no longer presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are still in comeback mode after years of scandal and organizational upheaval.\n\nYou can see a full list of nominees here: https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards\n\nWho is presenting? \n\nA ton of starry people: Andrew Garfield, Anthony Mackie, Anthony Ramos, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ariana DeBose, Aubrey Plaza, Auliʻi Cravalho, Awkwafina, Brandi Carlile, Catherine O’Hara, Colin Farrell, Colman Domingo, Demi Moore, Dwayne Johnson, Édgar Ramírez, Elton John, Gal Gadot, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Jennifer Coolidge, Kaley Cuoco, Kate Hudson, Kathy Bates, Ke Huy Quan, Kerry Washington, Margaret Qualley, Melissa McCarthy, Michael Keaton, Michelle Yeoh, Miles Teller, Mindy Kaling, Morris Chestnut, Nate Bargatze, Nicolas Cage, Rachel Brosnahan, Rob McElhenney, Salma Hayek Pinault, Sarah Paulson, Seth Rogen, Sharon Stone, Vin Diesel, Viola Davis and Zoë Kravitz.\n\nWhat are the Golden Globes? \n\nThe Globes are the first major ceremony of the awards season. They’re not exactly an Oscar bellwether, but they’re known for a few things: being a boozy, sometimes irreverent party and a glamourous gathering of the biggest television and film stars.\n\nA Globes win can help build momentum for a movie or actor’s Oscar campaign. As the first televised awards show of the year, they get ahead of similar ceremonies like the Screen Actors Guild and Critics Choice Awards and are nearly two months before the Oscars, which this year will be held on March 2.\n\nDouble nominees please \n\nStan, Kate Winslet and Selena Gomez are all double nominees.\n\nGomez is up for both best performance by a female actor in a supporting role for “Emilia Pérez” and best performance by a female actor in a television musical or comedy series for “Only Murders in the Building.”\n\nWinslet is nominated for both best performance by a female actor in a drama for “Lee” and best performance by a female actor in a limited anthology series for television for “The Regime.”\n\nStan earned a nod for both best performance by a male actor in a drama for “The Apprentice” and best performance by a male actor in a musical or comedy for “A Different Man.”\n\nWho will receive the Golden Globes’ Cecil B. DeMille award? \n\nViola Davis will be honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for her decorated career, starring in an array of powerful roles from “ Fences ” to “ The Woman King.”\n\nThe actor has won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as “The Help,” “ Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom ” and “Doubt,” while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama “How to Get Away with Murder.”\n\nThe DeMille Award has been bestowed to 69 of Hollywood’s greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Meryl Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.\n\nWho’s the next Carol Burnett award honoree? \n\nThe Golden Globes are raising a glass to former “Cheers” star Ted Danson by naming him the Carol Burnett Award honoree.\n\nDanson, a three-time Globes winner, has been a fixture on TV since he broke out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC’s comedy “Cheers.” His other credits include “The Good Place,” “Mr. Mayor,” “Fargo,” “CSI” and “CSI: Cyber,” “Damages” and “Becker.”\n\nDanson currently stars in Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside,” which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.\n\nThe Carol Burnett Award was inaugurated in 2019 and is presented to an honoree who has “made outstanding contributions to television on or off screen.”\n\nPast recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.\n\nDanson and Viola Davis will be praised at a gala dinner Friday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. For the first time, the Globes will host a separate event dedicated to both awards.\n\nWhat will stars eat at the Globes? \n\nThe Golden Globes, known as the “party of the year,” will bring back the celeb-beloved Nobu Restaurants group.\n\nChef Nobu Matsuhisa returns with several signature dishes, highlighted by The Gold Standard Roll — sushi that includes king crab inside, topped with salmon, gold flakes and caviar, and yuzu sauce on the side. The dish is served in the restaurant for $77.\n\nOther dishes from Matsuhisa include seaweed tacos, yellowtail jalapenos, sashimi salad, black cod and three pieces of tuna, white fish and salmon sushi.\n\n“This is kind of like harmony with the caviars and, jalapenos,” said Matsuhisa, who served signature Japanese food at the ceremony last year.","url":"https://www.peacearchnews.com/entertainment/golden-globes-set-to-kick-off-awards-season-with-jolt-of-star-power-7736983","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2025/01/web1_240102-cpw-golden-globes-2025-grande_1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:16:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.452},{"id":277860794,"title":"Clegg leaves Meta role as Republican promoted ahead of Trump presidency","text":"Sir Nick Clegg is leaving his job as global affairs president with Facebook’s parent company Meta.\n\nThe former UK deputy prime minister said it was “the right time for me to move on” from the role acting as a bridge between the worlds of technology and politics.\n\nIn an announcement made just weeks before Donald Trump’s inauguration as US president, Sir Nick’s replacement will be former Republican White House deputy chief of staff Joel Kaplan.\n\nMr Kaplan served under George W Bush from 2006 to 2009.\n\nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick said: “As a new year begins, I have come to the view that this is the right time for me to move on from my role as president, global affairs at Meta.\n\n“It truly has been an adventure of a lifetime!”\n\nSir Nick, who joined the firm which was then called Facebook in 2018 after losing his seat as an MP in 2017, said: “My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between ‘big tech’ and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector.\n\n“I hope I have played some role in seeking to bridge the very different worlds of tech and politics – worlds that will continue to interact in unpredictable ways across the globe.”\n\nHe added: “Having worked previously for close to two decades in European and British politics, it has been an extraordinary privilege to gain a front row insight into what makes Silicon Valley such an enduring hub of world leading innovation.\n\n“The pace and scale of change has been as dizzying as it has been ambitious.”\n\nHe said Mr Kaplan, his deputy at Meta, will now become the chief global affairs officer and was “quite clearly the right person for the right job at the right time – ideally placed to shape the company’s strategy as societal and political expectations around technology continue to evolve”.\n\nSir Nick said he would be spending “the next few months handing over the reins” and “then – as with each chapter in my lucky career in politics, Government and the private sector – I will move on to new adventures”.\n\nKevin Martin, who served as Federal Communications Commission chairman under George W Bush, will move into Mr Kaplan’s former role as vice president of global policy.","url":"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/news/national/clegg-leaves-meta-role-as-republican-promoted-ahead-of-trump-presidency-124370/","image":"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/_media/img/P4KZGIOYP0V71FONTF3S.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:06:17","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.555},{"id":277860338,"title":"US soldier identified as dead in Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion: Reports","text":"Details have started to emerge about the man killed in the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas on New Year’s Day.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said that the coroner’s office suggested man died by suicide before the blast.\n\n“The individual had sustained a gunshot wound to the head prior to the detonation of the vehicle,” McMahill told reporters. He added that a handgun was found at the man’s feet.\n\nEarlier in the day, news agencies including The Associated Press and AFP identified the man as an active-duty soldier named Matthew Livelsberger.\n\nCiting unnamed military officials, the news outlets explained that Livelsberger was on leave from his post with the United States Army Special Operations Command.\n\nHe was a highly decorated Green Beret who had served in various roles with the US military since 2006, with stints in Afghanistan, Ukraine and Tajikistan, among other locations.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Livelsberger was allegedly found dead inside the Tesla Cybertruck burning on the circular driveway outside the hotel’s glass front doors.\n\nSeven other people were wounded when the Cybertruck exploded, and details remain scarce about the circumstances surrounding the blast.\n\nKenny Cooper, a special agent for the the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, expressed surprise that a military member was involved in the explosion, which did little damage except to the Cybertruck.\n\n“The level of sophistication is not what we would expect from an individual with this type of military experience,” Kenny Cooper said.\n\nEarly investigations indicate the Cybertruck has been carrying fireworks and camp fuel cannisters when it exploded.\n\nThe Trump International Hotel Las Vegas is named for President-elect Donald Trump, a co-owner of the property who is set to take office for a second term in the White House on January 20.\n\nIn a brief statement on Thursday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said investigators had searched a home in Colorado in connection to the incident but offered no further details.\n\n“FBI Denver; the Denver Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; and the Colorado Springs Police Department are conducting law enforcement activity at a residential address in Colorado Springs,” the statement reads.\n\n“FBI Denver personnel and specialized teams will be on-site for several hours. This activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas on Wednesday.”\n\nThe explosion took place on the same day as a deadly car-ramming attack in the southern city of New Orleans that killed at least 15 people, including the suspect.\n\nAt least 35 more people were injured in that attack, according to an official estimate on Thursday. That incident is being investigated as a terrorist attack, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were allegedly discovered in coolers left on the street at the crime scene.\n\nBut authorities have stopped short of connecting the two incidents.\n\nAt a news briefing in New Orleans on Thursday, Christopher Raia, a deputy assistant director from the FBI’s counterterrorism division, emphasised he has found no connection so far.\n\n“We are following up on all potential leads and not ruling everything out,” Raia told reporters. “However, at this point, there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.”\n\nLaw enforcement initially believed that the suspect in the New Orleans attack, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, had received assistance from others.\n\nBut on Thursday, Raia said authorities now believe Jabbar acted alone. “We’re confident at this point that there are no accomplices.”\n\nHe said the initial reports of accomplices were likely spurred by witnesses who reported passersby examining the two coolers with the IEDs, without knowing what was inside.\n\nJabbar was ultimately shot and killed after exiting his vehicle and opening fire on police.\n\nBoth the New Orleans car-ramming and the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion involved vehicles that had been rented through the car rental app Turo.\n\nLivelsberger and Jabbar were also both military veterans who spent time at Fort Bragg, a North Carolina military installation now known as Fort Liberty.\n\nBut an anonymous official told The Associated Press that the two men were not stationed at the base at the same time.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/us-soldier-identified-as-dead-in-las-vegas-cybertruck-explosion-reports/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2024/12/s1-1733245535-VdWTHv.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:02:18","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"vc","sentiment":-0.481},{"id":277859892,"title":"Biden considered attack on Iran nuclear sites - Axios","text":"2 Oregon men die from exposure in Washington state forestTugboat sinks in river after colliding with tanker in LouisianaMega Millions player in California wins $1.3 billion jackpot15 hurt in Florida as train hits fire truck\n\n Biden considered attack on Iran nuclear sites - Axios White House reportedly discussed potential US military action before President-elect Donald Trump takes office President Joe Biden held a high-level meeting several weeks ago to discuss potential US military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, according to multiple sources cited by Axios.The discussions were reportedly part of contingency planning for scenarios in which Iran moves closer to developing nuclear weapons before Biden leaves office on January 20.National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan presented various options to Biden during the meeting, but the president has not authorized any action, and no active discussions on military strikes are currently underway, the sources added.A US official, speaking anonymously, clarified that the meeting was not prompted by new intelligence but aimed to assess \"prudent scenario planning\" if Iran enriched uranium to weapon-grade levels.

An arrest would be unprecedented for an incumbent South Korean president.\n\nOfficials from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading a joint team of investigators that include the police and prosecutors, had arrived gates of Yoon's compound shortly after 7 a.m. (2200 GMT Thursday), according to Reuters witnesses.\n\nYonhap News Agency reported that about 3,000 police had been mobilised in preparation.\n\nIt was unclear whether the Presidential Security Service, which has blocked access by investigators with a search warrant to Yoon's office and official residence, would try to stop the arrest.\n\nMedia reports said the CIO vehicles did not immediately enter the compound.\n\nProtesters gathered in the pre-dawn hours near his residence, with the numbers swelling into the hundreds amid media reports that investigating authorities would soon try to execute the arrest warrant that was approved on Tuesday after Yoon refused summons to appear.\n\n\"We have to block them with our lives,\" one was heard saying to others. About a dozen protesters tried to block a group of police officers at the entrance to a pedestrian overpass.\n\nSome chanted \"President Yoon Suk Yeol will be protected by the people,\" and called for the head of the CIO to be arrested.\n\nPyeong In-su, 74, said that the police had to be stopped by \"patriotic citizens\", a term Yoon used to describe those standing guard near his residence.\n\nHolding a flag of the United States and South Korea with the words \"Let's go together\" in English and Korean, Pyeong said he hoped incoming U.S. President Donald Trump would come to Yoon's aid.\n\n\"I hope after Trump's inauguration he can use his influence to help our country get back on the right track,\" he said.\n\nYoon sent shockwaves through the country with a late-night announcement on Dec. 3 that he was imposing martial law to overcome political deadlock and root out \"anti-state forces\".\n\nWithin hours, however, 190 lawmakers had defied the cordons of troops and police to vote against Yoon's order. About six hours after his initial decree, Yoon rescinded it.\n\nHe later issued a defiant defence of his decision, saying domestic political opponents are sympathetic to North Korea and citing uncorroborated claims of election tampering.\n\nInsurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity.\n\nYoon's lawyers have said the arrest warrant was illegal and invalid because the CIO did not have the authority under South Korean law to request a warrant.\n\nYoon has been isolated since he was impeached and suspended from power on Dec. 14.\n\nSeparate from the criminal investigation, his impeachment case is currently before the Constitutional Court to decide whether to reinstate or permanently remove him. A second hearing in that case is scheduled for later on Friday.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Authorities sought on Friday to execute an arrest warrant for impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, as a crowd of protesters faced off with police outside his residence and vowed to block any attempt.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/south-korea-authorities-arrive-to-arrest-impeached-president-yoon-suk-yeol-290172.html","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-01/7kr9cs4o_south-korea-president-to-arrest_625x300_03_January_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 00:00:06","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.388},{"id":277862638,"title":"Sheinbaum disputes NYT fentanyl report: the mañanera recapped","text":"The US dollar-Mexican peso exchange rate.

States, China, Germany, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Brazil, Canada and Russia.\n\n“We’re still the 12th largest economy in the world, … above Spain, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia, Netherlands, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland,” she said, mentioning the countries ranked 13th to 20th based on the size of their economy.\n\nThe data Sheinbaum presented showed that Mexico had a GDP of US $1.789 trillion in 2023, equivalent to 1.7% of global GDP.\n\nPlan to receive deportees during second Trump administration is ‘ready,’ says Sheinbaum \n\nAsked about the progress that has been made in terms of preparing for the possible mass deportation of Mexicans from the United States during Donald Trump’s second term as U.S. president, Sheinbaum said that the government already has a “very elaborate plan.”\n\n“… We already have it ready,” she stressed, adding that the government is waiting to see what happens vis-à-vis deportations before presenting the plan.\n\n“But everything is prepared,” Sheinbaum said, adding that states all over the country will have a role in the plan’s execution.\n\nThe government is not just working with the border states but with entities all over the republic, she said.\n\n“If a compatriot arrives to Mexico at the border, it’s very probable that he or she will want to go to their place of origin,” she said.\n\nGovernment seeks to debunk NYT fentanyl report \n\nThree days after Sheinbaum declared that a New York Times report about fentanyl production in Sinaloa “is not very credible,” no fewer than three other government officials sought to explain why the report is not grounded in truth.\n\nA central focus of the officials — the director of health agency IMSS-Bienestar, the director of health regulator Cofepris and a precursor chemicals specialist with the Mexican Navy — was the Times’ suggestion that fentanyl cooks could develop a tolerance to the synthetic opioid.\n\nReferring to a conversation with two alleged fentanyl cooks at a Sinaloa Cartel lab in Culiacán, reporters for the Times, who said they wore “gas masks and hazmat suits” to the lab, wrote:\n\n“While one sniff of the toxic chemicals could kill us, they explained, they had built up a tolerance to the lethal drug.”\n\nCofepris director Armida Zúñiga Estrada told reporters on Thursday that “there is no evidence of tolerance of this substance.”\n\nSimilarly, navy chemicals analyst Juana Peñaloza Ibarra said “there is no scientific evidence that supports the idea” that a person can build up a “tolerance to the lethal drug.”\n\nFor his part, IMSS-Bienestar director Alejandro Svarch Pérez said that if cooks shown in the Times’ report had really been producing fentanyl, they would have fallen down unconscious in 30 seconds due to “the vapors” emitted from “the synthesis of fentanyl.”\n\nThe cooks were wearing face masks but were not using any professional protective equipment.\n\nTo produce fentanyl, “a laboratory where the conditions of exposure can be controlled is required,” Svarch said, adding that “specialized equipment” and “professional ventilation systems” are also needed.\n\nFentanyl can’t be made in “a domestic kitchen, as the report shows,” he said.\n\n“It is not possible to make fentanyl in the way referred to in the article,” Svarch added.\n\nSheinbaum said on Monday that fentanyl is not produced in the way the Times’ photographs demonstrate, and suggested that the cooks were actually making methamphetamine.\n\nOn Thursday she said that “if there was [such a thing as] tolerance to the lethal drug, there wouldn’t be the deaths due to fentanyl that there [currently] are in the United States.”\n\nIn pointing out alleged falsehoods in The New York Times report, Sheinbaum said that the government was “defending the right to information, to veracity” and committed her administration to “denouncing” inaccurate reporting in the future.\n\nAfter the president questioned the credibility of the Times’ article earlier this week, the newspaper said it was “completely confident” in its reporting on fentanyl production in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum’s rejection of the newspaper’s reporting continues a practice of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who was an outspoken critic of the Mexican and international press during his presidency.\n\nWhether the Times’ Dec. 29 report really shows fentanyl cooks in a fentanyl lab or not, the fact remains that large quantities of the synthetic opioid are made in Mexico (using precursor chemicals from China) and illegally shipped to the United States.\n\nThe Mexican government’s willingness and capacity (or lack thereof) to reduce the flow of fentanyl — and migrants — to the United States looks set to be a defining factor in the health of the Sheinbaum administration’s relationship with the U.S. government led by Trump. In November, the president-elect pledged to impose a 25% tariff on all Mexican and Canadian exports on the first day of his second term due to what he called the “long simmering problem” of drugs and migrants illegally entering the U.S. from the country’s southern and northern neighbors.\n\nBy Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"Sheinbaum's Thursday conference questioned a New York Times article claiming that fentanyl cookers in Sinaloa had developed immunity to the drug's deadly vapors.\n\n\nThe post Sheinbaum disputes NYT fentanyl report: the mañanera recapped appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-fentanyl-mexico/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sheinbaum-mananera-1-2-2025-Daniel-Augusto-Cuartoscuro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:59:47","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":0.074},{"id":277859950,"title":"New Jersey makes last-ditch attempt to block NYC congestion toll before it takes effect Sunday","text":"New Jersey is making a last-ditch attempt to block Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s controversial congestion toll — which is set to kick in Sunday for drivers entering Manhattan south of 60th Street.\n\nNewark federal Judge Leo Gordon is scheduled to hold a hearing Friday after Jersey lawyers asked for clarification of his 72-page ruling issued earlier this week.\n\nHis decision appeared to greenlight the first-in-nation congestion pricing program despite citing shortcomings on how the US Dept. of Transportation and the MTA addressed environmental mitigation for Garden State communities that would be impacted by the new toll.\n\n“We are confident the judge will say it can’t go forward. How can you go forward with a plan the federal court says is defective?” said Bruce Nagel, one of the lawyers for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. \n\nThe MTA and Hochul say otherwise and are moving ahead with implementing the toll beginning at midnight Sunday — barring a court reversal.\n\nThe MTA will charge the $9 toll for passenger vehicles during peak hours, from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. At all other times, those drivers will be charged $2.25.\n\nWhile Gordon said in his Monday ruling that environmental mitigation concerns on the New Jersey side of the Hudson have to be addressed, he did not explicitly call for halting implementation of the toll.\n\nHe said the defendants erred in not providing enough specifics on measures to mitigate environmental impacts from diverted traffic in Jersey communities compared to New York’s, such as The Bronx.\n\nIn sum, the ruling nullifies key federal approvals that should halt New York from collecting the toll, said another Jersey lawyer, Randy Mastro.\n\n“Allowing congestion pricing to begin without adherence to [US environmental] mandates would thus cause New Jersey irreparable procedural harm in addition to concrete environmental injuries, even if the tolling was later halted.” Mastro said in the post-decision court filing.\n\nMastro argued there’s no harm in delaying implementation of the toll, noting Hochul did just that in June, claiming the burden on working class New Yorkers would be too heavy.\n\nThe governor originally tabled a $15 proposed toll to enter Midtown — then infamously waited until after the election in November to push a lower $9 commuter fee, set to increase to $12 in 2028.\n\nSome everyday New Yorkers — including cops, firefighters and teachers — are fuming over the toll, as are Garden State residents and elected leaders.\n\n“New York has flipped the bird at the judge and said, ‘We’re going to go ahead anyway!” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat whose constituents live in the Hudson communities on the Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge.\n\n“There’s a reason why it’s called a lung tax because the judge admits, as I read in what he said, that they have proposed no action to mitigate the effect on children’s lungs, on parents lungs, here in Northern New Jersey. And that’s what we got to get answers to,” added Gottheimer, who is running for governor this year. \n\nThe MTA defended the toll and blasted Gottheimer.\n\n“Nobody in their right mind should take transportation advice from the New Jersey politicians who have woefully failed to manage transit in their state—while also endorsing higher tolls on their own roads and on Port Authority bridges and tunnels, and higher fares on NJ Transit,” said John McCarthy, the MTA’s chief of policy and external relations.\n\n“Endless litigation over New York’s program to improve its transit and reduce traffic is the height of hypocrisy.”\n\nMass transit advocates who support congestion pricing also said it’s time to move forward.\n\n“After 18 months of litigation and millions of New Jersey taxpayer dollars down the drain, Governor Phil Murphy dares to beg a federal judge for a do-over because he refused to negotiate mitigation measures,” said Transit Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein.\n\nBut there is stiff opposition in New York, where a majority of voters say they hate the $9 toll.\n\n“We urge the MTA Board to convene immediately and vote to pause congestion pricing before further damage is done,” The City Council’s Common Sense Caucus said in a statement.\n\nEven former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who muscled through the congestion pricing law in 2019, opposes imposing the toll, at this time\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump also opposes the congestion toll and may try to kill it upon taking office January 20, while the outgoing Biden administration approved it.\n\n“It will hurt workers, families, and businesses, but in particular, anything to do with jobs. It is the most regressive tax known to womankind (man!).” Trump said following the November election.","summary":"New Jersey is making a last gasp attempt to block implementation Sunday of Gov.

The bill — and especially the proposed definition of assault-style weapons — proved controversial.\n\nThe legislation faced tough opposition in the House of Commons and the Senate before eventually becoming law in December 2023.\n\nMendicino was also in charge of the public safety file when the government invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in early 2022.\n\nThe unprecedented move came after “Freedom Convoy” protesters had occupied downtown Ottawa for weeks, filling the streets with vehicles and forcing businesses to close. A loosely organized group, the convoy was opposed to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and the Trudeau government, and protesters also blocked a number of border crossings.\n\nMendicino was dropped from cabinet in a shuffle in July 2023, along with former justice minister David Lametti.\n\nTrudeau’s decision to move Mendicino out of his cabinet was widely seen as a rebuke for his handling of the transfer of notorious killer and dangerous offender Paul Bernardo from a maximum-security prison earlier that spring.\n\nBernardo is serving an indeterminate life sentence for the kidnapping, torture and murders of teenagers Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s.\n\nThe correctional service transferred Bernardo in May 2023 to a medium-security facility that specializes in the treatment of sexual offenders, sparking a public uproar. The Mahaffy and French families called for the decision to be reversed.\n\nAt the time, Mendicino said he found the independent correctional service’s decision “shocking and incomprehensible.” He also told reporters that his staff never told him Bernardo would be moved, although it was revealed that his office knew about the plan to transfer Bernardo three months before it happened.\n\nMendicino later issued a series of directives to the correctional service, which aimed to ensure transfers of high-profile offenders were better communicated to the minister and to victims’ families. After an internal review, the correctional service found the decision to approve Bernardo’s transfer request was sound and followed all applicable laws and policies.\n\nMore recently, Mendicino has been a vocal supporter of the Jewish community and has pressured the Liberal government to do more to tackle rising antisemitism in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn his statement, he said it is “no secret” that he has disagreed with the federal government’s approach to foreign policy, citing “our deteriorated relations with the State of Israel, our inadequate handling of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and our enfeebled role in the Middle East.”\n\n“In political parties, there must be room for different views,” he wrote. “As a matter of principle, I have been consistently outspoken in my condemnation of the unjust targeting of the Jewish community, which is facing a tidal wave of antisemitism.”\n\nMendicino did not hint at what he may do after federal politics but said community leaders have told him they feel he should continue to play an active leadership role in Toronto. He also said he is passionate about the law and public policy.\n\nNews that Mendicino will not be on the Liberal ballot in the next election comes after weeks of chaos in the Liberal caucus.\n\nTrudeau shuffled his cabinet in mid-December, after the bombshell news that Chrystia Freeland was stepping down as finance minister and deputy prime minister.\n\nFreeland said she and Trudeau disagreed over how to handle the country’s finances after U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s threat to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods.\n\nTrudeau replaced her with Dominic LeBlanc, who had been public safety minister since Mendicino’s ouster.\n\nHe also had to replace Sean Fraser, Carla Qualtrough, Marie-Claude Bibeau, Dan Vandal and Filomena Tassi, all of whom do not plan to run in the next election.\n\nA growing number of Liberal MPs have been calling for Trudeau to step down as leader since Freeland’s resignation.\n\nThe next federal vote must happen before October.","summary":"Mendicino, who served as immigration minister and then public safety minister in Justin Trudeau's cabinet, is the latest Liberal to say he will not run in the next election.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10940683/marco-mendicino-liberals-re-election-trudeau/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250102170124-20250102170124-262cc51bc3f32d2dc28f397b2612fbec4711dea2be78efb8655d0c1a246e2cb2.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:54:57","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Canadian Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":277859240,"title":"Teal backer Simon Holmes a Court cops criticism for Scott Morrison, Rolf Harris comparison","text":"Multi-millionaire “teal” backer Simon Holmes a Court has copped criticism after he compared Scott Morrison’s popularity to that of child abuse offender Rolf Harris, with Liberals demanding he apologise to the former prime minister.\n\nThe businessman and climate activist, who’s Climate 200 helped proper a number of independents from Liberal-strongholds into office at the 2019 and 2022 election, made the comparison in response to Mr Morrison’s photo of himself, his wife Jenny, US president-elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania captioned “HNY 2025 from Mar-a-Lago”.\n\nMr Holmes a Court wrote that if Mr Morrison were to ever read the replies to the tweet, “it’ll be the second time he’ll have wished he could stay in the US and avoid coming back home” – an apparent reference to the former PM’s infamous Hawaii trip in 2019.\n\n“(Mr) Morrison is almost as popular as Rolf Harris,” Mr Holmes a Court said.\n\nHis comparison to the late Australian entertainer, a convicted child sex offender, attracted immediate ire.\n\nDeputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley said the post was “disgusting” and “juvenile” and said Mr Holmes a Court owed the former PM an apology.\n\n“The tweet should have been deleted yesterday, and he should apologise to Scott Morrison,” she told The Nightly.\n\n“Scott Morrison deserves respect for his service to Australia, regardless of whether you agree with his politics or his record.”\n\n“How can any of the Teals claim they are about lifting the standard of politics if they take Simon Holmes a Court’s money?

It was premeditated and an evil act,” said Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism division, calling Jabbar “100% inspired” by the Islamic State.\n\nThe attack killed 14 revelers, along with Jabbar, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and plowing into the crowd.\n\nIt was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat and coming as the FBI and other agencies brace for dramatic leadership upheaval — and likely policy changes — after President-elect Donald Trump’s administration takes office.\n\nSeeking to assuage concerns about any broader plots, Raia stressed that there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck filled with explosives outside Trump’s Las Vegas hotel. The person inside that truck, a decorated U.S. Army Green Beret, sustained a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion, and a handgun was found at his feet inside the charred vehicle, authorities said Thursday.\n\nThe FBI continued to hunt for clues about the 42-year-old Jabbar, but said that a day into its investigation, it was now confident that he was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others.\n\nOfficials have concluded that none of the individuals seen in surveillance video standing near an improvised explosive device that Jabbar placed in a cooler along the city’s Bourbon Street, where the attack occurred, were involved “in any way,” though investigators do want to speak with them as witnesses, Raia said.\n\nThe device in the cooler and another explosive device were rendered safe at the scene. Others were determined to be nonfunctional.\n\nInvestigators were also trying to understand more about Jabbar’s path to radicalization, which they say culminated with him picking up a rented truck in Houston on Dec. 30 and driving it to New Orleans the following night.\n\nThe FBI recovered a black Islamic State flag from his rented pickup and reviewed five videos posted to Facebook, including one in which he said he originally planned to harm his family and friends, but was concerned that news headlines would not focus on the “war between the believers and the disbelievers,” Raia said. He also left a last will and testament, the FBI said.\n\nJabbar joined the Army in 2007, serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.\n\nAbdur-Rahim Jabbar, Jabbar’s younger brother, told The Associated Press on Thursday that it “doesn’t feel real” that his brother could have done this.\n\n“I never would have thought it’d be him,” he said. “It’s completely unlike him.” \n\nHe said that his brother had been isolated in the last few years, but that he had also been in touch with him and he didn’t see any signs of radicalization.\n\n“It’s completely contradictory to who he was and how his family and his friends know him,” he said.\n\nIn New Orleans on Thursday, a still-reeling city inched back toward normal operations. Authorities finished processing the scene early in the morning, removing the last of the bodies, and Bourbon Street — famous worldwide for music, open-air drinking and festive vibes — reopened for business by early afternoon.\n\nThe Sugar Bowl college football game between Notre Dame and Georgia, initially set for Wednesday night and postponed by a day in the interest of national security, was still on for Thursday. The city also planned to host the Super Bowl next month.\n\nNew Orleans “is not only ready for game day today, but we’re ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city because we are built to host at every single turn,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said.","url":"https://gazettenet.com/FBI-says-driver-in-New-Orleans-rampage-acted-alone-was-100-inspired-by-Islamic-State-group-58736434","image":"https://gazettenet.com//attachments/91/47936991.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:51:12","author":"Eric Tucker, Jim Mustian, Kevin McGill And Jack Brook","authors":["Eric Tucker, Jim Mustian, Kevin McGill And Jack Brook"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":277859032,"title":"David Glassberg: Vice President Kamala Harris’ last act","text":"On Jan. 6, 2025, Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the counting of the electoral votes for Donald Trump, just as four years earlier VP Mike Pence presided over the counting of the electoral votes for Joe Biden.\n\nIt would be fitting for Harris to use the occasion to pay tribute to Pence and the Capitol Police officers who risked their lives on that day protecting the peaceful transfer of power from being overthrown by a violent mob, and to remind everyone of the very good reason why most of the insurrection’s perpetrators were indicted, convicted and incarcerated.\n\nWith Trump declaring his intention to pardon those criminals when he takes office on Jan. 20, it’s the least she can do.\n\nDavid Glassberg","url":"https://gazettenet.com/Letter-to-the-editor-58684591","image":"https://gazettenet.com//attachments/70/47232770.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:51:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.388},{"id":277858874,"title":"Earth-shattering interest rates call","text":"Then it was going to be by the end of the year; then not at all this year; then not until May in 2025. \n\nThe easiest prediction to make has been that no one knows what’s going on.\n\nOne thing we do know is that Christmas will be a lot less merry for Aussie families this year, thanks to crippling mortgage stress.\n\nMORE: Shock number of Aussie millionaires\n\nWe are now preparing for another year of uncertainty.

The Bank predicts this will not be achieved until 2026. Rates are most likely therefore to remain on hold through 2025 – particularly given the consistent strength of the Australian economy.”\n\nRate cuts could be brought about by “a sharp deterioration in the Australian economy with steeply rising unemployment”, Wilson said, adding that hikes were potentially as likely.\n\n“The RBA continues to be alert to the upside risks to inflation, early signs of which are already emerging in Europe and the US. Significant changes in global trade policies may also be inflationary. The Bank has clearly indicated its readiness to raise rates to offset higher inflation if it occurs.”\n\nMORE: Secrets of Russell Crowe’s home\n\nTHE TRUMP FACTOR\n\nEither one or two cash rate cuts are likely in the year ahead, according to Graham Cooke, head of consumer research at Finder.\n\n“This would see an end of year cash rate of 3.6 to 3.85 per cent,” Cooke said. However, one factor could significantly influence this: Donald Trump. His proposed tariffs on China could ignite a global trade war, indirectly affecting Australia as many of our exports are destined for China. If, as most of our panel expects, this has an inflationary effect on the Australian economy, we may not see a lower cash rate for the foreseeable future.”\n\nCooke said some economists believed Trump’s tariffs could have a deflationary effect in Australia, should Chinese demand for our resources dry up as a result and no other countries picked up the trading slack.\n\n“But most economists think the opposite,” he said. “The RBA has done a commendable job of bringing down inflation in 2024, but next year all eyes will be on the White House, which could easily undo that progress.”\n\nMORE: Major blow for homebuyers in 2025\n\nTHE UNEMPLOYMENT FACTOR\n\nDale Gillham of Wealth Within believes the RBA will slash early and often in 2025.\n\n“We should see consecutive interest rate cuts in 2025 with the total reduction in rate to the order of 1 to 1.5 per cent,” Gillham said. “I believe we should see this start to occur in the first quarter.”\n\nGillham said unemployment would play a telling role in the RBA’s decision making process.\n\n“Unemployment would need to rise substantially for rates to dramatically reduce,” he said. “I can’t see this occurring as the cost of living is very high and so many people are working two or more jobs. \n\n“If unemployment drops and or inflation starts to rise again, this would cause the RBA to put any rate cuts on hold and even consider raising them. This seems unlikely at present with so much mortgage stress and many struggling to make ends meet.” \n\nMORE:Sign RBA is creating ticking time bomb\n\nTHE INTERNATIONAL FACTORS\n\nA May rate cut, followed by two or three more cuts throughout the second half of 2025, is the most likely scenario for Michael Yardney, founder of Metropole Property Strategists.\n\nYardney expects a 3.6 per cent cash rate this time next year, though notes that a “significant slowdown in economic growth, marked by declining GDP and rising unemployment, could prompt the RBA to implement more substantial rate cuts to stimulate the economy”.\n\n“International factors, such as a downturn in major economies or geopolitical tensions, could negatively impact Australia’s economy, leading the RBA to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy,” he said.\n\n“A sharp decline in inflation (below the RBA’s target range of 2-3 per cent) could lead to more aggressive rate cuts to support economic activity.”\n\nMeanwhile, the RBA could consider raising rates, Yardney said, if underlying inflation remained too high.\n\n“A persistent, strong employment sector with low unemployment rates would be positive for consumer spending, which is inflationary and delay rate cuts.”","url":"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/earthshattering-interest-rates-call/news-story/e4bf3c7b0dd00dfcabb7c11fc44ae6f6","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/fbebfdcbf6f6df64219b2c631ecf1186","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:49:12","author":"Tim McIntyre","authors":["Tim McIntyre"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":277859184,"title":"Mike Johnson says he expects House speaker vote to go \"smoothly\"","text":"Mike Johnson says he expects House speaker vote to go \"smoothly\"\n The new Republican-controlled Congress will be sworn in Friday as Mike Johnson hopes an endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump can keep him in the speaker's office.

Car-sharing platform linked to two New Year&#039;s eve incidents","text":"NEW YORK: Two deadly incidents on New Year’s Day — an attack being investigated as an act of terrorism in New Orleans and an explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas — both involved vehicles that were rented on Turo, a peer-to-peer car sharing company.Early Wednesday, 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter — killing 14 people who were celebrating the New Year. And police fatally shot Jabbar in a following firefight. Just hours after, outside of President-elect Donald Trump’s hotel in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives also burst into flames. The person inside, identified as active-duty U.S. Army Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, died. Officials later said he suffered a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion.In a statement Wednesday, Turo said it was “devastated by these horrible incidents” and remained “dedicated to helping the authorities however we can.” While both incidents involved vehicles rented on this platform, the FBI has since said that is has found “no definitive link” between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.Still, the incidents have put a spotlight on the car sharing platform. Here’s what we know about Turo. What is Turo?Turo is a peer-to-peer car sharing company. The online platform allows car owners to rent their own vehicles directly to other nearby drivers, or “guests.” “Hosts” set their prices, availability and delivery options for renters to choose from and book via Turo’s website or app.Billing itself as “the world’s largest car sharing marketplace” today, Turo says it currently operates through a network of hosts across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.The San Francisco-based company has been around for almost 15 years, with its first trip completed in May 2010. The platform was originally introduced as “RelayRides,” but rebranded to Turo in 2015.How was Turo used for the cars involved in these New Year’s Day events?Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday’s attack in New Orleans and the following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.Turo has also confirmed that the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack was rented using the platform, too.“It is with a heavy heart that we confirm (Wednesday’s) horrific attack in New Orleans and ... Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas both involved vehicles rented on Turo,” the company said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.”What else has the company said? Turo has said that it’s partnering with law enforcement to share any information as investigations continue.On Wednesday, the company also said it did not believe “that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.” The Associated Press reached out for further comments Thursday.Published By: indiatodayglobal Published On: Jan 3, 2025","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/what-is-turo-car-sharing-platform-linked-to-two-new-years-eve-incidents-glbs-2658994-2025-01-03","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202501/turo-023203280-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=a.VgU0FIEtm4j1wBtDIVCMQ0250LB8Q4?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:42:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.322},{"id":277858052,"title":"New Orleans attacker acted alone, was inspired by Islamic State: FBI","text":"The US Army veteran who drove a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year’s revellers acted alone, the FBI said Thursday, reversing its position from a day earlier that he likely worked with others in the deadly attack that officials said was inspired by the Islamic State group.The FBI also revealed that the driver, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US citizen from Texas, posted five videos on his Facebook account in the hours before the attack in which he proclaimed his support for the militant group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the city’s famed French Quarter district.“This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,” said Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism division, calling Jabbar “100 per cent inspired” by the Islamic State.The attack killed 14 revellers, along with Jabbar, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and plowing into the crowd.It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on US soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat and coming as the FBI and other agencies brace for dramatic leadership upheaval — and likely policy changes — after President-elect Donald Trump’s administration takes office.Seeking to assuage concerns about any broader plots, Raia stressed that there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck filled with explosives outside Trump’s Las Vegas hotel. The person inside that truck, a decorated US Army Green Beret, sustained a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion, and a handgun was found at his feet inside the charred vehicle, authorities said Thursday.The FBI continued to hunt for clues about the 42-year-old Jabbar, but said that a day into its investigation, it was now confident that he was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others.Officials have concluded that none of the individuals seen in surveillance video standing near an improvised explosive device that Jabbar placed in a cooler along the city’s Bourbon Street, where the attack occurred, were involved “in any way,” though investigators do want to speak with them as witnesses, Raia said.The device in the cooler and another explosive device were rendered safe at the scene. Others were determined to be non-functional.Investigators were also trying to understand more about Jabbar’s path to radicalisation, which they say culminated with him picking up a rented truck in Houston on December 30 and driving it to New Orleans the following night.The FBI recovered a black Islamic State flag from his rented pickup and reviewed five videos posted to Facebook, including one in which he said he originally planned to harm his family and friends, but was concerned that news headlines would not focus on the “war between the believers and the disbelievers,” Raia said. He also left a last will and testament, the FBI said.Jabbar joined the Army in 2007, serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, Jabbar’s younger brother, told The Associated Press on Thursday that it “doesn’t feel real” that his brother could have done this.“I never would have thought it’d be him,” he said. “It’s completely unlike him.”He said that his brother had been isolated in the last few years, but that he had also been in touch with him and he didn’t see any signs of radicalization.“It’s completely contradictory to who he was and how his family and his friends know him,” he said.In New Orleans on Thursday, a still-reeling city inched back toward normal operations. Authorities finished processing the scene early in the morning, removing the last of the bodies, and Bourbon Street -- famous worldwide for music, open-air drinking and festive vibes — reopened for business by early afternoon.The Sugar Bowl college football game between Notre Dame and Georgia, initially set for Wednesday night and postponed by a day in the interest of national security, was still on for Thursday. The city also planned to host the Super Bowl next month.New Orleans “is not only ready for game day today, but we’re ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city because we are built to host at every single turn,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said.Published By: Sudeep LavaniaPublished On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/new-orleans-attacker-acted-alone-was-inspired-by-islamic-state-fbi-2659001-2025-01-03","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202501/new-orleans-022840263-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=Q3WbnYBzdDaKKA_uoF8hpFxfoFG9.B0D?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:42:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":277858036,"title":"After Germany and Canada, Britain is facing the Musk music","text":"\"I really like Britain!\" tweeted tech titan Elon Musk in 2012 after completing a business trip to London. Much water has flown down the Thames since then and Musk's views on the UK have undergone a change since Keir Starmer's Labour Party took charge last year. In the past few months, Musk has repeatedly got into spats with Starmer, asserting that a civil war was \"inevitable\" in the UK, amid speculation that he planned to donate millions to Nigel Farage's Reform UK. The UK is the latest country where Musk is aiming to call the shots, seemingly in a bid to play the kingmaker. This after spending $260 million on efforts to send Donald Trump back to the White House, predicting Justin Trudeau's ouster in Canada, and endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany. UK and Starmer are the latest targets of Musk's political playbook. It started with Musk tweeting that the UK was on the verge of \"civil war\" amid massive anti-immigration protests that erupted after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed party.He also weighed in on the farmers' protests, accusing the UK of going \"full Stalin\" over an increase in inheritance tax on farms. It was a reference to the erstwhile Soviet Union's devastating farm policies under Joseph Stalin.While the UK's Starmer kept away from directly engaging with Musk, Trump's election win and the Tesla CEO's increasing influence in picking the Cabinet meant he could not sidestep the repeated tirades. More so when the UK is one of America's closest allies.Thus, when Musk claimed that \"very few\" businesses wanted to invest in the UK under Labour, Starmer hit back by pointing to how he brought investments worth £63 billion to the UK after his win. \"Business investment in the third quarter this year is estimated to increase 4.5 per cent compared to this time last year,\" Starmer's spokesperson said.Even as the US grappled with a series of attacks on New Year's Day, with at least one being investigated for terrorism, Musk continued his brazen attack on Starmer, raking up the Rotherham grooming scandal, which happened between 1997-2013.\"In the UK, serious crimes such as rape require the Crown Prosecution Service's approval for the police to charge suspects. Who was the head of the CPS when rape gangs were allowed to exploit young girls without facing justice? Keir Starmer, 2008-2013,\" Musk tweeted.Musk's post came as a 2014 report revealing the extent of the crimes, where around 1,400 children were sexually abused for over 16 years, started circulating on X. The issue gained traction as author JK Rowling and several UK MPs also tweeted about the scandal, hitting out at systemic failures.The perpetrators were primarily of Pakistani heritage. Despite authorities being aware of such crimes, they chose not to act out of the fear of being labelled racists.MEETING WITH NIGEL FARAGEHowever, what is worrying for Starmer is Musk's rising interest in the UK's domestic political scene, with the world's richest person cosying up to hard-right firebrand lawmaker Nigel Farage.Last month, Musk met Farage at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, with the Reform leader saying Musk was giving \"serious thought\" to bankrolling the party in what could be a major game changer in the 2029 elections.GERMANY, CANADA ALSO FACE MUSK MUSICMusk has not just been a thorn in the flesh for Starmer. He has also gone hammer and tongs against the left-leaning German government of Olaf Scholz, calling him a \"fool\" after the collapse of his coalition. Musk has also openly backed the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany ahead of a snap election in February 2025. In an op-ed, Musk asserted that the AfD was Germany's \"last spark of hope\".The spree of developments has led to consternation in Europe. Germany, being the EU's largest economy, is also a political bellwether for the continent. A shift towards the far-right would have an impact on the European Union's united stand on issues like migration and defence.Canada's Justin Trudeau also came in Musk's crosshairs after he asserted that Kamala Harris's loss in the US election was a setback for women's progress. Musk, in his own unabashed way, labelled Trudeau \"an insufferable tool\". \"He won’t be in power for much longer,\" Musk predicted.Published By: Abhishek DePublished On: Jan 2, 2025Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/elon-musk-targets-britain-keir-starmer-global-politics-far-right-germany-canada-2658751-2025-01-02","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202501/elon-musk-vs-keir-starmer-024157456-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=aFvfR1SCGzvCm.zB8_M0kY02EtHFmWpC?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:42:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":277858022,"title":"Man shot himself in head before Cybertruck exploded outside Trump&#039;s Las Vegas hotel","text":"LAS VEGAS: The highly decorated Army soldier inside the Tesla Cybertruck that burst into flames outside President-elect Donald Trump’s Las Vegas hotel shot himself in the head before the explosion and likely planned to cause more damage but the explosive was rudimentary and the steel-sided vehicle absorbed much of the force, officials said Thursday.Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a news conference that a handgun was found at the feet of the man, who officials believe is Matthew Livelsberger. Officials believe the shot was self-inflicted.Damage from the blast was mostly limited to the interior of the truck. The blast “vented out and up” and didn’t hit the Trump hotel doors just a few feet away, the sheriff said.“The level of sophistication is not what we would expect from an individual with this type of military experience,” said Kenny Cooper, a special agent in charge for the the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Among other charred items found inside the truck were a second firearm, a number of fireworks, passport, military ID, credit cards, an iPhone and a smartwatch, McMahill said. Authorities said both guns were purchased legally.Investigators have not definitively identified the remains as Livelsberger, but the IDs and tattoos on the body “give a strong indication that it’s him,” the sheriff said.Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners, the Army said in a statement. He had served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the Army said. He was awarded two Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device for courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation Medal with valor. Livelsberger was on approved leave when he died, according to the statement.The FBI said Thursday in a post on X that it was “conducting law enforcement activity” at a home in Colorado Springs related to Wednesday’s explosion but provided no other details.The explosion of the truck, packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters, came hours after 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack. The FBI said Thursday that they believe Jabbar acted alone, reversing its position from a day earlier that he likely worked with others.Both Livelsberger and Jabbar spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to multiple Army special operations units. However, one of the officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty.Chris Raia, FBI deputy assistant director, said Thursday that officials have found ‘no definitive link’ between the New Orleans attack and the truck explosion in Las Vegas.Seven people nearby suffered minor injuries when the Tesla truck exploded. Video showed a tumble of charred fireworks mortars, canisters and other explosive devices crowded into the back of the pickup. The truck bed walls were still intact because the blast shot straight up rather than to the sides.Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday afternoon on X that “we have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks andor a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself.”“All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion,” Musk wrote.Musk has recently become a member of Trump’s inner circle. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas early Wednesday. Both had attended Trump’s New Year’s Eve party at his South Florida estate.Authorities know who rented the truck with the Turo app in Colorado, Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday. He did not release the person’s ID, however.Published By: indiatodayglobal Published On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/man-shot-himself-in-head-before-cybertruck-exploded-outside-trumps-las-vegas-hotel-glbs-2658992-2025-01-03","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202501/tesla-cybertruck-020811178-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=.uxezvD_Ap7Tq1GIKoNaI_8DdSSwsfGk?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:42:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":277858012,"title":"Geopolitics Wrapped 2024: When India’s neighbourhood said China first, global anti-incumbency, & more | Geeta's World, Ep 115","text":"2024 wasn't just a year of elections but a year of reckoning.

But it's uncertain whether Trump's blessing will be enough to persuade far-right Republicans who have at times grown frustrated with Johnson's leadership and who are prone to demand concessions when their votes become essential.Johnson, 52, ascended to the speakership in October 2023 almost by accident after Republicans struggled to replace Kevin McCarthy following the unprecedented removal of the California Republican from the job. Several contenders tried and failed before Republicans settled on Johnson, who is well liked across the conference.But Johnson's handling of major funding fights, including passage of aid to Ukraine last spring and, most recently, a short-term spending bill, has turned at least a few allies into detractors.With Republicans holding a narrow 220-215 majority in the House, it would take only two GOP lawmakers voting for other candidates to deny Johnson a majority for the speakership, forcing more rounds of voting.Here’s what to know about how the House elects a speaker:No House without a speaker Electing a speaker is the first order of business for the House after a new session of Congress begins at noon. It's a vote that members take even before being sworn into office.The House cannot organize until it has a speaker because that person effectively serves as the House’s presiding officer and the institution’s administrative head. The House can elect a new speaker at any time if the person occupying that role dies, resigns or is removed from office. The speakership has been vacant only 13 times in U.S. history, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. No speaker had ever been removed until eight Republicans joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy.Barring those instances, a speaker is normally elected at the start of a new Congress and serves in the job for the full two-year session.The House clerk presides over the speaker's election. Lawmakers call out the name of their choice for speaker from the floor, a rare and time-consuming roll call that heightens the drama on the floor. Members often liven up the proceedings by shouting or standing when casting their vote.Who can be nominated? Any name can be called out from the House floor. While it has been the tradition for the speaker to be a member of the House, it is not required.In past years, Democratic President Joe Biden, Trump and even a senator, Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky, have received votes for House speaker. None received the majority of the vote. And generally, a party's official nominee for speaker is who ends up with the gavel.Republicans chose Johnson as their nominee for speaker in a closed-door vote in November. A week later, Democrats unanimously chose Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to remain their leader despite the party's electoral losses.Lawmakers are not obligated to vote for their party’s nominated candidate. And that is why the process can quickly get messy.Let the voting begin Once the House is in a quorum — meaning the minimum number of members are present to proceed — nominating speeches will be made on behalf of the nominees for speaker. The clerk appoints lawmakers from each party as tellers to tally the votes before the roll call begins.To become speaker, a candidate needs a majority of the votes from House members who are present and voting.Historically, the magical number has been 218 out of the 435 members of the House. But many previous speakers, including McCarthy, have won with fewer votes because members sometimes vote “present” instead of calling out a name. Every lawmaker voting “present” lowers the overall tally needed to reach a majority.It remains to be seen whether Johnson will reach a majority to become speaker on the first ballot. Should he come up short, it is likely the clerk will move to start another roll call vote.McCarthy went through a grueling 15 ballots over four days before he gained enough support to become the 55th speaker in January 2023.Passing of the gavel Once a speaker candidate wins a majority of those present and voting, the clerk will announce the results of the election.A bipartisan committee, usually consisting of members from the home state of the chosen candidate, will escort the speaker-elect to the chair on the dais where the oath of office is administered. The oath is identical to the one new members will take once a speaker is chosen.The outgoing speaker usually joins the successor at the speaker’s chair, where the gavel is passed as a nod to the peaceful transition of power from one party leader to another. But this time around, given that Johnson is already the speaker, it will likely be Jeffries who would once again hand Johnson the gavel.Published By: indiatodayglobal Published On: Jan 3, 2025","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/why-mike-johnsons-bid-to-remain-house-speaker-could-be-a-struggle-despite-trumps-support-glbs-2658993-2025-01-03","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202501/mike-johnson-021624254-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=3_ORJ1qh4YctoTQjLqoBhZSHK68Qwm0H?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:42:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":277859084,"title":"Trump's 'Make America Great Again Victory Rally' planned for day before inauguration in D.C.","text":"Jan. 2 (UPI) -- President-elect Donald Trump and thousands of his supporters will gather in Washington, D.C., a day before his pending presidential inauguration.\n\nTrump's second inauguration is scheduled at noon EST on Jan. 20, but he has scheduled a victory rally on Jan. 19 at Capital One Arena in the nation's capital.\n\nMonumental Sports & Entertainment operates the 20,000-seat Capital One Arena.\n\nWe have made our arena available to every administration for inaugural events dating back decades [and] irrespective of party,\" Monumental officials told NBC4 Washington.\n\nTrump is billing the event as a \"victory party\" that is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. EST and would be his first public event since his Nov. 5 general election win over Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe event won't be his first public appearance, though.\n\nTrump on Dec. 22 addressed an audience of conservative activists during an Arizona event hosted by Turning Point USA.\n\nThose who want to attend the victory rally can register for one or two tickets on a first-come, first-served basis at Trump's inauguration website.\n\nDoors for the victory rally at Capital One Arena are scheduled to open at 11 a.m.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump and thousands of his supporters will gather in Washington, D.C., a day before his pending presidential inauguration.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/01/02/trump-victory-rally/5021735858455/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5021735858455/2025/upi/eb9ecba61c1540606ef4a245595a2df9/v1.2/Trumps-Make-America-Great-Again-Victory-Rally-planned-for-day-before-inauguration-in-DC.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:41:18","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.012},{"id":277858122,"title":"Freefalling media face grim prospects as reach, influence wane","text":"As 2025 dawns, legacy media is in freefall — their public trust in tatters, their viewership and readership cratering. \n\nThe wounds are a result of two factors: First, the landscape the legacy media once controlled is no more.\n\nNo longer do the liberal media ecosystems of New York and Washington, DC, set the terms of the national conversation. \n\nNo longer do a handful of major corporate entities like ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, The New York Times and Washington Post regulate thought and debate. \n\nInstead, the most-listened to broadcast is the Joe Rogan podcast out of Austin, Tex., averaging 11 million viewers per episode.\n\nFor context, CNN can’t attract more than 400,000 viewers to its primetime lineup these days, less than 4% of what Rogan generates. \n\nOnline, Elon Musk’s X is the No. 1 source for news in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, to take one example, The Washington Post lost more than $70 million and 50% of its audience in 2023 and is reportedly on track to lose more than $75 million in 2024. Several prominent reporters have fled the paper for more liberal confines, such as The Atlantic. \n\nSecond, and a major reason for the exodus, is the loss of respect that followed the legacy media’s gross breaches of integrity and ethics in recent years.\n\nMany in the media debased themselves by blatantly lying about the state of Joe Biden’s cognitive abilities (or lack thereof).\n\nThey openly cheered on Kamala Harris’ campaign and tried to Etch-a-Sketch her radical positions (and those of her goofy running mate, Tim Walz) out of existence, laughably selling them as joyous, centrist candidates. \n\nAnd all the while, they trashed Donald Trump and his supporters as fascist and uninformed.\n\nBut these efforts failed — and as Trump swept his way to a resounding victory, his triumph underscored both the waning influence of the mainstream media and the public’s disdain.\n\nOverall, according to Gallup, just 27% of independent voters trust the media, and only 12% of Republicans say the same. \n\nWith those factors as the backdrop, watch for these three media trends in 2025. \n\nMore journalists going independent: The old days of brick-and-mortar newsrooms as the absolutely necessary requirement for quality reporting are over. \n\nGreat investigative reporters, including Matt Taibbi, Michael Shellenberger, Bari Weiss and Catherine Herridge have been jumping over to subscriber-based Substack or, in Weiss’ case, launching The Free Press, her own online publication. \n\nThe money for those who succeed in these forums can be quite lucrative, as in seven figures lucrative.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, these writers’ corporate gatekeepers are no more, freeing them to control their own content.\n\nPay cuts and layoffs: The days of big contracts for network and cable news hosts are coming to an end.\n\nWe’ve already seen “stars” like Rachel Maddow take a $5 million annual pay cut, while veterans such as Chris Wallace jumped ship at CNN for his own podcast instead. Reason: The 77-year-old, who was reportedly pulling down $7 million annually, was told he could stay only if he took a sizable slash in salary. \n\nWhy? The ratings simply aren’t there to justify such huge contracts. Without strong demand, advertisers find other places to spend their money. Cord-cutting also continues to accelerate, with more than 10 million people saying goodbye to pay-TV services in favor of streaming.\n\nAdd it all up, falling revenues and fewer subscribers means smaller contracts and likely large-scale job losses. It’s that simple. \n\nAn explosion of defamation suits: ABC News recently settled with Trump after anchor George Stephanopoulos repeated — on 10 occasions in a single interview with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) — that the former and future president had been “convicted of rape.”\n\nIt was a lie, and Trump rightly called the former Clinton operative out on it, via a defamation suit.\n\nABC, likely fearing what could be revealed in the discovery phase of a trial — and knowing full well that Stephanopoulos’ unambiguous words would simply be read back to a jury — settled, paying Trump $15 million plus another $1 million in legal fees. \n\nSome media observers on the left cried foul, arguing ABC had been bullied into settling.“You can’t have the news industry worrying about this sort of stuff when they’re just simply doing their jobs,” whined Jim Acosta on CNN. \n\nBecause apparently “doing their jobs” includes intentionally referring to a rape verdict that never happened. \n\nMoving forward in 2025, I expect more such lawsuits will be leveled when media outlets lie, as Stephanopoulos did, or twist the facts, as actor Justin Baldoni alleges The New York Times did in a $250 million defamation suit filed Tuesday. \n\nThe legacy media — with a few exceptions — are on the brink of their most brutal year yet as Trump heads back to the White House. \n\nIt’s a perilous position for an industry that has inflicted its fate almost entirely upon itself. \n\nJoe Concha is the author of “Progressively Worse: Why Today’s Democrats Ain’t Your Daddy’s Donkeys.”","summary":"No longer do the liberal media ecosystems of New York and Washington, DC, set the terms of the national conversation — and after wrecking the public's trust in 2024, the new year will be even worse.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/opinion/freefalling-medias-grim-prospects-as-reach-influence-wane/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/newspress-collage-46crmx6xp-1735858208682.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1735840491&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:39:07","author":"Joe Concha","authors":["Joe Concha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":277861062,"title":"US President Biden awards presidential medal to Trump critic Liz Cheney","text":"Outgoing President Joe Biden has awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal, the second-highest civilian honour in the United States, to members of a congressional committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nA total of 20 honourees were recognised in a ceremony at the White House on Thursday.\n\nAmong them were an activist who campaigned to legalise same-sex marriage in the US, a military doctor who improved battlefield trauma care, and a civil rights leader who laid the groundwork for desegregation.\n\n“ The most important title in America is not president but citizen. It is ‘We the people,'” Biden said, quoting the preamble to the US Constitution. “ These are the words of the rock upon which this entire nation has been built.”\n\nBut a couple of the former legislators honoured were explicitly praised for their work on a committee in the House of Representatives charged with probing the January 6 attack.\n\nOne recipient was the committee chair, Democrat Bennie Thompson of Louisiana. The second was his vice chair, former Republican Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming.\n\nExtended applause welcomed Cheney to the stage at the White House on Thursday, as an announcer praised her “for putting the American people over party”. Thompson, meanwhile, was hailed for his “lifelong dedication to safeguarding our Constitution”.\n\nWhat is January 6?\n\nCheney has become a political lightning rod since her years on the committee. She is a popular target of criticism for President-elect Donald Trump, the de facto leader of the Republican Party.\n\nThe January 6 attack was spurred by Trump’s false claims that he had won the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOn that day, Trump held a “Stop the Steal” rally outside of the White House, repeating unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud.\n\nThousands of his supporters then travelled several blocks west to the US Capitol, where they attacked law enforcement and broke into the building while Congress was certifying the election results.\n\nLawmakers were evacuated, and rioters were heard to chant threats like, “Hang Mike Pence,” a reference to the vice president who was overseeing the vote certification.\n\nAs of November 2024, the US Justice Department reported that 1,561 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot. A total of 645 were sentenced to incarceration.\n\nThe agency noted that firearms, tasers, knives, axes and pepper spray were among the weapons the rioters brought into the Capitol during the January 6 attack.\n\nBiden has previously awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Capitol police officers and election workers who received threats in the wake of the 2020 vote, including Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss.\n\n“ I’ve been honoured to present law enforcement officers who defended our Capitol on January 6th and the state and local election officials, elected leaders, who defended the free and fair election of 2020,” Biden said at Thursday’s ceremony.\n\n“Today, we celebrate a new group of Americans who dedicated their careers to serving our democracy in other essential ways.”\n\nCheney versus Trump\n\nThursday’s medal ceremony took place just days before the riot’s fourth anniversary — and less than three weeks before Trump himself is set to take office for a second term. He will be sworn in on January 20.\n\nTrump previously served from 2017 to 2021, at which time Biden, the winner of the 2020 race, succeeded him.\n\nIn the months after the January 6 riot, the House of Representatives voted to assemble an independent investigative committee to look into the circumstances surrounding the attack.\n\nThe commission was ultimately dissolved in 2023 when the House switched from Democratic to Republican leadership. But in its final weeks, the commission released a damning, 850-page report recommending criminal charges against Trump.\n\nIt accused him of a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n“The central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed,” the report said. “None of the events of January 6 would have happened without him.”\n\nCheney was one of only two Republicans on the committee. Both have since left office. Cheney lost her party primary while her Republican colleague Adam Kinzinger did not seek re-election at all.\n\nShe and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, have since become visible critics of Trump, even supporting his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nIn an interview with NPR in December 2023, Cheney accused Trump of transforming the Republican Party into a “cult of personality” and called him a threat to US democracy.\n\n“He talks about weaponising the levers of our government against his political opponents,” Cheney told the NPR programme, Fresh Air. “I don’t view that so much through the lens of what it would mean for me personally. But I think that what it would mean for the republic is that we won’t be a republic any more.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has suggested the members of the January 6 committee should be arrested, spurring fears of political retribution.\n\n“Honestly, they should go to jail,” he told the NBC programme Meet the Press in December.\n\nHe repeatedly accused the committee, without proof, of deleting or suppressing evidence. “Cheney did something that’s inexcusable, along with Thompson and the people on the un-select committee of political thugs and, you know, creeps.”","summary":"A total of 20 recipients were honoured, including two who had investigated the attack on the US Capitol in January 2021.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/2/us-president-biden-awards-presidential-medal-to-trump-critic-liz-cheney?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP25002430570419-1735856510.jpg?resize=1200%2C630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:37:42","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":0.083},{"id":277856962,"title":"Not-So-Shocker: Photos of Biden With Hunter-Tied Chinese Business Interests Surface, Exposing Biden’s Lies","text":"Remember when conservative and libertarian news outlets were trying to tell people about the Hunter Biden laptop, and the federal government interfered, even going to the lengths of telling the New York Times to NOT publish the info?\n\nRemember the constant stream of news that you knew was confirmed and real, but – be it about the climate canard, or about the jabs, or the unreliability of the masks, or the Clinton e-mails – pop media poo-pooed it and social media censored you (after receiving “flags” from the feds about said info, in many cases)?\n\nWell, the pattern has repeated. This time, it’s about those totally fictitious, completely fake international business interests who, as we all know, never, ever, ever met with Joe Biden while they were negotiating with his son, and while Joe was Vice President of the U.S.\n\nYeah, those totally fanciful notions of Joe lying about not meeting those cool cats – we all know the thoughts were myths, no more valid than belief in Bigfoot or Nessie.\n\nExcept that the photos of Joe, Hunter, and some of those international biz interests just appeared, now that it doesn’t have any bearing on Joe’s presidency.\n\nSteven Nelson reports for the New York Post:\n\n“The National Archives has finally released photos showing then-Vice President Biden meeting with two of first son Hunter Biden’s Chinese government-linked business partners — again proving that the president lied about not interacting with his family’s foreign patrons.\n\nThe cache of photos, released long after their potential political salience and days before Biden retires on Jan. 20, also show Chinese President Xi Jinping grinning as then-Vice President Biden introduced his son during the same December 2013 trip to Beijing.”\n\nWhat could be more appropriate for Biden, who also is in photos with neo-Nazi Ukrainian politician Oleh Tyahnybok, circa late 2013, early 2014? He’s engaged in a lot of “appearances for a purpose”, it seems.\n\n“The Xi-Hunter Biden encounter, which had not previously garnered much attention, appears to have been at a meal Hunter described in an email to his former associate Devon Archer as ‘pretty amazing’ because his dad and China’s powerful authoritarian leader ‘were supposed to spend 2hrs together [but it] stretched to 7hrs. I think they are in love.’\n\nXi was about two months into his ambitious ‘Belt and Road’ foreign-influence and investment campaign — and a Chinese state-backed company aligned with that vision, BHR Partners, was in the process being co-launched by Hunter.”\n\nBut remember, as Joe said, he never met with those business interests.\n\n“The newly released photos, which would have been politically explosive if they were released during the now-closed House impeachment inquiry into alleged Biden family corruption, show the elder Biden shaking hands with incoming BHR Partners CEO Jonathan Li and greeting the company’s managing director Ming Xue.”\n\nBut it is possible that Biden still can get away with it? After all, as Nelson reports, the company actually wasn’t “listed” as a company until twelve days later.\n\n“Joe Biden later wrote college recommendation letters for both of Li’s children and, according to Archer, greeted Li during a subsequent speaker-phone conversation when Hunter returned to Beijing.\n\nBHR Partners was officially registered as a company 12 days after Air Force Two landed in Beijing with the Biden family for that trip, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe firm played an important role in foreign acquisitions for China, including the 2016 purchase of a Congolese cobalt mine from US and Canadian companies. Cobalt is used for electric car batteries.”\n\nBut, surely, Joe would never push unconstitutional federal subsidies to electric car makers that would need batteries… Would he?\n\nRelated: Video: Biden Shifts MORE College Debt Onto US, While Pop Media Call It 'Relief'\n\nAnd, surely, the government holding onto these indicting photos had nothing to do with political damage control…\n\nWrites Nelson:\n\n“The troubled now-54-year-old first son held a 10% stake in BHR through at least part of his dad’s presidency and says he relinquished control to his “sugar brother” Kevin Morris, who has loaned Hunter a sum believed to top $6.5 million since meeting him at a 2019 Biden campaign fundraiser.\n\nThe photos were released to the America First Legal Foundation in response to a transparency lawsuit.\n\n‘AFL obtained the photos through our lawsuit against the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which was filed on September 8, 2022,’ the group led by President-elect Donald Trump’s adviser Stephen Miller wrote on X.\n\n‘NARA had planned to release these photographs on October 23, 2024 — thirteen days before Election Day. Lawyers and representatives for President Biden and President Obama delayed NARA’s release of these photos — as they did with other critical records — until after Election Day.’”\n\nIt sure is good to know that the Bidenistas want to control our ability to freely communicate, encouraged unconstitutional lockdowns and imposed jab mandates during the misnamed “pandemic,” and want to send our money to “green” interests with close ties to political interests – all while hiding from us major pieces of truthful information.\n\nIt's almost as if they have an unlimited fear of the truth.","url":"https://mrctv.org/blog/p-gardner-goldsmith/not-so-shocker-photos-biden-hunter-tied-chinese-business-interests-surface","image":"https://cdn.mrctv.org/files/styles/large/s3/2024-12/VP%20Joe%20Biden%20and%20Hunter%20w%20foreign%20business%20ties.png?itok=Tky4J7xj","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-02 23:34:12","author":"Gardner Goldsmith","authors":["Gardner Goldsmith"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":277856958,"title":"New Orleans, Las Vegas Suspects Served at Same Army Base, Used Same Car Rental App","text":"Both the suspect in Wednesday’s deadly car attack in New Orleans and the suspect in the Las Vegas car bombing that same day had previously served at the same Army base and used the same carsharing app to obtain the vehicles they used, reports reveal.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar is suspected of driving into a crowd of New Year’s revelers, killing 15 people and injuring dozens more.
