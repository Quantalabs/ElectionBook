By a vote of 174-235 on Thursday, the House rejected the spending package, which was hastily assembled by Republican leaders after Trump and billionaire Elon Musk scuttled a prior bipartisan deal. Government funding is due to expire at midnight on Friday. If lawmakers fail to extend that deadline, the US government will begin a partial shutdown that would interrupt funding for everything from border enforcement to national parks and cut off paycheques for more than two million federal workers. The US Transportation Security Administration warned that travellers during the busy holiday season could face long lines at airports. The bill largely resembled the earlier version that Musk and Trump had blasted as a wasteful giveaway to Democrats. It would have extended government funding into March, when Trump will be in the White House and Republicans will control both chambers of Congress, and provided $US100 billion ($A160 billion) in disaster relief and suspended the debt. Republicans dropped other elements that had been included in the original package, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and new rules for pharmacy benefit managers. At Trump&apos;s urging, the new version also would have suspended limits on the national debt for two years -- a manoeuvre that would make it easier to pass the dramatic tax cuts he has promised and set the stage for the federal government&apos;s $US36 trillion ($A58 trillion) in debt to continue to climb. Ahead of the vote, Democrats and Republicans warned that the other party would be at fault if Congress allowed the government to shut down. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters the package would avoid disruption, tie up loose ends and make it easier for lawmakers to cut spending by hundreds of billions of dollars when Trump takes office on January 20. \"Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does few things well,\" he said. Democrats blasted the bill as a cover for a budget-busting tax cut that would largely benefit wealthy backers such as Musk, the world&apos;s richest person, while saddling the country with trillions of dollars in additional debt. \"How dare you lecture America about fiscal responsibility, ever?\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during floor debate. Some Republicans likewise objected that it would clear the way for more debt while failing to reduce spending. \"I am absolutely sickened by the party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility,\" Republican Representative Chip Roy said. Even if the bill had passed the House, it would have faced long odds in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats. The White House said Democratic President Joe Biden did not support it. Trump had urged lawmakers to vote for the package and take the debt ceiling off the table before he takes office again. Previous fights over the debt ceiling have spooked financial markets, as a US government default would send credit shocks around the world. The limit has been suspended under an agreement that technically expires on Jan. 1, though lawmakers likely will not have to tackle the issue before the spring.

All aspects of the oil business have come under the growing influence of the Guards, from the shadow fleet of tankers that secretively ship sanctioned crude, to logistics and the front companies selling the oil, mostly to China, according to more than a dozen people interviewed. The extent of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) control over oil exports has not previously been reported.\n\nDespite tough Western sanctions designed to choke Iran's energy industry, reimposed by former US President Donald Trump in 2018, Iran generates more than $50 billion a year in oil revenue, by far its largest source of foreign currency and its principal connection to the global economy. Six specialists – Western officials and security experts as well as Iranian and trading sources – said the Guards control up to 50% of Iran's oil exports, a sharp increase from about 20% three years ago. The sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThree of the estimates were based on intelligence documents about Iranian shipping while others derived their figures from monitoring shipping activity by tankers and companies linked to the IRGC. Reuters was unable to determine the exact extent of the IRGC's control. The IRGC's growing domination of the oil industry adds to its influence in all areas of Iran's economy and also makes it harder for Western sanctions to hit home - given the Guards are already designated as a terrorist organisation by Washington.Trump's return to the White House in January, however, could mean tougher enforcement of sanctions on Iran's oil industry.\n\nThe country's oil minister said Tehran is putting measures in place to deal with any restrictions, without giving details. As part of their expansion in the industry, the Guards have muscled in on the territory of state institutions such as the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and its NICO oil trading subsidiary, according to four of the sources.When sanctions hit Iran's oil exports years ago, the people running NIOC and the wider industry were specialised in oil rather than how to evade sanctions, added Richard Nephew, a former deputy special envoy for Iran at the U.S. State Department.\n\n\"The IRGC guys were much, much better at smuggling, just terrible at oil field management, so they began to get a larger control of oil exports,\" said Nephew, who is now a researcher at Columbia University.The IRGC, NIOC, NICO and Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.The IRGC is a powerful political, military and economic force with close ties to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Guards exert influence in the Middle East through their overseas operations arm, the Quds Force, by providing money, weapons, technology and training to allies Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, Yemen's Houthis and militias in Iraq.\n\nWhile Israel has killed a number of senior IRGC commanders over the past year, the oil specialists in its ranks have been able to continue their operations, two Western and two Iranian sources said.The Iranian government began allotting oil, instead of cash, to the IRGC and Quds Force around 2013, according to Nephew.The government was under budgetary pressure then because it was struggling to export oil due to Western sanctions imposed over Iran's nuclear programme. The IRGC proved adept at finding ways to sell oil even under sanctions pressure, said Nephew, who was actively involved in tracking Iranian oil activities then.Iranian oil revenues hit $53 billion in 2023 compared with $54 billion in 2022, $37 billion in 2021 and $16 billion in 2020, according to estimates from the US government's Energy Information Administration.\n\nCredit: Independent News Pakistan (INP)","url":"https://www.inp.net.pk/news-detail/international/irans-revolutionary-guards-extend-control-over-tehrans-oil-exports","image":"https://www.inp.net.pk/images/20241219144609_ogImage_25.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 01:11:23","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":274697842,"title":"Editorial | Hong Kong interest rates volatility price to pay as spectre of Trump tariffs looms","text":"The return of Donald Trump to the White House has injected uncertainty into anticipation of falling interest rates in the coming year. As expected, the US Federal Reserve has just cut its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points.\nIt was quickly followed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), easing the burden on mortgage borrowers and companies. But the Fed tempered hopes this would be the first of several cuts with a hawkish forecast of only two more reductions next year.\nFed chairman Jerome Powell said a slower pace of rate cuts reflected recent stubborn inflation and expectations that it would be higher than targeted in 2025. The latter is interpreted as inflationary pressure that would be unleashed by Trump’s proposed tariff increases on imports after he takes office on January 20.\nThis prompted a warning from the HKMA that the interest rate environment would remain volatile. “The US next year will continue to cut rates, but the pace and frequency of rate cuts may be less than initially expected,” chief executive Eddie Yue Wai-man said.\n\nThe question now becomes whether the two more rate cuts telegraphed by the Fed come early next year, ahead of the tariffs, or later when their inflationary impact is assessed. Right now, based on the way futures contracts are transacting, most traders appear to bet on early rate cuts.\nBets can change easily, but that implies the Fed will assess the economic impact of tariffs if and when they come. That would be better for Hong Kong, as it would give businesses and borrowers a longer runway of lower funding costs, before being swept up again by the effects of Trump’s tariffs on monetary policy.\nYue reiterated his warning to Hong Kong borrowers to exercise prudence because interest rates may remain at “relatively high levels for some time”.\nThere is more than one dimension to Trump’s impact on interest rates. As a candidate, he not only promised tariff increases, but also rate relief, although many contributory factors are largely outside his control.\nInitial market reaction to the Fed’s hawkish comments was negative but Powell’s remarks should be seen in a longer-term context, including Trump’s views on interest rates. The Fed chairman is hinting at fewer cuts, but there will still be cuts.\nThe impact on the mainland of the Fed’s rate cut and overall hawkishness will not be as immediate as on Hong Kong, where it underlines the need to identify new drivers of economic growth. That said, Hong Kong has a buffer against a tariff war in that it can benefit indirectly from the policy directions set at China’s central economic work conference earlier this month, with fiscal deficit increases and more spending pledged to keep domestic demand high.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/article/3291612/hong-kong-interest-rates-volatility-price-pay-spectre-trump-tariffs-looms","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/12/19/2f5e2e96-5948-4f8d-b509-34a96a07520b_2df851c3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 01:10:23","author":"Scmp Editorial","authors":["Scmp Editorial"],"language":"en","source_country":"hk","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":274698024,"title":"Trump rethinks firing of Joint Chiefs chairman after one-on-one meeting, sources say","text":"A meeting between President-elect Donald Trump and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Q. Brown, Jr., in a luxury box at the Army-Navy football game last weekend may have delayed Trump’s plans to fire Brown, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. For months, Trump and his close associates have vowed to immediately fire U.S. military leaders who they deem too focused on diversity initiatives, often referencing Brown specifically. But the meeting went well, according to the two people with knowledge of the conversation. Trump and Brown met during the second quarter of the annual military grudge match at Northwest Stadium in Maryland last Saturday, the two people said. Trump and Brown spoke one-on-one for about 20 minutes while seated in the owner’s box. They got along well and the President-elect is “changing his tone” on Brown, the two people said, and it now appears Trump will not fire Brown right away. Brown “congratulated Trump on his election and made clear he was ready to work with the President,” one of the people familiar with the conversation said, adding “[Trump] liked that. Afterward, Trump told someone traveling with him that the conversation went well and that Brown was“doing a good job.” Trump is now more likely to keep the Chairman in his job, the two people said. Brown, known as \"C.Q.,\" assumed the Chairman role on October 1, 2023 and can serve in the position until his four-year term expires in 2027. Brown seen as a source of stability Several Republican lawmakers and retired Generals have been urging Trump not to fire Brown because they say it could be destabilizing and send the wrong message to members of the military, particularly as Trump’s pick to head the Pentagon, former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth, is fighting to be confirmed. Brown would bring stability amidst Hegseth’s controversial policies, lack of experience, and concerns about his character, the two people said. A Trump transition spokesperson declined to comment on the record. A spokesperson for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff declined to comment. Brown met with members of the Trump transition team's Pentagon landing team on Wednesday, including Michael Duffey, a former Pentagon official who is leading the group, a defense official said. “The Chairman is actively supporting the transition team and the process,” the defense official said. “He is focused on ensuring that the President-elect and folks on his national security team are well-informed about both existing and potential threats.” On a podcast last month, Hegseth said Brown needed to be fired. “First of all, you got to fire the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Any General that was involved, General, Admiral, whatever, that was involved in any of the DEI woke shit has got to go,” Hegseth said on the Shawn Ryan Show, a podcast whose host describes himself as a former U.S. Navy SEAL and CIA contractor. Hegseth said people should be in the military for warfighting and “that’s the only litmus test we care about.” One of the retired generals who has been advocating for Trump to not fire Brown is General Terrence “TJ” O’Shaughnessy, a retired Air Force General who works closely with Elon Musk at SpaceX. Brown replaced O’Shaughnessy as the Commander of Pacific Air Forces, known as PACAF, in 2020 and the two men got to know one another while both serving on active duty. President Trump then nominated Brown to be Air Force Chief of Staff in 2020, making him the first Black American service chief in the U.S. military. When the death of George Floyd sparked protests across the U.S. in 2020, Brown released an emotional video about the challenges and biases he endured in his personal life and throughout his decades on active duty in the Air Force. He also described the advice he gives to his sons about the dangers they face as young black men in America. “I’m thinking about how full I am with emotion, not just for George Floyd, but for the many African Americans that have suffered the same fate as George Floyd,” Brown said in the 2020 video. “I’m thinking about our two sons, and how we had to prepare them to live in two worlds.” Known as an introvert with a quiet demeanor, Brown’s candid and raw video surprised many officers who served alongside him. In it, a visibly emotional Brown said, “I’m thinking about my Air Force career where I was often the only African American in my squadron or, as a senior officer, the only African American in the room.” He added, “I can’t fix centuries of racism in our country, nor can I fix decades of discrimination that may have impacted members of our Air Force.” Just four days after Brown released the video, on June 9, Trump praised Brown in an online post, saying he is “excited to work even more closely with Gen. Brown, who is a Patriot and Great Leader!” Tensions over recruiting memo Two years later, on August 9, 2022, Brown co-signed a memo that set goals for recruiting officers in the Air Force and Space Force broken down by race, ethnicity and gender. While the memo said the goals were not intended to undermine the merit-based process for recruiting or promotions, Republicans denounced the memo, arguing it imposed racial quotas on the military and called for reducing the number of white officers in the Air Force. During Brown’s confirmation hearing to be Chairman in 2023, Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Missouri) pressed him on the memo, asking, “Do we have too many white officers in the Air Force?\" Schmitt denounced what he called “race-based politics being injected into our military.” “Somehow, some way we ended up in a place where a General in the Air Force is advocating for racial quotas, whether it be by applicants or the number of officers or maybe the total unit, and I just think that’s wrong,” Schmitt said. “I just don’t know how we can continue to have leadership that advocates for this divisive policy.” Brown countered that the memo only laid out goals for applications for officers in the Air Force and Space Force. Brown became Joint Chiefs Chairman after serving as the Air Force Chief of Staff for just over three years. Throughout his 40 years in the Air Force, Brown served as a combat pilot flying primarily F-16s, and commanded U.S. forces in the Middle East and the Pacific.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-rethinks-firing-joint-chiefs-chairman-one-one-meeting-sources-sa-rcna184907","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241219-charles-q-brown-se-745p-fadcf0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 01:09:24","author":"Courtney Kube","authors":["Courtney Kube"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":274698022,"title":"House votes down Republican bill to avert shutdown on eve of the deadline","text":"WASHINGTON — The House rejected a bill Thursday to keep the government funded temporarily, after Republican leaders reneged on an earlier bipartisan deal and made modifications to appease President-elect Donald Trump, billionaire Elon Musk and an internal GOP revolt. The vote was 174-235, with one Democrat voting present, falling far short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass it under a fast-track process. Two Democrats voted for the bill and Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, was the lone present vote, while the rest of the party opposed it. Thirty-eight Republicans voted against the bill as well, with conservatives saying it did not substantially reduce federal spending. The vote leaves Congress without a clear plan to avoid a looming government shutdown with less than 30 hours left before the deadline, driving up the odds of a funding lapse just ahead of the holidays. A shutdown is slated to begin at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The new bill put together by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Republican leaders had Trump’s endorsement but faced speedy opposition from Democratic leaders, who had not signed off prior to its release. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the proposal “laughable” as Democrats met privately before the vote. Inside a closed-door meeting of House Democrats before the vote, lawmakers could be heard chanting, “Hell no! Hell no!” Jeffries said on the House floor before the vote that his party would oppose the bill. “We are going to continue to fight for everyday Americans. That is why we are voting no on this bill — and to stop this reckless regressive and reactionary Republican shutdown,\" he said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., whose chamber still needs to pass whatever can get through the House and send it to President Joe Biden's desk before the shutdown deadline said Thursday night: “It’s a good thing the bill failed in the House. And now it’s time to go back to the bipartisan agreement, we came to.” The 116-page bill released Thursday would have funded the government through March 14. It would also extend the nation’s debt limit through Jan. 30, 2027, in response to a key, 11th-hour request from Trump. The slimmed-down package includes millions of dollars in disaster relief money for recovery from hurricanes Helene and Milton for construction projects and environmental cleanup, among a slew of other designations. The bill includes an extension of the farm bill as well as funding for the farming sector, including millions for conservation efforts, a watershed protection program and rural development disaster assistance. Absent are provisions that had infuriated Trump and his right-wing allies, including cost of living increases for lawmakers and giving Washington, D.C., control over a stadium site that could be used for the Washington Commanders NFL team. The legislation also excludes health care provisions to overhaul laws around pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, that were agreed to in the prior deal. In a post on TruthSocial, Trump praised the deal, calling it a “success” and urged both Republicans and Democrats to vote yes. “Speaker Mike Johnson and the House have come to a very good Deal for the American People. The newly agreed to American Relief Act of 2024 will keep the Government open, fund our Great Farmers and others, and provide relief for those severely impacted by the devastating hurricanes,” Trump wrote. Two Democrats, Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., voted with most Republicans in favor of the bill Thursday night. The latest GOP proposal was released less than 36 hours before a deadline to fund the government or allow a shutdown that would shutter vast swaths of the federal government and furlough thousands of workers. Democratic leaders have excoriated Johnson and his team for reneging on the previous bipartisan deal that he had signed off on. Some noted that it diminishes House Republican leadership’s credibility in any future negotiations. On Wednesday evening, Trump threw an unexpected wrench into funding negotiations when he slammed the bipartisan funding deal Johnson had negotiated. And, in a last-minute demand, he threatened to go after Republicans unless they added a provision to extend the debt limit, months ahead of a deadline to prevent an economically catastrophic default next year — a substantial ask with less than two days to go before a shutdown deadline. On Thursday morning, Trump went even further, telling NBC News that Congress needs to abolish the debt ceiling entirely. In a phone interview, Trump noted that some Democrats have wanted to nix the debt ceiling for years and that he would “lead the charge” in that effort. Jeffries had previously said that any debate over extending or eliminating the debt ceiling at this point is “premature at best.” Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the former Appropriations Committee chair who is now the panel’s top Democrat, was among those who slammed Johnson and Republicans for reneging on the bipartisan funding deal that had been locked in just days earlier. She said there was a “good agreement” in place that was moving ahead, “but for President Musk.” Asked if the tech billionaire was calling the shots for Republicans, DeLauro replied: “It’d appear to me!” (Trump told NBC News Thursday that Musk had only put out a series of statements seeking to kill the bipartisan compromise after discussing it with the president-elect, saying the two are aligned on the issue.) Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who just won re-election in a swing district, said on MSNBC that it is “very clear, Donald Trump is in charge” and that Republicans need Democratic support for a bill. “The reality here is very simple. We have to negotiate,” Lawler told MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell before Thursday’s agreement was announced. “I will remind everybody we are in a divided government. Still, Democrats control the Senate and the White House, so there’s going to have to be a bipartisan negotiation.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trumps-demands-leave-republicans-no-plan-government-shutdown-rcna184866","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241219-mike-johnson-ch-1112-19acf2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 01:09:24","author":"Julie Tsirkin,Kyle Stewart,Sahil Kapur,Scott Wong,Syedah Asghar","authors":["Julie Tsirkin","Kyle Stewart","Sahil Kapur","Scott Wong","Syedah Asghar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.642},{"id":274698010,"title":"Biden stays on the sidelines as Congress scrambles over a looming shutdown","text":"WASHINGTON — White House officials are in close touch with Democratic leaders in Congress — Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Chuck Schumer — and are coordinating strategy with them as Democrats aim to highlight how a holiday shutdown would hurt the economy and block disaster relief, according to sources familiar with discussions. President Joe Biden has not spoken publicly about the looming shutdown. At this point, White House officials believe this is a problem for House Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump to solve after he encouraged his party to sink a bipartisan deal that had already been hammered out. The White House will have to ultimately sign any bill that can pass. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Thursday that Biden \"supports the bipartisan agreement to keep the government open, help communities recovering from disasters, and lower costs—not this giveaway for billionaires that Republicans are proposing at the 11th hour.” Biden did not answer shouted questions about a possible government shutdown when he arrived back at the White House on Thursday night. Asked about Trump's role in killing the deal, Republicans pointed to Biden. \"Where is the 46th President right now? What is he saying about this?\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said of Biden. \"I have not heard him weigh in one ounce over the last month.\" Late Wednesday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre released a statement blasting the GOP. “Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,” she wrote. “A deal is a deal. Republicans should keep their word.” In the White House’s view, Trump essentially ordered Republicans to shut down the government. A former Biden campaign official slammed Trump for seeming to listen to Elon Musk — a private citizen — who has inserted himself into the process. “Trump seems like he needs to act on his dad’s wishes,” the official said. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is preparing for a possible shutdown. An official with the White House Office of Management and Budget said that OMB has been working with agencies since last Friday to review relevant legal requirements to make sure their plans for an orderly shutdown are up to date. Starting at 10 a.m. Thursday, agencies sent an email to employees about the status of funding, the OMB official said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-stays-sidelines-congress-scrambles-looming-shutdown-rcna184900","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241017-biden-mb-1047-1a0faa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 01:09:24","author":"Gabe Gutierrez","authors":["Gabe Gutierrez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":274698012,"title":"Biden will meet with Pope Francis in the final days of his presidency","text":"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will meet with Pope Francis in January, likely the president's final international trip just days before he leaves the Oval Office, the White House announced on Thursday. Biden accepted Francis' invitation to visit the Vatican during a Thursday phone call with the pope, the White House said in a statement. The two men have met several times. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that Biden's visit to Rome will take place from Jan. 9 to 12, adding that Biden will also meet with Italy's President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. During Biden's conversation with the pope, the two men discussed \"efforts to advance peace around the world,\" according to the White House. \"The President thanked the pope for his continued advocacy to alleviate global suffering, including his work to advance human rights and protect religious freedoms,\" said a White House readout of the leaders' call. Before the White House's official announcement, reporters asked Biden as he departed Marine One whether he planned to visit with the pope in January, a trip first reported by the Associated Press. \"Yes, I will see the pope,\" Biden responded. Biden, who is the second Roman Catholic president in American history, most recently met with Francis privately during a June visit to Italy for the G7 summit. During the June meeting, the White House said that Biden and Francis discussed the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. \"The leaders emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire and a hostage deal to get the hostages home and address the critical humanitarian crisis in Gaza,\" the White House said in the June statement. The president was present at the start of the pope's tenure in 2013, when Biden, then in his capacity as vice president, led the American delegation for Francis' inauguration. Francis, 88, ascended to the papacy in March 2013 after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI. Biden's trip to Italy will take place later than his most recent predecessors' final international trips in office. President-elect Donald Trump's final international trip during his first term was to India in February 2020, shortly before Covid-19 restrictions limited travel, according to the State Department. Former President Barack Obama's final international trip as president was to Peru in November 2016, and former President George W.

President-elect Donald Trump, who previously rejected a bipartisan version of the deal, praised the new agreement.\r\nDetails of the Agreement\r\n\"There’s an agreement,\" stated Republican Representative Tom Cole, who chairs the committee responsible for overseeing spending, in a conversation with reporters.\r\n\r\nThe deal, however, has yet to receive feedback from Democrats. The proposal will need to be approved by the Senate, which Democrats control with a 51-49 majority, and signed into law by President Joe Biden to avoid a shutdown beginning on Saturday.\r\nGovernment Shutdown Consequences\r\nFailure to pass the bill by the deadline would trigger a partial government shutdown, disrupting funding for essential services such as border security and law enforcement. Federal workers, more than 2 million of whom would be affected, could face delayed paychecks. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration also warned that long lines at airports might become an issue for travelers.\r\n\r\nTrump has urged lawmakers to quickly approve the package, stressing the importance of resolving fiscal matters before he takes office on January 20.\r\nGovernment Shutdown: House Vote and Key Provisions\r\nThe House of Representatives is set to vote on the bill at 6 p.m. Eastern Time (2300 GMT), according to Representative Anna Paulina Luna.\r\n\r\nThe package would fund government operations for three months, extending coverage until Trump assumes the presidency and Republicans control both chambers of Congress. It also includes provisions for $100 billion in disaster relief and $10 billion in farm aid, as well as extending critical farm and food aid programs set to expire at the year’s end.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the deal would suspend the debt ceiling until January 2027, potentially allowing trillions of dollars to be added to the nation’s $36 trillion federal debt.\r\nTrump's Stance on the Debt Ceiling\r\nEarlier in the day, Trump reiterated his stance on the debt ceiling, insisting that it should be eliminated altogether. \"The debt ceiling should be thrown out entirely,\" he stated.\r\n\r\nHistorically, debates over the debt ceiling have led to instability in financial markets, as a U.S. default could trigger global credit shocks. While the debt ceiling suspension technically expires on January 1, lawmakers are not expected to address the issue until spring.\r\n\r\nTrump has also expressed his plan to introduce tax cuts that could decrease revenue by $8 trillion over the next decade, which would exacerbate the national debt without corresponding reductions in spending. Despite this, he has vowed not to cut senior citizens' retirement and health benefits, which constitute a significant portion of the budget and are projected to increase substantially in the coming years.\r\nDemocratic Party Response\r\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries responded to the situation earlier, labeling the conversation about the debt ceiling as \"premature.\" “This is a moment that's not about the incoming president, it's not about millionaires and billionaires, it's about the harm the House Republicans will do to the American people if the government shuts down,” Jeffries remarked during a news conference.\r\n\r\nHis office did not provide an immediate response to inquiries about the new deal.\r\n\r\nSome Republicans have expressed reluctance to suspend the debt ceiling without addressing government spending. \"It's like limiting, you know, increasing your credit card limit, while you don’t do anything to actually constrain spending,\" said Representative Chip Roy.\r\n\r\nThe Fate of Speaker Mike Johnson\r\n\r\nThe specter of a government shutdown also poses a challenge to House Speaker Mike Johnson. Johnson, who unexpectedly assumed the speaker's role after a faction of the Republican Party ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has faced pressure from both sides of the aisle. His leadership could be further threatened if he struggles to secure support from within his own party.\r\n\r\nSeveral Republicans have voiced opposition to Johnson’s leadership, indicating that they will not vote for him when Congress reconvenes in January. This could lead to another leadership battle in the lead-up to Trump’s inauguration.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene shared her thoughts on the issue, emphasizing the need for decisive action. \"We must stand firm with the American people to stop the madness!! No matter what. Even if we have to elect new leadership,\" she stated on social media.\r\n\r\nAlso Read: What Is The Debt Ceiling And Why Trump Wants Congress To Abolish It","summary":"Republican leaders in Congress have unveiled a new spending package to avoid a government shutdown, with a vote scheduled soon.

This development raises concerns about how essential services and federal payments may be affected, especially with the holiday season fast approaching.\r\nReason for the Impending Shutdown\r\nThe potential shutdown is the result of a contentious debate over a proposed spending bill intended to extend funding through March 14. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson withdrew support for the measure following objections from some Republican leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump. The primary point of contention was the inclusion of billions of dollars in additional spending.\r\n\r\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, a prominent financial backer of Trump and other Republican candidates during the November election, also criticized the bill. Describing it as \"terrible,\" Musk celebrated its rejection on the social media platform X, declaring, \"The voice of the people has triumphed!\"\r\nWhat Happens in a Federal Government Shutdown?\r\nIf Congress fails to authorize new funding, most federal agencies must suspend operations, with some exceptions for activities essential to protecting life and property. Each agency determines which employees remain on duty, leading to significant disruption across various government services.\r\n\r\nDavid Wessel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted in a blog post, \"Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans, or government benefits.\"\r\nReasons of Federal Government Shutdown\r\nGovernment workers deemed essential, such as air traffic controllers and law enforcement personnel, will continue to work, but without pay. Other federal employees will be furloughed. Retroactive paychecks are issued once a shutdown concludes, but the financial strain on workers during the interim can be significant.\r\n\r\nA similar situation occurred during the shutdown that began on December 22, 2018, and lasted over 30 days. Many workers faced financial hardship, turning to food banks and other support services to make ends meet.\r\nImpact on Social Security and Medicare\r\nSocial Security payments to the nation's 67 million recipients will continue without disruption, as the program operates under laws that don't require annual congressional approval. Medicare services will also remain active, ensuring seniors retain access to medications and healthcare.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Social Security Administration’s administrative budget relies on discretionary funding. This could lead to delays in benefit verifications and the processing of new benefit applications, according to AARP.\r\nEffect on Air Travel and the TSA\r\nTravelers can expect potential delays at airports, as Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents and air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers and must work without pay during a shutdown.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Homeland Security previously warned that shutdowns could result in \"significant delays and longer wait times for travelers at airports across the country,\" citing past shutdown experiences as precedent.\r\nImpact on the Military\r\nActive-duty military personnel and federal law enforcement agents will continue working, but like other essential government workers, they will not be paid until Congress approves a new spending measure. Civilian employees working for the U.S. Department of Defense will be furloughed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Military Times, the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs are preparing to notify workers of potential shutdown protocols. If the shutdown extends into January, the first military paychecks of 2025—which are set to reflect a 4.5% pay increase—could be delayed.\r\nWhat Closes During a Shutdown?\r\nMany public services would be suspended or delayed. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, environmental inspections and food safety checks conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be affected. National parks would likely close, and some services offered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) could also be halted.\r\n\r\nThe IRS may face furloughs, which could affect its ability to process tax returns. While quarterly estimated tax payments due on January 15 must still be paid, the start of the 2025 tax filing season—typically in late January—could face disruptions.\r\nHow Long Could a Government Shutdown Last?\r\nThe potential length of the shutdown remains uncertain. Analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested in a December 18 research note that a \"protracted shutdown looks unlikely\" but acknowledged that the possibility of a shutdown had increased.\r\n\r\nA spending measure could still pass before the December 21 deadline if Republicans can amend the bill to address Trump’s objections. According to Goldman’s analysts, \"Trump's opposition was unrelated to the main components—he stated support for the spending extension, and the disaster and agricultural aid—so it is possible that a revised package could still pass before\" the deadline.\r\n\r\nAlso Read: Neil Cavuto Departs Fox News After 28 Years: Did His Trump Criticism Play a Role?","summary":"As a potential federal government shutdown looms on December 21, millions of Americans face the prospect of halted services and unpaid workers just days before the holidays.

This increase represents the largest annual population growth since 2001, largely fueled by a surge in immigration.\r\n\r\nOf the 3.3 million new residents, about 2.8 million came from outside the U.S., highlighting the significant role immigration is playing in the nation's demographic changes. Births outnumbered deaths by almost 519,000, a notable increase from the low of 146,000 in 2021, during the pandemic.\r\nRegional Growth Patterns\r\nThe Southern United States emerged as the largest and fastest-growing region, adding 1.8 million new residents, more than all other regions combined. Texas led the charge, contributing nearly 563,000 new residents, driven largely by both births and domestic migration. However, California saw a population loss of nearly 240,000 people due to domestic migration, the largest such decline in the country. Despite this, the state experienced a net gain of 361,000 people from international migration.\r\n\r\nWhile much of the country saw growth, a few states experienced population declines. Vermont, West Virginia, and Mississippi were the only states to report decreases in their populations during 2024.\r\nThe Shift in Growth Drivers\r\nKristie Wilder, a demographer with the Census Bureau, noted that while an annual growth rate of 1% is higher than recent years, it remains within historical norms. What is most significant, however, is the diminishing role of natural population growth (births exceeding deaths) and the growing importance of international migration as the primary driver of U.S. population growth.\r\n\r\nThese population trends come amid ongoing political debates, including President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to address immigration reform, which could include mass deportations and changes to birthright citizenship policies. Despite such rhetoric, the continued influx of immigrants underscores the enduring impact of migration on the U.S. demographic landscape.\r\n\r\nRead More : Joe Biden To Visit Pope Francis In His Final International Trip","summary":"The U.S. population grew by nearly 1% in 2024, reaching 341 million, according to new estimates from the Census Bureau.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/us-population-growth-in-2024-driven-by-immigration-surge/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/USA-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 01:09:23","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":274697564,"title":"How White House Hid The Mental Decline Of Biden From Day 1 Of His Presidency","text":"White House aides have been accused of actively concealing signs of President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline since the beginning of his presidency, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. From the moment Biden, 82, took office in January 2021, staff reportedly implemented measures to limit his public exposure, citing his performance during public appearances as a key concern.\r\nFluctuations in mental clarity\r\nThe measures included curtailing in-person interactions and making adjustments to the president’s schedule to account for fluctuations in his mental clarity. By spring 2021, White House staff had started rescheduling meetings to accommodate what one national security official described as the president’s “good days and bad days.” The official reportedly told an aide, “He has good days and bad days, and today was a bad day so we’re going to address this tomorrow.” Meetings were often pushed to later in the day, aligning with the revelation that Biden’s mental sharpness was optimal within a six-hour window that closed around 4 p.m.\r\nManaging the image and communication of Biden\r\nWhite House officials reportedly took extensive steps to manage Biden’s image and communication. Staffers were instructed to keep briefings short and direct, ensuring the president’s attention remained focused. In addition, a voice coach, Jeffrey Katzenberg — a Hollywood executive and Biden campaign co-chair — was hired to help strengthen the president’s speaking voice, which had grown faint and raspy.\r\n\r\nBiden’s aides also filtered the information he received, reportedly omitting negative news about his administration’s performance. This move came amid plummeting public approval ratings, which hit a 70-year low in 2024. Critics argued that this practice shielded the president from the realities of public opinion and hindered his ability to respond effectively.\r\nControversy Over Handling of Press Interactions by Biden\r\nThe White House’s efforts to limit Biden’s exposure to the press have been noted throughout his presidency. He has held fewer large press conferences than any modern president, often stumbling during unscripted moments or deviating from teleprompter cues. This pattern was first observed during his 2020 presidential campaign, when aides acknowledged that Biden’s mental acuity diminished outside of his preferred daily time frame.\r\n\r\nThe strategy extended to press events where First Lady Jill Biden reportedly played a role in mitigating risk. She was said to intervene during lengthy press engagements, concerned that extended questioning could leave her husband vulnerable to mistakes. Staffers also exerted tight control during Biden’s brief 2024 re-election campaign, handling media inquiries with such rigidity that it surprised campaign donors.\r\nChallenges During Classified Documents Investigation\r\nPresident Biden’s cognitive abilities were tested during his interview with special counsel Robert Hur over the retention of classified documents. Although Biden himself pushed for the interview to demonstrate his cooperation, the preparation process proved challenging. The president’s team dedicated three-hour daily sessions to help him prepare. According to the Wall Street Journal, Biden’s ability to recall information fluctuated, and he struggled to remember specific points, including the year his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. The two-day interview, which occurred in October 2023, was described as “grueling.”\r\n\r\nA White House source downplayed the incident, stating, “Every person who has ever prepared for a legal interview has forgotten some of the prep.” The interview’s purpose was to contrast Biden’s approach with that of former President Donald Trump, who was also under investigation for handling classified materials.\r\nWhite House Defends President Biden’s Capabilities\r\nDespite the allegations, White House officials have defended Biden’s cognitive abilities and leadership. Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates emphasized the president’s active engagement with his cabinet and staff. “President Biden speaks with members of his cabinet daily, and with most members multiple times a week, staying close with them about implementation of key laws and strengthening our national security,” Bates said in a statement.\r\n\r\nBates further highlighted Biden’s accomplishments, calling him “the most accomplished record of any modern commander-in-chief” and crediting his success to “his attention to policy details that impact millions of lives.” According to Bates, Biden actively seeks input from a range of sources, including experts, elected officials, and historians, in his decision-making process.\r\n\r\nAddressing concerns about limited access to Biden, Bates argued that such restrictions are not unique to this presidency. “During every presidency, there are inevitably some in Washington who do not receive as much time with whomever the president is as they would prefer; but that never means that the president isn’t engaging thoroughly with others, as this president does,” Bates said.\r\n\r\nAlso Read: Who Is Fani Willis And Why Has Georgia Court Disqualified Her Over Trump Election Interference Case?","summary":"White House aides have been accused of concealing signs of President Biden&#8217;s cognitive decline since his inauguration, with measures taken to limit his public exposure.

This move has intensified the pressure on Republican leaders in Congress to quickly craft a plan to avert a government shutdown, just days before the holiday season.\r\nTrump and Vance criticize deal\r\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Trump and Vance criticized the proposed deal for containing provisions favored by Democrats. Their objections, however, took a significant turn when they called on Congress to address the debt ceiling now, rather than delaying it until next year.\r\n\r\n\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great, but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" Trump and Vance stated. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate now.\"\r\nUnderstanding the Debt Ceiling\r\nThe debt ceiling is a cap placed on the amount of money the U.S. government can borrow to pay its debts. Every year, Congress passes a budget covering essential government functions, including federal salaries and programs like Social Security. However, the government has consistently spent more than it takes in, leading to an increasing federal deficit. When this occurs, the government must borrow money to meet its obligations, but the debt ceiling limits the amount it can borrow.\r\n\r\nAs he prepares to take office, Trump has a legislative agenda that includes border security and the extension of his Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which overhauled the tax code in 2017. However, a standoff over the debt ceiling could complicate efforts to push through these priorities quickly, particularly with a Republican-led House and Senate.\r\nEliminating the debt ceiling altogether\r\nTrump has advocated for eliminating the debt ceiling altogether, a position that has garnered some support among Democrats in the past. In a phone interview with CBS News’ Robert Costa on Thursday, Trump emphasized his stance.\r\n\r\n\"Number one, the debt ceiling should be thrown out entirely,\" Trump said. \"Number two, a lot of the different things they thought they'd receive [in a recently proposed spending deal] are now going to be thrown out, 100 percent. And we'll see what happens. We'll see whether or not we have a closure during the Biden administration. But if it's going to take place, it's going to take place during Biden, not during Trump.\"\r\nChallenges in reaching a compromise\r\nThe likelihood of Congress agreeing to Trump's demands remains uncertain. Many Republicans in both the House and Senate have resisted raising the debt ceiling without corresponding spending reforms. Debt ceiling debates often evolve into broader discussions about the federal budget, with conservatives pushing for cuts to what they view as excessive government spending. Furthermore, Democrats retain control of the Senate and the White House, making it unclear whether a compromise can be reached.\r\n\r\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reacted sharply to the call for a government shutdown, warning of the negative impacts on American families. \"Shutting down the government would harm families and endanger services Americans rely on,\" Jean-Pierre stated. \"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country. President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Vance ordered Republicans to shut down the government and they are threatening to do just that — while undermining communities recovering from disasters, farmers and ranchers, and community health centers.\"\r\n\r\nAlso Read: Who Is Chip Roy?

I’ve been saying it – I think Elon Musk believes he’s president. I do.”\n\n“I’ve called him vice president. I’ve called him president. Because I don’t know what JD is doing,” she added, referring to the VP-elect, 40. “I don’t remember the last time we even talked about JD.”\n\n“The View” co-host Joy Behar, 82, then chimed in, saying of Vance, “He’s planning the presidency when they get rid of Trump.”\n\nLooking surprised, Goldberg then asked Behar, “You think it’s ‘Musk-Vance’?” alluding to a theoretical presidential ticket with Musk at the top.\n\n“Possible,” Behar replied. \n\n“Mmmmm,” Goldberg mused to a silent studio audience before joking, “Hey, you know who [Trump] – stay away from the stairways.”\n\n“Because, you know, people put their leg out to trip you going down the stairs. Watch out,” she added to laughs and claps. \n\nPotentially worried about the joke being misconstrued — and receiving a call from the Secret Service — Goldberg attempted to walk back the joke after a commercial break. \n\n“I need to clean something up,” she began. “My cat lays in wait for me on my stairs all the time. That’s what I was referring to.”\n\n“I was thinking of that,” she continued. “I wasn’t trying to indicate that they were actually standing there with their legs out hoping he would trip.”\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin, 56, then stepped in to try and help.\n\n“Nobody wants anything done to the president,” she insisted. \n\nAttempting another explanation, Goldberg went on to say, “It was light-hearted and it’s the holidays, c’mon! My goodness.”\n\nHostin weighed in again, saying, “You did not mean that anybody should hurt the president.”\n\n“No,” Goldberg responded. “The thing about this show, there’s no way not to step in poo. There’s no way to do it. There’s no way not to do it.”\n\nReferring to her feline once more, she told viewers, “I got a cat who does it to me everyday – and that’s what sparked it.”\n\nLast month, Goldberg shared her belief that Musk will be Trump’s de-facto president, superseding Vance. \n\n“Musk is the real, actual vice president,” she said on “The View.” “He’s making decisions. He’s doing things, so I think, why doesn’t he have to give up X with everything he’s done?”","summary":"Whoopsie.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/entertainment/whoopi-goldberg-jokes-about-elon-musk-jd-vance-tripping-trump-down-the-stairs-then-walks-it-back/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/95618599.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7h7n0lE2-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-20 01:01:45","author":"Sean Mandell","authors":["Sean Mandell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.627},{"id":274696052,"title":"US House rejects Trump-backed Republican Spending Bill, government shutdown looms","text":"The US House of Representatives on Thursday rejected a Republican-led spending bill that would have provided a temporary solution to avert a looming government shutdown, leaving lawmakers scrambling as a Friday midnight deadline nears. The bill, which aimed to extend government funding and suspend the national debt ceiling, failed by a vote of 174-235. The rejection comes just one day before the federal government is set to run out of cash, threatening widespread disruptions, including potential delays in holiday travel.Despite strong backing from President-elect Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, the bill faltered due to significant opposition within the Republican ranks. A total of 38 Republicans voted against the measure, aligning with almost all Democrats, who rejected the proposal in protest. With the government facing shutdown, federal operations could grind to a halt, affecting everything from national parks to border enforcement, and leading to pay freezes for over 2 million federal workers. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) also warned that air travel during the holiday season could be impacted by longer-than-usual wait times at airports.— elonmusk (@elonmusk) The bill, which resembled a previous version that Trump and Musk had criticized, included provisions to fund the government until March, when Trump will officially take office, and Republicans will control both chambers of Congress. It also proposed $100 billion in disaster relief and aimed to lift the debt ceiling for two years. — Jesse_Morgan_ (@Jesse_Morgan_) However, the bill's supporters, including Trump, viewed it as a necessary step to ease the path for future tax cuts and spending decisions. Trump had pushed for the suspension of the debt ceiling, arguing that it would help lay the groundwork for significant tax reductions, including a promised $8 trillion tax cut. Critics, however, argued that this would further exacerbate the national debt, currently at $36 trillion.Republicans divided, Democrats opposeAhead of the vote, both Republican and Democratic leaders warned that the other party would bear responsibility for a potential shutdown. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking before the vote, claimed the bill was vital for preventing a shutdown and for future spending cuts. \"Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does few things well,\" Johnson remarked.However, the bill faced fierce opposition from Democrats, who criticized it as a giveaway to wealthy individuals like Musk, without addressing critical spending issues. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called it \"a cover for a budget-busting tax cut\" that would largely benefit the rich, adding to the nation’s growing debt. “How dare you lecture America about fiscal responsibility?” he said during the floor debate.Many Republicans also voiced concerns over the bill's implications for the national debt, with Representative Chip Roy expressing his frustration: \"I am absolutely sickened by the party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility,\" he said.Even if the bill had passed the House, it faced significant challenges in the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority. The White House reiterated that President Joe Biden did not support the measure, further complicating any potential resolution.A shifting political landscapeThe failure of the spending bill also places a spotlight on the ongoing political instability within the Republican Party. Speaker Mike Johnson, who ascended to the role last year after a leadership shake-up that ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has struggled to unite his party around key issues. In the face of such divisions, Johnson had turned to Democrats for support on previous votes, but his efforts fell short this time.With the new year approaching and Trump’s inauguration set for January 20, Republicans face mounting pressure to come to a resolution. The government shutdown, if it proceeds, could have serious political and economic consequences, particularly as the country enters the holiday season. Meanwhile, Trump’s promise of sweeping tax cuts, without significant cuts to entitlement programs, poses a long-term challenge for fiscal responsibility.The political turmoil surrounding the government funding crisis could also undermine Johnson’s leadership, with some Republicans suggesting they may not support him as speaker when Congress reconvenes in January. This threat could set the stage for another leadership battle in the weeks leading up to Trump’s return to office.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-house-rejects-trump-backed-republican-spending-bill-government-shutdown-looms/articleshow/116485932.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116485944/116485944.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 01:00:23","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":274695830,"title":"Fani Finale: Will Lawfare Case Exit Stage Left?","text":"Sic semper lawfarennis. But has the attempt to prosecute a RICO case in Georgia centered on Donald Trump come to an end with Fani Willis' disqualification? It depends on how one defines \"end.\" \n\nTechnically, as David wrote earlier, the Georgia appellate court left the indictment in place while removing Willis and Fulton County from jurisdiction over it. That came from the punt by Judge Scott McAfee that David also described, but is in itself a punt too. In fact, the appeals court barely addressed the motion in its 2-1 ruling today, and missed the larger point behind it:\n\n2. The appellants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motions to dismiss the indictment. The State responds that the appellants have failed to show that the trial court erred in finding that the appellants had not shown “that [their] due process rights have been violated or that the issues involved prejudiced [them] in any way.”“Dismissal of an indictment . . . [is] an extreme sanction[ ], used only sparingly . . . for unlawful government conduct.” State v. Lampl, 296 Ga. 892, 896 (2) (770 SE2d 629) (2015). In the absence of express statutory authorization, dismissal of an indictment “generally cannot be imposed absent a violation of a constitutional right.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Id. While this is the rare case in which DA Willis and her office must be disqualified due to a significant appearance of impropriety, we cannot conclude that the record also supports the imposition of the extreme sanction of dismissal of the indictment under the appropriate standard. See Olsen v. State, 302 Ga. 288, 293-294 (2) (806 SE2d 556) (2017); Lamb v. State, 267 Ga. 464, 465-466 (5) (479 SE2d 719) (1997). We therefore affirm the trial court’s denial of the appellants’ motion to dismiss.\n\nThis case didn't just involve the appearance of impropriety. It involved actual impropriety, including factual misrepresentations during the hearing McAfee held on the disqualification motion. There are plenty of reasons to believe that both Willis and Wade lied in court about their relationship, which would not just be prosecutorial misconduct but outright perjury. A separate claim of witness tampering has yet to be pursued, but certainly raises all sorts of questions not just about the conflict of interest between Willis and Wade but also the entire conduct of the Fulton County DA throughout this case. \n\nIf perjury and witness tampering aren't \"extreme\" examples of prosecutorial misconduct, what is?\n\nThe court may have felt itself constrained to the findings of McAfee's rulings as the trier of fact on this hearing. That limitation lent itself to Judge Land's accusation in dissent that the court had adopted a new standard for disqualification. However, the short shrift that the ruling gives the dismissal motion looks more like a punt because without Willis, this indictment is almost certainly going nowhere -- and the court almost certainly knows it.\n\nTo understand why, the Associated Press gives a thumbnail description of the process that will now take place to assign new jurisdiction:\n\nThe 2-1 ruling by appeals court panel means it will be up to the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia to find another prosecutor to take over the case and to decide whether to continue to pursue it, though that could be delayed if Willis decides to appeal to the state Supreme Court. A trial judge in March had set conditions that allowed Willis to stay on the case.\n\nNow, ask yourselves this: What prosecutor will want to take up this case at all, beyond the guilty pleas that have already been entered? That's especially true of Willis' Tinker-Toy edition of a RICO case, based mainly on political speech and without any permanent \"organization\" involved for a Racketeer Influenced or Corrupt Organization charge. Add onto that Willis' attempts to make a racism argument in response to the DQ motion, including in a public speech at a church, and the entire mess looks distinctly unappealing, even for Democrat DAs that might otherwise be inclined to dislike Trump et al.\n\nDo the judges know this? Probably not with total certainty, but ... come on, man. They know the law and they read the indictment. They must at least suspect that no other DA will want to take this up with any real enthusiasm, and any other DA in Georgia might be inclined to quietly dismiss the RICO charges once the dust settles a bit. That includes Democrat DAs, where their constituents might be less impressed with lawfare against Trump, and their desire for re-election runs more toward dealing with actual crime rather than Politics By Other Means. \n\nThis may be premature. Both sides could appeal parts of the ruling to the Georgia state supreme court -- Willis on the DQ and Trump et al on the denial of the dismissal motion. There's no real upside for the high court to disturb this ruling, though, because it has all of the virtues of effectively killing the case while maintaining an alibi. Even CNN recognizes that this case is \"dead in the water,\" even before Elie Honig weighs in:\n\nCNN Newsroom anchor Jim Acosta began the hour with the breaking news and brought on senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz.“This is a big development,” said Acosta.The appeal court’s ruling was indeed a big development, Polantz agreed, “and a big development that Donald Trump has wanted for a long time.” The case had “already been paused,” she said, but “now it’s not even back burner.”“This is a case that will be dead in the water,” she continued, “because the Georgia Court of Appeals is now saying that Fani Willis, the leader of the prosecution against Donald Trump, the district attorney in Fulton county, Georgia, she should be disqualified from being able to bring that case.”\n\nHonig then referred back to Willis' public statements accusing Trump attorneys of being racist for opposing her, and wondered whether the judges would rule on that. As it happens, they didn't:\n\nAnd separately, and I'm looking to see if this is in the opinion, I believe it is, because I know it's one of the issues that was briefed to the Georgia Court of Appeals, the D.A. made statements outside of court that the trial judge found were, quote, legally improper. For example, she went in front of a church while this case was pending, and she said, essentially, the reason these defendants have brought these motions, standard legal motions, is because they're playing the race card.And the defendants, Donald Trump and other defense lawyers, argued that that violated the responsibilities and ethics of a prosecutor. And the trial judge, oddly, said those statements that Fani Willis made out of court were, quote, legally improper, and then he did nothing about it.

Don't believe it. \n\nEverything was going relatively smoothly for Donald Trump.Coming off a decisive electoral victory last month, he had appeared to corral his party behind even his most controversial Cabinet picks and was enjoying decent public approval. He promised to create a strong economy. Tech titans and foreign leaders are clamoring to meet with him or fund his inauguration.Then Wednesday happened.Two shocks to the system this week have cast Washington into chaos as Republicans scramble to avoid a self-created looming government shutdown and weather a market slide at the peak of the holiday season.\n\nThe Fed's worries about the economy indeed signal a problem for Trump for sure, but given that Biden is still president and he will walk into office with a bunch of proposals to jump-start the economy any improvement in 2025 will be seen as a victory for him. Right now Biden owns the economy. \n\nAs for a government shutdown--that is more a media phenomenon than a serious problem for Trump. Again, Biden is president, and the Republicans can do something about shifting the little blame that will be apportioned to where it belongs. \n\nPass a disaster relief bill and a clean CR and go home. Disaster relief is a real issue, although a creative president who wanted to do something about hurting people could easily find the money to get to work right now. The CR could be under 25 pages, and if Democrats refuse to pass it, then it is on them. \n\nThe last thing we need is to hamper Trump on Day 1, and this CR would have. Any fear that Americans will side with Biden and Hakeem Jeffries is a fantasy inspired by nightmares based on the 1990s. \n\nRepublicans are weenies, and their current problem isn't that moderate voters are worried about a government shutdown; it's that Republican voters will revolt if they stab us in the back. \n\nStill, I expect that Trump has the juice to get the Republicans in line. And once the ball is in the Democrats' court, Trump has the ammo to either force them to pass the bills or to make them take the blame for the consequences. \n\nTrump is not in trouble.

The claim that prosecutions of controversial figures are about the law is fiction. Politics always impinge in one way or another. The Hunter Biden case's resolution was political, as was the initial attempt to immunize him through a plea deal. The lawfare against Trump was purely political--four criminal trials in one year- an election year! \n\n🚨 CNN reacts to Fani Willis being disqualified from prosecuting Trump in the election interference case:“That case against him in Georgia… it’s already been paused.

Jean Carroll case was funded by billionaire Democrat Reid Hoffman, who also funded the \"Trump will ban masturbating to porn\" ads during the campaign. \n\nTheoretically, the RICO case can still move forward, but a different prosecutor has to run with it, and I would be somewhat surprised if one did because it is so tainted, and the original indictment was intended to kill Trump's campaign and that failed. \n\nBREAKING: Nathan Wade, Fanni's boyfriend, admits he colluded with the W.H. while working for Fani Willis during their unlawful prosecution of Trump.

Learn strategy? Look at the calendar before cutting deals that give away the store?\n\nAll of the above?\n\nDonald Trump actually sounds as though he wants Johnson to survive his next Speaker vote, even after the missteps yesterday. Trump tells Fox News Digital that Johnson could win \"easily\" as long as he stops falling for Democrats' banana-in-the-tailpipe tricks. Trump wants Biden's budget settled while Biden's on the hook for it, and he wants something else that might actually get bipartisan support:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump told Fox News Digital that House Speaker Mike Johnson will \"easily remain speaker\" for the next Congress if he \"acts decisively and tough\" and eliminates \"all of the traps being set by Democrats\" in the spending package. Fox News Digital spoke exclusively with the president-elect Thursday morning, just hours after the bipartisan deal to avoid a partial government shutdown was killed. \"Anybody that supports a bill that doesn’t take care of the Democrat quicksand known as the debt ceiling should be primaried and disposed of as quickly as possible,\" Trump told Fox News Digital. Vice President-elect JD Vance met with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Wednesday night. The two spoke about the potential continuing resolution for about an hour. Vance said the two had a \"productive conversation,\" and said he believes they will \"be able to solve some problems here\" and will continue \"working on it.\"\n\nThat's actually a remarkable show of support for Johnson, under the circumstances. Trump has a habit of stirring the pot at the last minute on legislative negotiations, which creates its own problems, but this is a pickle mainly of Johnson's own creation. The breadth of the giveaways in the supposed \"continuing resolution\" made it much more of an omnibus than anyone expected, even Johnson's allies in the House GOP caucus. The more that emerged, the more embarrassing it got, to the point where it made a pretty good case that Johnson might not be the leader the caucus needs in the next session.\n\nTrump and Vance really don't need that leadership war to reignite, however, especially in the all-important first 100 days while Trump still has electoral momentum. He understands that he might have only the first two years to get his agenda accomplished, and a crippling leadership fight might prevent Trump from any success at all. House Republicans also have a big stake in success, given their barely-there majority and the consequences of failing to deliver when the midterms roll around. \n\nInstead, Trump will try to cut a deal that both parties can live with -- and to do that, Trump has to give Democrats something they claim to want. Hence, Trump is going on both Fox and NBC to offer to end the \"debt ceiling\" fantasy once and for all:\n\nIn a phone interview with NBC News, Trump said getting rid of the debt ceiling entirely would be the “smartest thing [Congress] could do. I would support that entirely.”“The Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge,” Mr. Trump added. Trump suggested that the debt ceiling is a meaningless concept — and that no one knows for sure what would happen if it were to someday be breached — “a catastrophe, or meaningless” — and no one should want to find out. \n\nTo be more accurate, Democrats have mainly wanted to end the debt ceiling when we have Democrat presidents, but at least they're on record at some point for ending this edition of Kabuki theater. Republicans have resisted this consistently, convinced that it gives them leverage in budget negotiations despite winning nothing substantive over debt and deficits in the 20-plus years they've played chicken with it. \n\nOn this point, Trump is entirely correct. Congress authorizes debt when it passes budgets that spend more than the federal government receives in revenue, a gap which has now spread out to $2 trillion a year or so. If the debt ceiling meant anything, Congress would act like it by passing budgets that keep debt within its limits. Instead, they just use it for another food fight while increasing deficit spending anyway, so how exactly is this a \"limit\" in any meaningful sense? Even Congress doesn't act like it limits them in any way. If Congress really wants a debt limit, then they should budget accordingly; otherwise, a budget is a de facto authorization to borrow to get the funds appropriated. \n\nHad Johnson possessed any strategic sense, he would have pared down the additional baggage to get Trump the clean slate he clearly wanted in January. He could have offered up this essentially meaningless concession to get enough Democrats on board to pass a relatively clean CR/omnibus to clear the decks for the incoming administration. Johnson probably could have asked Trump what he actually wanted first, and if Johnson tried that, then he could have gotten Trump to go on record about it early so that his allies in the caucus could plan accordingly. \n\nWill Democrats accept a pared-down CR/omnibus that covers the rest of the year? Maybe or maybe not, but Trump wants that fight now rather than in March or June:\n\nOn the possibility of a shutdown, which would occur at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday if a funding deal isn't reached, he said, “If there’s going to be a shutdown, we’re going to start it with a Democratic president” — suggesting that the fight playing out in Congress now is necessary to clear the decks before his administration begins in January. \n\nExactly. A CR that puts Trump in the middle of a potential shutdown strategy by Democrats isn't a very good deal for Republicans generally, not just for Trump. One might expect a House Speaker to realize that.","url":"https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2024/12/19/trump-to-johnson-if-you-want-to-remain-speaker-n3798041","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/106/33152966-8fce-4101-a082-e0f129f86450.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 00:58:23","author":"Ed Morrissey","authors":["Ed Morrissey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":274695790,"title":"With Viewership Down, MSNBC Offers Joy Reid a Pay Cut","text":"The post-election landscape has been tough on left-leaning news networks.

Texas representative shreds GOP over debt ceiling deal; Trump fires back","text":"Texas Representative Chip Roy has ignited a heated feud within the Republican Party, taking aim at his colleagues and former President Donald Trump over the federal debt ceiling negotiations. Roy’s fiery critique of his party’s fiscal policies and Trump’s retaliatory threats have deepened divisions ahead of critical discussions on the spending bill.In an impassioned tirade, Roy accused his Republican colleagues of abandoning fiscal responsibility, yelling, “You’ve added to the debt since you were given the majority again on November 5th. It’s embarrassing. It’s shameful.”He didn’t stop there, shredding the proposed bill for its $5 trillion increase to the national debt. “Yes, I think this bill is better than it was yesterday in certain respects. But to take this bill yesterday and congratulate yourself because it’s shorter in pages, but increases the debt by $5 trillion is asinine,” he said.— CollinRugg (@CollinRugg) “I am absolutely sickened by a party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility and has the temerity to go forward to the American people and say you think this is fiscally responsible,” Roy continued. “It is absolutely ridiculous.”Roy’s pointed remarks drew a swift and scathing response from Trump, who took to Truth Social to brand the congressman an obstructionist. “The very unpopular ‘Congressman’ from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory — All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself,” Trump wrote.— Rep_Fighter (@Rep_Fighter) Roy said his position on raising the debt limit is “simple.” “I am not going to raise or suspend the debt ceiling (racking up more debt) without significant & real spending cuts attached to it,” Roy said. “I’ve been negotiating to that end.”Trump escalated the feud with a follow-up post threatening to back primary challengers. “Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,” Trump declared. “I hope some talented challengers are getting ready in the Great State of Texas to go after Chip in the Primary. He won’t have a chance!”This time, the president-elect went after Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, who is often aligned with Trump’s policy and political leanings. Roy and his fellow conservatives have been vehemently against any debit limit increases throughout their time in Congress but were blind-sided by Trump’s last-minute ask Wednesday.“The very unpopular ‘Congressman’ from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory - All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself. Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Who is Chip Roy?Roy, 51, represents Texas’ 21st congressional district, covering areas north of San Antonio and a significant portion of Austin. Known for his conservative principles, Roy serves as Policy Chair of the House Freedom Caucus.Born in Bethesda, Maryland, Roy earned degrees in commerce and information systems from the University of Virginia and later graduated from the University of Texas School of Law. Before entering Congress, he was Chief of Staff for Senator Ted Cruz and served as the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas.Roy, married to Carrah Key since 2004, has two children. His estimated net worth is between $500,000 and $2 million, with an annual congressional salary of $174,000.The FalloutRoy’s defiance highlights the ideological rift within the GOP over fiscal policy. While his hardline stance may resonate with conservative voters, Trump’s threats to support primary challengers cast uncertainty over Roy’s political future.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-chip-roy-texas-representative-shreds-gop-over-debt-ceiling-deal-its-embarrassing-and-trump-fires-back/articleshow/116485992.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116486105/116486105.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 00:56:22","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.184},{"id":274696008,"title":"Communities facing air pollution threats worry about EPA rollbacks under Trump","text":"Houston — Donna Thomas is a pollution warrior in Houston, Texas.

It's dangerous,\" Thomas said.To respond to communities like hers, the Environmental Protection Agency under President Biden created a new Office of Environmental Justice.

This marks Trump’s second nomination of an ambassador to the Caribbean region and the first black pick from the administration to date.\n\nWalker is celebrated as a former NFL star and a member of the U.S. bobsled team at the 1992 Winter Olympics, showcasing his diverse athletic career.\n\nDespite his prominence in sports and health advocacy, Walker has no prior diplomatic experience, a trend observed among some of Trump’s past ambassadorial nominees.\n\nWalker previously co-chaired Trump’s Council on Health, Nutrition, and Fitness during his first administration and has been a longtime supporter of the former president.\n\nWalker rose to political prominence in 2022 when Trump endorsed him as the Republican candidate in Georgia’s Senate race. He lost to Democrat Raphael Warnock in a campaign fraught with personal and political scandals.\n\nAllegations surfaced during Walker’s Senate campaign that he had paid for two ex-girlfriends to have abortions, despite his publicly staunch anti-abortion stance. He has denied the allegations.\n\nWalker’s ex-wife accused him of holding a gun to her head and threatening her life, a claim that drew significant attention during his Senate race.\n\nWalker faced backlash for criticizing absentee fathers in Black households, only to later admit he had fathered children he had not publicly disclosed. He has since said he loves and supports all his children.\n\nThroughout his Senate campaign, Walker made several false claims, including that he graduated in the top 1% of his class at the University of Georgia (he did not) and had served in law enforcement (he had not).\n\nAnnouncing Walker’s nomination on his Truth Social platform, Trump lauded him as “an NFL great” and a role model who has served as “an ambassador to our nation’s youth.” Trump expressed confidence that Walker would “put America First” in his new role.\n\nWalker’s nomination will now require Senate confirmation, where his past controversies and lack of experience may face scrutiny.","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/10-fast-facts-about-trumps-bahamas-ambassador-nominee/","image":"https://www.newsamericasnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hershel-walker-1024x683.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 00:53:23","author":"Brandon Bell","authors":["Brandon Bell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"tt","sentiment":0.206},{"id":274695098,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: Dec. 20, 2024","text":"The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News.\n\nTOKYO - The regular Diet session will likely begin on Jan. 24, later than previously envisioned, meaning that the next House of Councillors election will also be pushed back to around July 20, administration officials said Thursday.\n\nThe revised schedule, which is still under consideration, reflects calls from the Komeito party, the junior coalition partner in the government of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, which wants to limit the negative impact of back-to-back elections on voters, the officials said.\n\nTOKYO - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is willing to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in mid-January before his return to the White House, a Japanese government source said Thursday.\n\nJapan is looking at the feasibility of such a meeting after it received the message from the Trump side, the source added.\n\nJapan's core consumer prices in Nov. rise 2.7% on year\n\nTOKYO - Japan's core consumer prices in November rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier, government data showed Friday.\n\nThe increase in the nationwide core consumer price index, excluding volatile fresh food, followed a 2.3 percent rise in October.

He stopped short of providing a breakdown of how many North Korean soldiers had been killed and wounded.\n\nTOKYO - The Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged Thursday in a move widely expected by the market due to a lack of clarity over wage trends at home and caution over the outlook for the U.S. economy under incoming President Donald Trump.\n\nThe central bank decided to keep its key short-term rate on hold at around 0.25 percent at the end of a two-day policy meeting.

Here's What We Know","text":"What's NewRight-wing commentator Nick Fuentes revealed that someone tried to assassinate him earlier this week when an armed individual targeted him in his home.Why It MattersFuentes made headlines the night of the 2024 U.S. election after Donald Trump secured a second term. In response, Fuentes went online and declared there will \"never, ever be a female president\" in the United States and that it was \"your body, my choice. Forever.\"Fuentes, 26, is a white nationalist podcaster known for a long history of misogynistic and antisemitic remarks. He hosts the America First show and works with a wide range of right-wing pundits, such as Laura Loomer.He also played a significant role in helping Trump secure the \"bro vote\" through his show, which receives upwards of 100,000 views on the site Rumble. Trump ended up increasing his share among young men in the election.Fuentes's election night video, however, struck a nerve among leftists, who ended up leaking his home address online. He did not confirm if his address was actually leaked, but he did repost a video from conservative media giant Candace Owens who said she had heard about Fuentes pepper-spraying a woman who showed up at his home.What To KnowFuentes revealed the startling episode in a post on social media platform X on Thursday, revealing video of the alleged would-be assassin on his front porch.The assailant approached his front door with a pistol and what seemed to be a crossbow while Fuentes was livestreaming.After putting down the crossbow, the assailant rings the doorbell, tries his door, then yells \"Yo Nick!\"Fuentes in his initial post claimed that the assailant carried \"incendiary devices\" and that he believed the man \"intended to kill me.\"\"According to police, the would-be assassin committed a triple homicide in southern Illinois early yesterday before he arrived at my doorstep with his pistol drawn, calling my name,\" Fuentes wrote. \"I am grateful to God that I am still alive today.\"Fuentes also wrote that the assailant \"is now dead. I am okay!\"Fuentes said the assailant broke into his neighbor's home to evade police and killed two of their dogs in the confusion. Fuentes called the incident \"heartbreaking,\" but he said that it \"could have been so unimaginably worse. God have mercy.\"\"Doxing is not a game. This nihilistic lynch mob behavior must end before anyone else is killed,\" Fuentes wrote.What People Are SayingThe posts about the near-attack generated thousands of interactions: The initial post has over 3,6000 comments, 6,500 shares and 43,000 likes. Subsequent posts in the same chain each had between 12,000 and 16,000 likes and around 1,000 shares.Fans offered their own homes as potential alternate broadcasting sites \"free of charge.\"Others took aim at Fuentes asking for donations, with one asking, \"You're already wealthy, why are you begging for money?\"A smaller group focused on the claim that Fuentes was banned from banking services, demanding action be taken to get him \"unbanned\" while calling any such ban \"unamerican\" as a potential breach of free speech.What Happens Next\"I will now have to uproot my life and relocate,\" Fuentes wrote. \"While I can handle whatever comes to my front door, it is irresponsible to expect my neighbors with young families to share that burden.\"\"In the meantime I will have to contract 24 hour security to protect myself and my property,\" he added, appealing to his followers to \"contribute to defray the cost\" of private security, which he claimed would cost $13,000 per week. The money would also go towards rebuilding his studio.However, Fuentes said he could \"only accept cryptocurrency because I am banned from banking services and CC processing. Thank you.\"It is not clear why he is banned from banking services, as he did not elaborate on this point.","summary":"Right-wing commentator Nick Fuentes claimed that a would-be assassin showed up at his doorstep on Wednesday with a gun and crossbow.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/white-nationalist-nick-fuentes-assassination-attempt-chicago-home-2003882","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2548599/nick-fuentes-donald-trump-rally.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 00:41:46","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.386},{"id":274693822,"title":"Bitcoin sinks below US$100 000","text":"Bitcoin sank below US$100 000 as part of a wider retreat in speculative investments after the Federal Reserve signalled greater caution about the scope for future interest-rate reductions.\n\nThe digital asset fell about 1 percent to US$99 800 as of 10am yesterday in Singapore. That followed a 5,1 percent drop on Wednesday, the biggest retreat since September.

A spat over a funding bill added to nerves by raising the risk of a partial US government shutdown. US equity futures wavered yesterday. Bitcoin is up 50 percent since the November 5 election and hit a record high of US$108 316 earlier this week, buoyed by President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to unfetter crypto in the US from regulatory shackles. \n\nThe Republican has also backed the idea of creating a national strategic stockpile of the largest digital asset.\n\n“All signs point to a good floor and outlook for Bitcoin” even if some traders were disappointed about the Fed meeting and took profits, said Paul Veradittakit, a managing partner at Pantera Capital.\n\nTrump’s embrace of crypto has overshadowed warnings about stretched momentum and the lack of any traditional valuation tethers. President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration imposed a clampdown on the industry in the wake of a deep market rout in 2022 that exposed risky practices and fraud. —

spoken.\n\nOK, Elon: What’s your legislative strategy now?\n\nBecause everyone advising President-elect Donald Trump needs to be figuring out the plan come Jan. 20 for turning this country around. \n\nWas torpedoing this bill a plus for that agenda?\n\nYes, the CR was awful, and it’s looking like Speaker Mike Johnson has been able to come up with something cleaner — one that even includes the debt-limit-extension that President-elect Donald Trump added as a late demand.\n\nWhether that will pass the House is still up in the air, though — let alone the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nDems are the ones who insisted on all the garbage in the first place, after all.\n\nWe’re not particularly worried about a “government shutdown” here: Uncle Sam’s essential services will keep working even if this doesn’t get resolved for weeks.\n\nBut a standoff prolonged into next year will gum up the start of the actual Trump administration, and potentially sideline whatever the new team wants Congress to do in its early months.\n\nAnd that’s what the braintrust down in Mar-a-Lago needs to prioritize right now: Getting its people into place with plans for major reform — plus policies that can immediately spur economic growth and counter the inflation still programmed in by the Biden team.\n\nDespite a paper-thin House majority, Republicans need to use their control of the White House and Congress to deliver for the American people in time for the 2026 midterm elections — not least so they can increase their House ranks, rather than see Dems take control and block the GOP agenda.\n\nThat’s going to require firm and steady leadership — not grenade-throwing or pointless posturing about the sausage factory.\n\nJohnson’s done a tremendous job as speaker, herding the cats of the Republican caucus (you try needing Marjorie Taylor Greene on every vote!) even as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has done his best to divide the GOP — and to push an entire year’s worth of work on funding the federal government into the final days before Christmas so he could get another CR monster.\n\nBigfooting the speaker may have worked out this time, but it shouldn’t have to come to that — Johnson’s not to blame for any failure of communications.\n\nTeam Trump’s mission is to bring a new dawn in America. \n\nSometimes, making that happen will mean Elon Musk needs to keep it in his pants.","summary":"“VOX POPULI, VOX DEI,” cheered Elon Musk after the Continuing Resolution he’d spent all Wednesday trashing became a dead letter: Basically, the voice of the people has

fiscal sanity — but it’s just a start","text":"It feels like 2013 again. \n\nBack then, a beleaguered Republican speaker of the House was forced into a government shutdown by firebrands in his caucus who considered him insufficiently pure. \n\nA revolution in GOP politics has happened since, and yet a beleaguered Republican speaker of the House has been forced to the verge of a government shutdown by firebrands in his caucus who consider him insufficiently pure. \n\nThe difference is that Mike Johnson — unlike his predecessor, John Boehner — isn’t just dealing with an internal revolt in his caucus.\n\nHe also had the single most powerful Republican politician on the planet and his extremely influential sidekick turning against his handiwork, namely, Donald Trump and Elon Musk respectively. \n\nJohnson did make a misstep with the so-called continuing resolution to keep the government funded past a looming deadline.\n\nHe added Republican priorities, and then, to placate the Democrats who control the Senate and the White House, added Democratic priorities.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a stopgap measure to avoid a government shutdown became a vehicle to pass new legislation in a last-minute, 1,500-page bill that no one was going to read. \n\nThe yet-to-be-resolved episode shows that Republican hostility to spending still exists a decade after Tea Party Republicans roiled the establishment — and made John Boehner’s life miserable — demanding massive deficit reduction. \n\nNow, though, this reflex has taken a new form.\n\nIt is expressed in fierce opposition to “the swamp” — in this case, business-as-usual logrolling in Congress — and excitement about the prospects for Musk’s DOGE, the new Department of Government Efficiency. \n\nThe bipartisan agreement in Washington, DC, to perpetually spend more money is indeed disgraceful, and DOGE could be a welcome force for new thinking and change.\n\nYet, both of these are really beside the point when considering the avalanche of federal red ink that one day — probably not tomorrow and maybe not even several years from now — could cause a horrendous fiscal crisis.\n\nThere are idiotic programs and senseless regulations aplenty, but the money that can be found in the federal couch cushions is relatively minimal.\n\nMost federal spending has strong public backing, and so a $6.8 trillion budget that looks like a juicy target is very hard to bring under control. \n\nThe math is as inexorable and brutal as ever.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare, together with veteran’s benefits and other health programs, account for more than half of the budget. One of Trump’s signature promises, of course, is not to touch Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThen, interest on the debt and defense spending take up about another $2 trillion. \n\nWhat’s left is, in the scheme of things, a pittance — and even programs in this category have their constituencies. \n\nIf the budget is ever to be put on a more rational basis, there is no substitute for making a public case for a serious reform agenda that includes entitlements like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThis is a politically perilous project, which is why the Republican Party abandoned it years ago. How much easier and more satisfying it is to tank flagrantly absurd end-of-year spending bills and to put extravagant hopes in DOGE. \n\nIt is telling what else was happening in Washington while Mike Johnson’s first continuing resolution went down in flames.\n\nThe Senate passed on a bipartisan basis the Social Security Fairness Act that will cost roughly $200 billion over 10 years.\n\nIt didn’t matter that the legislation is a poorly designed giveaway to public employees that experts across the political spectrum think is a bad idea. \n\nDOGE will be hard-pressed just to claw that money back.\n\nMusk and Vivek Ramaswamy have talked about cutting a swath of federal workers. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2022, the federal government employed 2.3 million civilians at a cost of $271 billion.\n\nIf you can cut 10% of those employees, which would be a stunning accomplishment, you might have covered the 10-year cost of the Social Security Fairness Act, but are still basically treading fiscal water. \n\nIt points to another similarity with 2013: All the drama and chaos is unlikely to fundamentally alter our dreadful fiscal trajectory. \n\nTwitter: @RichLowry","summary":"The house has yet to pass a budget after Speaker Johnson's first proposal was heavily criticized by President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/opinion/gops-budget-revolt-signals-fiscal-sanity-but-just-a-start/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/speaker-house-mike-johnson-r-95619862.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 00:36:56","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":274694980,"title":"Trump-backed funding bill to avert government shutdown fails in House","text":"Trump-backed funding bill to avert government shutdown fails in House\n The House Thursday voted against a government spending bill backed by President-elect Donald Trump.

He also has been a vocal critic of measures to prevent the spread of COVID and even has questioned the validity of using vaccines, as well. He was appointed to his position by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2021.\n\nLadapo and a researcher from the University of Florida spoke with the council, which also heard public comments before its five members voted on the matter.\n\nPutting fluoride in public drinking water creates a risk of neurological problems for young children and pregnant women, including attention deficit and behavioral problem, Ladapo said.\n\n\"I don't understand why anyone who can read and, therefore, can read the studies is still defending it,\" Ladapo said of the practice of putting fluoride in public drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor also questioned the practice of fluoridating the city's water supply, which he said forces residents to ingest fluoride that is available in other ways for those who want it.\n\nThose who accidentally ingest toothpaste containing fluoride are supposed to seek medical help or immediately call a poison control center, Mayor Walter Price told the council.\n\n\"So why are we putting that in our water?\" he asked the council.\n\nCouncil member Troy Singer likened fluoridated water to forcing people to take medication.\n\n\"They are being medicated [and] not through their own desires,\" Singer said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has set a maximum of 0.7 mg of fluoride per liter of drinking water, but Ladapo cited a document showing many children have suffered lower IQs due to consuming drinking water containing more than double that amount.\n\nLadapo said putting fluoride in public drinking water does help teeth, but the extent to which it helps is questionable.\n\nPeople who want to benefit from fluoride can use toothpaste that contains it, he said.\n\nThe council earlier in December heard from health professionals who support fluoridation of public water supplies.\n\n\"You're receiving at least 25% cavity reductions,\" dentist Johnny Johnson Jr. previously told the council, Spectrum News reported.\n\nHe said ending water fluoridation would affect a \"silent majority\" of people who are impoverished and would be most vulnerable to dental problems afterward.\n\nDuring Wednesday's council meeting, endodontist Maria Claus said she is a root canal specialist who sees many patients who experience pain due to deep-seated tooth decay.\n\nClaus expressed her support for continued water fluoridation.\n\nFluoridated water is one of the many issues Robert Kennedy Jr. previously said he wants to address after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\nKennedy is Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and said the federal department immediately will recommend ending water fluoridation at the state and local levels.\n\nHe said a federal judge on Oct. 4 ruled the Environmental Protection Agency hasn't conducted health and safety studies regarding the effects of putting fluoride in public drinking water.\n\nKennedy also cited Austria and Germany's removal of fluoride from public water supplies and how those nations did so without experiencing increased cavity rates among their respective populations.","summary":"City leaders in Tavares, Fla., on Wednesday approved removing fluoride from the city's water supply.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/12/19/tavares-florida-fluoride-drinking-water/4031734649846/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4031734649846/2024/upi/9d57faeccc6ea533bb14557d41d25ce1/v1.2/As-fluoridation-becomes-topic-in-DC-town-in-Florida-votes-to-remove-it.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 00:28:11","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":274693034,"title":"House Rejects Trump-Endorsed Backup Plan To Prevent Government Shutdown And Suspend Debt Limit: Lawmakers Chant 'Hell No'","text":"On Thursday, the House turned down a contingency plan proposed by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) aimed at averting a government shutdown and suspending the debt limit.\n\nWhat Happened: Johnson’s measure, introduced only hours before the vote, failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority for approval, receiving a 174-235-1 vote, reported The Hill. The bill encountered opposition from Democrats, led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), along with a few conservative Republicans, mainly due to its inclusion of a two-year debt limit suspension, a provision requested by President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe future course of action for Johnson remains uncertain. With the Republican opposition, the bill is unlikely to pass if Johnson tries to push it through a regular rule process that only requires a simple majority.\n\nIf no legislation is approved by Congress by 11:59 p.m. on Friday, the government will face a shutdown. This failed vote is a setback for Johnson, who is striving to prevent a shutdown by the impending deadline and retain his leadership position in the coming year.\n\nThe proposed bill would have maintained the government funding at existing levels through March 14, suspended the debt limit for two years, and allocated approximately $100 billion in disaster relief and about $10 billion for farmer economic assistance.\n\nDespite President-elect Trump’s endorsement of the package, a few Republicans promptly rejected the legislation. Democrats also overwhelmingly opposed the bill, with lawmakers reportedly chanting “hell no” during a closed-door House Democratic Caucus meeting after the bill’s introduction.\n\nWhy It Matters: Earlier, U.S. Congressional leaders had reached a bipartisan agreement to extend government funding and avert a shutdown. However, this agreement was rejected by House Republicans under pressure from President-elect Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, leading to the current situation. Ramaswamy and Musk are the leaders of the Department of Government Efficiency, a body whose task it is to cut wasteful government spending.\n\nTrump’s unexpected dismissal of the bipartisan proposal has escalated the fears of a U.S. government shutdown ahead of Christmas. However, research firm Edward Jones suggests that markets tend to remain positive half the times during past government shutdowns since 1976, despite the short-term volatility introduced by such political events.\n\nHouse Mike Johnson.

It ruled that either Willis or the other lawyer, Nathan Wade, had to stop working on the case. \n\nBut an appeals court has now found that didn't solve the problem, and disqualified Willis from the case too.\n\nWhat's the case about?\n\nFani Willis accused Donald Trump and 18 of his advisers and allies of illegally trying to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 election win in the state of Georgia.\n\nShe was prosecuting them under the state's racketeering law, known as RICO. The law is commonly used to prosecute outlaw gangs. \n\nWillis was essentially accusing Trump and his team — including lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former White House aide Mark Meadows — of running a criminal enterprise. \n\nIn charging documents, she pointed to Trump's phone call to Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump asked Raffensperger to \"find\" enough votes to give him the state.\n\nIt also points to the team of so-called \"fake electors\", organised by Trump's team to allegedly misrepresent how the state voted at the January 6 certification of results in Congress.\n\nOther allegations relate to conspiracy theories spread about false results, intimidation of election workers, filing false documents, and recruiting Justice Department officials and former vice-president Mike Pence to the scheme. \n\nFour of Trump's 18 co-accused have already pleaded guilty to lesser charges.\n\nWhy would a relationship between lawyers affect the case?\n\nFani Willis hired Nathan Wade in November, 2021, to lead the investigation that led to Trump and his allies being charged.\n\nAbout a year later, they began taking holidays together, and Wade spent thousands of dollars on cruises, resort accommodation, winery visits and other expenses for them both. (Willis argued she paid at least some of this back.)\n\nThe court ruling in March said this created \"the possibility and appearance that the district attorney benefited — albeit non-materially — from a contract whose award lay solely within her purview and policing\".\n\nIt found the fact they weren't transparent about the relationship made matters worse.\n\n\"As the case moves forward, reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued resulting in some form of benefit to the district attorney.\"\n\nThe court said either Wade or Willis needed to step aside, to remove any perceptions of a conflict of interest.\n\nBut Trump and his allies took the matter to an appeals court, arguing for stronger action against Willis and her case.\n\nAnd the appeals court gave Trump a win, ruling the lower court \"erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office\".\n\n\"While we recognise that an appearance of impropriety generally is not enough to support disqualification, this is the rare case in which disqualification is mandated and no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings,\" the appeals court found.\n\nWhat happens to the case now?\n\nWhatever happens next, any prosecution of Trump is highly unlikely to go ahead during his term as president. \n\nTrump and his co-defendants had asked the Georgia appeals court to dismiss the case completely, but it did not go that far.\n\nThat means it could be assigned to another prosecutor.\n\nTrump told Fox News it should \"not be allowed to go any further\" and \"everybody should receive an apology, including those wonderful patriots who have been caught up in this for years\".\n\nWillis's office has meanwhile filed paperwork to appeal to the state's Supreme Court. So there's still a chance she could pursue it.\n\nWhat about Trump's other cases?\n\nThis is the last ongoing criminal case against Trump.\n\nAfter his election win, the Justice Department abandoned two other cases against him — one relating to election interference, and another over the handling of classified documents.\n\nTrump was found guilty in a so-called \"hush money\" case in May. But sentencing is indefinitely on hold, as he prepares to assume the presidency on January 20.","summary":"Lawyers for Trump successfully argued Fani Willis, a Democrat district attorney in Georgia, should be disqualified from the case after she had a relationship with a lawyer she hired to lead it.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-20/fani-willis-disqualified-donald-trump-election-rico-case/104749764","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d3c8a7713958760207f3421fdc57b1cb?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=150&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-20 00:22:09","author":"Brad Ryan","authors":["Brad Ryan"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.603}]}
