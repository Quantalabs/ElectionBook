Rahman had sought Pakistani citizenship in 2008 after completing the legal requirements. The ruling prevents their deportation until further orders, while notices have been issued to the Interior Ministry, the Immigration Department, and the Federal Investigation Agency.\nAlso Read | Leticia Paul, 22-Year-Old Lawyer in Brazil, Dies of Anaphylactic Shock After Allergic Reaction to Contrast Agent During CT Scan.\nThe order comes at a time when Pakistan is moving ahead with its \"Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan,\" under which Afghan refugees holding PoR cards that expired on June 30 were directed to leave voluntarily between August 4 and August 31. Deportations are set to begin from September 1, raising fears among refugees and rights groups.\nHuman rights bodies and the UNHCR have voiced concern that forced returns could violate the principle of non-refoulement. Rights advocates warn that such measures will deeply impact Afghan families who have lived in Pakistan for decades and built strong community ties. While the IHC's decision provides a reprieve to a small group, it underscores the broader uncertainty faced by over a million PoR cardholders who remain vulnerable to expulsion.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Says There Seems to Be 'Purge or Revolution' in South Korea Ahead of Summit With New President Lee Jae Myung.\nIn parallel with the court proceedings, authorities have intensified enforcement. Police in Peshawar, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have been conducting coordinated operations to identify undocumented Afghan migrants. According to Khaama Press, a significant number of migrants have been detained in recent days, with officials also claiming to have seized weapons and narcotics. The operations, carried out in areas including Kacha Garhi, Nasir Bagh, and Regi, are part of a wider crackdown on Afghans without valid documents.\nReports further indicate that Pakistan's campaign has accelerated in recent months, with arrests and deportations often involving house-to-house searches. The suspension of visa renewals for Afghan nationals for over a month has compounded the problem, leaving many previously legal residents undocumented and at risk of removal.\nAdding to these measures, the federal government announced on August 13 the formation of a special committee comprising police and intelligence officials to track and repatriate Afghans holding PoR cards. This committee has been tasked with gathering and sharing data across agencies to facilitate enforcement actions.\nMeanwhile, the UNHCR has expressed concern that Pakistan's stringent policies have left thousands of Afghans homeless, with many alleging threats, coercion, and mistreatment by law enforcement agencies. Rights advocates caution that the continuation of such actions risks deepening an already severe humanitarian crisis, forcing vulnerable Afghan families into greater displacement, loss of livelihood, and insecurity.

We have incredible cards,” he told reporters before his meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. “But I don’t want to play those cards. If I did, that would destroy China. I’m not going to play those cards.”— ANI (@ANI) Trump added he had recently spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping and was considering travelling to Beijing. “At some point, probably during this year or shortly thereafter, we'll go to China,” he said, adding that Xi had extended the invitation.Despite the sharp warning, Trump insisted Washington would maintain a working relationship with Beijing. “We are going to have a great relationship with China... They have some cards. We have incredible cards, but I don’t want to play those cards. If I play those cards, that would destroy China. I am not going to play those cards,” he said.Live EventsTrade truce extendedHis remarks came shortly after the United States and China agreed on 12 August to prolong their trade truce for another 90 days. The pause is intended to give negotiators more time to address disputes that have stretched over the past year.Since April, the White House has repeatedly raised duties on Chinese imports, with the highest tariff peaking at 145 per cent. Most goods from China currently face a 30 per cent duty. Beijing responded with a 10 per cent levy on US imports, according to Fox News.Rare earths and oil suppliesTensions have also spread beyond tariffs. Trump singled out China’s rare earths policy, warning that unless Beijing continued to supply the US with magnets, “we have to charge them 200% tariff or something,” Reuters reported. China tightened restrictions on rare earth exports in April, using them as part of its retaliation.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also flagged China’s oil trade with sanctioned states as a major issue. Speaking during negotiations in Sweden, he identified Beijing’s imports of Iranian and Russian oil as a central dispute. Washington argues that such purchases provide financial lifelines to Tehran and Moscow, enabling destabilising activities.Bessent has urged Beijing to reduce reliance on exports and open itself more as an importer in the global economy. At the same time, Washington has made clear it wants to curb China’s role as the world’s dominant manufacturing hub.Executive orders on tariffsThe extended suspension of tariffs follows a series of executive orders signed by Trump this year.On 2 April, through Executive Order 14257, Trump declared that large and persistent annual US trade deficits with China “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.” The order imposed new ad valorem duties. Later in April, Executive Orders 14259 and 14266 further raised tariffs after Beijing retaliated.In May, Trump issued Executive Order 14298, temporarily suspending additional tariffs for 90 days and replacing them with a revised duty rate. That suspension was due to expire on 12 August.Earlier this month, Trump signed a new order extending the pause until 10 November. According to the order, “the PRC continues to take significant steps toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and addressing the concerns of the United States relating to economic and national security matters.”The directive requires the Commerce Secretary, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the US Trade Representative, along with other top officials, to ensure the suspension is properly enforced. The order also clarifies that it “is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit... enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States.”Trump’s comments underline the dual approach of pressure and restraint. On one hand, Washington continues to raise tariffs and challenge China’s trade practices. On the other, the president insists he will not take steps that would cripple Beijing, repeating his line that America and China will maintain a “great relationship.”(With inputs from ANI)(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump China relationsChina tariffsrare earths policyUS executive orders tariffsBeijing US negotiationsXi Jinping invitationUS trade deficitChina oil importsSouth Korea President meeting\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

He said the cartel raked in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and admitted that people working for him paid bribes to Mexican police and military commanders “so they could operate freely.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi flew to New York to herald Zambada’s guilty plea as a “landmark victory,\" telling reporters at a news conference that he “will die in a U.S. federal prison, where he belongs.”\n\n“This guy, ‘El Mayo,’ was living like a king,” Bondi said. ”Now he’s living like a criminal for the rest of his life.”\n\nBondi’s visit to Brooklyn underscored President Donald Trump’s anti-cartel crusade. His administration has declared drug cartels to be terrorist organizations, positioned military assets off Venezuela and compelled the Mexican government to hand over several dozen high-ranking cartel officials for prosecution.\n\nThe kingpin's legacy\n\nSought by U.S. law enforcement for more than two decades, Zambada was arrested in Texas last year, at the end of the Biden administration, when the drug lord arrived in a private plane with one of Guzmán’s sons, Joaquín Guzmán López. Zambada says he was kidnapped in Mexico and taken against his will to the U.S.\n\nHis arrest, along with that of Guzmán López, touched off deadly fighting in his home state of Sinaloa between rival cartel factions, pitting his loyalists against backers of Guzmán’s sons, dubbed the Chapitos, or “little Chapos.”\n\nConsidered a good negotiator, Zambada was seen as the cartel’s strategist and dealmaker who was more involved in its day-to-day doings than the flamboyant Guzmán. Prosecutors have said Zambada was enmeshed in the group’s violence, at one point ordering the murder of his own nephew.\n\nIn the Sinaloan capital of Culiacan, dead bodies lie in streets or sometimes appear hanging from highway underpasses. Businesses shutter early because people don’t want to be out after dark. Schools grind to a halt during sudden bursts of conflict. People ranging from social media influencers to animal caregivers have been touched by the bloodshed.\n\nProsecutors promised not to seek the death penalty\n\nZambada's plea came two weeks after prosecutors said they wouldn’t seek the death penalty.\n\nHis lawyer, Frank Perez, stressed after court that the plea agreement doesn’t obligate Zambada to cooperate with government investigators. The attorney said his client never really wanted to go to trial, and that once the death penalty was off the table, his “focus shifted to accepting responsibility and moving forward.\"\n\nBondi noted Mexico’s opposition to the death penalty, which is a factor in its willingness to extradite suspects to the U.S. Although Zambada wasn’t extradited, she alluded to the nations’ understanding that “we cannot seek the death penalty” for those who are.\n\nZambada is due to be sentenced Jan. 13 to life in prison. He also faces billions of dollars in financial penalties.\n\nZambada describes his drug trade\n\nZambada appeared momentarily unsteady as he arrived in court; a marshal grabbed his arm to direct him to his seat.\n\nAs Judge Brian M.

Maybe we will apply additional pressure, or maybe we feel like we are making progress, and we will dial that pressure back,\" he said.\nOn Russia-Ukraine negotiations and guarantees for Ukraine, the Vice President underlined Washington's commitments.\n\"It is providing the Ukrainians the kind of security guarantees that ensure the country is not going to be invaded again.

As you know, the Europe deal is the biggest deal ever made. I think it's the biggest deal ever made, period. And, they pay us $950 billion coming into this country and lots of other things.

I felt so foolish for years watching this take place. You know, we did it in my first term with China.

I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that I don't think we even need that, but uh, if we need that I'm sure Congress will go along. You know that was the name when we won WW1, we WW2, we won everything. To me, seems like a much more appropriate... The other is defense is too defensive.

Lawmakers are trying to guide an investigation into who among Epstein's high-powered social circle may have been aware of his sexual abuse of teenage girls, delving into a criminal case that has spurred conspiracy theories and roiled top officials in President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nThe subpoena, signed by Rep. James Comer, the Republican chair of the oversight committee, and dated Monday, demands that Epstein's estate provide Congress with documents including a book that was compiled with notes from friends for his 50th birthday, his last will and testament, agreements he signed with prosecutors, his contact books, and his financial transactions and holdings.\n\nComer wrote to the executors of Epstein's estate that the committee “is reviewing the possible mismanagement of the federal government’s investigation of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell, the circumstances and subsequent investigations of Mr. Epstein’s death, the operation of sex-trafficking rings and ways for the federal government to effectively combat them, and potential violations of ethics rules related to elected officials.”\n\nThe Justice Department, trying to distance Trump and Epstein, last week began handing over to lawmakers documentation of the federal investigation into Epstein.

Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week.\n\nPulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.\n\nThe announcement came days after Cook said she wouldn't leave her post despite Trump previously calling for her to resign. The Fed's board has seven members, meaning Trump's move could have deep economic and political ramifications.\n\nTrump said in announcing the move that he had the constitutional authority to remove Cook, but doing so will raise questions about control of the Fed as an independent entity.\n\nThe firing is likely to touch off a legal battle and Cook could be allowed to remain in her seat while the case plays out. Cook would have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.\n\nIt is the latest effort by the administration to take control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.\n\nForcing Cook off the Fed's governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.","summary":"Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is firing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.","url":"https://abc7chicago.com/post/president-donald-trump-fires-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook-opening-new-front-fight-control-central-bank/17647658/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17647664_082525-wls-ap-lisa-cook-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 00:51:02","author":"Chris Rugaber","authors":["Chris Rugaber"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":354278626,"title":"World News | Trump Highlights Role in Inter-Korean Relations, Recalls 2018 Winter Olympics","text":"Washington DC [US], August 26 (ANI): In a bilateral meeting with the President of the Republic of Korea, US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) highlighted his engagement with North Korea and the progress made in inter-Korean relations.\nTrump said, \"Kim Jong Un and I have a very good relationship...

Then I received a call from North Korea, stating they wanted to participate in the Olympics and actually field teams... Immediately, after that, you started selling tickets and it turned out to be a tremendous success...\"\nTrump highlighted that this success was acknowledged by former South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who credited him with playing a key role in making the 2018 Winter Olympic Games a triumph.

Might as well say it.\"\nHe added, \"It's a little hard to sell tickets when you think you're going to be nuked.\" CNN reported that these remarks came during a 2018 rally in Pennsylvania.\nSpeaking at the same rally, Trump also praised South Korea for doing \"a great job\" with the Olympic Games and highlighted the demonstration of unity between North and South Korea. \"It was great to see North Korea going and participating,\" Trump said. \"And there was a nice unity. It was really a nice thing,\" CNN noted.\nEarlier, Trump and South Korea had announced that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had made a direct overture for talks between leaders of all three countries, a move seen as a potentially significant development in the ongoing nuclear standoff in the region, CNN reported.

Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week.\n\nPulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.\n\nThe announcement came days after Cook said she wouldn’t leave her post despite Trump previously calling for her to resign. The Fed's board has seven members, meaning Trump's move could have deep economic and political ramifications.\n\nTrump said in announcing the move that he had the constitutional authority to remove Cook, but doing so will raise questions about control of the Fed as an independent entity.\n\nThe firing is likely to touch off a legal battle and Cook could be allowed to remain in her seat while the case plays out. Cook would have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.\n\nIt is the latest effort by the administration to take control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.\n\nForcing Cook off the Fed’s governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.","summary":"President Donald Trump fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook late Monday, a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics.\n\nTrump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is firi...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/568598/Trump-fires-Fed-Governor-Lisa-Cook-opening-new-front-in-fight-for-control-over-central-bank","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/cp/2025/8/662e4ab3665df21e44e0b483a1e2b36102bcb8c06c6133a999fd95eff34ffd35.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 00:50:00","author":"Chris Rugaber, The Associated Press - Aug 25, 2025 / 5:50 Pm | Story: 568598","authors":["Chris Rugaber, The Associated Press - Aug 25, 2025 / 5:50 Pm | Story: 568598"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":354275754,"title":"Trump says he's removing Fed Governor Lisa Cook, cites mortgage fraud allegations","text":"President Donald Trump on Monday fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, according to a letter on his Truth Social, an unprecedented move and a significant escalation of his attacks on the independence of the U.S. central bank.\n\n\"Pursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution of the United States and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, you are hereby removed from your position on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, effective immediately,\" Trump wrote.\n\nCNBC reached out to the Federal Reserve for comment.\n\nTrump's move pushes the Federal Reserve into unchartered territory and will likely lead to a legal clash that could wind up at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Trump administration claims that Cook, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden in 2022, committed mortgage fraud by allegedly naming two different properties as her primary residence at the same time.\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, an outspoken critic of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, publicly accused Cook of mortgage fraud on Aug. 20 and sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department. \n\nTrump cites the criminal referral in his letter and said that \"there is sufficient reason to believe you have made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements.\" \n\n\"For example, as detailed in the Criminal Referral, you signed one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be your primary residence for the next year,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Two weeks later, you signed another document for a property in Georgia stating that it would be your primary residence for the next year,\" he continued. \n\nTrump claimed that it is \"inconceivable\" that Cook was \"not aware of [her] first commitment when making the second.\"\n\nAfter Pulte's claims started to circulate last week, Trump quickly called for Cook's resignation, writing in a social media post that \"Cook must resign, now!!!\"\n\nCook said in a statement the same day that she has \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"\n\nTwo days later, Trump said he would fire Cook if she did not resign.\n\n\"What she did was bad,\" Trump told reporters on Aug. 22.\n\nPulte applauded Trump's move and thanked his \"commitment to stopping mortgage fraud and following the law\" in a post on X. \n\nTrump's firing will likely trigger a legal showdown. The Supreme Court could get involved if a judge allows Cook to continue serving in her role while legal proceedings play out. \n\nCongress curbed the president's authority to unilaterally fire a Fed governor in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which states that president can only do so \"for cause.\" While the law does not elaborate on what constitutes \"cause,\" it has historically been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.","summary":"President Donald Trump's removal of a Federal Reserve governor could end up being challenged at the Supreme Court.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/25/trump-fires-lisa-cook-fed-powell.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108188561-1755700322985-gettyimages-2221374277-AFP_63TK8WK.jpeg?v=1755721085","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 00:45:32","author":"Erin Doherty","authors":["Erin Doherty"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":354276934,"title":"EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy reveals she only did her weight loss DVDs for the money and declares 'this is the size I'm meant to be'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Aug 26th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs a mystery girlfriend helping the fugitive father who's been hiding out in the New Zealand wilderness with his three children for FOUR YEARS?\n\n'She's never here': Three homes Deputy PM Rayner accused of neglecting her constituency address as 70ft trees overshadow neighbours\n\nThe moment of madness that got architect struck off just days after qualifying following five years of training\n\nI lost nine stone on Mounjaro but then I was hit with this disfiguring side-effect I'd never heard of... and doctors say it's now on the rise\n\nI lost my best friend... to God.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:14 BST, 26 August 2025 |Updated:01:44 BST, 26 August 2025 \n\nNatalie Cassidy has revealed that she only did her weight loss DVDs for the cash as she got candid about her body image. \nThe actress, 41, is best known for her role as the trumpet playing Sonia Fowler in EastEnders.\nNatalie has been the face of two different workout videos, Then & Now and The Perfect Ten, and she has revealed in recent years she was paid £100,000 to lose the weight for the films.\nNow, speaking to Radio Times, Natalie has shared that the DVD was 'not a good move for' and admitted she only did it for the cash. \nShe said: 'The DVD wasn't a good move for me – I did it for the money. I'm now 42, and to be honest, I could be doing a bit more exercise at the moment, but I just can't be bothered. \n'I think, 'If this is the size I'm meant to be, then I need to be happy with that'.'\n\nNatalie Cassidy has revealed that she only did her weight loss DVDs for the cash as she got candid about her body image to Radio Times \n\nNatalie said: 'The DVD wasn't a good move for me – I did it for the money. I'm now 42, and to be honest, I could be doing a bit more exercise at the moment, but I just can't be bothered' (Seen in July)\nNatalie added: 'I don't overeat. I enjoy my food. I like a glass of wine. I like a packet of crisps, but you can't do it every day. \n'I think everything in moderation. If I go the other way and want to lose a lot of weight, my days aren't as good.'\nIt comes after Natalie appeared to be in the shape of her life while showcasing her slender frame during a lavish family holiday to Crete earlier this month. \nShe took to Instagram to share a glimpse of her latest trip. \nNatalie looked incredible as she sunbathed in a green and cream two piece bikini during the idyllic summer break. \nIn another snap, the actress can be seen enjoying some personal time in the pool with her fiancé, cameraman Marc Humphreys.\nShe appeared to be in top spirits during her sunny trip as she shared a smiley selfie while wearing a pair of tinted sunglasses and a white beach dress. \nNatalie appeared smitten in her post as she lovingly gazed at Marc while they enjoyed an Aperol Spritz.\n\nNatalie added: 'I don't overeat. I enjoy my food. I like a glass of wine. I like a packet of crisps, but you can't do it every day'\n\nNatalie has been the face of two different workout videos, Then & Now and The Perfect Ten, and she has revealed in recent years she was paid £100,000 to lose the weight for the films\nAlongside her album, she penned: ' Crete. 10 days of pure family time. UNO, clear seas, gorgeous people and beautiful food. \n'I love you all so much and feel so blessed. NOT AN AD AT ALL NO DISCOUNTS NO NOTHING but thank you to @_oliverstravels_ as the villa and everything about this break were fabulous. Would recommend them for a trip.'\nNatalie has recently bagged herself a brand new job at Virgin Radio, ahead of her long-awaited exit from EastEnders after three decades.\nShe has starred as Sonia Fowler on the popular BBC One soap for 32 years, first appearing in 1993 when she was just 10 years old.\nHowever, she announced she would be bidding goodbye to Albert Square for good in January after returning last year for the 40th anniversary, with her final scenes set to air on the show on Thursday's episode.\n\nThe actress, 41, is best known for her role as the trumpet playing Sonia Fowler in EastEnders (Pictured)\n\n'I think everything in moderation,' Natalie told Radio Times. 'If I go the other way and want to lose a lot of weight, my days aren't as good'\nBut it seems she's already made huge strides with her post-EastEnders career, taking to Instagram on Wednesday to reveal she's taking to the airwaves with her own Easter show.\nSpeaking from the Virgin Radio studios, Natalie told fans that she would be hosting a special one-off show on Easter Monday from 1pm until 4pm.\nShe already has won many fans with her foray into the podcast world with Off The Telly, which she hosts with Gavin & Stacey star Joanna Page.\nAhead of the show, the soap star explained that she was trying to 'branch out' this year and be 'brave', as she gushed she was 'honoured' to get the opportunity.\nNatalie said: 'I'm very excited. This year I'm trying to branch out and do brave things, and this is one of them.\n'I feel very honoured to have been given a chance on Virgin Radio. I'm a very big fan of the station and music in general.\n'So to actually come in and do my own show feels very daunting, but there's a first time for everything.'\nNatalie CassidyEastenders\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEastEnders star Natalie Cassidy reveals she only did her weight loss DVDs for the money and declares 'this is the size I'm meant to be'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it was looking into the matter.\n\n“I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position,” Mr. Trump said in a letter to Ms. Cook posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nMr. Trump said there was sufficient evidence that Ms. Cook had made false statements on mortgage applications. “At minimum, the conduct at issue exhibits the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question your competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.”\n\nMs. Cook had been defiant about continuing onward at the Fed.\n\n“I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,” she said on August 20. “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve, and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”\n\nMs. Cook, who was nominated to the Fed’s Board of Governors by former President Joe Biden in 2022, took out the mortgages in question in 2021 when she was an academic. An official financial disclosure form for 2024 lists three mortgages held by Ms. Cook, with two listed as personal residences.\n\nMr. Pulte has claimed that Ms. Cook committed mortgage fraud by listing two of her mortgages as her primary residence, but he has provided no public evidence to back up his allegation. Loans for primary residences can carry lower borrowing rates.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television on August 21, Mr. Pulte said Ms. Cook’s alleged fraud is “self-evident” and easily seen in publicly available documents. Mr. Pulte also said the issues were uncovered as part of regular investigations rather than through a political witch hunt against those opposed by the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Pulte’s claims against Ms. Cook coincide with a broad effort by the Trump administration against diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the U.S. government, a process that has led to the departure of some prominent women and minorities.\n\nThe Trump administration has also targeted other political opponents, including U.S. Senator Adam Schiff, with similar accusations of mortgage fraud.\n\nPressure campaign\n\nThe firing of Ms. Cook marked an escalation in Mr. Trump’s attempt to reshape the makeup of the Fed leadership ranks. He has been pressuring the central bank for aggressive rate cuts at a time when Fed officials have kept them steady amid ongoing worries about inflation.\n\nThe President has regularly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who was nominated by Mr. Trump during his first term in the White House and then nominated for a second term by Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump, who lacks the legal authority to fire the Fed chair except “for cause”, has backed away from that threat as Mr. Powell gets closer to the expiration of his term as Fed chief next May.\n\nMs. Cook’s exit from the Fed could speed up the President’s reshaping of the Fed.\n\nHe recently elevated Fed Governor Michelle Bowman to be the central bank’s top bank regulator, and is believed to be considering Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who he named to the board in 2020, to succeed Mr. Powell.\n\nTwo other Biden appointments on the Fed board have some time left in their terms, while Mr. Powell could stay on as a governor until 2028 after the end of his term as head of the central bank.\n\nFinancial issues have been a regular issue for U.S. central bank officials in recent years. In 2021, the then-presidents of the Dallas and Boston Fed banks both resigned after revelations of active trading in financial markets.\n\nWhile both were later cleared by the Fed’s in-house watchdog of wrongdoing, the central bank’s Inspector General nevertheless said their trading created the appearance of a conflict of interest.

But recent history suggests otherwise.\n\nThe Alaska summit came only after Trump made repeated threats to punish Russia economically, culminating in his tariffs on India.\n\nThat pressure apparently helped motivate Putin to soften his (albeit still wildly unrealistic) territorial demands.\n\nAlthough additional sanctions may not deal Moscow an immediate knockout blow, they would exacerbate Russia’s economic woes and put Trump in the driver’s seat for future talks.\n\nWashington should then combine that economic pressure with stronger military support for Ukraine, including by sending Kyiv European-financed missiles with sufficient range to strike key military-industrial sites deep inside Russia — and permitting Ukrainian forces to actually use them on Russian territory.\n\nPutin will never abandon his decades-long obsession with dominating Ukraine.\n\nBut intensifying economic turmoil, coupled with a realization that Ukraine’s resistance will not break, might eventually convince him to pause the war on terms Kyiv can live with.\n\n“Negotiations are a euphemism for capitulation if the shadow of power is not cast across the bargaining table,” as the late Secretary of State George Shultz observed.\n\nPresident Trump, the negotiator-in-chief, understands that well.\n\nRichard Goldberg is a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where John Hardie is Russia Program deputy director.","summary":"President Trump has to apply some serious pressure on Russia’s primary source of income, its oil revenues — without upending the global energy market in the process.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/25/opinion/oil-holds-the-key-to-ukraine-wars-end-if-trump-plays-hardball/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-0ctojeyfc-1756168144628.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1756153827&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 00:42:36","author":"John Hardie,Richard Goldberg","authors":["John Hardie","Richard Goldberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":354277928,"title":"Wes Moore Says Donald Trump Made Up 'Imaginary Conversation'","text":"Democratic Maryland Governor Wes Moore publicly disputed President Donald Trump's claim that Moore had praised him as \"the greatest president\" of his lifetime during a face-to-face encounter last year.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that Moore approached him at an Army-Navy football game, hugged him and delivered the compliment.Moore responded to Trump's claim during a radio interview, calling it an \"imaginary conversation\" that \"never happened.\" The Maryland governor later also posted on X saying \"lol\" and \"Keep telling yourself that, Mr. President.\"Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email on Monday.Why It MattersThis latest dispute is the latest escalation in Trump's broader confrontation with Democratic governors across the country over urban crime policies and National Guard deployments.Trump has already deployed federal forces twice during his presidency—first in Los Angeles to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation operations and later in Washington, D.C., to crack down on what he characterized as skyrocketing crime in the nation's capital. Both deployments have been met with significant legal and political backlash.The president has threatened similar deployments to major Democratic-led cities including Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland. Moore's emphatic denial comes as Trump considers withholding federal funding for Maryland's Francis Scott Key Bridge reconstruction.The governor directly rebuked Trump last week, writing on X that Trump should \"walk our streets, stand with our people, and visit our community.\"\"If you are not willing to be part of the solution, keep our names out of your mouth,\" Moore said.What To KnowTrump said on Monday that the alleged conversation occurred at a 2024 Army-Navy football game, where Moore supposedly told him he had done a \"fantastic job\" as president and was \"the greatest president\" of the governor's lifetime.Moore first addressed Trump's claims during a Monday radio interview with WBAL News Radio host T.J. Smith, where he emphatically rejected the president's account.\"I'm a person who takes my integrity very seriously, and I spent the past six months before that election campaigning as to why I did not think that he should be the next president of the United States,\" Moore told WBAL Radio.\"So, when I say that conversation never happened, that imaginary conversation never happened, I mean that conversation never happened,\" the governor added.He later reposted the video of Trump's Oval Office comments on X and replied with \"lol\" and \"Keep telling yourself that, Mr. President.\"Moore has consistently pushed back on Trump's characterizations, citing substantial improvements in Baltimore's crime statistics, including a homicide rate that has dropped over 20 percent during his tenure.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social, in part: \"Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I \"walk the streets of Maryland\" with him. I assume he is talking about out of control, crime ridden, Baltimore? As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a \"walk.\" Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other \"Blue States\" are doing. But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the \"troops,\" which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.\"Maryland Governor Wes Moore told Newsweek in response to questions by email on Sunday, in part: \"President Trump represents what people hate most about politicians–someone who only seeks power to benefit themselves. This is a President who would rather attack his country's largest cities from behind a desk than walk the streets with the people he represents.\"\"The President should join us in Baltimore because the blissful ignorance, tropes, and the 1980s scare tactics benefit no one.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to temporarily remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while further litigation played out over whether presidents have the power to remove them without cause.In one of those opinions, the conservative majority said the removals would not \"implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections\" for Federal Reserve members because of the agency's \"distinct historical tradition.\"\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the unsigned opinion said.In response to Trump's calls to resign last week, Cook said, \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" according to a statement issued by the Fed.The statement continued, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve, and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"The Fed is scheduled to meet in less than a month. Its rate-setting Open Markets Committee has provisions to allow for alternate voters when a governor or a member of the panel misses a vote. It remains unclear how the Fed will proceed.Last week, Powell said that the Fed would always make rate-setting decisions solely based on the judgment of the needs of the broader economy to balance inflation and unemployment — a once perfunctory message that has taken on renewed relevance amid Trump's frequent efforts to cajole the Fed into cutting rates.\"FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks,\" Powell said during his closely-watched speech during an economic policy summit in Jackson Hole.

Now, their sugar industry is going down. In fact, it is happening in many small island developing states that the agriculture sector is not very prominent anymore, whereas people had gone there as indentured labour for sugarcane plantations, for cocoa plantations, etc. But over the years, tourism has evolved so much that the entire focus is on tourism. In some island countries, you have oil and gas like Trinidad and Tobago, so they are more focused on that. So there is an over-dependence on tourism. So that is why the other sectors of the economy have not developed very well,\" she said.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Says There Seems to Be 'Purge or Revolution' in South Korea Ahead of Summit With New President Lee Jae Myung.\nShe said in several countries post-COVID, tourism took a big hit and they are trying to diversify their economies, and are looking for skilled labour and skilled professionals from abroad. \"So agriculture is an area where we see enormous possibilities. We already have an MoU on agriculture with them. We are supplying agriculture drones, as is listed in the joint statement. And that is an area which we consider as an area of our strength. And Fiji has a very conducive climate. There is plenty of rainfall. And as of now, the agriculture is very, very limited. So I definitely see a lot of possibilities for our entrepreneurs, for joint ventures, etc. And they have the possibility of leasing the land. And there is a possibility of contract farming. We also discussed today the possibility of natural farming, etc. So there are a lot of possibilities in that sector,\" she said. The senior MEA official said Fiji is planning to have a new airport.\n\"They are planning to have another port. They are also planning to construct tourism-related infrastructure. There are not enough hotels in that country. So that is another area where we see a lot of possibility. Tourism-related infrastructure also has possibilities because it's a country which has nearly 9,28,000 people, but it receives over 1 million tourists per annum. It's more than their population. The majority of the tourists are from Australia and also New Zealand and USA, but there's not much tourist traffic from India to Fiji. So there's a possibility of, say, Fiji's development as a wedding destination, Fiji's development as a destination for our Bollywood. So, there are a lot of possibility in the tourism sector,\" she said. \"Similarly, in the fishery sector as well. They have, some possibilities for tuna processing. In fact, India imports tuna from Fiji, but fisheries as an industry hasn't developed that much. I think we are really a big power in fisheries nowadays. We are the largest in the shrimp production. We are also venturing into pearl farming, which is a very promising area for the South Sea countries because South Sea pearls, as we know, are world famous\" she added.\nNeena Malhotra said Fiji does some pearl farming, but on a very small scale and that is an area of cooperation. \"They have a lot of corals, but they export raw corals, and there's no coral jewellery, etc. So those are the allied kind of sectors where there's a lot of possibility\".\nThe joint statement said that PM Modi and His Fiji counterpart acknowledged the growing momentum in bilateral defence ties. They emphasized the importance of their shared interests in advancing regional peace, stability, and prosperity. Prime Minister Modi reaffirmed India's commitment to advancing the priority areas of cooperation outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Cooperation signed in 2017, and to supporting Fiji's strategic priorities in these areas. The Leaders welcomed the outcomes of the inaugural Joint Working Group (JWG) on Defence, including enhanced cooperation in areas such as United Nations Peacekeeping Operations (UNPKO), Military Medicine, White Shipping Information Exchange (WSIE), and capacity building for Republic of Fiji Military Forces.\nThe Leaders expressed satisfaction with the ongoing defence collaboration and reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen these ties, emphasising the need to enhance defence and maritime security cooperation. Prime Minister Rabuka stressed the significance of ensuring security of Fiji's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and welcomed India's assurance to extend assistance to meet the security needs of the Republic of Fiji.

Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week.\n\nPulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences — in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta — in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.\n\nThe announcement came days after Cook said she wouldn’t leave the seven-member Fed board despite Trump previously calling for her to resign. Senate Democrats had expressed support for Cook.\n\n“The Federal Reserve has tremendous responsibility for setting interest rates and regulating reserve member banks. The American people must have the full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve,” Trump wrote in a letter addressed to Cook, a copy of which he posted online. “In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.”\n\nTrump argued that firing Cook was constitutional, even if doing so will raise questions about control of the Fed as an independent entity.\n\n“The executive power of the United States is vested to me as President and, as President, I have a solemn duty that the laws of the United States are faithfully enacted,” the president wrote in the letter to Cook. “I have determined that faithfully enacting the law requires your immediate removal from office.”\n\nThe firing is likely to touch off a legal battle and Cook could be allowed to remain in her seat while the case plays out. Cook would have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.\n\nIt is the latest effort by the administration to take control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.\n\nForcing Cook off the Fed’s governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.\n\nPowell signaled last week that the Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain moderate. Meanwhile, Trump will be able to replace Powell in May 2026, when Powell’s term expires. However, 12 members of the Fed’s interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the chair might not guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.","summary":"Trump said he is firing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/25/trump-fires-federal-reserve-lisa-cook/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Federal_Reserve_Cook_00606_3309b1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 00:33:35","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":354275198,"title":"Trump fires Fed governor Lisa Cook, opening new front in fight for control over central bank","text":"By CHRIS RUGABER\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook late Monday, a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics.\n\nTrump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is firing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.

It’s really noticeable,” said Svetlana Bazhanova, a resident of Sevastopol, the largest city in Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nRussia’s far eastern port of Vladivostok saw long car queues at gasoline stations, according to a Reuters reporter. The shortages are due to a seasonal influx of tourists, local authorities said.\n\nThe affected refineries have lost only part of their capacity but this could still create problems with domestic fuel supplies, said Sergei Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, who previously worked at Russian oil major Gazprom Neft.\n\nRussia relies on oil and gas exports for a quarter of its budget revenues, which are funding a 25% rise in defence spending this year to the highest levels since the Cold War.\n\nWestern sanctions have forced Moscow to sell oil at discounts and stop gas sales in most of Europe.

Brent crude futures were up 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, to USD68.13 by 1315 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 46 cents, or 0.7 percent, to USD64.12. \n\n“The market is somewhat concerned that these peace negotiations are going nowhere,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “The market is looking for supply to exceed demand in the autumn months, but in the short term that’s being challenged by a potential geopolitical disruption.” US President Donald Trump warned again on Friday that he would impose sanctions on Russia if there was no progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks. He has also said he may hit India with harsh tariffs over its purchases of Russian oil. \n\nAt the weekend, US Vice President JD Vance said Russia had made “significant concessions” toward a negotiated settlement in the 3-1/2-year war. Ukraine, which has repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure during the war, launched a drone attack on Sunday that sparked a huge blaze at the Ust-Luga fuel export terminal, Russian officials said. A fire at Russia’s Novoshakhtinsk refinery, caused by a Ukrainian drone attack, was burning for the fourth day on Sunday, the region’s acting governor said. \n\nThe refinery sells fuel mainly for export and has an annual capacity of 5 million metric tons of oil, or about 100,000 barrels per day. \n\nSoftening the worries about Russian supply disruptions was OPEC+’s reversal of a series of production cuts, which is adding millions of barrels to the market, Saxo Bank’s Hansen said. Eight members of the oil exporters’ group are scheduled to meet on September 7, when they are set to approve another boost. \n\nInvestors’ risk appetite improved following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s signal on Friday of a possible interest rate cut at the US central bank’s meeting in September.

This decision marks a dramatic escalation in the president's campaign to exert more control over the nation's monetary policy, an area traditionally regarded as insulated from the whims of partisan politics.Trump's move came days after Cook said she wouldn’t leave the seven-member Fed board despite the President calling for her to resign. Senate Democrats had been backing Cook.Firing Cook would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.The implications of this development are likely resonate throughout the financial markets and the broader economy, as the Fed plays a crucial role in shaping fiscal policy and ensuring economic growth.In a letter shared on his Truth Social platform, Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook as the primary reason for her termination.Live EventsThe accusations, which surfaced last week, were brought to light by Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee with connections to the regulatory agency overseeing the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte's claims ignited a firestorm of controversy, raising questions about the integrity and oversight of financial regulators.Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.Cook, who made history as one of the first Black women to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, has faced scrutiny since her appointment, but the allegations of fraud have taken the discourse to a new level.Critics of Trump's intervention argue that such actions undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, a critical institution responsible for managing the nation's monetary policy, including interest rates and inflation control.The firing of Cook is part of a broader trend of increased politicisation within the Federal Reserve, which has historically operated free from direct political pressures. Observers are concerned that Trump's aggressive stance could set a precedent that might destabilise the Fed's long-standing reputation for independence, potentially impacting economic stability.The firing is likely to touch off a legal battle and Cook could be allowed to remain in her seat while the case plays out. Cook would have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.Trump said firing Cook was constitutional, even if doing so will raise questions about Fed's independence.(With inputs from AP and other agencies)Here is the full text of Trump's notice to Cook: Dear Governor Cook,Pursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution of the United States and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, you are hereby removed from your position on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, effective immediately.The Federal Reserve Act provides that you may be removed, at my discretion, for cause. See 12 U.S.C. § 242. I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.As set forth in the Criminal Referral dated August 15, 2025, from Mr. William J. Pulte, Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to Ms. Pamela Bondi, Attorney General of the United States (\"Criminal Referral\") (attached to this letter as Exhibit A), there is sufficient reason to believe you may have made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements. For example, as detailed in the Criminal Referral, you signed one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be your primary residence for the next year. Two weeks later, you signed another document for a property in Georgia stating that it would be your primary residence for the next year. It is inconceivable that you were not aware of your first commitment when making the second. It is impossible that you intended to honor both.The Federal Reserve has tremendous responsibility for setting interest rates and regulating reserve and member banks. The American people must be able to have full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve. In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity. At a minimum, the conduct at issue exhibits the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question your competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.The executive power of the United States is vested in me as President and, as President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed. I have determined that faithfully executing the law requires your immediate removal from office.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA FOX, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:01:22 BST, 26 August 2025 |Updated:01:25 BST, 26 August 2025 \n\nRecent developments in Peter Andre and Katie Price's feud have dominated the headlines, and for much of the nation, it's a no-brainer whose side they're on.\nBut despite painting himself as the doting father for years, a string of clips have started to show Peter in a wholly different light.\nThe singer had previously appeared in an ITV2 reality show alongside his then-spouse, which at the time was watched by millions as it followed the couple and their family's life in the spotlight.\nBut in a 2025 lens, fans have noticed how some of the behaviour between Peter and his wife could be cause for concern, with clips uploaded to TikTok showing the singer mocking his wife's voice and blaming her for domestic mishaps.\nThe comments add fuel to recent commentary on social media that accused Peter of being manipulative during his turbulent four year marriage to Katie, and of failing to properly support her in her mental health struggles.\nThe pair's feud has been dragged back into the spotlight in recent weeks, following the broadcast of their daughter Princess' reality show, with Peter issuing a bombshell statement were he accused his ex-spouse of 'peddling baseless lies.'\n\nKatie Price and Peter Andre's marriage was never far from the headlines, and while much of the nation have sided with the singer, cracks are starting to show in his 'saintly' image\n\nClips from the couples' Noughties reality show feature Peter exchanging insults with Katie, including branding her a 'f*****g idiot' and mocking her voice\nKatie has since responded with a bizarre statement about 'saints and sinners,' and declared on her podcast she won't be 'gaslit or bullied.'\nPrice, now 47, and Peter, 52, famously got together in the Australian jungle when they appeared on the TV show I'm a Celebrity in 2004 at a time when his brief 1990s pop career was said to be in freefall.\nThey married the following year, but split bitterly in 2009 after being seen regularly arguing on their reality show Katie & Peter. She insisted at the time that Andre's decision to leave her had left her 'devastated and disappointed'.\nThese disturbing clips have added yet more doubt to Peter's 'saintly' image, as they showed an even darker side to his marriage, hinting that perhaps it was doomed from the start... \nNasty comments \n\nIn a clip that could be deemed the most shocking from the couple's marriage, a furious Peter launches a vile tirade of insults at Katie, including calling her an 'arrogant b***h'\n\nWhile Katie declare she's 'used to it,' Peter hits back: 'How f****g dare you talk to me like that, think you're going to get away with it?'\nIn a clip that could be deemed the most shocking from the couple's marriage, a furious Peter launches a vile tirade of insults at Katie.\nThe clip, which appears to have been filmed during their trip to the US, Peter declares: 'You're a f*****g idiot, I hope you learn a lesson and come down a peg or two because you're too far up your own a*se.\n'You're too up your own a*se, you're a f*****g arrogant b***h, I'm not having her talk to me like that in front of anyone. F*****g idiot, stupid arrogant little f*****g cow.\n'Stuck up beaver. You put up with it? I'm going home Nicola, I'm not having it, she fucked it up again.'\nWhile Katie declares she's 'used to it,' Peter hits back: 'How f****g dare you talk to me like that, think you're going to get away with it?'\nThe shocking outburst is a stark contrast to the squeaky-clean image Peter has presented of himself in recent years, and sparked a sea of comments from users.\nThey included: 'He’s definitely showing his true colours. Good on you Katie xx;\n'This is horrid I’ve always supported Kate and I always will;'\n'Wow! Regardless of what she said before the reaction is completely and utterly disrespectful & narcissistic.'\nBlaming her for mishaps\n\nAnother sees Peter blaming his wife for losing his car keys, before declaring she'll have to cancel an interview to pick up their children from nursery\nWhile it's no surprise to see Katie preparing for yet another tell-all interview during her historic reality show, a tense clip featuring a phonecall with Peter offered a glimpse at their domestic mishaps.\nIn the video, Peter blames his wife after struggling to locate his car keys, and then declares she'll have to cancel her interview to pick up their children from nursery, as he had to borrow their nanny's car instead.\nVisibly irate by the exchange, Katie tells their manager Claire Powell: 'He stresses me because he can't find the car keys\n''I'm late for the studio, I can't find the car keys, so it's my fault'' Is he taking the p**s out of me or what?'\nWhile Claire suggests she could book a car for Peter instead, an exasperated Katie adds: 'What am I supposed to do. This is what Pete does, before my signings, anything he keeps stressing me like this. It's really out of order.'\nMocking her voice\n\nAnother toe-curling moment from Katie and Peter's show featured the reality star poking fun at his spouse's voice, including an 'intimate' impression of her alter-ego Jordan\n\n Katie Price and Peter Andre's marriage crumbled into feud that left a mark on daughter Princess \nAnother toe-curling moment from Katie and Peter's show featured the reality star poking fun at his spouse's tone during a photo shoot.\nAfter hearing Katie greet someone off-camera, Peter began to mimic her tone in a high-pitched child-like voice in a bid to get her attention.\nHe said: 'Who did you say ''hiya'' to? Who did you...' before furiously muttering 'f**k sake.'\nThe clip then cuts to show Peter in the midst of an 'intimate' impression of Katie's racy alter-ego Jordan.\nBranding her a 'tart' \n\nPeter also brands Jordan a 'tart' in another awkward clip, before wrongfully claiming she's 'had half of the English football team'\nPeter was no stranger to taking aim at Katie's famous alter-ego Jordan, known at the team for her sexy shoots and eye-popping cleavage.\nAnd in an uncomfortable clip from their ITV2 show, Peter was quick to make a lewd assumption about Katie's in-character behaviour.\nWhle riding in a car together, Peter declares: 'I'd love Jordan tonight. I would like that stupid little tart thank you very much.\n'Everybody else has had her. Half the English football team.'\nIn this instance, Katie was quick to hit back at her spouse, saying: 'They haven't actually, I don't know where you get that c**p from?'\nChildish response to feminine issues \n\nPeter was also quick to share his disgust when Katie discussed natural feminine matters, even threatening to throw tampons on her\n\nAnother clip sees Peter criticise Katie for asking for a new bra after noticing she was starting to leak breast milk\nIn several clips between the bickering couple, Peter never shied away from expressing his disgust when Katie discussed natural feminine matters.\nOne video showed Katie asking her husband to go into the bathroom and pick up a tampon for her, he hit back: 'Can I just explain something to you? \n'There's ways you can say things, now I know we're rude sometimes, but why can't you just say, there's something next to the toilet, can you get it? It's that time. Not can you go and grab my Tampax?'\nWhile he did go and get Peter a tampon, he then pretended to hurl one of them across the living room to her, before quickly insisting he was 'joking.'\nAnother clip showed Katie requesting a member of her team to bring a bra for her, after noticing she was starting to leak breast milk.\nRepulsed by her request, a disgusted Peter said: 'It's natural to have a period but it's different to say, yeah I'm on my period, can you bring me a pad cos I'll be gushing with blood.'\nWhile Katie hit back: 'I didn't say my t*ts are gonna be squirting with milk did I?' her husband added: 'That's a bit horny.'\nNasty insults \n\nIn another clip, Peter is heard trying to put down Katie while eight months pregnant after rushing from a filming engagement to meet friends for her birthday\nAnother clip shows Peter trying to put down his wife when she is apparently moody while eight months pregnant after rushing from a filming engagement to meet friends for her own birthday party.\nThe video taken as Andre drives her to the venue features him saying sarcastically: 'You have just made me feel like s*** on your birthday this time. I didn't think that could possibly happen – but that's alright.\n'What you do is make everyone else feel the same way you do… You make everyone else feel like s*** and it's unfair… it's wrong what you do… you've put me in the foulest mood.'\nPeter then refuses to get out of the car with her, and launches into another rant as he sits alone in the driving seat, telling the camera: 'Honestly she is the hardest woman to live with. She is such hard work. It's so, so, so, so bad to live with that woman. \n'She makes life so difficult for everyone. I have never had so much stress in my entire life as I have had with that woman. \nShe treats everybody like s**t. I am f***ing sick of it.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPeter Andre and Katie Price's toxic relationship: How the singer branded his ex 'a f*****g idiot,' mocked her voice and blamed her for his endless mishaps as questions arise over his 'saintly' image\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

In a letter shared publicly on X by the White House rapid response team, Trump stated that Cook was \"removed\" from her position “effective immediately,” invoking Article II of the Constitution and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 as legal justification. However, the legality of the move is under scrutiny, as Federal Reserve governors are typically considered independent and protected from politically motivated dismissal. Cook’s term was not set to expire until 2038. If upheld, this would mark a significant and controversial expansion of presidential power over the Federal Reserve. Allegations and Political Context The White House claims it has cause for Cook’s termination after Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee, referred her to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. Pulte alleges that Cook falsified bank documents and property records to receive favorable loan terms, an accusation that amounts to mortgage fraud. The White House says this constitutes legal grounds for dismissal. Lisa Cook, appointed by President Biden in 2022, made history as the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor. Her removal comes amid a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the Federal Reserve. Trump has criticized the Fed’s current leadership, especially Chair Jerome Powell, over interest rate policy and recently attempted to build a case against Powell related to building renovations at the central bank. Cook’s firing follows the recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler. With her departure and Cook’s ousting, Trump has a chance to install two loyalists on the powerful board. The White House has already nominated Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to temporarily fill Kugler’s seat until January.

President Donald Trump called for Cook to resign just hours after the news was made public.\n\nPulte has targeted Trump opponents over allegations of mortgage fraud. The firing of Cook is especially notable in light of Trump’s efforts to pressure the central bank to lower interest rates.\n\nCook’s early departure gives Trump the ability to nominate a new person to the Fed board, presumably someone who would share his desire for the central bank to slash interest rates. Trump has repeatedly berated Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for refusing to cut rates this year. Cook has consistently voted to hold interest rates steady rather than cut.\n\nAnother Fed governor who voted to hold interest rates steady, Adriana Kugler, recently and unexpectedly resigned, handing Trump another opening on the board. Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to lower interest rates at the last meeting: Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.\n\nIn the letter to Bondi, Pulte said it appears Cook “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.”\n\n“This has included falsifying residence statuses for an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based residence and an Atlanta, Georgia-based property in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms,” Pulte wrote.\n\nBIGGEST IMMEDIATE CHANGE FOR FED UNDER NEW CHAIR LIKELY TO BE TONE SHIFT\n\nPulte has emerged, perhaps unexpectedly, as one of Trump’s most vociferous attack dogs and the administration’s leading critic of the Fed’s monetary policy and Powell.\n\nIn his role as FHFA Director, Pulte oversees the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.","summary":"President Donald Trump fired Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook on Monday, a move that comes after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte asked the Justice Department to consider prosecuting her for mortgage fraud.
