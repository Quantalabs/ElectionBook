Boasberg - whom former President Donald Trump has previously said should be impeached - underscores a significant clash between the judiciary and the executive branch over presidential authority and immigration enforcement.Judge Boasberg accused administration officials of hastily deporting individuals under the Alien Enemies Act before they had the opportunity to challenge their removal in court. He further stated that the government deliberately ignored his directive to turn around planes that had already left.Boasberg said he may hold hearings and refer the case for prosecution if the administration fails to address the violation. Should the Justice Department decline to act, the judge stated he would appoint an independent attorney to pursue the case.\"The Constitution does not tolerate wilful disobedience of judicial orders - especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,” wrote Boasberg, the chief judge of Washington’s federal court.The Trump administration has said it will appeal the ruling.“The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,” White House communications director Steven Cheung wrote in a post on X.It comes as Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador on Wednesday, where he met with the country’s vice president to advocate for the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia - a man deported by the Trump administration in March despite a court order blocking his removal.Speaking at a press conference in San Salvador following the meeting, Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Vice President Félix Ulloa told him the Salvadoran government would not return Abrego Garcia to the United States and denied Van Hollen’s request to visit him in the high-security prison where he is being held.Both the Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele stated this week that they see no legal grounds to repatriate Abrego Garcia, even though the US Supreme Court has ordered the administration to make efforts to bring him back. Trump officials allege that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who had been living in Maryland, is connected to the MS-13 gang. However, his lawyers argue that no evidence has been presented to support those claims, which Abrego Garcia has consistently denied.Garcia has not been charged with any crimes related to gang activity.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticised Van Hollen's decision to visit El Salvador to advocate for Garcia's return.\"It's appalling and sad that Senator Van Hollen and the Democrats applauding his trip to El Salvador today are incapable of having any shred of common sense or for their own constituents. And our citizens,\" Leavitt said.","summary":"Judge Boasberg accused administration officials of rushing deportees out of the country under the Alien Enemies Act last month before they could challenge

Trump administration has asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to revoke Harvard University’s tax-exempt status, sources within the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed to Fox News.\n\nThe Ivy League school’s failure to address antisemitism on campus is grounds for losing its 501(c)(3) status, Fox News’ sources said.\n\nThe IRS is expected to make a final decision soon on Harvard’s tax exemption, according to CNN, which was first to report the story.\n\nIn a recent social media post, President Donald Trump claimed that Harvard had “lost its way” and didn’t deserve federal funding.\n\n“Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and ‘birdbrains’ who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students and so-called ‘future leaders,'” Trump wrote. \n\n“Look just to the recent past at their plagiarizing President, who so greatly embarrassed Harvard before the United States Congress.”\n\n“Many others, like these Leftist dopes, are teaching at Harvard, and because of that, Harvard can no longer be considered even a decent place of learning, and should not be considered on any list of the World’s Great Universities or Colleges,” he continued. \n\n“Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds.”\n\nThe developments come less than three weeks after the Justice Department announced a “comprehensive review” of federal contracts and government-funded grants at Harvard University.\n\nCiting an ambition to eliminate antisemitism on campuses, and coming on the heels of a similar move against Columbia University, the Department of Education said that over $255.6 million in contracts between Harvard, its affiliates and the federal government would be reviewed, plus nearly $9 billion worth of grants.\n\n“Harvard has served as a symbol of the American Dream for generations — the pinnacle aspiration for students all over the world to work hard and earn admission to the storied institution,” Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said at the time. \n\n“Harvard’s failure to protect students on campus from anti-Semitic [sic] discrimination — all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry — has put its reputation in serious jeopardy.”","summary":"The Trump administration has asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to revoke Harvard University’s tax-exempt status, sources

Intervened: Report","text":"Israel was preparing to launch military strikes against multiple nuclear targets in Iran—until U.S. President Donald Trump intervened, according to a New York Times report citing administration officials and other briefed on the discussions.What To KnowThe Times reported that Israel was planning to strike Iran as soon as May, but Trump stepped in because the White House was leaning toward taking a diplomatic approach toward Tehran as opposed to a military one.Israel's reported decision to call off the strikes comes as tensions between Israel, Iran and its proxies continue to escalate and Iran recently flat-out rejected U.S. demands to curb its uranium enrichment.According to the Times, Trump decided to negotiate with Iran after months of internal debate among administration officials who favored a stronger military stance against the rogue state and those who were wary of launching a wider war in the Middle East when tensions in the region are already at a tipping point.Trump earlier this week said that he plans to make a decision regarding Iran \"very quickly,\" following what officials said were positive nuclear talks in Oman.But the negotiations hit a snag when Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration's special envoy to the Middle East, said Iran \"must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.\"Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi rejected Witkoff's demand, saying Wednesday that Iran's uranium enrichment \"is not subject to negotiation.\"A second round of talks is scheduled for Saturday.The absence of U.S. support ensuring Israel's attack was successful and providing Israel protection from Iranian retaliation likely pushed Israel to call off its plans to launch military strikes against Iranian targets, according to the Times.The report added that the goal of Israel's strikes was to set Iran back at least a year in its nuclear ambitions.This story is developing and will be updated as more information becomes available.","summary":"Israel was reportedly planning to launch multiple strikes against Iran but called them off after Trump stepped

tells US to stop portraying itself as a victim","text":"Beijing appointed a new top international trade negotiator at its Ministry of Commerce on Wednesday, as trade tensions with the US failed to show any sign of abating. Li Chenggang, who was China’s ambassador to the World Trade Organization, has taken over from former vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen, Reuters reports\n\nLi, 58, was an assistant commerce minister during US President Donald Trump’s first administration. It’s unclear whether Wang, 59, had been offered a post elsewhere in the government. No details were given by the ministry in its statement confirming Li’s new role. \n\nAlfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior adviser to the China Centre of the Conference Board – a US-headquartered business research organisation – portrayed the shift to Reuters as “very abrupt and potentially disruptive.” \n\n[See more: US tariffs will impede the growth of Macao’s casino industry, local experts warn]\n\n“We can only speculate as to why this happened at this precise moment; but it might be that in the view of China’s top leadership, given how tensions have continued escalating, they need someone else to break the impasse in which both countries find themselves and finally start negotiating,” Montufar-Helu argued.\n\nChina was the only country to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US after Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” announcement earlier this month, which saw “reciprocal tariffs” of between 10 and 50 percent slapped on almost 90 of the US’ trade partners. China was also the only country that didn’t benefit from the 90-day reprieve Trump granted hours after the new rates were enforced on 9 April. \n\nAn escalating tariff war means most Chinese imports to the US now face levies of 145 percent, while all US imports to China receive a 125 percent rate. \n\n[See more: President Xi Jinping embarks on a Southeast Asian tour amid US tariff chaos]\n\nHowever, the White House recently said its taxes on certain Chinese goods are actually up to 245 percent when taking into account Section 301 tariffs. These are additional duties of up to 100 percent imposed on imports from nations the US accuses of violating fair trade practices.\n\nTrump has argued that increasing the cost of US imports would recreate the golden age of US manufacturing, spur local consumers to buy more American-made goods, and increase the amount of investment in the country. He also claimed that the US’ trade partners have “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” the US though their unfair trade policies – citing America’s steep trade deficits as evidence.\n\nOn Tuesday, an editorial by state news outlet China Daily countered that the US was “not getting ripped off by anybody … [rather it] has been taking a free ride on the globalisation train.” It urged the US to “stop whining about itself being a victim in global trade and put an end to its capricious and destructive behaviour.”\n\n[See more: Three macroeconomic indicators worth monitoring in the current tariff climate]\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has insisted that “the ball is in China’s court,” when it comes to resolving tensions between the world’s two most powerful economies – a suggested that Beijing strong rebuffs.\n\nYesterday, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry told the press that “this tariff war was initiated by the US side” and said that the US needed to “stop threatening and blackmailing” before Beijing would consider engaging in dialogue. China also says it is more than willing to “fight to the end” to defend its legitimate rights and interests.","summary":"An editorial in the China Daily says Washington is ‘taking a free ride on the globalisation train’ and calls on the US to stop its ‘destructive behaviour’\n\n\nThe post China appoints a new trade envoy and tells US to stop portraying itself as a victim appeared first on Macao News.","url":"https://macaonews.org/news/greater-china/china-us-trade-war-trade-negotiator-li-chenggang/","image":"https://macaonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/China-US-Trade-TradeWar.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:48:36","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mo","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":311930238,"title":"Carney, Poilievre align on pipelines as Trump and trade loom over French debate (Canada)","text":"Liberal Leader Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre aligned on support for new oil and gas pipelines as a matter of national security during the French language election debate Wednesday night.\n\nDealing with U.S. President Donald Trump was a running theme as the four main federal party leaders took the stage in Montreal for the first of two debates. Even the debate moderator Patrice Roy cited the elephant in the room as he pitched questions on immigration, affordability and Canadian identity.\n\nDuring an exchange on climate change, Poilievre argued that Canada needs to build a national pipeline, pointing out that Alberta oil and gas is transported east through pipelines passing into the United States.\n\n“Quebecers that buy Alberta oil, it needs to go through the United States, giving the power to Donald Trump on our own energy,\" Poilievre said, addressing Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet.\n\n\"You say you’re for sovereignty? I’m for economic and energy sovereignty. And it takes a pipeline across Canada.”\n\n“The Americans will never damage their own economy to the point of saying ‘Okay, we’re going to prevent the trade of a product in which we’re making enormous profits,’” Blanchet snapped back.\n\n“That’s an extraordinary argument. And tell me how much your oil pipeline will cost. Because 1,600 kilometres for Trans Mountain cost $40 billion. And now you want to build one 4,600 kilometres, without investors and with Europe not wanting it.”\n\nPoilievre said that a Conservative government led by him would never subsidize pipelines.\n\n“It’s not necessary. They’re extremely profitable,” he said. “The only reason it costs a lot right now is because we have laws and rules that prevent construction with bureaucracy.”\n\nCarney jumped in at that point — when he was trailing Poilievre and Blanchet’s speaking time by more than a minute because he was fending off attacks throughout the evening. He agreed with Poilievre’s concerns about Canadian energy passing through the United States.\n\n“Our relationship with the United States has completely changed. So imports from the United States and the geography — as Mr. Poilievre just said — of the pipelines is a national security problem for us,\" Carney said.\n\n\"We have to act.”\n\nCarney said that during his latest meeting with Canada’s premiers, they agreed on developing a national energy corridor and removing trade barriers to build projects faster.\n\nIn an earlier exchange, Blanchet said he was in favour of Canada producing less oil and gas because the cost of failing to address climate change is too great.\n\n“We have to progressively get out of oil because the cost per family is higher than all the horrible scenarios that Mr. Poilievre is raising,\" Blanchet said.\n\n\"Reparations from damage from climate change costs thousands of dollars per family per year.”\n\nThe debate began with the leaders sparring over how to respond to the trade war with the United States and pitching themselves as the best one to negotiate with President Donald Trump.\n\nPoilievre said that on his first day in office, he would open negotiations with Trump on an agreement to put an end to tariffs.\n\n\"We can't control Trump. So at the same time, we need to control what we can,\" Poilievre said.\n\n\"That means reversing the Liberal economic policies which have weakened our country, unlocking our (natural) resources, cut taxes, bring jobs here to face Trump with strength.\"\n\nCarney said Canada needs to plan for the worst-case scenario and have a strategy to build a stronger economy.\n\n\"It's those elements that will work with Trump. He respects strength, he respects people who know how the world and the private sector works,\" he said.\n\n\"Canada has to create other options, new international trade partners, and that's what I promise.\"\n\nBlanchet said Canada needs to align with countries that are being affected by U.S. tariffs and \"negotiate rationally.\"\n\n\"Trump will hang himself with his own cord because his measures are extremely toxic to the U.S. economy,\" he said. \"In the meantime, he will also create damage everywhere.\"\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Canada needs to prioritize what matters most and invest rather than cut.\n\n\"Like our agriculture, our culture, our French language, not sacrifice it,\" Singh said.\n\n\"A profound value for us is taking care of each other. How we do that is reinforcing our health-care system, not Americanizing it.\"\n\nThe party leaders were also asked which U.S. products they've cut from their daily lives.\n\nAll other party leaders took a dig at Carney by saying they no longer buy U.S. strawberries. In a recent interview with a Quebec talk show, when asked if he still buys U.S. strawberries, Carney said he doesn't buy his own groceries.\n\n\"No more wine, no more American alcohol,\" Carney said.\n\n\"I do my own groceries, and I cook myself. So lots of fruit,\" Singh said.\n\n\"This is a delicious conversation,\" Poilievre quipped, adding he buys Canadian beef.\n\nEarlier in the debate, Carney cited his promises to double housing construction, while Poilievre vowed to cut income taxes and the GST on new homes.\n\nBlanchet said Quebec should have the right to run its own economy, using its own natural resources. Singh prioritized health care, noting his party's efforts to secure dental and pharmacare programs under the previous government.\n\nThe first of the election's two debates is structured around five key topics: the cost of living, energy and climate, the trade war, identity and sovereignty, and immigration and foreign affairs.\n\nThe Green party was removed from the debate early Wednesday after fielding candidates in less than 70 per cent of ridings.","summary":"Liberal Leader Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre aligned on support for new oil and gas pipelines as a matter of national security during the French language election debate Wednesday night.

It said its new estimate was based on measures in place at the start of this week.\n\n“I’m very concerned, the contraction in global merchandise trade growth is of big concern,” WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told reporters in Geneva.\n\nUS President Donald Trump imposed extra duties on steel and car imports as well as more sweeping global tariffs before unexpectedly pausing higher duties on a dozen economies. His trade war with China has also intensified with tit-for-tat exchanges pushing levies on each other’s imports beyond 100%.\n\nThe WTO said that, if Trump reintroduced the full rates of his broader tariffs that would reduce goods trade growth by 0.6 percentage points, with another 0.8 point cut due to spillover effects beyond US-linked trade.\n\nTaken together, this would lead to a 1.5% decline, the steepest drop since 2020.\n\n“If we have contraction in global merchandise the concern is spill over into broad GDP growth. We’ve seen that the trade concerns can have negative spill overs into financial markets, into other broader areas of the economy,” Okonjo-Iweala added. She also raised alarm about the impact on developing countries.\n\nThe head of the WTO said her greatest fear was that the economies of China and the US were decoupling from one another.\n\nThe WTO estimates that merchandise trade between them will fall by 81% - a drop that could have reached 91% without recent exemptions for products such as smartphones.\n\n“A decoupling could have far reaching consequences if it were to contribute to a broader fragmentation of the global economy along geopolitical lines to two isolated blocks,” Okonjo-Iweala said.\n\nIn this scenario, global GDP could shrink by 7% in the long term, which the director general described as “significant and substantial”.\n\n“The unprecedented nature of the recent trade policy shifts means that predictions should be interpreted with more caution than usual,” said the WTO, which is also forecasting a modest recovery of 2.5% in 2026.\n\n“Forecasting a credible baseline scenario has become virtually impossible,” Hector Torres, a former executive director of the International Monetary Fund, told Reuters.\n\n“The remnants of a deteriorated ‘rules-based’ trading system are giving way to a capricious ‘deals-based’ disorder, where any projections hinge on government’s capacity to strike bilateral deals with the Trump Administration,” Torres said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the UN Trade and Development agency said global economic growth could slow to 2.3% as trade tensions and uncertainty drive a recessionary trend.\n\nThe Geneva-based WTO said disruption of US-China trade was expected to increase Chinese merchandise exports across all regions outside North America by between 4% and 9%. Other countries would have opportunities to fill the gap in the United States in sectors such as textiles, clothing and electrical equipment.\n\nServices trade, though not subject to tariffs, would also take a hit, the WTO said, by weakening demand related to goods trade such as transport and logistics. Broader uncertainty could dampen spending on travel and investment-related services.\n\nThe WTO said it expected commercial services trade to grow by 4.0% in 2025 and 4.1% in 2026, well below baseline projections of 5.1% and 4.8%.

With the US as its fourth-largest trading partner in 2024, these tariffs create substantial financial pressure on multiple fronts”, the CIoD said.\n\nThe institute led by its President, Tijjani Borodo, explained that the increased cost of foreign exchange as a result of the tariffs would particularly affect small and medium enterprises that lack the financial reserves to absorb sudden increases in import costs. \n\n“These businesses form the backbone of the economy, and their struggles would ripple throughout the entire economic system, potentially increasing unemployment and reducing consumer spending power.\n\nIt pointed to one of the most pressing concerns for businesses to include disruptions to global supply chains, estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars, noting that these disruptions will likely cause increased costs for goods and raw materials across various sectors. \n\n“Nigeria imports most of its goods, such as electronics, vehicles, machinery, raw materials, and even food. If the new tariffs push up the cost of global trade, prices for these items will likely rise.\n\nThe interconnected nature of modern commerce means that even items not directly imported from the US will experience price increases as global trade patterns adjust. This challenges the manufacturing sector, which depends heavily on imported inputs.”\n\nThe CIoD also noted that the resulting inflation could further stress consumers already coping with high prices for essential goods. \n\nIt emphasised that businesses must contend with the reality that many international suppliers might increase prices across the board to offset losses in markets affected by tariffs. \n\n“This could create a domino effect where even trade routes not directly targeted by the US-led tariffs experience cost increases. Furthermore, shipping and logistics companies might pass on their increased operational costs to customers worldwide, further compounding the price pressures on importers.”\n\nCIOd believes that despite these challenges, the current trade situation may create strategic opportunities for forward-thinking businesses, as it could prompt a realignment of global trade partnerships, potentially benefiting Nigeria. \n\n“This could help develop stronger trade relationships with countries affected by the tariff war, potentially opening new export markets.\n\nThe institute says as China and other tariff-affected countries seek alternative destinations for their products, Nigeria might become an attractive investment destination. “This could lead to technology transfer and manufacturing expansion, potentially strengthening local production capabilities and creating jobs. Businesses that are prepared to form strategic partnerships with international companies seeking to circumvent tariffs might find unprecedented growth opportunities.\n\nIt viewed that the situation might also accelerate interest in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), creating additional regional opportunities for businesses that can adapt quickly to changing trade patterns. \n\n“Stronger intra-African trade networks could provide some insulation against external trade disputes whilst creating new markets for Nigerian products throughout the continent.”\n\nTo weather the storm, it advised that businesses should consider forming industry associations or cooperative arrangements to increase their collective bargaining power when dealing with international suppliers and customers as such collaborations could help spread risks and reduce individual exposure to sudden market changes resulting from tariff policies.\n\nIt also suggested that companies must also invest in understanding alternative supply sources and potential new export markets. \n\n“Those able to quickly adapt their business models to changing trade conditions will likely outperform competitors who remain fixed in traditional patterns. \n\n“This might require investments in market research, building relationships with potential international partners, and exploring regional alternatives to established global supply chains.”\n\nWhile increased costs, currency pressures, and supply chain disruptions create serious obstacles, CIoD opined that redistributing global trade flows offers potential avenues for export growth and investment attraction.\n\nIt recommended that enterprises that adapt quickly to the changing trade environment by emphasising local production, exploring new export markets, and building resilience against external shocks may be better positioned for long-term success.\n\nCIoD posited that government’s policy response, particularly regarding support for local manufacturing and strategic trade agreements, will prove crucial in determining how effectively the business community can weather this period of international trade tension.\n\nAs this situation unfolds, businesses must remain alert to emerging patterns and position themselves to capitalise on new opportunities whilst minimising exposure to the negative aspects of the tariff war”, CIoD advised.","summary":"By Merit Ibe                                               ibe.merit@yahoo.com  &#160; For the Chartered Institute of Directors (CIoD), the ongoing trade wars between the United States and many countries, Nigeria inclusive, is not all gloom and doom, as [&#8230;]\n\n\nThe post From crisis to profit: How Nigeria can benefit from global trade shifts  –Directors Institute appeared first on The Sun Nigeria.","url":"https://thesun.ng/from-crisis-to-profit-how-nigeria-can-benefit-from-global-trade-shifts-directors-institute/","image":"https://d1jcea4y7xhp7l.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nigeria-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:39:04","author":"Merit Ibe,Rapheal","authors":["Merit Ibe","Rapheal"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.06},{"id":311925896,"title":"The Masked Singer live updates: Find out what celeb is unmasked as The Lucky Six perform","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Apr 17th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Masked Singer live updates: Find out what celeb is unmasked as The Lucky Six perform\n\n Have YOU got a story?

A senior official with knowledge of the negotiations told Agence France-Presse that newer drafts of the US-Ukraine accord appeared not to recognise previous US military aid as a debt owed by Ukraine, adding that talks were moving forward “quite fast”. That assessment echoed a report by Bloomberg News that said Washington had eased a demand that Kyiv pay for aid already delivered since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\n“The basic legal stuff is almost finalised, and then, if everything moves as quickly and constructively, the agreement will bring economic results to both our countries,” Zelenskyy said in his daily address on Wednesday. The Trump administration has demanded some sort of deal giving the US a large share of critical minerals or what Donald Trump calls “rare earths” and other Ukrainian natural resources in return for military aid. Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine will not recognise previous aid approved under the Biden administration as a loan requiring repayment, but he expects to be paying the US upfront going forward.\n\nA mass attack of Russian “Shahed” drones killed a young woman and an elderly woman and injured at least 16 on Wednesday in Dnipro city, said officials. In the Kharkiv region, the governor, Oleh Syniehubov, said a Russian missile attack injured two people in the town of Izium.\n\nRussian attacks in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson killed one person and wounded three more on Wednesday in an apparent so-called double-tap strike, officials said. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the region, said Russian attacks had continued as rescue workers arrived on the scene.\n\nUkraine said on Wednesday it had detained nine people including five teenagers aged between 14 and 15 on suspicion of preparing sabotage attacks on behalf of Russian security services. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said some of the suspects were planning to plant explosives near residential buildings or railway lines, including with improvised explosive devices, adding agents had seized more than 30kg of explosives. The SBU in March accused Russia of blowing up two teenage boys it had recruited to make bombs and plant them near a Ukrainian railway station.\n\nThe Kremlin on Wednesday refused to say when a supposed 30-day moratorium on strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure would end – or whether it would be extended. Putin said on 18 March that he had ordered his army to halt such attacks for 30 days but Kyiv has accused Moscow of continuing them.\n\nThe former governor of Russia’s Kursk region and his ex-deputy have been arrested on suspicion of embezzling over $12m of funds earmarked for border defences against Ukraine, authorities said on Wednesday. Alexei Smirnov, 51, and Alexei Dedov, 48, were in charge when Ukrainian troops stormed across the border in August 2024, successfully mounting the biggest ground assault on Russian territory since the second world war. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in December replaced Smirnov with Alexander Khinshtein.\n\nFrance’s president, Emmanuel Macron, will on Thursday meet Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and Donald Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, the Élysée Palace has said. The US state department said they would discuss ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nLatvian lawmakers voted on Wednesday to quit a treaty banning anti-personnel mines so the Baltic country can reinforce its security against Russia. “Withdrawal from the Ottawa convention will give our armed forces room for manoeuvre in the event of a military threat to use all possible means to defend our citizens,” said Inara Murniece, chair of parliament’s foreign affairs committee. The decision, a direct consequence of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, will come into effect six months after Latvia formally notifies the UN.\n\nEstonia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland have also announced plans to renounce the landmine treaty. The International Committee of the Red Cross has called it “a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict”. Lithuania last month quit another treaty banning cluster bombs, also citing the threat posed by Russia, alarming human rights groups.","summary":"Ukrainian president says legalities almost finalised and officials signal US concessions in talks that are progressing ‘quite fast’; deadly Shahed strike on Dnipro.

However, the trade war is expected to have a major effect on discretionary spending by Chinese consumers.\n\nJP Morgan analysts recently described the SAR as likely to take a hit from “second-order impacts” of US tariffs – such as China’s expected economic slowdown and weakening yuan – and lowered their GGR forecast for 2025.","summary":"With gambling revenue failing to meet targets, Macao’s top official is painting a fairly stark picture of the SAR’s economic realities \n\n\nThe post Urging ‘crisis awareness,’ Sam Hou Fai says Macao could face a budget deficit appeared first on Macao News.","url":"https://macaonews.org/news/business/macau-budget-deficit/","image":"https://macaonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sam-Hou-Fai-Macao-Budget-Deficit.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:31:38","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mo","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":311929142,"title":"Some Hong Kong-based shipowners consider changing flags as US tariff war rages","text":"Some Hong Kong-based shipowners are looking to navigate US tariffs and Washington’s escalating trade war with China by changing their vessels’ registration flags to jurisdictions with fewer geopolitical risks such as Panama and Liberia, the Post has learned.\nAccording to industry sources, some shipowners are preparing exit plans to mitigate rising political risks even though a recent executive order by US President Donald Trump did not include an earlier threat to impose a US$1.5 million fee per port call in the United States on Chinese-linked ships. The fees were also supposed to apply to Hong Kong.\nThe owners’ considerations have cast a shadow on Hong Kong’s development as “three centres and one hub”, that is, an international centre for finance, shipping and trade and as a prominent talent hub.\n“There are discussions among some shipowners about changing the Hong Kong flag to Panama and Liberia to minimise political risks, costs and exposure to the US tariffs,” a stakeholder who requested anonymity said on Wednesday.\n“Geopolitics is a teething issue, and shipowners are talking about the feasibility of carrying a flag from elsewhere.”\nIn reply to Post inquiries, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said ship registrations with the Hong Kong Shipping Registry remained “solid, strong and stable”.\nThe bureau noted that Hong Kong was a separate customs territory from mainland China and its free-port status provided a foundation for the maritime industry’s development.\nIt said Hong Kong was in fourth place globally in terms of ship registrations, after Liberia, Panama and the Marshall Islands as of January this year.\nMore than 2,600 ships with a total gross tonnage of 132.2 million tonnes were registered in Hong Kong, a 10-year high.\nHong Kong Shipowners Association deputy chairman Richard Hext told the Post that “Washington keeps changing its mind” over tariffs and the industry needed to let things settle down before making any decisions.\n“Shipowners are always looking at different alternatives all the time, and risk management, there are owners who have always had ships in different flags,” he said.\n“Shippers have survived by staying nimble and by keeping up with things. And, of course, we need to stay agile.”\nHext said Hong Kong remained a strategic location for shipping because it was situated next to the mainland, the world’s most important source of cargo and shipbuilders, in addition to the city’s developed ecosystem.\nMandarin Shipping chairman Tim Huxley said what the industry needed was clarity on policies.\n“There is always some turnover on flags but I don’t think many people are leaving because of the potential trade issues,” he said.\n“What we need before anything happens is clarity on tariffs and the rule about the Chinese-connected payments.”\nFrancis Lui Ting-ming, adjunct professor in the economics department at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said changing flags to another jurisdiction was not a long-term solution.\n“Shipowners registering in other countries might help temporarily, but I doubt that this makes any difference,” he said.\n“Trump wants shipbuilding to return to the US. So he will try hard to drag the fleet of ships made in China. It is easy for him to figure out that the registration place of a ship company is unimportant.\n“What matters is where the ships are actually produced.”\n\nThe mainland is a leading global commercial shipbuilding power. It built more commercial vessels by tonnage last year than the entire US shipbuilding industry has done since the end of World World II, according to a study by Washington-based think tank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.\nBeijing’s top official overseeing Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong, warned on Tuesday that the US “isn’t after our tariffs, it is after our very survival”.\nThe bureau said it saw opportunities for Hong Kong amid geopolitics.\n“The US tariffs are expected to reshape global trade and cargo flow patterns, presenting both challenges and opportunities for Hong Kong,” it said.\nIt noted that the city was known for being a “catch-up” port, as an ocean-going vessel had a turnaround time of one day on average compared with 1.94 days for the world’s top 20 container ports. Hong Kong was second to Kaohsiung in this regard.\nThe bureau also said the Hong Kong registered fleet was safe and reliable in terms of quality. It said the detention rate under the port state control – a global inspection regime on vessel conditions and equipment compliance – averaged 0.69 per cent in 2024, much lower than the world’s average of 3.3 per cent.\nHong Kong’s rate is within the top three lowest among the 10 largest flag administrations.\n“This reflects the unrivalled degree of safety and reliability of the fleet of Hong Kong registered ships, as well as important contributions of Hong Kong to international navigation safety and standards,” the bureau said.\nThe government would continue to foster a facilitating environment for the maritime industry and raise its competitiveness through tax concessions, clarity, certainty and transparency in policies, it said.","summary":"Industry sources say some shipowners are preparing exit plans to mitigate rising geopolitical risks.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3306823/some-hong-kong-based-shipowners-seeking-safer-havens-us-tariffs-insiders","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/17/42dfa3be-7df3-48a8-974d-8368313a791d_7ea26767.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:30:08","author":"Denise Tsang","authors":["Denise Tsang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.033},{"id":311926630,"title":"Sinners Is Michael B.

The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung says the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.What is contempt of court?Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\" As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant — in this case, potentially a federal official — willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.What happens next in this case?Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases. Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.","summary":"A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-happens-if-judge-boasberg-holds-trump-in-contempt-el-salvador-deportations/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/16/9ada26d3-813b-4cf4-ba46-9bda3cdf856c/thumbnail/1200x630/b368760a8fd0231e20da448dda57ef2a/cbsn-fusion-trump-administration-memo-says-us-send-non-criminal-migrants-guantanamo-bay-thumbnail.jpg?v=412b48b2e","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3654017_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:29:13","author":"Joe Walsh","authors":["Joe Walsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":311926634,"title":"Trump joins Japanese tariff talks as America aims to lock in trade deal","text":"President Donald Trump inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials on Wednesday.\n\nThe president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.\n\nThe move signals the fragile position now faced by the US after the new trade rules caused stock markets to plunge around the world.\n\nSince the US imposed trade rules on a slew of foreign nations, America has been forced to reassure its public that the government was working to lock in deals with world leaders around the globe.\n\n“Hopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!” Mr Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting.\n\nAfterwards, he posted: “A Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!”\n\nThe president’s choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalise deals with other nations such as China, with the Asian superpower pursuing its own set of agreements.\n\nIt is an open test of Mr Trump’s reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit potential damage unleashed by his import taxes.\n\nThe sweeping tariffs, announced on April 2 by Mr Trump, triggered fears of a global recession, which saw the US president implement a partial 90-day hold on import taxes.\n\nHe also increased his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.\n\nThe pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminium exports.\n\nWith Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries’ goods and having a long-standing alliance with the US, the Wednesday talks are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies.\n\nChina is trying to capitalise on the turmoil around Trump’s announcements, with President Xi Jinping touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner.\n\nJapan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the US.\n\nMr Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been “ringing off the hook” with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends.\n\nIsrael and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but the president has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient.\n\nOn Thursday, he is scheduled to meet Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs placed on the 27-state group.\n\nThe president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs, with voters saying they returned him to the White House in order to improve the economy, not to worsen it.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit on Wednesday, which argues Mr Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos.\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that Mr Trump’s tariff policies would hurt the US economy.\n\nMr Powell’s move signals a direct warning to the White House, which is trying to pitch import taxes to the American public as a long-term positive for the country.\n\n“The level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” Mr Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.\n\nJapan, like many other nations trying to minimise the possible economic fallout from Trump’s tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Mr Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-joins-japanese-tariff-talks-002417976.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1qBBrOel1mNMdJq.d7Oe2A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_704/0a6ea6c4b8577ad05483ec32aa5b5322","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:24:17","author":"Associated Press Reporters","authors":["Associated Press Reporters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.16},{"id":311925892,"title":"Sen. Warren Introduces Bill to Tighten Ethics Standards for Musk and Other Special Government Employees","text":"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has announced new legislation that will subject Elon Musk and other “special government employees” (SGEs) to the same ethics rules as other federal employees. \n\nWarren said the legislation was prompted by Musk’s close advisory access to President Donald Trump, coupled with the fact that Musk’s companies have been the recipients of billions in government contracts and subsidies for over a decade.\n\nHer proposed legislation aims to prevent conflicts of interest by preventing SGEs from communicating with government agencies whose work overlaps with their business interests. \n\nThe bill “would apply standard ethics rules to SGEs starting on the SGE’s 61st day in government,” would require the Office of Government Ethics to sign off on any conflict-of-interest waivers issued to SGEs, and make such waivers public. \n\nA fact sheet on the bill states that “While most ethics laws for regular federal employees apply to SGEs, some apply more loosely and others do not apply at all.”\n\nIt would also allow public access to some SGE financial disclosures and require the Office of Personnel Management to keep a list of which federal workers are designated as SGEs. \n\nRelated StoriesHouse Democrats Warn Elon Musk Must Leave Government Role After 130 Days4/10/20259 Charts to Put DOGE Efforts in Perspective4/11/2025\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Sens.

Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) has introduced a similar bill in the House. \n\nThe legislation would need to pass both chambers of a Republican-controlled Congress, and survive an inevitable veto when it reached the desk of President Donald Trump. \n\nMusk, a tech mogul and owner of Tesla, X, and SpaceX, was designated an SGE by Trump at the start of his second term. He spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked by the president with reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy, and eliminating “waste, fraud, and abuse” in government spending. \n\nWhile supporters of the Trump administration’s effort to cut costs and tackle the national debt applaud DOGE’s work, the agency and Musk have faced criticisms from Democratic officials, a wave of protests, and dozens of lawsuits. \n\nHis frequent posts on X, highlighting DOGE’s findings of government waste and hinting that agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development should be shuttered, have drawn fire, literally. Tesla factories and vehicles have become frequent targets of arson and vandalism in recent months. \n\nFederal regulations state that SGEs may only serve under that designation for 130 days during any 1-year period. After that period ends, their status as SGEs is reevaluated, and they may become subject to stricter disclosure and ethics standards.\n\nOver 70 House Democrats signed an April 9 letter seeking assurance from Trump that Musk would indeed leave the government after his term expires. So far, the White House has given no public reply on the matter. \n\nWarren, along with other Democratic lawmakers, has been a perennial critic of Musk, especially his work to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and transfer its functions to other agencies. The bureau, which Warren helped create in 2011, works to regulate financial entities like credit card companies and lending agencies. \n\nMusk has not publicly responded to Warren’s proposed legislation as of publication time.","summary":"The bill would make these employees subject to stricter conflict-of-interest and disclosure rules.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sen-warren-introduces-bill-to-tighten-ethics-standards-for-musk-and-other-special-government-employees-5842887","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/26/id5694193-GettyImages-1233338506-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:23:01","author":"Stacy Robinson","authors":["Stacy Robinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":311927222,"title":"Israel says 30 percent of Gaza turned into buffer zone","text":"Israel announced Wednesday it had converted 30 percent of Gaza into a buffer zone as it pressed its unrelenting military offensive, vowing to maintain its blockade on humanitarian aid to the war-ravaged territory.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also ordered security chiefs and negotiators to keep pressing for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, where Israel resumed air and ground attacks on 18 March, ending a two-month ceasefire.The United Nations said an estimated 500,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the end of the ceasefire, triggering what it has described as the most severe humanitarian crisis the territory has faced since the war started after the Hamas 7 October 2023 attacks.The Israeli military said that it had \"achieved full operational control over several key areas and routes throughout the Gaza Strip.\"\"Approximately 30 percent of the Gaza Strip's territory is now designated as an Operational Security Perimeter.\"It added that Israeli air strikes had hit \"approximately 1,200 terror targets\" and that \"more than 100 targeted eliminations have been carried out\" since 18 March.Defence Minister Israel Katz said this month that the military was leaving Gaza \"smaller and more isolated.\"Israeli officials have repeatedly said that military pressure was the only way to force Hamas to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza.'No aid for Gaza' On Wednesday, Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad released a video of an Israeli-German hostage, showing him appealing to Israeli authorities and US President Donald Trump to secure his release.His family and Israeli media identified him as Rom Braslavski from Jerusalem, who was abducted at the Nova music festival during the Hamas attack on Israel.In parallel to the Gaza offensive, Hamas said Israel had proposed a new 45-day ceasefire through mediators which would include the release of dozens of hostages.Netanyahu met hostage negotiators and security chiefs on Wednesday and \"issued directives for the continuation of the steps to advance the release of our hostages,\" his office said in a statement.The proposal also called for Hamas to disarm to secure a complete end to the war, the militant group said. A senior Hamas official, Mahmoud Mardawi, told AFP that the group was still preparing a response to Israel's document but insisted Hamas \"weapons will not be subject to any negotiations.\"Katz announced that Israel would continue preventing aid from entering the besieged territory of 2.4 million people.Israel halted the entry of aid on 2 March, exacerbating the territory's humanitarian crisis.\"Blocking this aid is one of the main pressure levers preventing Hamas from using it as a tool with the population,\" the defense minister said.Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said Israeli military operations and the aid blockade had transformed Gaza into a graveyard.\"Gaza has been turned into a mass grave of Palestinians and those coming to their assistance,\" said MSF coordinator Amande Bazerolle.\"With nowhere safe for Palestinians or those trying to help them, the humanitarian response is severely struggling under the weight of insecurity and critical supply shortages,\" she said.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs gave a new estimate that \"about half a million people have been newly displaced or uprooted once more\" in Gaza since 18 March, having earlier warned that Gaza was facing its most severe humanitarian crisis since the war began.ICJ hearings Israel controls the entry of aid and supplies to Gaza.On 28 April, the International Court of Justice is to open hearings on Israel's humanitarian obligations towards Palestinians.The UN General Assembly approved a resolution in December requesting that the court in The Hague give an advisory opinion on the matter.It calls on the ICJ to clarify what Israel is required to do to \"ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival of the Palestinian civilian population.\"Although ICJ decisions are legally binding, the court has no concrete way of enforcing them.Israel continued to pound Gaza on Wednesday.At least 11 people were killed in air strikes, 10 of them in an attack on Gaza City, the civil defence agency said.The renewed assault has killed at least 1,652 people in Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory reported, bringing to 51,025 dead, mostly civilians, since the war erupted.The 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/17/israel-says-30-percent-of-gaza-turned-into-buffer-zone","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-04-16/lj5wim8a/00042H78WE.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:22:24","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":311929952,"title":"Trump and U.S. trade war take spotlight in French leaders’ debate","text":"In the French language election debate Wednesday night, the four main federal party leaders were asked to lay out policy priorities that have nothing with the United States.\n\nBut the conversation quickly turned to the elephant in the room — Donald Trump — and how the leaders would deal with the U.S. president.\n\nThe leaders began the debate by sparring over how to respond to the trade war with the United States and pitching themselves as the best one to negotiate with Trump.\n\nPoilievre said that on his first day in office, he would open negotiations with Trump on an agreement put an end to tariffs.\n\n“We can’t control Trump. So at the same time, we need to control what we can,” Poilievre said.\n\n“That means reversing the Liberal economic policies which have weakened our country, unlocking out (natural) resources, cut taxes, bring jobs here to face Trump with strength.”\n\nLiberal Leader Mark Carney said Canada needs to plan for the worst-case scenario and have a strategy to build a stronger economy.\n\n“It’s those elements that will work with Trump. He respects strength, he respects people who know how the world and the private sector works,” Carney said.\n\n“Canada has to create other options, new international trade partners, and that’s what I promise.”\n\nBloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said Canada needs to align with countries that are being affected by U.S. tariffs and “negotiate rationally.”\n\n“Trump will hang himself with his own cord because his measures are extremely toxic to the U.S. economy,” he said. “In the meantime, he will also create damage everywhere.”\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Canada needs to prioritize what matters most and invest rather than cut.\n\n“Like our agriculture, our culture, our French language; not sacrifice it,” Singh said.\n\n“A profound value for us is taking care of each other. How we do that is reinforcing our health-care system, not Americanizing it.”\n\nThe party leaders were also asked which U.S. products they’ve cut from their daily lives.\n\nAll other party leaders took a dig at Carney by saying they no longer buy U.S. strawberries. In a recent interview with a Quebec talk show, when asked if he still buys U.S. strawberries, Carney said he doesn’t buy his own groceries.\n\n“No more wine, no more American alcohol,” Carney said.\n\n“I do my own groceries, and I cook myself. So lots of fruit,” Singh said.\n\n“This is a delicious conversation,” Poilievre quipped, adding he buys Canadian beef.\n\nEarlier in the debate, Carney cited his promises to double housing construction, while Poilievre vowed to cut income taxes and the GST on new homes.\n\nBlanchet said Quebec should have the right to run its own economy, using its own natural resources. Singh prioritized health care, noting his party’s efforts to secure dental and pharmacare programs under the previous government.\n\nThe first of the election’s two debates is structured around five key topics: the cost of living, energy and climate, the trade war, identity and sovereignty, and immigration and foreign affairs.\n\nThe Green party was removed from the debate earlier Wednesday after fielding candidates in less than 70 per cent of ridings.","summary":"In the French language election debate Wednesday night, the four main federal party leaders were asked to lay out policy priorities that have nothing with the United States.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11136463/canada-election-french-debate/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/canada-election-french-debate.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:21:35","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Canadian Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.152},{"id":311925184,"title":"U.S. IRS planning to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status amid Trump feud: report","text":"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is making plans to rescind the tax-exempt status of Harvard University, CNN reported on Wednesday (April 16, 2025), citing two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nA final decision on rescinding the university's tax exemption is expected soon, CNN added.\n\nThe report comes a day after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to strip the university of its tax-exempt status and said Harvard should apologize after the school rejected what it called unlawful demands to overhaul academic programs or lose federal grants.\n\nSpokespersons for the IRS and the U.S. Treasury, which oversees the tax collection agency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the CNN story.","summary":"A final decision on rescinding the university's tax exemption is expected soon, CNN added","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-irs-planning-to-rescind-harvards-tax-exempt-status-amid-trump-feud-report/article69459180.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/wj3uvd/article69459181.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-04-16T231335Z_767886453_RC2IYDAAPCEN_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-UNIVERSITIES-HARVARD.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:21:08","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":311925894,"title":"Celebrity Big Brother fans blast Patsy Palmer's 'disrespectful' behaviour after Trisha Goddard's eviction as JoJo Siwa calls her 'draining' to be around","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Apr 17th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCelebrity Big Brother fans blast Patsy Palmer's 'disrespectful' behaviour after Trisha Goddard's eviction as JoJo Siwa calls her 'draining' to be around\n\n Have YOU got a story?

Like, I think Patsy wanted it to go the other way, and I think jack doesn't care.\n\nHowever, Patsy appeared visibly unhappy with the outcome, telling her fellow housemates that she wished she had been the one to leave (pictured with JoJo Siwa)\n\nShe also pretended to speak to her children through a banana as if it were a phone, adding: 'Listen be home soon' \n\nHowever, viewers were left unimpressed with her behaviour, flocking to X (formerly Twitter) to express their outrage\n\nWhile another fan rushed to Patsy's defence saying it is 'okay for her to miss her family' as she has been away from them for a long time\n'I would literally give my right arm to stay in here till the end. I am having the best time, I'm loving it. \nShe continued: 'I was watching tonight - I was watching Patsy - and I was like, \"I cannot fathom feeling like that\"\n'I know Patsy wished she'd gone home. And I think that's really hard to see, because there are so many people that do want to be here, and be here till the end.' \n'I think she's an angel, but I find it the hardest to be close to Patsy.' \n'I feel like every time I talk to Patsy I feel down, I feel down after. Maybe it's just her tone... I just feel like she's sad.' \nIt comes after Trisha became the second housemate to be evicted from Celebrity Big Brother 2025. \nThe veteran broadcaster had signed up for the ITV show to prove to patients they should 'not be scared of living' after being diagnosed with terminal stage four cancer.\nBut after going head-to-head with Patsy and Jack P. Shepherd in the public vote, Trisha received the fewest number of votes to be saved, and so bid farewell after nine days on the show. \n\nLater in the episode, JoJo Siwa, 21, also opened up in the Diary Room, revealing that she finds it 'hard' to connect with Patsy\n\nShe said: 'I think she's an angel, but I find it the hardest to be close to Patsy. I feel like every time I talk to Patsy I feel down, I feel down after. Maybe it's just her tone... I just feel like she's sad'\nAs Trisha headed out of the house, the presenter herself also admitted she was 'a bit sad' to be leaving the show.\nSpeaking to hosts AJ Odudu and Will Best, Trisha brushed off the housemates' reasons for nominating her, especially Chesney Hawkes' that conversations with her felt like being on her talk show.\nShe said: 'That's actually a great compliment... No because we all said we were all scratching around in the dirt to find something negative to stay around each other.' \nThe star also reflected on her decision to sign up for the show, admitting it was a welcome break for her from cancer treatment.\nShe added: 'Really, it meant a lot, it meant a lot, it was respite it was a holiday from having to think about cancer, because with the BB team and with my team in the Stes so I didn't have to think of the next scan, and I could be like a child again.\n\nIt came after Trisha became the second housemate to be evicted from Celebrity Big Brother 2025, after losing out to Jack P Shepherd and Patsy in the public vote\n\n Who left Celebrity Big Brother? Trisha Goddard is evicted from the house after sparking race row by accusing Michael Fabricant of 'Islamophobia' \n'Yes I did talk about cancer because I had to, and it is part of my life, as it is for 3.4 million Brits. It was just a break from having to think about it.\n'Heavy subjects came up now and again, but it was just a break!'\nTrisha received her terminal diagnosis 20 months ago and received palliative care while in the house.\nTrisha has secondary breast cancer - meaning the disease started in the breast and spread to another part of the body - for which there is treatment but no cure.\nIn February last year, she revealed her cancer had returned after previously being given the all-clear.\nAs well as having her own private room during her stay in the house, the broadcaster had with her 'a bag full of meds' amid her ongoing cancer treatment.\nCelebrity Big Brother airs every night on ITV1, except on Saturday nights. \n\nCELEBRITY BIG BROTHER 2025: MEET THE LINEUP!\n\nMICKEY ROURKE - AXED\n\nFAMOUS FOR: The actor and former pro boxer is one of the show's biggest ever signings and after public feuds with Robert De Niro, two marriages and a string of high profile relationships, he will be bringing plenty of drama.\nDALEY THOMPSON\n\nFAMOUS FOR: The double Olympic gold-medallist is considered one of Britain's greatest athletes. He broke the decathlon world record four times.\n\nPATSY PALMER\n\nFAMOUS FOR: It's an open secret that Patsy is leaving EastEnders, with the actress enjoying a wild leaving party this month. The Bianca Jackson star posted a snap of her character on Instagram with the caption: 'Bye bye B, always grateful to see her again.'\nDONNA PRESTON\n\nFAMOUS FOR: While Donna has featured in several TV shows and movies, the comedy star is known for hosting Apocalypse and for the role of a circus Compere in 2018's Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald.

His arrival on CBB has been described by a TV source as 'perfect timing', as he's just released a comeback album\nANGELLICA BELL\n\nFAMOUS FOR: The TV presenter is said to have landed a staggering five-figure deal to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. Fans will be keen to see if the CBBC legend spills all on her untimely exit from The Martin Lewis Show - which left fans baffled back in 2023. Angellica currently co-presents Hits Radio while Fleur East is on maternity leave.\n\nDANNY BEARD \n\nFAMOUS FOR: The RuPaul's Drag Race UK winner - whose real name is Daniel Curtis - has signed up as a late entry. Danny previously made headlines after swearing on Big Brother's Late & Live last March whilst doing an impression of housemate Louis Walsh. The incident saw the guest say the word 'c***' before immediately apologising after being informed they weren't allowed to say that on the show.\n\nCHRIS HUGHES\n\nFAMOUS FOR: After shooting to fame on Love Island in 2017, Chris went on to become a sports presenter and regularly hosts the horse racing coverage on ITV.\n\nFAMOUS FOR: The American singer, who shot to stardom on reality show Dance Moms, is expected to draw a big American audience.

SHEPHERD\n\nFAMOUS FOR: The actor has played David Platt in Corrie since 2000 and is following in his pal Colson Smith's footsteps by taking part in the popular reality show. He has won a string of awards for the role including Best Actor at the British Soap Awards.\nELLA RAE WISE \n\nFAMOUS FOR: Producers have been keen to land the TV personality, who previously dated Pete Wicks and has had an on-off romance with Dan Edgar. Bosses are hoping the TOWIE star might reveal all about some of her other famous exes.\nMICHAEL FABRICANT - OUT\n\nFAMOUS FOR: The former Conservative politician is understood to have signed a lucrative six-figure deal to take part after political stars were banned from the broadcaster's other reality show, I'm A Celeb.

While discussing the recent court battle over the deportation of illegal migrant Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, Gutfeld said Democrats can’t help but “pick the wrong” side to support.\n\n“It’s amazing you look at the mother, and then you can hear [Senator Chris] Van Hollen’s words about who the most vulnerable is — he’s talking about the gangbanger. The effing Democrats. You can offer them two sides, and they can’t help but pick the wrong one,” Gutfeld said.\n\n“For years we’ve dealt with unfettered illegal immigration, with consequences felt in our cities and in our morgues. Now we stop it, and who do they side with? An illegal with a history of violence who beats women. Good job Dems. You never fail us,” Gutfeld added. “Whether it’s Antifa, BLM, Hamas — is there any dirtbag that you won’t embrace for political reasons? How many traps do the Democrats and the media lead people into? It always ends the same way.”\n\nIn March, Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, with a lower court later ordering officials to bring the illegal migrant back. While members of the administration brought the case to the Supreme Court and admitted he was deported due to an “administrative error,” they argued he would pose a danger if returned, as he is allegedly connected to MS-13. (RELATED: DOJ Releases Dossier Of Deported Maryland Man’s Alleged MS-13 Gang Ties)\n\nThe Supreme Court, on April 10, ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s “release from custody in El Salvador” and “ensure that his case is handled as it would have been” before he was sent to the foreign country.\n\nGutfeld went on to discuss instances where legacy media and Democrats reportedly got it wrong. These examples include liberals claiming that border agents whipped migrants. One time, they likened Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to Nazis and Hitler. On another occasion, liberals insisted that Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop was fake.\n\n“Do you notice this? How long are you going to put up with this crap where they lead you down a path for a political reason, and you find out you’re in quicksand? What is more repulsive to me is how the media still thinks it can decide what your priorities are, what people in the world you should care about,” Gutfeld said. “They plant this idea of this one man in your head and say, ‘Why don’t you care about them?'”\n\nMaryland Democrat Sen. Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador on Thursday in an attempt to meet with the illegal migrant, who is being held in a mega-prison. After his arrival, though, the Salvadoran government denied him entry into the facility.\n\n“All this is scoring symbolic virtue points that Democrats pick and choose their victims based on how it helps them politically and how it can be exploited for public sentiment. But every person at home, you know the concentric circles of caring — you, your family, your friends, your neighbors, your community,” Gutfeld said.\n\n“A creep from El Salvador, he can’t jump that line,” Gutfeld added. “This is a border that he can’t cross, and every time the libs try to cross that border into your house you have to fight back. I’m so happy that we got this truth out there and shut all these people up.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Planning a trip to El Salvador to bring an illegal alien with MS-13 terrorist connections back to Maryland. Shameful,” Harris wrote on X.\n\nGov.

He is an illegal immigrant. El Salvador is his home — not Maryland.”\n\nThe White House and several prominent Republicans also weighed in. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Democrats are “flying to El Salvador to demand the return of a violent illegal alien MS-13 gang member.”\n\nTrump White House communications director Steven Cheung added, “Chris and his bedwetting friends have shown more concern and sympathy for an illegal MS-13 gang member than victims of horrific migrant crimes. He is a complete disgrace to his office.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security echoed that criticism in a statement, saying, “Senator Van Hollen has done more to bring an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, and illegal alien back to Maryland than he has to help keep his constituents safe.”\n\nSen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) also posted, “All of this is so bizarre. America is not his home. El Salvador is.”\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz added, “Democrats miss Biden’s open borders so much they are flying to El Salvador to personally try and bring violent criminals to the United States.”\n\nCHRIS VAN HOLLEN ATTEMPTS TO MEET KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA\n\nThe government of El Salvador prevented Van Hollen on Wednesday from visiting Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. \n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who met with President Donald Trump earlier this week, stated that his government has no intention of releasing Abrego Garcia from the prison where he is being held.","summary":"Rep.

They have the pieces, and one day they could eventually put them together,\" Mr. Grossi told French newspaper Le Monde in an interview published on Wednesday.\n\n\"There's still a way to go before they get there. But they're not far off, that has to be acknowledged,\" he said.\n\nThe UN watchdog was tasked with overseeing Iran's nuclear programme and its compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal which collapsed three years later when the United States withdrew from it during President Donald Trump's first term.\n\n\"It's not enough to tell the international community 'we don't have nuclear weapons' for them to believe you. We need to be able to verify,\" said Mr. Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nHe arrived on Wednesday in Tehran and met Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. He is also expected to meet Mohammad Eslami, who heads Iran's nuclear energy agency.\n\nMr. Grossi described his meeting with Araghchi as \"important\".\n\n\"Cooperation with IAEA is indispensable to provide credible assurances about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme at a time when diplomacy is urgently needed,\" he said on X.\n\nMr. Grossi's visit comes ahead of a second round of talks between Iran and the United States on Saturday, a week after the two countries held their highest-level talks since Trump abandoned the nuclear deal in 2018.\n\nBoth sides called the first meeting \"constructive\".\n\n 'Conflicting positions'\n\nEarlier, Araghchi said Iran's enrichment of uranium under its nuclear programme was \"non-negotiable\" after U.S/ Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff called for it to end.\n\n\"Iran's enrichment is a real, accepted matter,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"We are ready to build confidence in response to possible concerns, but the issue of enrichment is non-negotiable.\"\n\nHis remarks came after Mr. Witkoff said Tuesday that Iran must \"stop and eliminate\" enriching uranium as part of any nuclear deal.\n\nThe day before, Mr. Witkoff had urged only that Iran return to the 3.67 percent enrichment ceiling set by its 2015 accord with major powers.\n\nIn its latest report, the IAEA said Iran had an estimated 274.8 kilos (605 pounds) of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent.\n\nThat level far exceeds the ceiling set by the 2015 deal, but still falls short of the 90 percent threshold required for a nuclear warhead.\n\nAfter returning to office in January, Trump reimposed sweeping sanctions against Iran under his \"maximum pressure\" policy.\n\nIn March, he wrote to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging talks but also warning of possible military action if these fail to produce a deal.\n\nAhead of Saturday's new round of talks, Araghchi condemned what he called the Trump administration's \"contradictory and conflicting positions\". \n\n\"We will find out the true opinions of the Americans during the negotiation session,\" he said.\n\nAraghchi said he hoped to start negotiations on the framework of a possible agreement, but that this required \"constructive positions\" from the United States.\n\n\"If we continue to (hear) contradictory and conflicting positions, we are going to have problems,\" he warned.\n\nIran's 'red lines'\n\nOn Wednesday, Iranian state media said Saturday's talks would be held in Rome with Omani mediation, as an Italian spokesman also confirmed the location.\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign ,inister, Kazem Gharibabadi, affirmed to state TV late Wednesday that the talks would be held in Rome.\n\nHe also noted that Iran's request is that \"if the other party is serious about the negotiations, they should come with logical requests, not unrealistic ones,\" referring to recent remarks by Witkoff about enrichment.\n\nAraghchi is set to head to Iran's ally Russia on Thursday, Tehran's ambassador in Moscow Kazem Jalili said.\n\nIran has said the visit was \"pre-planned\", but will include discussions on the Iran-US talks.\n\n\"The objective of (my) trip to Russia is to convey a written message from the supreme leader\" to President Vladimir Putin, Araghchi said.\n\nAhead of Saturday's talks, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he hoped a deal could be reached with the United States, the official IRNA news agency reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, Khamenei cautioned that while the talks went well in their early stages, they could still prove fruitless.\n\n\"The negotiations may or may not yield results,\" he said, noting that Iran had already outlined its \"red lines\".\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards have said the country's military capabilities are off-limits in the talks. \n\nAnd late on Sunday, IRNA said Iran's regional influence and its missile capabilities -- both sources of Western concern -- were also among its \"red lines\".","summary":"The UN watchdog was tasked with overseeing Iran's nuclear programme and its compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal which collapsed three years later when the United States withdrew

City, Vietnam – Kieu Quoc Thanh, the CEO of cashew export business SVC Group, says that everyone in his industry has been “feeling crazy” for the past two weeks.\n\nSince United States President Donald Trump announced his since-paused “reciprocal” tariffs on April 2, Thanh has witnessed mass confusion among Vietnamese exporters.\n\nMany businesses reliant on the US market are checking online hourly for updates on the tariffs, Thanh says, while he has a shipping container full of cashews bound for the US market currently sitting in limbo.\n\nSince Trump announced a 90-day pause on Vietnam’s 46 percent tariff and duties on dozens of other countries, the US has imposed a baseline 10 percent levy on imports from all countries, including Vietnam.\n\nBut Thanh’s customers in the US and customs officers alike are uncertain how much to tax his products, he says.\n\n“No one knows what’s happening,” Thanh told Al Jazeera at his Ho Chi Minh City office last week.\n\nWhile businesses such as Thanh’s navigate the disruption, Hanoi and Washington are in discussions about a trade deal after agreeing to begin negotiations on April 10.\n\nFor Vietnam, one of the world’s most export-reliant economies, the stakes could scarcely be higher.\n\nThe US is the Southeast Asian country’s biggest export market, with shipments to it alone last year accounting for 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nWhile Trump’s tariff pause led to some hope in Vietnam, the country is on tenterhooks about what might happen next, said Tyler Manh Dung Nguyen, chief market strategist at equity firm Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corporation.\n\n“We are having a period of extreme uncertainty, not only for the financial market, but also for businesses,” Nguyen told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s like a reality show,” Nguyen added. “Everything changes every day.”\n\nTrump’s trade salvoes have drawn sharp contrast with the decades-long process of warming relations between Washington and Hanoi, culminating in the former enemies upgrading their ties to a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership” in 2023.\n\nFor Eddie Thai, a Vietnamese American who co-founded the Ho Chi Minh City-based venture capital firm Ascend Vietnam Ventures, it has been disheartening to see relations come under strain, particularly ahead of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War on April 30.\n\n“I don’t think it has thrown us back 50 years, I wouldn’t say that far, but it is burning a lot of goodwill that a lot of people on both sides of the ocean have been trying to build since the 90s,” Thai told Al Jazeera, calling Trump’s dealing with Vietnam destructive and personally “disappointing as an American”.\n\nWith the US and Vietnam looking towards a trade deal, China, Hanoi’s biggest source of imports and its second-largest export destination, has loomed large over the negotiations.\n\nOn Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Hanoi as part of a five-day tour of Southeast Asia, a trip widely seen as an effort to cast China as a more reliable trading partner for the region than the US.\n\nUpon his arrival, Xi was greeted at the airport by Vietnamese President Luong Cuong, and later received a 21-gun salute at Hanoi’s Presidential Palace.\n\nReacting to the warm reception for the Chinese leader, Trump suggested the countries would use their talks to scheme against the US.\n\n“That’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, ‘How do we screw the United States of America?’” Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nAccording to Chinese state news outlet Xinhua, Xi urged Vietnam to resist “unilateral bullying” and stated that “China’s mega market is always open to Vietnam”.\n\nDuring Xi’s visit, the countries signed 45 agreements, Chinese and Vietnamese media reported, without providing details of the deals.\n\nWith the US and China slapping each other’s goods with tariffs exceeding 100 percent, Vietnam has become the “diplomatic guy in the middle,” said Nguyen, the strategist at Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corporation.\n\n“[Hanoi] always tries to be neutral in every situation,” Nguyen said. “We do not side with one country to fight another country.”\n\nUS trade deficit\n\nTrump’s tariffs have also raised the ire of foreign businesses based in Vietnam.\n\nIt would be an impossible task for Vietnam to erase its trade deficit with the US – the third-highest in 2024 at $123.5bn – given the differences between the two economies, said Bruno Jaspaert, general director of DEEP C Industrial Zones in the northern port town of Haiphong.\n\n“Any country like Vietnam, in reality, has no leverage against the States,” Jaspaert, who is also head of EuroCham Vietnam, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That stupid formula of theirs can never ever be balanced because it will take decades before Vietnam can buy enough,” Jaspaert said, referring to the controversial calculations used by the Trump administration to come up with its “reciprocal” tariff rates.\n\nFacing the threat of a huge economic blow, Hanoi has put considerable effort into getting into the good graces of the Trump administration.\n\nThe government has pledged to buy more Boeing planes and liquefied natural gas, and opened talks on purchasing C-130 cargo planes from Lockheed Martin.\n\nLast month, officials agreed to allow Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service to operate in the country on a trial basis.\n\nVietnam has also signed deals with the Trump Organization.\n\nShortly before Trump’s re-election, his holding company agreed to invest $1.5bn in a golf course and hotel project in Communist Party chief To Lam’s home province of Hung Yen.\n\n“I believe that the leadership in Hanoi – they have done a lot to secure a more lenient approach,” Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told Al Jazeera.\n\nTo Lam was one of the first foreign leaders to get on the phone with Trump after his April 2 tariff announcement and sent a delegation to Washington to negotiate with his administration on April 10.\n\nAmong his efforts to mollify Trump, To Lam has said he is willing to reduce tariffs on US goods to zero.\n\n“There is no alternative choice for Vietnam other than making peace with the US to secure access to the US market,” Giang said. “The Vietnamese must do what they can to preserve that access.”\n\nDespite the risks for Vietnam, some observers also see opportunities for the country in Trump’s trade war.\n\nIn the short term, businesses are ramping up production in order to get goods to the US in the next three months while the 10 percent tariff is still in place.\n\n“Quite a few people are planning to ship out a lot – 10 percent is still doable,” Jaspaert said. “If Trump wants to stand up to his promise, the tariffs will go up again … I don’t believe we’re out of the woods yet.”\n\nIn the longer term, Vietnam could again be a beneficiary of increased volatility between Washington and Beijing under Trump.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, the Southeast Asian country benefitted from an exodus of factories from China as businesses sought to lessen their exposure to geopolitical risks and trade barriers.\n\n“The real battle here is unashamedly the US against China,” Craig Martin, chairman of Ho Chi Minh City-based private equity firm Dynam Capital, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“You’ve got this uncertainty, this very heated trade war with eye-watering levels of tariffs [between Washington and Beijing].” “You could actually see a silver lining, being people looking to do more in Vietnam,” Martin added.\n\nVietnam has also been under US scrutiny for shipping goods from China into the US with minimal manufacturing undertaken in Vietnam.\n\nSuch scrutiny will likely push Vietnam to invest in more value-added manufacturing, said Nguyen, the market strategist.\n\n“I think there will be a mechanism that has to be agreed by both governments to control that – to make sure that there’s no transhipment,” he said. “I think that would actually be a good thing for Vietnam in the mid to long run.”\n\nLast week, the Reuters news agency reported that Hanoi was offering to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped to the US via its territory and to tighten controls on sensitive exports to China.\n\nThe report, which cited a person familiar with the matter and a government document, came after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro raised concerns that Chinese goods were being sent to the US with “Made in Vietnam” labels to avail of lower import taxes.\n\nThe US-China tensions could be a “golden opportunity” for Europe to increase its trade with Vietnam and for Hanoi to diversify its trade more broadly, Jaspaert said.\n\n“Vietnam has won all the wars it’s been in, so I believe it will also win the tariff war,” Jaspaert said.","summary":"The Southeast Asian country is hoping for a reprieve from 46 percent duty, which would pummel its

| Trump Joins Tariff Talks with Japan as US Seeks Deals Amid Trade Wars","text":"Washington, Apr 17 (AP) US President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals. The Republican president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.

Big Progress!” Also Read | US Vice President JD Vance, Second Lady Usha Vance To Visit India Early Next Week; To Meet PM Narendra Modi. The president's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It's an open test of Trump's reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes. The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145 per cent. The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24 per cent across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25 per cent tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports. With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9 per cent on other countries' goods and having a longstanding alliance with the US, the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies. US economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump's announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner. Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been “ringing off the hook” with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient. On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group. Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump's tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country. “The level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago. Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies. Although Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks. Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit. “Japan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and TRADE FAIRNESS,'” Trump posted on Wednesday. U.S. officials met in Washington with Japan's chief trade negotiator, Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa. “I am prepared for the talks,” Akazawa told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda Airport before boarding his flight. “I will negotiate in order to firmly protect our national interest.” He said that both Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are “known to be pro-Japan and professionally talented” and that he hopes to build a relationship of trust with them. “I believe we can have good talks toward a win-win relationship that will serve national interest for both Japan and the United States,” he said. Japan has contended that Trump's tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn't want concessions.

Pulte, who was appointed by Trump last month to be Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. \n\nThe letter states, “Based on media reports, Ms. Letitia James has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms. This has potentially included 1) falsifying residence status for a Norfolk, Virginia-based home in order to secure a lower mortgage rate and 2) misrepresenting property descriptions to meet stringent requirements for government backed loans and government assistance.”\n\nAccording to the letter, documents indicate that the Virginia property would be James’ “primary residence,” which could allow James to get “more favorable loan terms,” despite the fact that James was serving as New York attorney general at the time. \n\nThe Times, though, reports that the attorney general’s office provided it with a separate loan application in which James said that the property would not be her primary residence.\n\nThe letter also says that James misrepresented the number of units in the Brooklyn property, claiming it had four units while the original certificate of occupancy said it had five, a distinction Pulte’s letter states could allow James to get more favorable interest rates. A James spokesperson told the Times that a rider attached to the mortgage clarified that the building was four units.\n\nThe referral letter comes one day after Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media site, that James was “a totally corrupt politician” and a “wacky crook” and called for her to resign. \n\nThe accusations against James apparently originate from the “White Collar Fraud,” website, run by Sam E. Antar, a former executive with the “Crazy Eddie” electronics chain.\n\nMeanwhile, A CNN report says that James is looking into the way Trump’s recent pause on tariffs was handled, and whether insider trading occured.\n\nLast week, several Democratic lawmakers, including New York Sen. Charles Schumer, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether anyone in Trump’s administration profited from knowledge of the president’s April 9 announcement that tariffs were being put on hold ― an announcement that caused a stock market rally. Hours before he announced the pause, Trump posted on Truth Social that it was a “GREAT TIME TO BUY!!”\n\nBoth CNN and The New York Post reported that the inquiry was in its early stages and was not a full investigation yet.","summary":"Meanwhile, James is looking into potential insider trading connected with Trump's recent pause on tariffs.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2025/04/trump-administration-official-hits-ny-ag-letitia-james-with-mortgage-fraud-allegations.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/ZDAR5LDVABEJDPJ4HIMNLJFYTA.jpg?auth=14fba941d2378c95df229c678d0c86c67158355e1e4946b070155512df938ade&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:07:55","author":"George Owens","authors":["George Owens"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":311929608,"title":"Haley Joel Osment of Sixth Sense fame 'ARRESTED for public intoxication and possession' at ski resort","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Apr 17th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSignature of alien life 'found' 120 light years from Earth: Scientists detect signs of tell-tale biosignature of microbial life on ocean-covered planet that could be 'teeming with life'\n\nHistoric victory for women... and common sense: Judges rule that women are defined by biological sex - will Labour finally protect their rights?\n\nTrump's 'great' trade deal with Britain could be sealed 'in a matter of weeks'\n\nTV's richest stars and their whopping net worth - From Ant & Dec to a Daytime icon\n\nI know the devil, he's far more terrifying than in the movies... you can feel his power\n\nTop doctor warns cooking ingredient millions use is linked to aggressive breast cancer\n\nHow Louis Tomlinson and Zara McDermott REALLY feel about each other is revealed by body language expert\n\nI woke up one day and my mother was gone, never to be seen again.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy REBECCA LAWRENCE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:55 BST, 17 April 2025 |Updated:01:05 BST, 17 April 2025 \n\nBob Geldof famously sang 'to live in love is all there is; life without love is meaningless'.\nAnd it seems his daughters have heeded his message, going on to settle down and start families with men that have obtained their famous father's approval. \nGrowing up, Fifi, Pixie and Peaches - Bob's children with late wife Paula Yates - and his adopted daughter Tiger-Lily, faced unbearable tragedy with the loss of their mother in 2000 and then sister Peaches 14 years later. \nAs part of one of Britain's most famous families, the siblings once lived their lives in the spotlight, but in the wake of their tragic loss, the brood opted to focus on family and step away from the limelight. \nRecently, Bob's youngest daughter Tiger-Lily - who Paula conceived with the late Michael Hutchence - made headlines when it emerged she had secretly tied the knot with her boyfriend of two years Ben Archer.\nBob - who married French actress Jeanne Marine following Paula's death - was said to be in attendance, watching on proudly as the last of his daughters married. \nIt was a much more understated affair than the other Geldof weddings, however, hammering home the message that the Geldof girls no longer wish to live their life in the spotlight. \n\nHow Bob Geldof's daughters have all found love with creative men who enjoy low-key lifestyles after growing up in the spotlight (L-R Fifi, Tiger Lily, Pixie and Peaches in 2004)\n\nBob - who married French actress Jeanne Marine (pictured in 2023) following Paula Yate's death - was said to be in attendance, watching on proudly as the last of his daughters married.\nThe eldest of the Geldof brood, Fifi, 42, married sand sculptor Andrew Robertson in 2016. \nHe describes himself as an ‘artist and busker’ and runs an organisation called Dirtybeach, which creates sand sculptures on beaches to make sometimes light-hearted political and environmental points.\nAndrew once appeared on Dragons’ Den, dressed in a red kilt, with the intention of asking for £100,000 of funding to build litter-removing robots.\nThe producers edited out his idea, screening only his bid for £22,000 for a pop-up beach bar — which the Dragons turned down.\nHe told the investors he had been homeless in 2007 and had a ‘plethora’ of jobs. He even worked as a lap-dancer at Stringfellows. ‘I started out as an engineer,’ he said. ‘I was Father Christmas once.’\nIn 2014, the same year he proposed, he launched a bid for a political career, making enquiries with the Electoral Commission about registering his own political party.\nHe published a manifesto for his Beach Party, whose policies included legalising drugs, and providing free food, travel and education 'at any age, regardless of sex, age, race, religion or species'.\n'Your GP should have the power to prescribe you any drug you need, including cannabis and mushrooms for free,' he asserted just seven weeks after Fifi's younger sister Peaches died of a heroin overdose at 25.\n\nThe eldest of the Geldof brood, Fifi, 42, married sand sculptor Andrew Robertson in 2016 (pictured in 2013) \n\nAndrew describes himself as an ‘artist and busker’ and runs an organisation called Dirtybeach, which creates sand sculptures on beaches to make political and environmental points\n\n The normal, low-key lives of the Geldof sisters as they shun the spotlight following tragic past \nHis political career was short-lived, however. A Twitter account for his political party still remains, inactive, with 12 followers. \n In 2016, Andrew and Fifi tied the knot at St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence church in Kent. \nThe venue held particular significance for Fifi as it is the same church where her sister Peaches, who died of a drug overdose at the age of 25 in 2014, and mother, Paula Yates who suffered a similar fate, are buried.\nBob and Paula had a blessing in the church after their Las Vegas wedding in 1986 while Peaches married Thomas Cohen in the same venue in 2012.\nPR guru Fifi first announced her engagement ring in May 2014 with reports claiming the pair had been together for around one year before getting engaged.\nFifi originally told Mail On Sunday in May that her low-key wedding would be in stark contrast to the glitzy one enjoyed by Peaches and her rocker husband Thomas, four years prior.\nShe told Charlotte Griffiths: 'Unlike my dear late sister's wedding there won't be a magazine deal, nor pictures of me in a white dress.'\nFree-spirited Pixie, 34, met her husband George Barnett through their connections in the world of music and fashion. \n\nFree-spirited Pixie, 34, met her husband George Barnett through their connections in the world of music and fashion (pictured in 2024) \n\nGeorge, 37, is the drummer of band These New Puritans. The pair dated for five years before they wed in 2017 on the outskirts of the exclusive mountain-top town of Deia\nGeorge, 37, is the drummer of band These New Puritans, while Pixie works as a DJ and model.\nThe pair dated for five years before they wed in 2017 on the outskirts of the exclusive mountain-top town of Deia, in the gardens of a former monastery.\nFollowing the ceremony, the 150 guests - which included the likes of Daisy Lowe, Harry Styles and Nick Grimshaw - filtered out to the 70 tables set up in the grounds, where a night of live music followed.\nThey welcomed their first child - a daughter - in 2021 and opted not to reveal her name or exactly when she was born.\nThe youngest of the brood, Tiger-Lily made headlines this week when it emerged she had secretly married boyfriend, Ben Archer. \nThe singer, 28, who is expecting her first child with Ben, reportedly said 'I Do' in an intimate ceremony of 30 guests in in East London.\nAccording to The Sun, the couple - who met in 2023 - were 'keen to marry' ahead of the birth of their first child.\nThe newlyweds reportedly hired out a restaurant on Columbia Road and invited their closest family and friends.\n\nThe youngest of the brood, Tiger-Lily made headlines this week when it emerged the pregnant star had secretly married boyfriend, Ben Archer (pictured in March) \n\nAccording to the insider, Ben 'completely swept Tiger Lily off her feet' and he's 'everything she wants in a man'\n\nTiger Lily is the daughter of the late Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence.

(EPA Images pic)GAZA: Israel announced Wednesday it had converted 30% of Gaza into a buffer zone as it pressed its unrelenting military offensive, vowing to maintain its blockade on humanitarian aid to the war-ravaged territory.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also ordered security chiefs and negotiators to keep pressing for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, where Israel resumed air and ground attacks on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire.The UN said an estimated 500,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the end of the ceasefire, triggering what it has described as the most severe humanitarian crisis the territory has faced since the war started after the Hamas Oct 7, 2023 attacks.The Israeli military said that it had “achieved full operational control over several key areas and routes throughout the Gaza Strip”.“Approximately 30% of the Gaza Strip’s territory is now designated as an Operational Security Perimeter.”It added that Israeli air strikes had hit “approximately 1,200 terror targets” and that “more than 100 targeted eliminations have been carried out” since March 18.Defence minister Israel Katz said this month that the military was leaving Gaza “smaller and more isolated”.Israeli officials have repeatedly said that military pressure was the only way to force Hamas to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza.‘No aid for Gaza’On Wednesday, Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad released a video of an Israeli-German hostage, showing him appealing to Israeli authorities and US president Donald Trump to secure his release.His family and Israeli media identified him as Rom Braslavski from Jerusalem, who was abducted at the Nova music festival during the Hamas attack on Israel.In parallel to the Gaza offensive, Hamas said Israel had proposed a new 45-day ceasefire through mediators which would include the release of dozens of hostages.Netanyahu met hostage negotiators and security chiefs on Wednesday and “issued directives for the continuation of the steps to advance the release of our hostages,” his office said in a statement.The proposal also called for Hamas to disarm to secure a complete end to the war, the militant group said.A senior Hamas official, Mahmoud Mardawi, told AFP that the group was still preparing a response to Israel’s document but insisted Hamas “weapons will not be subject to any negotiations”.Katz announced that Israel would continue preventing aid from entering the besieged territory of 2.4 million people.Israel halted the entry of aid on March 2, exacerbating the territory’s humanitarian crisis.“Blocking this aid is one of the main pressure levers preventing Hamas from using it as a tool with the population,” the defence minister said.Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said Israeli military operations and the aid blockade had transformed Gaza into a graveyard.“Gaza has been turned into a mass grave of Palestinians and those coming to their assistance,” said MSF coordinator Amande Bazerolle.“With nowhere safe for Palestinians or those trying to help them, the humanitarian response is severely struggling under the weight of insecurity and critical supply shortages,” she said.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs gave a new estimate that “about half a million people have been newly displaced or uprooted once more” in Gaza since March 18, having earlier warned that Gaza was facing its most severe humanitarian crisis since the war began.ICJ hearingsIsrael controls the entry of aid and supplies to Gaza.On April 28, the International Court of Justice is to open hearings on Israel’s humanitarian obligations towards Palestinians.The UN General Assembly approved a resolution in December requesting that the court in The Hague give an advisory opinion on the matter.It calls on the ICJ to clarify what Israel is required to do to “ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival of the Palestinian civilian population”.Although ICJ decisions are legally binding, the court has no concrete way of enforcing them.Israel continued to pound Gaza on Wednesday.At least 11 people were killed in air strikes, 10 of them in an attack on Gaza City, the civil defence agency said.The renewed assault has killed at least 1,652 people in Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory reported, bringing to 51,025 dead, mostly civilians, since the war erupted.The 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.","summary":"The Jewish state vows to keep aid blocked to force Hamas into agreeing to a deal for hostage

Spent Segment After Segment On Abrego Garcia","text":"Two Maryland stories involving illegal immigration made national news this week. On Monday, a Maryland jury found Salvadoran illegal immigrant Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez guilty of the rape and murder of Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five from Bel Air. The other story involves Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant who a U.S. district judge ruled the Trump administration deported illegally to El Salvador. However, viewers of ABC, NBC, and CBS are likely only aware of the second story. According to a new NewsBusters study, the three broadcast networks have spent zero – zero! – seconds covering the Morin case. Meanwhile, over the past two weeks, they have spent more than 64 minutes covering Garcia, whom they largely refer to as a \"Maryland man.\" \"Disgusting,\" Donald Trump Jr. called the disparity in coverage. And we all know the reason why. The heinous killing of Morin emphasizes the danger in which Joe Biden's mindless open-border policy put Americans. In fact, Morin's family and family attorney both called out the Biden administration this week for its negligence. \"They caught him… three times at the border,\" the attorney said. \"I'm very angry, I'm actually outraged ... There was no action on the Democrat Party in any way. From Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mayorkas…none of the [Maryland] Senators did anything to help search for the murderer of my daughter,\" Morin's mother told Fox News. Apparently, the broadcast networks didn't find the mother's comments worthy of a mention. Conversely, the networks see Garcia's deportation as an opportunity to frame Trump as evil and inhumane. The report also noted the networks neglected to focus on several details related to Garcia – such as his suspected gang affiliations, the details of his 2019 arrest, and the credible evidence linking him to MS-13. Put simply, the networks are not trying to report on illegal immigration honestly or even accurately. They have an agenda. Mentioning Rachel Morin makes Trump's border policy look good. Framing the Garcia story the way the networks have makes Trump look bad. And thus, expect the disparate coverage of the two Maryland illegal immigration cases to continue.","summary":"ABC, NBC, CBS won&apos;t mention Rachel Morin case but spend segment after segment on Abrego Garcia.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/abc-nbc-cbs-wont-mention-rachel-morin-case-spent-segment-after-segment-kilmar-garcia","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2210617513.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:00:45","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.478},{"id":311923678,"title":"Singapore election: why flight to safety over Trump tariffs may not weigh on voters","text":"As countries grapple with US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and a mounting trade war, Singapore will head to the polls where such global affairs are not expected to be top of mind for voters casting their ballots on May 3.\nDomestic concerns such as the rising cost of living, jobs and housing are more likely to move the needle in an election where Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will seek a strong mandate as he helms the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) for the first time since taking office last May.\nWong will lead his band of fourth-generation leaders, commonly known as the 4G, with candidate introductions reported nearly daily as the city state counts down to the polls.\nThe PAP has dominated Singapore’s elections since 1959, before independence in 1965. It is among the longest-uninterrupted governing parties in history.\nWith the ongoing tariffs turmoil, Singapore’s open economy is especially vulnerable, authorities warn. But analysts say bread-and-butter issues weigh more heavily on voters’ minds and the trade war may not result in the electorate taking a flight-to-safety approach to the ballot in favour of the PAP.\n“Elections in Singapore tend to be a domestic affair, with the focus very much on local and municipal issues that are personal to the voter and less about foreign issues,” said Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior analyst at Solaris Strategies Singapore.\n“Singapore is not immune to the trade war, so the ruling party will emphasise it to the voters but I don’t think there is substantial mileage to gain from it.”\n\nNydia Ngiow, managing director at consulting firm BowerGroupAsia, meanwhile argued that global issues would only come into play if Singaporeans felt a direct hit.\n“Given that general elections in Singapore tend to focus on local issues, it is unlikely that geopolitics will become a major campaign theme – unless Singaporeans feel a direct and tangible impact on their cost of living, job security, or the broader economy,” Ngiow said.\nYet, independent political observer Felix Tan said: “There’s always the flight to safety, especially for those who have gone through and seen some very tough times. However, younger voters might not see the tariffs as dire conditions.”\nAnalysts also note that despite the last election in 2020 being held while Singapore was grappling with the dire threat of the Covid-19 pandemic, the opposition won a record 10 out of the 93 seats on offer.\n“At this point, the real-time effects of global tensions, such as the ongoing tariff war, are not as immediately felt as the pandemic once was. Even in 2020, when the PAP leaned heavily on this rhetoric, the results did not turn out as strongly in their favour as expected,” Ngiow said.\nTeo Kay Key, a research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies’ Social Lab, argued that even if the trade war posed a tangible bogeyman, it did not equate to a better result for the PAP.\n“Even if people feel fearful and uncertain for their futures, they might not feel that there is a need to fly to safety, and instead want to consider having more perspectives in parliament instead,” Teo said.\n\nAnalysts note that surveys conducted in the lead-up to the election writ announced on Tuesday regularly found cost-of-living concerns to be the biggest factor among voters.\nOn the cost pressures in Singapore, Bilveer Singh, associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, pointed out that these had been driven up by two consecutive goods and services tax (GST) rises from 7 per cent to 9 per cent in 2023 and last year, which would hurt the incumbent.\n“The worst-hit are the middle and lower classes which are the majority. The cost of living already shot up before the trade war began, so it will be difficult to sell the flight-to-safety argument and pin this all on Trump,” Singh said.\nTo alleviate cost pressures, Wong’s government unveiled a raft of relief measures as part of a S$143.1 billion (US$109 billion) budget in February that included vouchers for necessities, rebates for utilities and income tax, and gifts to commemorate Singapore’s 60th year of independence. Similar measures involving vouchers and payouts have been rolled out since the pandemic.\nOn February 28, responding to Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh’s questioning of policies during the budget debate, Wong stressed the GST increase did not lead to inflation “turbocharging”, pointing to price moderations after the tax rate was raised twice. He also said inflation was driven by global factors such as war and ensuing supply chain disruptions.\n‘The house never wins’\nYet Ngiow pointed out that these measures, while generous, were often seen as short-term relief.\n“This risks voter scepticism: people are impatient for long-term strategies to show results, yet quick to criticise perceived inaction, with support measures risking being viewed as a natural given. In this dichotomy, the house never wins,” Ngiow argued.\n\nAside from bread-and-butter issues, Bilveer Singh said cohesion would be another theme with some voters, especially those from the Muslim community.\n“The Muslim population is not a majority but they can make up 15 to 17 per cent in some areas and a lot of them haven’t been happy with the way the government has handled the situation in Gaza and how long it took them to address the comments made by Calvin Cheng,” he said.\nHe was referring to how Singapore’s top office holders, including Wong, took former nominated member of parliament Cheng to task nearly a month after he said on social media he would sponsor flying pro-Palestinian activists to Gaza “only if they never come back”.\nWong’s 60 per cent litmus test\nAnalysts say that while the PAP is expected to be returned to power, eyes will be on whether Wong can keep its vote share above 60 per cent – a mark achieved in every election since independence.\nIn 2020, the party clinched 61.23 per cent of the vote, slightly higher than the PAP’s worst performance in 2011 when it won 60.14 per cent amid unhappiness over an influx of foreigners, a housing shortage and transport breakdowns. Analysts had also suggested a stronger desire for opposition voices in parliament as the Workers’ Party won its first multi-seat constituency that year.\nThe PAP bounced back to 69.86 per cent in the 2015 election held following the death of Singapore’s first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and as the country celebrated 50 years of independence.\n\nAnalysts point out that each first general election for a new prime minister has not been their best performance. Every leadership transition, from Lee Kuan Yew to Goh Chok Tong, and from Goh to Lee Hsien Loong, has been marked by a dip from the previous polls.\nWong told local media last Saturday he did not have a target vote share and that he was expecting fierce competition across all wards.\nMustafa said this response was expected of the prime minister, as anything otherwise would hold him to the figure ahead of the polls. “There is some political realism from Lawrence Wong with what he hopes to get. Anything between 60 and 65 may be viewed as a reasonable electoral outcome for him.”\nThe PAP slate will be a fresh one, with Wong telling local media that at least 30 new faces will be fielded, the largest in recent history.\nTan argued that the fresh crop under a new prime minister made sense for the party to avoid waiting five years for some of the older MPs to retire.\nHowever, Bilveer Singh questioned whether such retirements could have caused unhappiness within the party.\n“There is no doubt that the PAP will be the government, two-thirds majority, [Wong] will be the prime minister on May 3, but what happens the day after? What if they only win by 58 per cent?” he said.\n“Will there be questions within the party about who caused the fall? This is how one-party dominance fails – fractionism, and moving people into retirement who are still capable.”\n\nThe freshness of the PAP slate, coupled with cost-of-living pressures and the opposition’s ability to attract high-calibre candidates, has led to analysts calling this the most hotly contested election in Singapore’s recent history.\nWhile the Workers’ Party has yet to unveil its full slate, leader Pritam Singh has suggested that it is necessary to prevent the PAP from having a two-thirds majority, which lets the party pass constitutional amendments. Should the Workers’ Party contest in a third of the 97 seats in this election, it would be the most candidates the party has ever fielded.\nIts potential candidates include a senior counsel, consultants and a senior principal clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health.\n“If you look at all the new faces in all the constituencies and how both the incumbent and the opposition seem to have been able to attract good candidates, this election is going to be hard fought,” Tan said.\nMeanwhile, Teo pointed out that opposition political parties were increasingly able to attract credible candidates to join their slate, which would shape voter perceptions.\nNgiow noted that while a wider range of choices was healthy for democracy, it remained to be seen if opposition parties could overcome the long-standing issues of fragmentation and infighting. “The possibility of more multi-cornered fights could dilute their impact – unless they can coordinate effectively and present themselves as a credible long-term alternative,” she said.\nRegardless, Mustafa expects the election to be one of the closest and most intense, given the slew of candidates and the political parties that have joined the fray.\n“This bodes well for the democratic development of Singapore,” he said.","summary":"Domestic issues and more perspectives in parliament likely to be on voters’ minds for next month’s election, analysts say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3306817/singapore-election-why-flight-safety-over-trump-tariffs-may-not-weigh-voters","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/16/a63c6526-5dbb-4315-82a6-32f7b2d0d006_4a64501d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:00:10","author":"Jean Iau","authors":["Jean Iau"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":311928968,"title":"Letitia James listed this Virginia house as her ‘primary residence’ — but neighbors say they’ve never seen her as NY AG faces mortgage fraud probe","text":"NORFOLK, Virginia — New York Attorney General Letitia James listed a Virginia home 300 miles from her office in New York City as her primary residence in official public documents, The Post can confirm — but neighbors said Wednesday that they’ve never seen her. \n\nThe modest three-bedroom, two bathroom house is now home to a woman and her daughter, who moved in just a few months ago, according to people in the neighborhood.\n\nBefore that, a “husband and wife” lived in the $240,000 house for about four years, said one neighbor, who has lived near the property for 18 years and asked not to be identified.\n\n“I’ve only met [the new resident] like maybe two or three times. She seemed really nice,” the neighbor added of the new residents. “The last time I saw her was, like, maybe a week or so ago and she was just outside smoking a cigarette and we were talking about her grandkids,” she said.\n\n“It might have been maybe a little bit more than three months that she moved in because it was just before,” the neighbor also said. “It’s definitely not a year.”\n\nThe 1,450-square-foot home is at the center of a federal criminal referral for mortgage fraud alleging James “falsified records” to get a more favorable loan rate when she purchased the residence in 2023 with her niece.\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte detailed these and other allegations of James playing fast and loose with residency requirements in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche obtained by The Post.\n\nThe referral also accused James, whose salary is $220,000, of misrepresenting the number of apartments for a building she owns in Brooklyn — saying it has four units, when NYC Department of Buildings records say it has five. That’s a key distinction because buildings with four or fewer units quality for mortgages with better terms.\n\n“Ms. James was the sitting Attorney General of New York and is required by law to have her primary residence in the state of New York — even though her mortgage applications list her intent to have the Norfolk, VA, property as her primary home,” the letter stated.\n\n“It appears Ms. James’ property and mortgage-related misrepresentations may have continued to her recent 2023 Norfolk, VA property purchase in order to secure a lower interest rate and more favorable loan terms,” Pulte wrote.\n\nPulte said this could amount to criminal charges, including wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution, among others.\n\nOn Wednesday, James’ office said she bought the Norfolk property with her niece. “Her niece lives in the home as a primary residence and the AG has been clear that she is not using the Virginia home as her primary residence, because she lives in New York,” the statement said.\n\nThe statement also lashed out at the Trump administration, saying “Donald Trump’s weaponization of the federal government continues to careen out of control – and now they are using cherry-picked information to attack the Attorney General. We will have more to share on these political attacks, but the AG and our office remain focused on protecting New Yorkers every single day.”\n\nThe embattled attorney general dodged reporters’ questions outside her Brooklyn home Wednesday morning.\n\nAsked about the case on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” Wednesday, Bondi said her office had only just received the referral. “We haven’t looked at it, of course we’ll be reviewing it. You just told me more than I’ve heard about it so far,” she told anchor Bill Hemmer.\n\nOutside the Norfolk property, a neighbor said his grandmother had lived in the community his entire life but that he had never seen James.\n\nJames — who infamously proclaimed “no one is above the law” when accusing President Trump of inflating the value of his properties for financial gain in 2019 — is now embroiled in a scandal involving the Virginia home, as well as her residence in Brooklyn.\n\nJames granted power of attorney to Shamice Thompson-Hairston to sign an Aug. 17, 2023, document authorizing the purchase of the Virginia property, for which they secured a $219,780 mortgage, according to legal filings.\n\nThe document was witnessed by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy and a New York state secretary, and notarized.\n\nPulte’s letter also raises questions about whether James lied about the number of units in a three-story brownstone she owns in Brooklyn.\n\nThe NYC Department of Buildings’ certificate of occupancy says the building has five units, but James said on both the deed and mortgage that it only has four.\n\nA dwelling with five or more units can only qualify for commercial loans under federal funding standards, meaning she likely would have gotten a better mortgage rate by representing the home as only containing four.\n\nJames’ office said, “The Attorney General has been clear in her financial filings that this is a 4 unit, owner-occupied building. The previous Certificate of Occupancy from January 2001 that lists it as a 5 unit building was filed by the previous owner before the Attorney General owned the home.”\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC’s “José Díaz-Balart Reports” Wednesday, Mayor Eric Adams said “It’s up to the investigative bodies to do an unbiased investigation,” calling James “a longtime friend” and wishing her well.\n\nAsked whether he believes the probe is being launched for political reasons, he said James herself should address that, noting that he believed former President Biden’s Justice Department was “politicized,” which Biden acknowledged as well as Trump.\n\n“It’s imperative that our criminal justice agencies do what’s right,” he said.\n\nCity Council Speaker and Democratic mayoral candidate Adrienne Adams was more blunt in her assessment of the motivation behind the criminal referral.\n\n“Letitia James has spent her career standing up to powerful interests and fighting for everyday New Yorkers. Now she’s being targeted by a president who abuses the power of the federal government to go after his enemies,” she told The Post.\n\nConservatives cheered James’ having to “eat her own words” after news of the probe broke, including former political rivals.\n\nMichael Henry, the GOP candidate who sought to unseat James as attorney general in 2022, turned her past statements against her in a statement to The Post.\n\n“No one is above the law. James has not denied the legitimacy of the documents. It should be investigated to the fullest extent of the law,” said Henry, who previously worked in the mortgage industry before becoming an attorney.\n\n“There are clearly some issues here.”\n\nAt best, he said “there was something miscommunicated on her behalf numerous times,” noting that even if James had a power of attorney, she should have read all of the documents in the property records — especially since she’s a lawyer and the attorney general.\n\nHenry said the whole affair is “certainly ironic” given that James prosecuted Trump over his business record.\n\n— Additional reporting by Carl Campanile and Haley Brown","summary":"Longtime neighbors of a house in Virginia owned by New York AG Letitia James said they never saw her there, despite claiming the three-bedroom home as her \"principal residence\" in 2023.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/us-news/letitia-james-listed-this-virginia-house-as-her-primary-residence-but-neighbors-say-theyve-never-seen-her-as-ny-ag-faces-mortgage-fraud-probe/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/nyag-letitia-james-virginia-neighbors-102841296.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CESj3S7T-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-16 23:58:10","author":"Chris Nesi,Josh Christenson,Peter Senzamici","authors":["Chris Nesi","Josh Christenson","Peter Senzamici"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":311929604,"title":"Bobby Brown says Britney Spears 'butchered' her cover of his 1988 hit My Prerogative","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Apr 17th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSignature of alien life 'found' 120 light years from Earth: Scientists detect signs of tell-tale biosignature of microbial life on ocean-covered planet that could be 'teeming with life'\n\nHistoric victory for women... and common sense: Judges rule that women are defined by biological sex - will Labour finally protect their rights?\n\nTrump's 'great' trade deal with Britain could be sealed 'in a matter of weeks'\n\nTV's richest stars and their whopping net worth - From Ant & Dec to a Daytime icon\n\nI know the devil, he's far more terrifying than in the movies... you can feel his power\n\nTop doctor warns cooking ingredient millions use is linked to aggressive breast cancer\n\nHow Louis Tomlinson and Zara McDermott REALLY feel about each other is revealed by body language expert\n\nI woke up one day and my mother was gone, never to be seen again.

(Freepik pic)WASHINGTON: The US on Wednesday eliminated a key government agency that tracked foreign disinformation, framing the move as an effort to preserve “free speech.”The closure of the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference hub, previously known as the Global Engagement Center (GEC), comes as leading experts monitoring propaganda have been raising the alarm about the risk of disinformation campaigns from US adversaries such as Russia and China.In December, just weeks ahead of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the US Congress failed to extend the agency’s funding following years of Republican allegations that it censored conservative views.In a statement on Wednesday, secretary of state Marco Rubio announced the closure of the unit, saying it was the responsibility of government officials to “preserve and protect the freedom for Americans to exercise their free speech.”“Under the previous administration, this office, which cost taxpayers more than US$50 million per year, spent millions of dollars to actively silence and censor the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving,” Rubio said. “That ends today.”The announcement comes at a time when the state department is expected to propose an unprecedented dismantling of Washington’s diplomatic reach, shuttering programmes and embassies worldwide to slash the budget by almost 50%, according to US media.The GEC, established in 2016, had long faced scrutiny from Republican lawmakers, who accused it of censoring and surveilling Americans. Its closing leaves the state department without a dedicated office for tracking and countering disinformation from US rivals for the first time in over eight years.The unit has also come under fire from billionaire Trump advisor Elon Musk, who accused the GEC in 2023 of being the “worst offender in US government censorship (and) media manipulation” and called the agency a “threat to our democracy.”Musk has overseen the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with radically reducing government spending.The GEC’s former leaders have pushed back on those views, calling their work crucial to combating foreign propaganda campaigns.Last June, James Rubin, special envoy and coordinator for the GEC at the time, announced the launch of a multinational group based in Warsaw to counter Russian disinformation on the war in neighbouring Ukraine.The state department had said that the initiative, known as the Ukraine Communications Group, would bring together partner governments to coordinate messaging, promote accurate reporting of the war and expose Kremlin information manipulation.In a previous report, the GEC also warned that China was spending billions of dollars globally to spread disinformation and threatening to cause a “sharp contraction” in freedom of speech around the world.","summary":"The White House frames the move as preserving

sex at birth","text":"Britain's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the legal definition of a \"woman\" is based on a person's sex at birth, a landmark decision with far-reaching implications for the bitter debate over trans rights.In a win for Scottish gender-critical campaigners who brought the case to the UK's highest court, five London judges unanimously ruled that \"the terms 'woman' and 'sex' in the \"Equality Act 2010\" refer to a biological woman, and biological sex.\"However, the act also \"gives transgender people protection\" against discrimination in their acquired gender, Justice Patrick Hodge said in handing down the verdict.The UK government welcomed the ruling for bringing \"clarity\" to the debate.It is the culmination of a years-long battle between the Scottish government and the campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS) — which launched an appeal to the Supreme Court after losing pleas in Scottish courts over an obscure legislation aimed at hiring more women in public-sector bodies.Dozens of FWS and other gender-critical campaigners, who argue that biological sex cannot be changed, cheered the ruling, hugging and crying outside the court.\"This has been a really, really long ride,\" said For Women Scotland co-director Susan Smith.\"Today, the judges have said what we always believed to be the case: that women are protected by their biological sex,\" she said. \"Women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women.\"The Scottish government said it accepts the verdict and would focus on \"protecting the rights of all.\"Trans rights activists had raised concerns that a ruling in favour of FWS could risk discrimination against trans people in their chosen gender.\"The court is well aware of the strength of feeling on all sides which lies behind this appeal,\" Hodge said.Single-sex spacesScottish Greens activist and trans woman Ellie Gomersall, 25, told Sky News the ruling was \"yet another attack on the rights of trans people to live our lives in peace.\"But \"Harry Potter\" author JK Rowling, one of the most prominent supporters of gender-critical campaigns, praised the \"three tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them\" who refused to drop the case.\"In winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK,\" Rowling, who has been accused of transphobia and become a target of hate, posted on X.At the heart of the legal battle were clashing interpretations of the Equality Act.While the Scottish government argued that the \"Equality Act\" gave trans women with a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) the same protections as a biological female, FWS disagreed.In its judgement, the Supreme Court ruled that the devolved Scottish government's \"interpretation is not correct\" and that the \"Equality Act\" was inconsistent with the \"2004 Gender Recognition Act\" that introduced GRC certificates.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which is responsible for enforcing the \"Equality Act,\" said it was \"pleased\" the ruling addressed complicated issues of maintaining single-sex spaces.Single-sex spaces and services including changing rooms, hostels and medical services \"will function properly only if sex is interpreted as biological sex,\" the judgement said. The Labor government said the ruling brought \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs.\"\"We have always supported the protection of single-sex spaces based on biological sex,\" a government spokesperson said.Opposition Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch hailed the \"victory\" for FWS.\"Saying 'trans women are women' was never true in fact, and now isn't true in law either,\" Badenoch said.Under threatLGBTQ charity Stonewall said however that the ruling was \"incredibly worrying for the trans community.\"\"Stonewall shares the deep concern at the widespread implications for today's ruling,\" its chief executive Simon Blake said.The ruling also comes at a time when transgender rights are under threat in the United States under President Donald Trump.Since retaking office, Trump has declared the federal government will recognise only two sexes, male and female; sought to bar trans athletes from women's sports; and curbed treatments for trans children.The latest UK ruling could pile pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has remained largely silent on trans issues since coming into power last July, to further clarify legislation.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/16/uk-top-court-rules-definition-of-woman-based-on-sex-at-birth","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-04-16/vpnyt6ci/0632207849065.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 23:43:50","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.3},{"id":311927246,"title":"Trump Admin Spending Over $1 Million to Recruit 'Diverse' Talent","text":"In March, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) updated its website to list nearly two dozen payments for \"diverse\" recruitment to Howard University, a historically Black college, awarded on behalf of the U.S. Department of State.Newsweek reached out to the State Department and Howard University for comment.Why It MattersDOGE, run by the unelected billionaire Elon Musk, has drawn both praise and consternation for cutting federal budgets and monies since President Donald Trump took office again in January.As of Wednesday, April 16, DOGE estimates it has saved approximately $155 billion for the nation, combining different components including asset sales, contract/lease cancellations and renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions. American individual federal taxpayers, of which DOGE estimates there are about 161 million, are purportedly saving $962.73.What To KnowDOGE records reviewed by Newsweek show 21 modifications on the site's \"payments\" section made on March 7.Each modification shows the State Department as the agency providing funding, in this instance, to Howard University in Washington, D.C., in the total amount of approximately $1.34 million.One line-item costing $332,740 is for the following: \"TO RECRUIT DIVERSE TALENT FOR THE USG FOREIGN SERVICE. THIS IS THE FIRST INSTALLMENT.\"Another item costing $38,241 says: \"DIVERSITY RECRUITMENT PROGRAM TO INCREASE THE REPRESENTATION OF DIVERSE GROUPS IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE.\"A $302,348 price tag is labeled next to this: \"TO INCREASING THE REPRESENTATION OF DIVERSE GROUPS IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE.\"It remains unclear what the payments from the State Department to Howard University signify, or what the funds are going toward.A note on the site says, \"The payments listed here have been approved by the applicable agency and funds have been disbursed; DOGE has not approved nor disapproved any of these payments.\"On January 5, or 15 days before Trump officially stepped into the White House and signed an executive order giving authority to Musk and DOGE, the DOGE X account critiqued the

Cross says 8,000 missing in war-torn Sudan in 2024","text":"At least 8,000 people were reported missing in war-ravaged Sudan in 2024, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday, warning that the figure is just \"the tip of the iceberg.\"\"These are just the cases we have collected directly,\" Daniel O'Malley, head of the ICRC delegation in Sudan, told AFP in an interview.\"We know this is just a small percentage — the tip of the iceberg — of the whole caseload of missing,\" he added.As Sudan's brutal conflict entered its third year, O'Malley said the ICRC was not only working to trace missing persons but also focusing on bolstering forensic capacity within Sudan to help identify victims years later and ensure their proper burial.\"When people are buried, they should be buried in a dignified manner,\" he said.For families of the missing, the pain of not knowing where their loved ones are may remain \"an open wound\" long after the war ends, he added.Sudan's war, which erupted in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands, displaced 13 million and triggered what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.The conflict has pitted the forces of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against those of his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).In recent days, the vast western region of Darfur has seen some of the deadliest battles since the conflict erupted.The United Nations said on Monday that over 400 people had been killed in recent attacks on El-Fasher — the last army-held state capital in Darfur — and nearby displacement camps.The RSF has ramped up its assaults on El-Fasher after the army recaptured the capital Khartoum last month.\"We are deeply concerned about what is happening in El-Fasher,\" O'Malley said, urging all parties to guarantee \"safe passage in order for civilians to be able to exit safely\".\"There is a need for all the parties involved to take the responsibility and to ensure that this is done,\" he added.'Emotional consequences' The ICRC official also warned of widespread and systematic sexual violence in the Sudan conflict — describing the incidents as \"even higher than we've seen in other conflicts\".\"We're seeing cases obviously of women, but also very young children and even men,\" O'Malley said.The official added that sexual violence carries long-lasting effects on survivors, adding that even \"if peace comes to Sudan... the humanitarian and emotional consequences will go on for a long time.\"International rights groups, including Amnesty International and the UN, have previously accused RSF fighters of using sexual violence, including rape, sexual slavery and forced marriages, as a weapon of war.The RSF has dismissed the accusations as propaganda.O'Malley also voiced particular concern over grassroots Sudanese organisations — often the first line of support for survivors — being crippled by US funding cuts.Shortly after his inauguration last month, US President Donald Trump froze US foreign aid and announced the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).Though waivers were promised for life-saving assistance, many Sudanese groups say no support has materialised.O'Malley said that international organisations can withstand the cuts, but \"grassroots organisations, which are working on the ground, don't have that cushion\".\"These are the ones that have been affected,\" he added.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/16/tip-of-the-iceberg-red-cross-says-8000-missing-in-war-torn-sudan-in-2024","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-11-10/u82qublo/202411101731243610-764.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16

dilemma as Beijing delays go-global plans","text":"Chinese carmakers are facing a dilemma as their plans to build overseas production facilities to overcome tariff blows in the US and European markets are being held back by authorities in Beijing for security and geopolitical reasons.\nChina has delayed approvals for BYD and Geely Auto to produce cars in Brazil and Mexico, according to a Reuters report last week, with officials cautioning the electric vehicle (EV) producers about trade and investment risks arising from policies pursued by US President Donald Trump.\nWhile the latest tariff war was unlikely to discourage their global expansion, Beijing wants carmakers to adopt a more cautious approach and be selective in choosing their destinations, analysts said.\n“I think Chinese policymakers are encouraging it,” said Cosimo Ries, an analyst at Trivium China. “But they want these decisions to be made in a more strategic way, by rewarding some countries that are more favourable towards China in a geopolitical setting and being more punitive to those countries that are not.”\n\nBeijing’s intervention in Geely and BYD’s plans is not peculiar. Last November, Leapmotor scrapped plans to produce a second EV model at its partner Stellantis’ plant in Poland in favour of factories in Germany and Slovakia, after China urged EV makers to halt investments in countries that supported extra tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.\nBesides market size, potential and business environment, Chinese carmakers were now considering other factors like diplomatic ties with China when choosing overseas plant locations in the future, said Paul Gong, head of China auto research at UBS Investment Bank.\nChinese authorities are also worried that excess production capacity at home will plague markets abroad if their expansion plans are too aggressive. While Chinese-made EVs accounted for about 70 per cent of global sales last year, only half of the nation’s EV production capacity was utilised, according to Goldman Sachs.\nCarmakers from BYD to start-up Hozon Auto operate about 30 factories outside the mainland, according to a study by the Post last month. Their combined annual manufacturing capacity was 2 million units in markets including Southeast Asia, Latin America and Europe.\n\nThe Trump administration’s so-called reciprocal tariffs could wreak havoc on economies in those regions and deter local consumers from making purchase plans, according to Cui Dongshu, general secretary of the China Passenger Car Association.\nSince Chinese carmakers and supply chain vendors are at the forefront of EV innovation, authorities overseeing the manufacturing and commerce sectors, as well as the economic planning agency, are wary of potential technology leaks as leading EV players set up factories overseas.\nBYD’s plan to build a plant in Mexico and Chery Automobile’s discussions with the Italian government about setting up a factory there are believed to have been frozen for now as a result of Beijing’s intervention.\nStill, mainland Chinese carmakers and automotive supply-chain vendors are likely to stay on course with the go-global drive, as they promote Chinese EV technology and manufacturing heft worldwide.\n\nCurrently, Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe, Australia and New Zealand are major export markets for Chinese-made cars. When building overseas factories, Thailand is often the first choice, followed by Brazil and Hungary.\nMeanwhile, tensions between China and the EU have eased as they started talks on setting floor prices for Chinese-made EVs, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported last week. It marks a key turning point in ties since the EU imposed up to 45.3 per cent tariff on EVs from China in October.\n“The two sides are officially shifting from legal battles to exploring market-based solutions,” Wang Shuai, analyst at Industrial Securities, said in a report on Monday. “The negotiations have eased trade tensions and set an example for cooperation in other areas, such as solar energy and lithium batteries.”\nBesides delaying overseas factory plans, Beijing is also pushing efforts to boost production and consumption at home to mitigate the tougher international trade environment.\nChina wants to “rigorously develop domestic circulation and make it a long-term strategic priority to boost domestic demand”, Premier Li Qiang said at a symposium in Beijing this month, hours after Trump launched his series of tariff hikes on Chinese goods.\n2025 could be a good year for Chinese carmakers who want to focus on the domestic market, said Zhang Xiang, who heads a research centre at the Jiangxi New Energy Technology Institute.\nThey could sidestep geopolitical risks and take advantage of various state incentives to boost consumption, including car purchases, he added.","summary":"China wants decisions by carmakers to be made strategically, prioritising geopolitically favourable countries, Trivium China’s Ries says.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3306731/byd-geely-and-ev-peers-face-tariff-dilemma-beijing-delays-go-global-plans","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/16/d1aaf673-3ea3-4348-b170-9547b583e02b_0f5c0d61.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 23:30:08","author":"Daniel Ren,Yujie Xue","authors":["Daniel Ren","Yujie Xue"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":311921914,"title":"Trump’s pick to run the critical DC attorney’s office has appeared on Russian state media over 150 times: report","text":"Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia has appeared on Russian state media more than 150 times, according to a new report.\n\nEd Martin, the current interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., appeared on networks funded by the Russian government from August 2016 to April 2024 as a guest commentator on RT and Sputnik, The Washington Post reports. \n\nMartin helped organize the “Stop the Steal” movement promoting the baseless position that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. He has also vowed to pursue legal action against anyone impeding Elon Musk’s DOGE work, and made headlines last month for his history of inflammatory remarks.\n\nHe did not initially disclose his appearances on Russian TV when Trump nominated him to his new post.\n\n After dozens of people were killed in a chemical attack in Syria in April 2017, Martin appeared on RT America to claim that it was possible the incident was “engineered” in Washington “by the people that want war in Syria.”\n\nThe Trump White House denounced the attack, blamed the Syrian government, and ordered a missile strike. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said at the time that the United States “fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext” for a missile strike.\n\nMore recently, in early 2022, Martin reportedly said in another appearance that “there’s no evidence” of a Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders. Russia launched a war against Ukraine about a week later.\n\nIn March of that year, he suggested there was a missed alliance between the U.S. and Russia during Trump’s first term. \n\n“We needed to be allies with nuclear powers like Russia,” he said on Sputnik, the Post reported. “What Trump knew was you want to be allies with the toughest dudes on the street. And he was ready to be allies with North Korea and with Putin and everybody.”\n\nMartin failed to disclose these appearances on his Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire, which asks about media appearances, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, ranking member of the committee, said Wednesday in a statement.\n\n“The 150 undisclosed appearances Mr. Martin has made on Russian state media as recently as April of last year —as Russia was actively bombing Ukraine — raises further serious questions about whether he has the temperament to serve as U.S. Attorney, concerns that have been underlined by his misconduct as Interim U.S. Attorney,” Durbin said. The senator said the Post report underscored the need for Martin to testify under oath about his relationship with Russia.\n\nA spokesperson for Martin told the Post on Tuesday that he “has disclosed all of the identified links in a supplemental letter to the Senate” in the past two days.\n\nWhen asked about Martin’s guest spots on Russian state media, the White House defended Trump’s nomination. \n\n“President Trump made a brilliant choice in selecting Ed Martin to serve a full, permanent term as United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. With a distinguished record of service, Ed is the perfect leader to restore law and order and make our Nation’s Capital safe and beautiful once again,” a spokesperson told the newspaper.\n\nThe Illinois senator, along with other Democrats, last month requested the D.C. bar launch a disciplinary investigation into Martin, citing his dismissal of charges against his own client, a January 6 defendant, and his use of the “threat of prosecution to intimidate government employees and chill the speech of private citizens.”\n\nThis week, a group of former January 6 prosecutors also asked the D.C. bar to investigate Martin, saying he has “used his brief time in office to demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of a federal prosecutor, announcing investigations against his political opponents, aiding defendants he previously represented, and communicating improperly with those he did not.”","summary":"Ed Martin reportedly appeared on RT and Sputnik from August 2016 through April 2024","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-dc-attorney-russian-state-media-b2734721.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/01/11/08/GettyImages-1356759631.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 23:26:03","author":"Kelly Rissman,Peony Hirwani","authors":["Kelly Rissman","Peony Hirwani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.002},{"id":311917502,"title":"Trump’s drive to lock in trade wins and end the maddening mixed messages","text":"President Donald Trump’s decision to sit in on Wednesday’s trade talks with Japanese envoy Ryosei Akazawa sends a clear and excellent message: The prez wants this deal done fast, with more trade agreements to follow.\n\nThat ends weeks of mixed messages since “Liberation Day” about where Team Trump wants to go, though certainty will have to wait on the actual accords.\n\nWhich he should rapidly get, since at least 15 nations have put some kind of offer on the table and 75 have asked for talks.

They also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition.The case was originally filed in December 2020, in the last days of President Donald Trump's first administration.Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he has tried to persuade the president to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial.As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies.He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power.Zuckerberg wrapped some 12 hours of testimony on Wednesday with an assessment of TikTok, which he said has emerged as perhaps the biggest competitive threat for Instagram and Facebook.Meta has seen the growth of its apps slow as the China-based video-snippet sharing sensation has boomed, so the US tech titan added a TikTok-like Reels feature to fire back in the marketplace, according to Zuckerberg.\"That said, TikTok is still bigger than either Facebook or Instagram, and I don't like it when our competitors do better than us,\" he told the court.And as video has evolved into a favorite form of online media, particularly on smartphones, YouTube has become serious competition for Meta, the chief executive testified.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday denied in court that his company bought rival services Instagram and WhatsApp to neutralize them, as his testimony in a landmark antitrust case came to a close.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mark-zuckerberg-denies-meta-bought-rivals-to-conquer-them-8183292","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-04/fvnvpaig_mark-zuckerberg-_625x300_17_April_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 23:22:38","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":311917482,"title":"AOC has made herself a legit White House contender — and a GOP threat","text":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has come a long way since 2018.\n\nWhen she first arrived on the political scene by beating out not just an incumbent, but a member of her party’s leadership in a Democratic primary contest, she was a rebel — an avatar of insurgent impulses within her coalition.\n\nAnd, among Republicans, something of a joke.\n\nNow, she’s the Democratic Party’s most popular elected official.\n\nA Yale University poll released this week found that among Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez boasts the single highest net favorability rating of all the party’s many potential 2028 presidential candidates — a sky-high 62%.\n\nIn addition, 41% of the same cohort said they have a “strongly favorable” opinion of the progressive congresswoman — again, the largest proportion to say as much about any Democrat.\n\nAnd when asked who they would support if the 2028 Democratic presidential primaries were held today, AOC finished a very strong second.\n\nFormer vice president Kamala Harris, at 28%, was the only prospective candidate to edge her out.\n\nOcasio-Cortez’s 21% placed her well ahead of bronze medalist Pete Buttigieg, at 14%.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate just how impressive a feat this is, especially considering the 35-year-old New Yorker also had the second-highest name recognition in the poll, behind only Harris.\n\nJust 11.7% of the poll’s Democrats said they haven’t heard of or have no opinion of her, which makes her superb favorability rating all the more breathtaking.\n\nBut wait, there’s more.\n\nHarris is a very, very soft front-runner, if she can even be called that.\n\nThe 2024 Democratic presidential nominee lost every single battleground state to Donald Trump last fall.\n\nAs Trump continues to facilitate liberal teeth-gnashing through his second term, anger at Harris over her dismal performance will only grow.\n\nAnd so will Democrats’ appetite for a fire-breather like AOC, who can count on Sen. Bernie Sanders to throw his full weight behind her.\n\nWhen one of Harris’ opponents on a primary debate stage asks her why voters should trust her to win this time around, what satisfying answer could she possibly produce?\n\nShe’s already 0-for-2 on the presidential campaign trail, since when Harris first ran for the presidency back in 2020, she flamed out spectacularly.\n\nWith AOC well-positioned to make a run at the Democratic nomination in 2028, no doubt some Republicans will be giddy at the prospect of facing down this self-described socialist with demonstrated champagne tastes.\n\nNational Review’s Rich Lowry has gone so far as to submit that if she’s the party’s future, Democrats stand no chance.\n\nIt’s true that any competent GOP campaign will make significant hay of AOC’s glaring vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Boston University economics and international relations major has regularly embarrassed herself on both topics.\n\nHer Green New Deal package was so unpopular that it was mocked out of existence.\n\nShe lacks any of the executive or managerial experience that persuadable voters claim to value in a candidate.\n\nAnd although she has a talent for stealing headlines, they’re often the wrong ones.\n\nHer taste for the good life — glamming it up at the Met Gala (then stiffing designers on the bill) and taking first-class flights on her way to an anti-oligarchy rally — undermines her message to the working class.\n\nAs does her weepy open-borders advocacy.\n\nBut her potential opponents would be unwise to underestimate her.\n\nShe’s only just become constitutionally eligible for the Oval Office, but already has an adoring national following that hangs on her every word, as her cross-country tour with Sanders this month demonstrates.\n\nThe enthusiasm she inspires on the left is matched only by that which Trump evokes on the right.\n\n“She is a rockstar, AOC,” one fan told The Post’s Kirsten Fleming at a rally in Idaho this week. “It’s like, Madonna and AOC.”\n\nThat’s not the only similarity between the current president and the woman who might very well be vying to succeed him.\n\nWhile some of Ocasio-Cortez’s far-left positions — including her anti-fossil fuel crusade and support for punitive tax rates — would likely hurt her in the polls, it’s more important that she would offer Americans a bold vision.\n\nAfter all, not every policy Trump campaigned on has been popular on its own.\n\nYet he’s overcome voters’ reservations about them because they come as part of a larger, coherent program that’s anything but timid.\n\nAs Ronald Reagan put it, the American electorate rewards those who bear banners of “bold unmistakable colors” rather than “pale pastels.”\n\nAOC waves just such a banner — and has more raw political talent in her pinky than the last three Democratic nominees combined.\n\nSeven years ago, she was a punchline. \n\nBut right now, she has as good a chance as anyone of becoming our next president\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"As Ronald Reagan put it, the American electorate rewards those who bear banners of “bold unmistakable colors” rather than “pale pastels.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/16/opinion/aoc-has-made-herself-a-legit-white-house-contender-and-a-gop-threat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/congresswoman-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-speaks-102807943.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 23:22:23","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.081}]}
