I’ve been a believer in H-1B.”\n\n“I have used it many times,” he said, referring to his own real estate ventures. “It’s a great programme.”\n\nHowever, the statements were a departure for the president-elect.\n\nIn the past, he has criticised the visas as “very bad” and “unfair” to US workers and his administration sought to increase barriers for applicants during his first term.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThe back-and-forth underscores a growing fault line between many of the earliest supporters of Trump and those like Musk who only embraced him in the 2024 election campaign. Many of the latter – like Musk – are associated with the tech industry, and are less prone to amplifying nativist rhetoric.\n\nThe infighting could inform the next four years of Trump’s presidency, with Musk already warning of a “MAGA civil war” over the issue.\n\nSeveral of Trump’s most prominent supporters during his first term have joined in, with strategist Steve Bannon condemning “Big Tech oligarchs” who support the visas.","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/why-are-us-republicans-debating-the-future-of-h-1b-high-skill-work-visas/","image":"https://trinidadtribune.com/app/uploads/2024/12/2024-12-04T185704Z_1074903890_RC2DIBAKC1LL_RTRMADP_3_CUBA-CRISIS-BLACKOUT-1733424932-dOdlXr.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-30 01:11:50","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"tt","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":276961032,"title":"Syria’s de facto leader says holding elections could take up to four years","text":"Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, says holding elections in the war-ravaged country could take as long as four years.\n\nIt is the first time the new Syrian leader has commented on a possible electoral timetable since opposition fighters, led by al-Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad three weeks ago.\n\nDrafting a new constitution could take up to three years, al-Sharaa told Saudi Arabia’s state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya on Sunday.\n\nHe said elections would likely be held after four years because a new census is to be conducted to specify the numbers of eligible voters in the country. “Any meaningful elections will require conducting a comprehensive population census,” he said.\n\nAl-Sharaa said Syrians would likely witness significant changes in their country in about a year. He said HTS – the most dominant military and political power in Syria – would be dissolved at a national dialogue conference.\n\nThe comments from al-Sharaa came as the new government in Damascus seeks to reassure its neighbours of peace and stability in the multiethnic country.\n\n“Syria will not be a source of disturbance to anyone,” he told Al Arabiya.\n\nAl-Sharaa said Syria shared strategic interests with Russia, a close ally and military supporter of al-Assad during the 13-year Syrian war, reiterating conciliatory signals his government has made previously. This month, he said Syria’s relations with Russia should serve common interests.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the status of Russia’s military bases in Syria would be the subject of negotiations with the new leadership in Damascus.\n\n“It is a question not only of maintaining our bases or strongholds but also of the conditions of their operation, maintenance and provision and interaction with the local side,” he said in an interview with the Russian news agency RIA released on Sunday.\n\nAl-Sharaa also said he hoped the administration of United States President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on Syria.\n\nSenior US diplomats who visited Damascus this month said al-Sharaa came across as pragmatic and Washington had decided to remove a $10m bounty on the HTS leader’s head.","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/syrias-de-facto-leader-says-holding-elections-could-take-up-to-four-years/","image":"https://trinidadtribune.com/app/uploads/2024/12/AP24355401280652-1734758970-sTdWbt.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-30 01:11:50","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"tt","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":276959870,"title":"A look back at Jimmy Carter’s presidency: Years marked by crisis — from gas shortages to Iran","text":"Former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday, led the US through a tumultuous time of conflict in the Middle East, gas shortages, Cold War drama and the Iran Hostage Crisis, all of which cemented his legacy as America’s 39th commander-in-chief. \n\nCarter — who was the longest-living president in US history by the time he died at 100 — took the national and global stage when he defeated Republican Gerald Ford in November 1976.\n\nThe former Georgia peanut farmer would only last a single term in office. \n\nBut those four years were some of the most eventful in US history as Carter worked to preserve peace in a time where war could erupt at any moment, efforts that eventually landed him the Nobel Peace Prize. \n\nThe Camp David Accords \n\nCarter’s first test of leadership came in 1978 when he oversaw the historic Camp David Accords between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. \n\nThe agreement was the first major treaty of its kind that established Arab-Israeli relations, with Carter hosting the two world leaders for 12 days to broker peace. \n\nThe pact represented Carter’s second win on the global stage, after signing a treaty with Panama the year before to return the Panama Canal back to the Central American nation by 1999. \n\nThe Soviet Union invades Afghanistan \n\nBy 1979, Carter faced a new challenge in the Middle East when the former Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. \n\nCarter slammed then-Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev’s aggression and vowed that the US would protect Middle Eastern oil supplies from encroaching Soviet power as he levied heavy sanctions and trade embargoes against the Kremlin. \n\nThe president also canceled US participation in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow in a stunning symbolic gesture of disgust at the deadly Russian aggression.\n\nCarter and Brezhnev would go on to sign the SALT II treaty, which set limits on America’s and Russia’s nuclear arms race. \n\nThe Iran Hostage Crisis \n\nCarter’s biggest challenge came just months later, when Iranian militants stormed the US Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 hostages, who remained in captivity for 444 days. \n\nA failed rescue effort by the US military in April 1980 led to the deaths of eight American service members in a helicopter crash and decimated Carter’s credibility on national security ahead of that year’s presidential election.\n\nAll the hostages were eventually freed just minutes after Carter left the White House in defeat in January 1981. \n\nThe Mariel Boatlift \n\nAs he dealt with the ongoing hostage situation, Carter faced another crisis closer to home when the Mariel Boatlift began in April 1980. \n\nThe boatlift saw tens of thousands of Cubans migrate to the US, many of whom were criminals and psychiatric patients freed by Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Others were escaping the island nation’s economic plummet. \n\nWhile Carter initially welcomed the wave of migrants as refugees escaping communist rule, the sheer number of people coming across forced him to declare a national emergency in the state of Florida. \n\nThe oil crisis and ‘stagnation’ \n\nAlong with the setback of the Iran Hostage Crisis, Carter’s presidency quickly became overshadowed by the OPEC-induced fuel catastrophe of the early 1970s that helped lead to paralyzing “stagflation,” a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and stagnant demand for goods.\n\nThe situation was only made worse by the 1979 oil crisis, which was kicked off by the Iranian revolution and caused an energy debacle around the world. \n\nFollow the latest on President Jimmy Carter’s death\n\nLongest living US President Jimmy Carter dead at 100 after spending nearly 2 years in hospice care\n\nDonald Trump reacts to Jimmy Carter’s death with heartfelt statement: ‘We all owe him a debt of gratitude’ \n\nPhotos: Remembering former President Jimmy Carter\n\nPresident Biden praises Jimmy Carter as ‘extraordinary leader’ after former president’s death at 100\n\nFormer Presidents Obama, Clinton, Bush react to Jimmy Carter’s death at 100\n\nThat year, Carter gave his infamous “malaise” speech where he said the nation was going through a “crisis of confidence,” which was followed by the dismissal of six of his cabinet members. \n\nThe axed top aides included his attorney general, treasury secretary and energy secretary.\n\nHumanitarian work post-presidency \n\nAfter his tumultuous four-year term, Carter ran for re-election and lost handily to Ronald Reagan in one of the most crushing defeats at the polls ever, losing 44 of the 50 states. \n\nAfter his exit from Washington, Carter turned his attention to humanitarian and charitable endeavors, notably his decades-long commitment to the Habitat for Humanity program, which developed housing for the poor, and the Carter Presidential Center to promote human rights.\n\nCarter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 “for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.”\n\nAnd on a personal note … \n\nCarter’s image wasn’t helped by a few comical incidents, such as when the married dad and devout Baptist gave an interview to Playboy magazine just before the 1976 election in which he overshared by saying that at times, “I’ve committed adultery in my heart.”\n\nThere was also the time Carter told reporters he’d had to fight off a swamp rabbit while fishing in a canoe near his Georgia home, leading to jokes that he’d been attacked by “a killer rabbit.”","summary":"Former President Jimmy Carter led the US through a tumultuous time of conflict in the Middle East, gas shortages, Cold War drama and the Iran Hostage Crisis.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/a-look-back-at-jimmy-carters-presidency-years-marked-by-crisis-from-gas-shortages-to-iran/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/look-back-jimmy-carters-presidency-95981823.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ge6clDaH-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-30 00:59:05","author":"Ronny Reyes","authors":["Ronny Reyes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":276959528,"title":"Former US president Jimmy Carter dead","text":"Mr Carter, a Democrat, led the United States from 1977 to 1981. He defeated Republican Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election, before losing his bid for re-election to Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nIn his post-politics career, Mr Carter devoted his time to charitable and humanitarian causes, which brought him widespread admiration.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 due to his “untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development”.\n\nHe died at his home on Sunday afternoon, local time.\n\n“My father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love,” Mr Carter’s son, Chip Carter, said in a statement.\n\n“My brothers, sister and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honouring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.”\n\nMr Carter rose from humble beginnings in rural Georgia, in America’s south, to lead the United States.\n\nHe had been in hospice care since mid-February of 2023 at his home in Plains, Georgia - the same small town where he was born, and once ran a peanut farm, before becoming governor of the state and then running for the White House.\n\nMr Carter died “peacefully” and was “surrounded by his family”, his non-profit organisation, The Carter Center, said in a statement.\n\nThere will be public observances in both Atlanta, the capital of Georgia, and Washington D.C., before a private interment in Plains.\n\nThe final arrangements for Mr Carter’s state funeral are yet to be finalised.\n\nMr Carter was the oldest living former American president and the nation’s longest-lived president of all time. That seemed an unlikely feat back in 2015, when Mr Carter revealed he had brain cancer.\n\nBut the US Navy veteran and fervent Christian repeatedly defied the odds to enjoy a long and fruitful post-presidency.\n\nDuring his single term, Mr Carter displayed a firm commitment on human rights and social justice, enjoying a strong first two years that included brokering a peace deal between Israel and Egypt, dubbed the Camp David Accords.\n\nBut his administration hit numerous snags, the most serious being the taking of US hostages in Iran and the disastrous failed attempt to rescue the 52 captive Americans in 1980. He also copped criticism for his handling of an oil crisis.\n\nIn November of that year, Mr Reagan clobbered Mr Carter at the polls, relegating the Democrat to just one term. Mr Reagan, a former actor and governor of California, swept into office on a wave of staunch conservatism.\n\nAdmirable post-presidency\n\nAs the years passed, a more nuanced image of Mr Carter emerged, one that took into account his significant post-presidential activities and reassessed his achievements.\n\nHe founded The Carter Center in 1982 to pursue his vision of world diplomacy.\n\nHe observed numerous elections around the world and emerged as a prominent international mediator, tackling global problems from North Korea to Bosnia.\n\nMr Carter, known for his toothy smile, said basic Christian tenets such as justice and love served as the bedrock of his presidency. He taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist, his church in Plains, well into his nineties.\n\nIn recent years, he had received various hospital treatments, including when he revealed in August of 2015 that he had brain cancer and was undergoing radiation.\n\nUS Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, who is the pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church where Martin Luther King Jr preached, wished the Carter family comfort as the former president entered hospice last year.\n\n“Across life’s seasons, President Jimmy Carter, a man of great faith, has walked with God,” Mr Warnock wrote on X, then Twitter.\n\n“In this tender time of transitioning, God is surely walking with him.”\n\nIn April of 2021, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, met with the Carters at their home.\n\nThe White House later released a photo showing the couples smiling together, although only Mr Carter’s wife Rosalynn was seen by the press outside, bidding the Bidens farewell while using a walker.\n\nRosalynn, Carter’s wife of 77 years, died on November 19, 2023 at the age of 96. The former president, who looked frail, appeared at her memorial service in a wheelchair, with a blanket on his lap bearing their likenesses.\n\nMr Carter is survived by the couple’s four children: three sons and a daughter.\n\n‘I just heard’: Reaction to Carter’s death\n\nPresident Biden called Mr Carter “an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian”.\n\n“He was a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism. We will always cherish seeing him and Rosalynn together. The love shared between Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism,” Mr Biden said, referring to both himself and his wife Jill.\n\n“We will miss them both dearly, but take solace knowing they are reunited once again and will remain forever in our hearts.\n\n“To the entire Carter family, we send our gratitude for sharing them with America and the world. To their staff – from the earliest days to the final ones – we have no doubt that you will continue to do the good works that carry on their legacy.\n\n“And to all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility. He showed that we are great nation because we are a good people – decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.”\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump reacted to Mr Carter’s death with a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“I just heard about the news of the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to have served as president understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,” Mr Trump wrote.\n\n“The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\n\n“Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.”","summary":"Jimmy Carter, having lived longer than any other US president, has died at his home, according to his son.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/jimmy-carter-former-us-president-dead-at-100/news-story/946fa108b159416d210bb242b0b7ef31?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/605906f9afb307093a85e7eb84ec94bb","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-30 00:57:50","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.276},{"id":276959266,"title":"Jimmy Carter, the 39th US president, dies at age 100","text":"Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, has died at age 100.\r\n\r\nCarter was “surrounded by his family” at his home in Plains, Georgia, in his final moments, the Carter Center said in a statement Sunday.\r\n\r\nPresident Joe Biden remembered Carter as a “dear friend” and “extraordinary leader” in a statement Sunday, while President-elect Donald Trump said Americans owe the former president “a debt of gratitude.”\r\n\r\nPreparations are underway for a state funeral.\r\n\r\nCarter was a peanut farmer and US Navy lieutenant before going into politics, eventually serving one term as governor of Georgia and as president of the United States from 1977 to 1981.

He was 100.“My father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love,” said Chip Carter, the former president’s son. “My brothers, sister, and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.”A Democrat, he served as president from January 1977 to January 1981 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 U.S. election. Carter was swept from office four years later in an electoral landslide as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor.Carter lived longer after his term in office than any other U.S. president. Along the way, he earned a reputation as a better former president than he was a president - a status he readily acknowledged.His one-term presidency was marked by the highs of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, bringing some stability to the Middle East. But it was dogged by an economy in recession, persistent unpopularity and the embarrassment of the Iran hostage crisis that consumed his final 444 days in office.In recent years, Carter had experienced several health issues including melanoma that spread to his liver and brain. Carter decided to receive hospice care in February 2023 instead of undergoing additional medical intervention. His wife, Rosalynn Carter, died on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96. He looked frail when he attended her memorial service and funeral in a wheelchair.Carter left office profoundly unpopular but worked energetically for decades on humanitarian causes. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 in recognition of his \"untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\"Carter had been a centrist as governor of Georgia with populist tendencies when he moved into the White House as the 39th U.S. president. He was a Washington outsider at a time when America was still reeling from the Watergate scandal that led Republican Richard Nixon to resign as president in 1974 and elevated Ford from vice president.\"I'm Jimmy Carter and I'm running for president. I will never lie to you,\" Carter promised with an ear-to-ear smile.Asked to assess his presidency, Carter said in a 1991 documentary: \"The biggest failure we had was a political failure. I never was able to convince the American people that I was a forceful and strong leader.\"Despite his difficulties in office, Carter had few rivals for accomplishments as a former president. He gained global acclaim as a tireless human rights advocate, a voice for the disenfranchised and a leader in the fight against hunger and poverty, winning the respect that eluded him in the White House.Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to promote human rights and resolve conflicts around the world, from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Bosnia and Haiti. His Carter Center in Atlanta sent international election-monitoring delegations to polls around the world.A Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher since his teens, Carter brought a strong sense of morality to the presidency, speaking openly about his religious faith. He also sought to take some pomp out of an increasingly imperial presidency - walking, rather than riding in a limousine, in his 1977 inauguration parade.The Middle East was the focus of Carter's foreign policy. The 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, based on the 1978 Camp David accords, ended a state of war between the two neighbors.Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland for talks. Later, as the accords seemed to be unraveling, Carter saved the day by flying to Cairo and Jerusalem for personal shuttle diplomacy.The treaty provided for Israeli withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and establishment of diplomatic relations. Begin and Sadat each won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.By the 1980 election, the overriding issues were double-digit inflation, interest rates that exceeded 20% and soaring gas prices, as well as the Iran hostage crisis that brought humiliation to America. These issues marred Carter's presidency and undermined his chances of winning a second term.HOSTAGE CRISISOn Nov. 4, 1979, revolutionaries devoted to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seized the Americans present and demanded the return of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was backed by the United States and was being treated in a U.S. hospital.The American public initially rallied behind Carter. But his support faded in April 1980 when a commando raid failed to rescue the hostages, with eight U.S. soldiers killed in an aircraft accident in the Iranian desert.Carter's final ignominy was that Iran held the 52 hostages until minutes after Reagan took his oath of office on Jan. 20, 1981, to replace Carter, then released the planes carrying them to freedom.In another crisis, Carter protested the former Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. He also asked the U.S. Senate to defer consideration of a major nuclear arms accord with Moscow.Unswayed, the Soviets remained in Afghanistan for a decade.Carter won narrow Senate approval in 1978 of a treaty to transfer the Panama Canal to the control of Panama despite critics who argued the waterway was vital to American security. He also completed negotiations on full U.S. ties with China.Carter created two new U.S. Cabinet departments - education and energy. Amid high gas prices, he said America's \"energy crisis\" was \"the moral equivalent of war\" and urged the country to embrace conservation. \"Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth,\" he told Americans in 1977.In 1979, Carter delivered what became known as his \"malaise\" speech to the nation, although he never used that word.\"After listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world can't fix what's wrong with America,\" he said in his televised address.\"The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America.\"As president, the strait-laced Carter was embarrassed by the behavior of his hard-drinking younger brother, Billy Carter, who had boasted: \"I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer.\"'THERE YOU GO AGAIN'Jimmy Carter withstood a challenge from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but was politically diminished heading into his general election battle against a vigorous Republican adversary.Reagan, the conservative who projected an image of strength, kept Carter off balance during their debates before the November 1980 election.Reagan dismissively told Carter, \"There you go again,\" when the Republican challenger felt the president had misrepresented Reagan's views during one debate.Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan, who won 44 of the 50 states and amassed an Electoral College landslide.James Earl Carter Jr. was born on Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, one of four children of a farmer and shopkeeper. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, served in the nuclear submarine program and left to manage the family peanut farming business.He married his wife, Rosalynn, in 1946, a union he called \"the most important thing in my life.\" They had three sons and a daughter.Carter became a millionaire, a Georgia state legislator and Georgia's governor from 1971 to 1975. He mounted an underdog bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, and out-hustled his rivals for the right to face Ford in the general election.With Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate, Carter was given a boost by a major Ford gaffe during one of their debates. Ford said that \"there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration,\" despite decades of just such domination.Carter edged Ford in the election, even though Ford actually won more states - 27 to Carter's 23.Not all of Carter's post-presidential work was appreciated. Former President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, both Republicans, were said to have been displeased by Carter's freelance diplomacy in Iraq and elsewhere.In 2004, Carter called the Iraq war launched in 2003 by the younger Bush one of the most \"gross and damaging mistakes our nation ever made.\" He called George W. Bush's administration \"the worst in history\" and said Vice President Dick Cheney was \"a disaster for our country.\"In 2019, Carter questioned Republican Donald Trump's legitimacy as president, saying \"he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\" Trump responded by calling Carter \"a terrible president.\"Carter also made trips to communist North Korea. A 1994 visit defused a nuclear crisis, as President Kim Il Sung agreed to freeze his nuclear program in exchange for resumed dialogue with the United States. That led to a deal in which North Korea, in return for aid, promised not to restart its nuclear reactor or reprocess the plant's spent fuel.But Carter irked Democratic President Bill Clinton's administration by announcing the deal with North Korea's leader without first checking with Washington.In 2010, Carter won the release of an American sentenced to eight years hard labor for illegally entering North Korea.Carter wrote more than two dozen books, ranging from a presidential memoir to a children's book and poetry, as well as works about religious faith and diplomacy.

Kathy Hochul’s controversial $9 congestion toll to enter Midtown Manhattan, The Post has learned. \n\nIt’s the first time Cuomo has weighed in on the $9 commuter tax since Hochul unveiled it after the November elections.\n\n“It is undeniable that New York is in a dramatically different place today than it was in 2019, and without a study forecasting [the toll’s] consequences based on facts, not politics, it could do more harm than good to New York City’s recovery,” Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi told The Post on Sunday, referring to his boss’s stance on the new commuter tax.\n\nCuomo is sort of the father of congestion pricing in the US. He was largely responsible for muscling the first-in-the-nation congestion toll plan through New York’s legislature in 2019 to help fund mass transit and curb traffic in Manhattan’s central business district.\n\nBut he has since backed off the tactic, writing in a Post op-ed column in March, “The people of New York know this is not the time to implement congestion pricing,” while citing a shaky post-COVID economic recovery and subway crime.\n\nHe feels the same way now even though the toll was lowered by Hochul from $15 to 9 before it takes effect next Sunday, Jan. 5.\n\nCuomo’s reversal comes as he is weighing a political comeback bid for New York City mayor.\n\nHe resigned as governor in August 2021 after accusations of misconduct and under threat of impeachment — though he’s denied wrongdoing.\n\nAzzopardi said Cuomo still believes congestion pricing is “ultimately the right policy” and that’s why he fought to approve it. But “the question is whether now is the right time to implement it,” the rep said.\n\n“Congestion pricing is premised on a safe and reliable subway system, and given the obvious lack of confidence the public currently has in the subway system – combined with the tenuous state of New York City post-COVID – the Governor called for a data-driven study on the impact of congestion pricing to inform the timing of such a major policy change and to ensure New York was not creating additional obstacles to its comeback,” Azzopardi said.\n\nThere have been 10 murders in the subway this year, the highest homicide tally in 25 years. That figure includes the horrifying arson murder of a sleeping straphanger on a train last week, allegedly at the hands of a sadistic illegal Guatemalan migrant.\n\nA rep for Hochul — who served as Cuomo’s lieutenant governor — fired back at her predecessor’s shifting stand and accused him of “gubernatorial mismanagement.”\n\n“Drivers upset about paying a $9 toll when entering Manhattan should remember two things: Andrew Cuomo is the reason they’re paying a toll, and Kathy Hochul is the reason it’s 40% lower than originally envisioned,” said Hochul spokesman Avi Small.\n\n“Governor Hochul took office in 2021 — two years after congestion pricing became law — and got to work fixing the mess she inherited at the MTA following a decade of gubernatorial mismanagement,” Small added.\n\nToll opponents welcomed Cuomo’s change of heart, but noted the ex-governor is the one who put the issue front and center.\n\n“It’s nice to see that now Cuomo recognizes what a bad idea congestion pricing is, but we won’t forget that he was the one who signed it into law just like the bail reform and sanctuary state policies that have made us less safe,” said.Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn).\n\n“Maybe he should have listened to Republicans before championing these disastrous policies,” added Malliotakis, who also challenged Hochul to ride the subway without her state police security detail.\n\nHochul originally tabled a $15 proposed toll to enter Midtown south of 60th Street, then infamously waited till after the election to push a $9 commuter tax.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority also has the authority to raise the tolls by 25% on gridlock alert days.\n\nBut Hochul, who largely controls the MTA, derailed the gridlock surcharge last week after an exclusive Post report about the outrageous add-on.\n\nMalliotakis and other congestion-pricing foes are appealing to President-elect Donald Trump, who opposes congestion pricing, to stop the toll, which was approved by the Biden administration.\n\n“I think there’s an avenue for President Trump to intervene and stop it,” Malliotakis said on 77 WABC radio’s the “Cats Roundtable” show Sunday. “[We] do have a lawsuit still in court, as does New Jersey.\n\n“We’re still hopeful that we can stop this congestion pricing cash grab that will cost commuters thousands of dollars,” \n\nA majority of New Yorkers — 51% — oppose a congestion toll on Manhattan commuters, according to a recent Siena College poll. Only 29% of those polled said they were supportive of the congestion tax with another 20% saying they were unsure or were in the middle.\n\nThe toll is backed by transit advocates and environmental groups, the Regional Planning Association and the Partnership for the City of New York, a top business advocacy group.","summary":"It's the first time Cuomo has weighed in on the $9 commuter tax since Hochul unveiled it after the November elections.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/12/29/us-news/andrew-cuomo-opposes-hochuls-9-congestion-toll-while-mulling-comeback/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo-95976561.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/eYNXHmuT-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-30 00:41:20","author":"Carl Campanile","authors":["Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":276958978,"title":"Trump slams Biden's 2023 Debt Ceiling Deal as the 'Dumbest political decisions', calls for GOP unity","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday criticised the extension of the 2023 debt ceiling deal, saying it will \"go down as one of the dumbest political decisions made in years.\" The agreement, reached by President Joe Biden and then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, suspends the debt limit until January 1, 2025.Trump argued that the decision to postpone addressing the debt ceiling was a mistake. He believes the issue should be handled now, under the Biden administration.Sharing his thoughts on the 'Truth Social' platform, Trump criticised the move for lacking any tangible gains and attributed it as a reason for the loss of the Speakership.“The extension of the Debt Ceiling by a previous Speaker of the House, a good man and a friend of mine, from this past September of the Biden Administration, to June of the Trump Administration, will go down as one of the dumbest political decisions made in years. There was no reason to do it - NOTHING WAS GAINED, and we got nothing for it - A major reason why that Speakership was lost,\" Trump said.— TrumpDailyPosts (@TrumpDailyPosts) The president-elect also suggested that the Democrats would rather see a depression if it harmed the Republican Party, asserting that the responsibility for addressing the debt ceiling should rest with the Biden administration.“It was Biden’s problem, not ours. Now it becomes ours. I call it ‘1929’ because the Democrats don’t care what our Country may be forced into. In fact, they would prefer ‘Depression’ as long as it hurt the Republican Party. The Democrats must be forced to take a vote on this treacherous issue NOW, during the Biden Administration, and not in June. They should be blamed for this potential disaster, not the Republicans!” he said.Although the current deal allows the Treasury to pay its bills for several more months, Congress will have to revisit the debt ceiling in 2024.What is the debt ceiling?The debt ceiling is the limit that dictates how much money the US Treasury Department can borrow to fulfill the country’s financial obligations. Congress must raise or suspend this limit to allow the government to continue borrowing.The current federal debt is approximately $36 trillion. Increased borrowing costs due to post-pandemic inflation mean debt payments in the coming year will surpass national security spending.In June 2023, Congress opted to suspend the debt ceiling rather than raise it by a fixed amount. This suspension lasts until January 1, 2025. On that date, the debt ceiling will automatically adjust to equal the total debt issued by the Treasury up to that point.Historically, the debt ceiling vote has become a political tool, providing leverage for attaching unrelated policy priorities to this essential legislation.Fight on the debt ceilingTrump has linked the debt ceiling issue to government funding. He insists both must be addressed together. He has rejected a spending proposal, demanding a debt ceiling resolution before the next president takes office. He warned that Republicans supporting any bill that doesn't address the debt ceiling will face challenges.“Anybody that supports a bill that doesn’t take care of the Democrat quicksand known as the debt ceiling should be primaried and disposed of as quickly as possible,” Trump told Fox News Digital.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump criticized the 2023 budget deal that extended the debt ceiling, calling it a major political error.

She also made headlines by securing the pole position in the 2013 Daytona 500. But beyond her impressive racing achievements, Patrick has also ventured into entrepreneurship with her own clothing line and vineyard. Now, she has stepped into the spotlight again, but this time, it's for her political views, which are causing quite a stir among her fans and friends.Patrick voted for the first time in the 2024 United States elections and declared her support for Donald Trump, which has led to a decrease in her followers. Even though this decline might seem concerning, Patrick sees it positively.She considers it a filtering process, which resonates with a saying she remembers from Darrell Waltrip: \"When you get into politics, you know you're going to lose half of your friends.\" Patrick acknowledges that this could apply to her social media followers, stating, \"Maybe half of my followers too, you never know.\"Her dive into politics began in 2023 when she interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend, marking her first public discussion centered around politics. Despite the possible backlash, Patrick seems unfazed by the criticism. During an interview with NASCAR legend Kenny Wallace, Patrick explained:\"Definitely, when I post some stuff about politics, you see some dropping due to that. But then you get some back because that's how it works... I'd say the same thing works with friends. You know, you'll drop some friends but then you're gonna pick some up too because you're going to find more of your people. And it's going to make you happier anyway.\"Patrick has been actively participating in Trump's campaign, even moderating a Q&A session with Trump's running mate, JD Vance, in Greensboro, North Carolina.Speaking about her campaign involvement, Patrick recently explained it felt like \"a calling\". She stated, as previously reported by Newsweek Sports:\"That night just standing in the crowd, you know, after all the swing states kept going red, and you're like, wow, and once Pennsylvania came through, you're like, 'Oh my God, it's really happening.'\"[...] It's been a long time since I just like volunteered so much time out of passion and out of a calling. I guess it's been a while since there's been a calling. And that's kind of what it was. It was a very, it was a very unforced process for me that began at AmFest in the end of 2023.\"It was just such a blessing to be on that last phase of it. That last sort of four or five days with Tulsi (Gabbard) and yourself, and the man himself Donald Trump. So I'll never forget flying home on Trump Force One sitting next to him hanging out being like, 'How did I get here? This is so wild.'\"She also stated:\"I just want to say I've never voted before, but this time around, I have to vote. It's that important.\"The person that runs this country should ultimately be running it very much like a business. I can't really think of a better businessman than Donald Trump,\" Patrick said.\"A guy like that who has been in business as long as he has, he's gonna go into that room and he's gonna get stuff done. That's what we need, a president who is actually going to make changes happen.\"","summary":"Danica Patrick's vocal support for Donald Trump, coupled with her broader political engagement, has polarized her fan base and friendships.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/racing/danica-patrick-reveals-impact-passionate-donald-trump-support-drop-some-friends-2007242","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2552950/danica-patrick.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-30 00:30:01","author":"Lydia Mee","authors":["Lydia Mee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.138},{"id":276956860,"title":"Jimmy Carter, Former U.S. President and Three-Time Grammy Winner, Dies at 100","text":"Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, endured humbling defeat after one tumultuous term and then redefined life after the White House as a global humanitarian, has died. He was 100 years old.\n\n The longest-lived American president, and the president who’s won the most Grammy Awards — three, for audiobook or spoken word recordings — died on Sunday (Dec. 29), more than a year after entering hospice care, at his home in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife, Rosalynn, who died at 96 in November 2023, spent most of their lives, The Carter Center said.\n\n “Our founder, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, passed away this afternoon in Plains, Georgia,” the center said in posting about his death on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). It added in a statement that he died peacefully, surrounded by his family.\n\n As reactions poured in from around the world, President Joe Biden mourned Carter’s death, saying the world lost an “extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian” and that he lost a dear friend. Biden cited Carter’s compassion and moral clarity, his work to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and advocate for the disadvantaged as an example for others.\n\n “To all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility,” Biden said in a statement. “He showed that we are a great nation because we are a good people – decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.”\n\n Biden said he is ordering a state funeral for Carter in Washington. \n\n Members of the music community remembered Carter in posts on social media on Sunday.\n\n “President Jimmy Carter was a truly extraordinary man and a rare politician who always stood up and spoke out for idealism, compassion and human rights and particularly for the rights of women and those who suffered real oppression. I feel so privileged to have been able to work with and get to know this great and truly inspiring man,” Peter Gabriel, a longtime friend to Carter, wrote.\n\n “Rest easy, Mr. President. I’m sad for us, and happy for you. Your and Mrs. Rosalynn’s legacy of love will live forever,” wrote Trisha Yearwood. Yearwood and husband Garth Brooks helped lead the 2024 Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project with Habitat for Humanity.\n\n In a statement, the Academy of Country Music quoted Carter — “Country Music is heard everywhere. It is the deepest expression of all that is uniquely American,” he’d written in regards to the fifteenth annual ACM Awards in 1980. The ACM’s statement on Sunday read, “On behalf of everyone at the Academy, thank you for your service to others and love for #CountryMusic.”\n\n Businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, citizen of the world: Carter forged a path that still challenges political assumptions and stands out among the 45 men who reached the nation’s highest office. The 39th president leveraged his ambition with a keen intellect, deep religious faith and prodigious work ethic, conducting diplomatic missions into his 80s and building houses for the poor well into his 90s.\n\n “My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,” Carter once said.\n\n A moderate Democrat, Carter entered the 1976 presidential race as a little-known Georgia governor with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and technocratic plans reflecting his education as an engineer. His no-frills campaign depended on public financing, and his promise not to deceive the American people resonated after Richard Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia.\n\n “If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,” Carter repeated before narrowly beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who had lost popularity pardoning Nixon.\n\n Carter governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women’s rights and America’s global role. His most acclaimed achievement in office was a Mideast peace deal that he brokered by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for 13 days in 1978. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy.\n\n Yet Carter’s electoral coalition splintered under double-digit inflation, gasoline lines and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His bleakest hour came when eight Americans died in a failed hostage rescue in April 1980, helping to ensure his landslide defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan.\n\n Carter acknowledged in his 2020 White House Diary that he could be “micromanaging” and “excessively autocratic,” complicating dealings with Congress and the federal bureaucracy. He also turned a cold shoulder to Washington’s news media and lobbyists, not fully appreciating their influence on his political fortunes. (Although White House Diary did not receive a nomination, in his lifetime Carter received a total of 10 Grammy Award nominations, and three wins, for audiobook recordings: Our Endangered Values: America’s Moral Crisis (2007), A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety (2016) and Faith – A Journey for All (2019). Carter could posthumously win a fourth Grammy for his spoken word album Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration, which is nominated for best audio book, narration and storytelling recording at the 2025 Grammys.)\n\n “It didn’t take us long to realize that the underestimation existed, but by that time we were not able to repair the mistake,” Carter told historians in 1982, suggesting that he had “an inherent incompatibility” with Washington insiders.\n\n Carter insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to “protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully” and “enhance human rights here and abroad” — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term.\n\n Ignominious defeat, though, allowed for renewal. The Carters founded The Carter Center in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind base of operations, asserting themselves as international peacemakers and champions of democracy, public health and human rights.\n\n “I was not interested in just building a museum or storing my White House records and memorabilia,” Carter wrote in a memoir published after his 90th birthday. “I wanted a place where we could work.”\n\n That work included easing nuclear tensions in North and South Korea, helping to avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti and negotiating cease-fires in Bosnia and Sudan. By 2022, The Carter Center had declared at least 113 elections in Latin America, Asia and Africa to be free or fraudulent. Recently, the center began monitoring U.S. elections as well.\n\n Carter’s stubborn self-assuredness and even self-righteousness proved effective once he was unencumbered by the Washington order, sometimes to the point of frustrating his successors.\n\n He went “where others are not treading,” he said, to places like Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had wandered across the border in 2010.\n\n “I can say what I like. I can meet whom I want. I can take on projects that please me and reject the ones that don’t,” Carter said.\n\n He announced an arms-reduction-for-aid deal with North Korea without clearing the details with Bill Clinton’s White House. He openly criticized President George W. Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also criticized America’s approach to Israel with his 2006 book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid. And he repeatedly countered U.S. administrations by insisting North Korea should be included in international affairs, a position that most aligned Carter with Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n Among the center’s many public health initiatives, Carter vowed to eradicate the guinea worm parasite during his lifetime, and nearly achieved it: Cases dropped from millions in the 1980s to nearly a handful. With hardhats and hammers, the Carters also built homes with Habitat for Humanity.\n\n The Nobel committee’s 2002 Peace Prize cites his “untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.” Carter should have won it alongside Sadat and Begin in 1978, the chairman added.\n\n Carter accepted the recognition saying there was more work to be done.\n\n “The world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place,” he said. “The greater ease of travel and communication has not been matched by equal understanding and mutual respect.”\n\n Carter’s globetrotting took him to remote villages where he met little “Jimmy Carters,” so named by admiring parents. But he spent most of his days in the same one-story Plains house — expanded and guarded by Secret Service agents — where they lived before he became governor. He regularly taught Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church until his mobility declined and the coronavirus pandemic raged. Those sessions drew visitors from around the world to the small sanctuary where Carter will receive his final send-off after a state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral.\n\n The common assessment that he was a better ex-president than president rankled Carter and his allies. His prolific post-presidency gave him a brand above politics, particularly for Americans too young to witness him in office. But Carter also lived long enough to see biographers and historians reassess his White House years more generously.\n\n His record includes the deregulation of key industries, reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil, cautious management of the national debt and notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health. He focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictators to release thousands of political prisoners. He acknowledged America’s historical imperialism, pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders and relinquished control of the Panama Canal. He normalized relations with China.\n\n “I am not nominating Jimmy Carter for a place on Mount Rushmore,” Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s domestic policy director, wrote in a 2018 book.\n\n “He was not a great president” but also not the “hapless and weak” caricature voters rejected in 1980, Eizenstat said. Rather, Carter was “good and productive” and “delivered results, many of which were realized only after he left office.”\n\n Madeleine Albright, a national security staffer for Carter and Clinton’s secretary of state, wrote in Eizenstat’s forward that Carter was “consequential and successful” and expressed hope that “perceptions will continue to evolve” about his presidency.\n\n “Our country was lucky to have him as our leader,” said Albright, who died in 2022.\n\n Jonathan Alter, who penned a comprehensive Carter biography published in 2020, said in an interview that Carter should be remembered for “an epic American life” spanning from a humble start in a home with no electricity or indoor plumbing through decades on the world stage across two centuries.\n\n “He will likely go down as one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history,” Alter told The Associated Press.\n\n James Earl Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains and spent his early years in nearby Archery. His family was a minority in the mostly Black community, decades before the civil rights movement played out at the dawn of Carter’s political career.\n\n Carter, who campaigned as a moderate on race relations but governed more progressively, talked often of the influence of his Black caregivers and playmates but also noted his advantages: His land-owning father sat atop Archery’s tenant-farming system and owned a main street grocery. His mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns.\n\n Seeking to broaden his world beyond Plains and its population of fewer than 1,000 — then and now — Carter won an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946. That same year he married Rosalynn Smith, another Plains native, a decision he considered more important than any he made as head of state. She shared his desire to see the world, sacrificing college to support his Navy career.\n\n Carter climbed in rank to lieutenant, but then his father was diagnosed with cancer, so the submarine officer set aside his ambitions of admiralty and moved the family back to Plains. His decision angered Rosalynn, even as she dived into the peanut business alongside her husband.\n\n Carter again failed to talk with his wife before his first run for office — he later called it “inconceivable” not to have consulted her on such major life decisions — but this time, she was on board.\n\n “My wife is much more political,” Carter told the AP in 2021.\n\n He won a state Senate seat in 1962 but wasn’t long for the General Assembly and its back-slapping, deal-cutting ways. He ran for governor in 1966 — losing to arch-segregationist Lester Maddox — and then immediately focused on the next campaign.\n\n Carter had spoken out against church segregation as a Baptist deacon and opposed racist “Dixiecrats” as a state senator. Yet as a local school board leader in the 1950s he had not pushed to end school segregation even after the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision, despite his private support for integration. And in 1970, Carter ran for governor again as the more conservative Democrat against Carl Sanders, a wealthy businessman Carter mocked as “Cufflinks Carl.” Sanders never forgave him for anonymous, race-baiting flyers, which Carter disavowed.\n\n Ultimately, Carter won his races by attracting both Black voters and culturally conservative whites. Once in office, he was more direct.\n\n “I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,” he declared in his 1971 inaugural address, setting a new standard for Southern governors that landed him on the cover of Time magazine.\n\n His statehouse initiatives included environmental protection, boosting rural education and overhauling antiquated executive branch structures. He proclaimed Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the slain civil rights leader’s home state. And he decided, as he received presidential candidates in 1972, that they were no more talented than he was.\n\n In 1974, he ran the Democrats’ national campaign arm. Then he declared his own candidacy for 1976. An Atlanta newspaper responded with the headline: “Jimmy Who?”\n\n The Carters and a “Peanut Brigade” of family members and Georgia supporters camped out in Iowa and New Hampshire, establishing both states as presidential proving grounds. His first Senate endorsement: a young first-termer from Delaware named Joe Biden.\n\n Yet it was Carter’s ability to navigate America’s complex racial and rural politics that cemented the nomination. He swept the Deep South that November, the last Democrat to do so, as many white Southerners shifted to Republicans in response to civil rights initiatives.\n\n A self-declared “born-again Christian,” Carter drew snickers by referring to Scripture in a Playboy magazine interview, saying he “had looked on many women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.” The remarks gave Ford a new foothold and television comedians pounced — including NBC’s new Saturday Night Live show. But voters weary of cynicism in politics found it endearing.\n\n Carter chose Minnesota Sen. Walter “Fritz” Mondale as his running mate on a “Grits and Fritz” ticket. In office, he elevated the vice presidency and the first lady’s office. Mondale’s governing partnership was a model for influential successors Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden. Rosalynn Carter was one of the most involved presidential spouses in history, welcomed into Cabinet meetings and huddles with lawmakers and top aides.\n\n The Carters presided with uncommon informality: He used his nickname “Jimmy” even when taking the oath of office, carried his own luggage and tried to silence the Marine Band’s “Hail to the Chief.” They bought their clothes off the rack. Carter wore a cardigan for a White House address, urging Americans to conserve energy by turning down their thermostats. Amy, the youngest of four children, attended District of Columbia public school.\n\n Washington’s social and media elite scorned their style. But the larger concern was that “he hated politics,” according to Eizenstat, leaving him nowhere to turn politically once economic turmoil and foreign policy challenges took their toll.\n\n Carter partially deregulated the airline, railroad and trucking industries and established the departments of Education and Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He designated millions of acres of Alaska as national parks or wildlife refuges. He appointed a then-record number of women and nonwhite people to federal posts. He never had a Supreme Court nomination, but he elevated civil rights attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the nation’s second highest court, positioning her for a promotion in 1993. He appointed Paul Volker, the Federal Reserve chairman whose policies would help the economy boom in the 1980s — after Carter left office. He built on Nixon’s opening with China, and though he tolerated autocrats in Asia, pushed Latin America from dictatorships to democracy.\n\n But he couldn’t immediately tame inflation or the related energy crisis.\n\n And then came Iran.\n\n After he admitted the exiled Shah of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun in 1979 by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Negotiations to free the hostages broke down repeatedly ahead of the failed rescue attempt.\n\n The same year, Carter signed SALT II, the new strategic arms treaty with Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, only to pull it back, impose trade sanctions and order a U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.\n\n Hoping to instill optimism, he delivered what the media dubbed his “malaise” speech, although he didn’t use that word. He declared the nation was suffering “a crisis of confidence.” By then, many Americans had lost confidence in the president, not themselves.\n\n Carter campaigned sparingly for reelection because of the hostage crisis, instead sending Rosalynn as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him for the Democratic nomination. Carter famously said he’d “kick his a–,” but was hobbled by Kennedy as Reagan rallied a broad coalition with “make America great again” appeals and asking voters whether they were “better off than you were four years ago.”\n\n Reagan further capitalized on Carter’s lecturing tone, eviscerating him in their lone fall debate with the quip: “There you go again.” Carter lost all but six states and Republicans rolled to a new Senate majority.\n\n Carter successfully negotiated the hostages’ freedom after the election, but in one final, bitter turn of events, Tehran waited until hours after Carter left office to let them walk free.\n\n At 56, Carter returned to Georgia with “no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.”\n\n Four decades after launching The Carter Center, he still talked of unfinished business.\n\n “I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,” Carter told the AP in 2021. “But it’s turned out to be much more long-lasting and insidious than I had thought it was.

But his administration hit numerous snags -- the most serious being the taking of US hostages in Iran and the disastrous failed attempt to rescue the 52 captive Americans in 1980. He also came in for criticism for his handling of an oil crisis.In November of that year, Republican challenger Ronald Reagan clobbered Carter at the polls, relegating the Democrat to just one term. Reagan, a former actor and governor of California, swept into office on a wave of staunch conservatism.As the years passed, a more nuanced image of Carter emerged -- one that took into account his significant post-presidential activities.He founded the Carter Center in 1982 to pursue his vision of world diplomacy, and he was the recipient of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless efforts to promote social and economic justice.He observed numerous elections around the world and emerged as a prominent international mediator, tackling global problems from North Korea to Bosnia.Carter, known for his toothy smile, said basic Christian tenets such as justice and love served as the bedrock of his presidency. He taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist, his church in Plains, well into his 90s.In recent years, he had received various hospital treatments, including when he revealed in August 2015 that he had brain cancer and was undergoing radiation.Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday hailed Carter as \"a symbol of humanitarian efforts\" for his role in brokering the 1978 Camp David Accords, predicting his work would \"remain etched in the annals of history.\"Tributes poured in from White House leaders past, present and incoming. Bill Clinton said Carter \"worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world.\" George W. Bush said Carter's legacy would \"inspire Americans for generations,\" and Barack Obama said the former leader \"taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service.\"Donald Trump said Americans owed the Democrat \"a debt of gratitude,\" later adding, in a second social media post, that \"I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically.\"One of Carter's defining foreign policy achievements -- negotiating the return of the Panama Canal to Panama -- has come back into focus as Trump has threatened to retake the channel.\"America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian,\" current President Joe Biden and his wife Jill said in a statement. \"For anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning -- the good life -- study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility.\"In April 2021, the Bidens met with the Carters at their home in Plains.The White House later released a photo showing the couples smiling together, although only Rosalynn was seen by the press outside, bidding the Bidens farewell while using a walker.Rosalynn, Carter's wife of 77 years, died on November 19, 2023 at age 96.

Recently, the false reports have become even more aggressive. We can respond to them briefly with the words of the well-known saying: ‘If the shoe fits, wear it',\" Lavrov told TASS in his year-end interview.\n\n\"Those who accuse Russia of something need to look at themselves in the mirror,\" the minister continued. \"NATO military personnel and mercenaries are blatantly involved in planning and conducting combat operations alongside the Ukrainian armed forces. NATO is involved in the invasion of the Kursk Region and strikes with long-range missiles on Russian territory. President Vladimir Putin has made this clear in his recent public speeches.

Zelensky keeps making various statements all the time. We have stopped paying attention to them, frankly speaking,\" the foreign minister noted. \"We do not believe statements, but rather facts, especially when it comes to the Kiev regime,\" he added.\n\n\"I have repeatedly emphasized that we are not going to participate in the ‘peace summit’ even if we receive an invitation,\" Lavrov pointed out.\n\nRussia ready to restore relations with Georgia\n\nMoscow is ready for the normalization of relations with Tbilisi to the extent that Georgia is prepared, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in his year-end interview with TASS.\n\n\"We are determined to normalize Russian-Georgian relations precisely to the extent that Tbilisi is ready,\" he stated.\n\nRussia opposes Taiwan independence in any form\n\nMoscow is against Taiwan’s independence in any form, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in his year-end interview with TASS.\n\n\"Our principled position on the Taiwan issue remains unchanged.

As one Washington Post columnist joked at the time, ‘Relax, He’s not crazy. He’s just Southern.’ \n\nCarter ascended to the White House in 1977 in the shadow the Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon’s blighted administration. \n\nAs a political outsider, he ran on a platform to ‘clean up the mess in Washington’- a strategy that reverberated almost 40 years later when a fast-talking interloper from New York named Donald Trump pledged to ‘drain the swamp’ during his 2016 campaign.\n\nCarter’s single term was marred by an oil crisis that saw Americans waiting in line for gas, and the scourge of ‘stagflation’ – which is high inflation coupled with slow economic growth.\n\nIt culminated in the Iran hostage crisis which saw 52 Americans held in the US Embassy in Tehran for 444 days.\n\nBut as president he also had his victories, including the signing of a formal peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979, known as the Camp David Accords. \n\nHis decades-long focus on humanitarian and diplomatic efforts eventually earned him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.\n\nUntil he was sidelined by the 2020 pandemic, Carter continued to teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in his home town of Plains, Georgia. \n\nHe was married to his wife Rosalynn, for 77 years until her death in November 2023. They were the longest-married presidential couple ever. \n\nTogether they raised four children and enjoyed dozens of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. \n\nAfter surviving metastatic brain and liver cancer in 2015, Carter began hospice care in February 2023 from his two-bedroom Georgia home that he has owned for more than six decades. \n\nHis grandson, Jason, told the New York Times in January 2024: ‘He was really honored and glad that he made it to the end with my grandmother, and that was a real treasure for him.’\n\n‘I think that for whatever reason, the way he approaches this is from a place of enormous faith. And so he just believes that for whatever reason, God’s not done with him yet.’\n\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924 in Plains, Georgia, a village that now has a population of around 725. \n\nHe has the distinction of being the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital. His father, whom he was named after, was a hardworking farmer and businessman, and his mother, Lillian Gordy Carter, was a nurse.\n\nJimmy, as he would be called, was raised on his family’s peanut farm outside of Plains in a rural community of 200 people called Archery. \n\nHis father operated a store for his workers that sold essentials such as salt and sugar and goods like soap, overalls and work shoes, according to Peter G Bourne’s 1997 biography on Jimmy Carter. \n\nThe elder Carter was ‘fastidious about every dollar, (and) had a rule that everything on the farm had to pay its way.’ \n\nJimmy Carter later attributed ‘his fiscal conservatism to the teaching of his father during these depression years,’ according to the biography.\n\nLife on the farm, where he did chores from a young age – gathering eggs and pumping water – ‘was a Huckleberry Finn existence,’ wrote Bourne, who served as a special assistant to Carter during his presidency and who had known him since the 1960s. \n\nHis mother worked as a nurse while his father became a community leader and, at one point, served in Georgia’s state legislature. \n\nCarter was the first of four children. His sister, Gloria, was born on October 22, 1926, then Ruth, born on August 7, 1929, and the youngest, his brother, Billy, on March 29, 1937.\n\nAll three of his younger siblings later died of pancreatic cancer. \n\nWhile the family would eventually become somewhat affluent, Carter’s childhood home lacked electricity and indoor plumbing. \n\nAt age ten, Carter stacked produce from his family farm onto a wagon and began selling it in town. After saving his money by age 13, Carter purchased five houses around Plains that the Great Depression had put on the market at rock-bottom prices.\n\nPostcards from his uncle, Tom Gordy, during his travels as part of the U.S. Navy, interested the young Carter, and from an early age he set his sights on going to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, which has a high bar for admission. \n\nAfter Carter graduated from high school in 1941, he attended Georgia Southwestern College and the Georgia Institute of Technology in order to get into the academy. He was admitted in 1943. \n\nWhile on leave and back home in Plains two years later, Carter went on a date with 17-year-old Rosalynn Smith. \n\nHe had known Rosalynn since she was born, and he was just three years old. Rosalynn was friends with his younger sister Ruth. \n\nThe morning after the date, he told his mother: ‘She’s the one I’m going to marry,’ Carter recalled in his 2015 book, A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety.\n\n‘She was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussions on the rumble seat of the Ford Coupe,’ he wrote.\n\nEleanor Rosalynn Smith was born on August 18, 1927. \n\nGrowing up in Plains, she excelled academically and was her class valedictorian, and had a strong relationship with God and her faith. Carter grew up in the Baptist church, according to Bourne’s biography.\n\nRosalynn rejected his first proposal, telling Carter she promised her father she would finish college before marriage. \n\nThey continued to write to each other, however, when he went back to Annapolis, and by the next February, she accepted his proposal, according to the book. They were married on July 7, 1946 in Plains.\n\n‘Jimmy was wearing his white Navy summer uniform and Rosalynn wore a white-and-blue dress,’ Bourne wrote.\n\nAfter he graduated from the Naval Academy with a bachelor’s degree, Carter’s Naval career started in Norfolk, Virginia where he trained enlisted men. \n\nThe couple had their first child, John William Carter, known as Jack, on July 3, 1947. He then applied to the Navy’s submarine program and the young family moved to New London, Connecticut. \n\nThe couple would have three more children: James Earl Carter III, known as Chip, on April 12, 1950, Donnel Jeffrey, known as Jeff, born on August 18, 1952, and Amy Lynn, the youngest who was born on October 19, 1967. Americans would get to know her later as a young child in the White House.\n\nAfter six years in the Navy and moving around the country depending on his deployment, Carter began working under then Captain Hyman G. Rickover, who was overseeing the branch’s nuclear-powered submarine program. \n\nBut then Carter had ‘a major existential crisis,’ according to Bourne’s biography. \n\nHis father, 58, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He died on July 22, 1953. His mother, Lillian, wanted Carter to come back to Plains to take over the family’s business, which was struggling. But Rosalynn did not want to go back.\n\n‘It precipitated the greatest crisis of their marriage,’ according to the biography with Carter saying: ‘She almost quit me.’\n\nNonetheless, Carter resigned from the Navy after serving for seven years and the family moved back to Plains. \n\nBy the end of the decade, Carter and Rosalynn were able to turn around the farm and business, which was called Carter’s Warehouse.\n\nIt was a ‘general-purpose seed and farm supply company,’ according to the biography on his presidential library website. \n\nCarter also started becoming more involved in his community, and in 1955, he ran his first successful campaign: a seat on the Sumter County Board of Education. \n\nBy 1962, Carter was a Georgia state senator, serving two terms. He ran for governor in 1966 but lost.\n\nAfter the loss, Carter ‘turned increasingly for solace to his faith’ and became a born-again Christian, according to Bourne’s biography.\n\nIn his book, A Full Life, Carter noted that it took him running for office in 1962 for some of the dynamics in his marriage to Rosalynn to change, writing that they became ‘real partners.’ \n\nBourne pointed out that Rosalynn became his ‘political partner,’ and she chose to focus on mental health issues. ‘Few were aware of what a significant role she played in their political symbiosis,’ Bourne wrote.\n\nCarter tried again for governor, this time winning in 1970. \n\nWhile governor, Carter served both as chair for the Democratic Governor’s Campaign Committee in 1972 and then the campaign chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1974.\n\nWhen he announced his candidacy for president in 1974, Carter was not well-known on a national level. \n\n‘Public reaction to his candidacy revealed that exposure to his party was not enough to gain him wide recognition,’ said his biographer.\n\nIn fact, the leading newspaper in his home state ran a headline the day after his announcement that proclaimed, “Jimmy Who Is Running For What!?”‘\n\nBut the country was reeling. \n\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 after three articles of impeachment, including obstruction of justice, were adopted by a House of Representatives’ committee. \n\nThe scandal began after the arrest of the five men who broke into the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, DC, and subsequent cover-up. \n\nMeanwhile, the war in Vietnam continued and did not end until the next year under Gerald Ford, who became president after Nixon’s resignation. \n\n‘In response to the twin nightmares of Vietnam and Watergate that had shattered public confidence in government… Americans gravitated toward leaders who were outside the Washington sphere. \n\nAnswering the nation’s need, Carter’s slogan was ‘A Leader, For A Change,’ and Carter portrayed himself as an outsider who could ‘clean up the mess in Washington.’\n\nIt worked, and Carter won the Democratic nomination, and chose Walter Mondale, a senator from Minnesota, as his running mate. \n\nGerald Ford had represented Michigan’s 5th congressional district since 1949 when then Vice President Spiro T Agnew resigned on October 10, 1973 due to a corruption scandal that was separate from Watergate. \n\nFord then became vice president and after Nixon resigned, president. He secured the Republican presidential nomination and chose Bob Dole, a senator for Kansas, as his running mate.\n\nThe election was close but Carter won. \n\n‘With hard work and favorable circumstances, I was chosen, and I relished the challenges and opportunities to make important decisions as president,’ Carter wrote in his book, A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety.\n\nWhen Carter took office on January 20, 1977, he ‘sought to run the country the way he had run his farm – with unassuming austerity. This would be no “imperial presidency” like those of (Lyndon B) Johnson and Nixon,’ Robert Strong wrote.\n\nCarter wanted to ‘portray himself as a president close to the people,’ and to that end, ‘carried his own suit bag when he traveled,’ ‘ended the practice of “Hail to the Chief” played whenever he made a public appearance,’ and Amy was enrolled in a public school, Bourne wrote in his biography.\n\nHe wanted to balance the budget and reduce the deficit, reorganize the federal government and establish ‘a long-range energy policy for the nation,’ according to the biography. \n\nBut he had a contentious relationship with Congress despite the fact that Democrats had majorities in both the Senate and the House.\n\nCarter tried to reduce the country’s dependence on oil – there had been an earlier energy crisis in 1973 – and created the Department of Energy while enacting conservation measures. \n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, known as OPEC, pushed the price of oil higher from $13 to over $34, and Strong noted in his essay that ‘this huge price increase resulted in a run-up in inflation.’\n\nBy Independence Day in 1979, many Americans had to wait in line to get their gas. Soon after, Carter gave his so-called ‘malaise’ speech, which according to NPR, was ‘to address the energy crisis, unemployment, inflation and something else a bit more nebulous:\n\n‘The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation,’ Carter said.\n\nInitially, the speech was received positively, but then several members of his cabinet left – some resigned, some were fired.\n\n‘It’s from then on that Carter had a really difficult time at bouncing back and being seen on the part of the American people as a strong and significant leader – especially a leader that could take America through solving the energy crisis,’ Kevin Mattson, author of What the Heck Are You Up To, Mr. President?, told NPR.\n\n‘As a one-term southern governor with no national experience, it was presumed Carter came to office with little knowledge or interest in foreign policy. In fact, Carter saw foreign affairs as the most exciting and intellectually stimulating challenge of his presidency,’ Bourne wrote.\n\nCarter’s biggest success and, perhaps, failure both came on the foreign policy front. Strong wrote that the 39th president was ‘determined to make human rights considerations integral to US foreign policy… Just as important, Carter’s emphasis on human rights was consistent with his own beliefs on the necessity of living one’s life in a moral way.’\n\nOnce he took office, Carter sought to revive the Middle East peace process. Diplomatic efforts between Israel, Egypt and the US bore fruit when Carter met with Israel’s Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egypt’s President Anwar Sadat at Camp David, the president’s retreat in Maryland, for a peace summit that lasted 13 days starting on September 6, 1978.\n\nThe treaty, which was signed on March 26, 1979 normalized relations between the two countries.\n\nCarter also normalized relations between China and the United States in 1979.\n\nAbout two years into his tenure, Carter would face the crisis that some contend was partly why he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980: Iranian students took over the American Embassy in Tehran, holding 66 Americans hostage on November 4, 1979.\n\n‘It was the most fateful day of the Carter presidency,’ Bourne wrote.\n\n‘The nightly television pictures of Iranian students – burning the American flag, parading the hostages blindfolded, and shouting defiant anti-American slogans – enraged the American public.’\n\nA failed attempt to rescue the hostages in April 1980 along with an economic downtown lingered in the mind of voters during an election year. Carter was able to fend off a challenge from Ted Kennedy, then senator of Massachusetts, for the Democratic nomination but he was no match for Reagan, who beat him soundly: 489 electoral votes to Carter’s 49.\n\nWhile some of the hostages were freed, 52 people were held until January 20, 1981 when Reagan took office.\n\nAfter the loss, Carter and his wife went back to Plains, but all was not well with the family’s business, which had been put in a trust to avoid conflict of interests during his presidency.\n\nBourne wrote that their warehouse business was ‘more than $1 million in debt. They still owned approximately 4,000 acres of farmland, but in terms of cash they were near bankruptcy.’ The couple wrote their memoirs, and Carter has authored more than 30 books.\n\nWhile working on his presidential library, Bourne wrote that Carter ‘could not summon much enthusiasm for building a mausoleum to his presidency,’ and that even before he left the White House, ‘he had the idea of creating an institutional base for his continuing role in public life.’\n\nCarter said to Rosalynn, according to the book: ‘We can develop a place to help people resolve disputes.’\n\nThis was how the Carter Center, was born, according to the biography. The Carters founded the center in 1982, partnering with Emory University in Atlanta. The nonprofit’s mission to ‘advance peace and health worldwide,’ with numerous programs and democratic initiatives that includes observing elections, according to its website. \n\nCarter also continued to put his skills as a negotiator and foreign affairs knowledge to use, and ‘served as a freelance ambassador for a variety of international missions, including soothing disputes between countries, observing elections in nations with histories of fraudulent voting processes, and advising presidents on Middle East issues,’ Strong wrote. \n\nIn 1994, he helped the US to mediate with Kim Il-sung of North Korea regarding a pact on nuclear weapons. He also worked on other negotiations, such as the Nairobi Agreement in 1999 between Sudan and Uganda. He went on a mission to Haiti, and in 2002, a trip to Cuba where he met with Fidel Castro, according to Strong.\n\nThe Carters also worked with Habitat for Humanity, a Christian nonprofit that builds affordable houses for those in need. The Carters contributed financially to the international organization, and helped to build homes since 1984.\n\n‘Habitat, apart from the Carter Center, (is) the only organization for which they would allow their names to be used for fund-raising purposes,’ Bourne noted.\n\nIndeed, even after a fall in October 2019, Carter was seen working and drilling on a Habitat home with Rosalynn. \n\nIn 2002, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, according to its website, ‘for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.’ \n\nCarter, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015 but beat it, told People that he had been at ease with having a few weeks left.\n\nIn the July 2023, Carter’s family announced that he was receiving hospice care at his two-bedroom home that he has lived in for the last 60 years.\n\nHis long goodbye had seemingly defied the odds of those who enter hospice care at the end of their life. \n\n‘He has also always been very ambitious — and that ambition extends to wanting to stick around and see what happens in the world,’ said his biographer, Jonathan Alter.\n\n‘Carter once told me that he thought the biggest misconception about him was that he is weak,’ Alter added. \n\n‘He’s been a record-breaker for decades — the oldest-living president, the longest-married president,’ said longtime friend, Jill Stuckey, to the New York Times in February. \n\n‘It’s always been on President Carter’s terms. That’s how he’s living, and that’s how he’s going to die,’ she added.\n\n‘It’s hard to live until you’re 95 years old,’ he told the magazine for an article published in October 2019. ‘I think the best explanation for that is to marry the best spouse: someone who will take care of you and engage and do things to challenge you and keep you alive and interested in life.’","summary":"Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, has died at&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/jimmy-carters-journey-from-peanut-farmer-to-president/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/13/20/19451458-7546661-Rosalynn_and_Carter_have_visited_more_than_145_countries_accordi-a-25_1626206199695.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-30 00:09:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.361},{"id":276954084,"title":"Jimmy Carter, the U.S. president from the Plains, dies at 100","text":"Article content\n\nJimmy Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, endured humbling defeat after one tumultuous term and then redefined life after the White House as a global humanitarian, has died. He was 100 years old.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe longest-lived American president died on Sunday, more than a year after entering hospice care, at his home in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife, Rosalynn, who died at 96 in November 2023, spent most of their lives, The Carter Center said.\n\nBusinessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, citizen of the world — Carter forged a path that still challenges political assumptions and stands out among the 45 men who reached the nation’s highest office. The 39th president leveraged his ambition with a keen intellect, deep religious faith and prodigious work ethic, conducting diplomatic missions into his 80s and building houses for the poor well into his 90s.\n\n“My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,” Carter once said.\n\nA president from Plains\n\nA moderate Democrat, Carter entered the 1976 presidential race as a little-known Georgia governor with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and technocratic plans reflecting his education as an engineer. His no-frills campaign depended on public financing, and his promise not to deceive the American people resonated after Richard Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia.\n\n“If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,” Carter repeated before narrowly beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who had lost popularity pardoning Nixon.\n\nCarter governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women’s rights and America’s global role. His most acclaimed achievement in office was a Mideast peace deal that he brokered by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for 13 days in 1978. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy.\n\nYet Carter’s electoral coalition splintered under double-digit inflation, gasoline lines and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His bleakest hour came when eight Americans died in a failed hostage rescue in April 1980, helping to ensure his landslide defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan.\n\nCarter acknowledged in his 2020 “White House Diary” that he could be “micromanaging” and “excessively autocratic,” complicating dealings with Congress and the federal bureaucracy. He also turned a cold shoulder to Washington’s news media and lobbyists, not fully appreciating their influence on his political fortunes.\n\n“It didn’t take us long to realize that the underestimation existed, but by that time we were not able to repair the mistake,” Carter told historians in 1982, suggesting that he had “an inherent incompatibility” with Washington insiders.\n\nCarter insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to “protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully” and “enhance human rights here and abroad” — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term.\n\nAnd then, the world\n\nIgnominious defeat, though, allowed for renewal. The Carters founded The Carter Center in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind base of operations, asserting themselves as international peacemakers and champions of democracy, public health and human rights.\n\n“I was not interested in just building a museum or storing my White House records and memorabilia,” Carter wrote in a memoir published after his 90th birthday. “I wanted a place where we could work.”\n\nThat work included easing nuclear tensions in North and South Korea, helping to avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti and negotiating cease-fires in Bosnia and Sudan. By 2022, The Carter Center had declared at least 113 elections in Latin America, Asia and Africa to be free or fraudulent. Recently, the center began monitoring U.S. elections as well.\n\nCarter’s stubborn self-assuredness and even self-righteousness proved effective once he was unencumbered by the Washington order, sometimes to the point of frustrating his successors.\n\nHe went “where others are not treading,” he said, to places like Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had wandered across the border in 2010.\n\n“I can say what I like. I can meet whom I want. I can take on projects that please me and reject the ones that don’t,” Carter said.\n\nIf I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don't vote for me\n\nHe announced an arms-reduction-for-aid deal with North Korea without clearing the details with Bill Clinton’s White House. He openly criticized President George W. Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also criticized America’s approach to Israel with his 2006 book “Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.” And he repeatedly countered U.S. administrations by insisting North Korea should be included in international affairs, a position that most aligned Carter with Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nAmong the center’s many public health initiatives, Carter vowed to eradicate the guinea worm parasite during his lifetime, and nearly achieved it: Cases dropped from millions in the 1980s to nearly a handful. With hardhats and hammers, the Carters also built homes with Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe Nobel committee’s 2002 Peace Prize cites his “untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.” Carter should have won it alongside Sadat and Begin in 1978, the chairman added.\n\nCarter accepted the recognition saying there was more work to be done.\n\n“The world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place,” he said. “The greater ease of travel and communication has not been matched by equal understanding and mutual respect.”\n\n‘An epic American life’\n\nCarter’s globetrotting took him to remote villages where he met little “Jimmy Carters,” so named by admiring parents. But he spent most of his days in the same one-story Plains house — expanded and guarded by Secret Service agents — where they lived before he became governor. He regularly taught Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church until his mobility declined and the coronavirus pandemic raged. Those sessions drew visitors from around the world to the small sanctuary where Carter will receive his final send-off after a state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral.\n\nThe common assessment that he was a better ex-president than president rankled Carter and his allies. His prolific post-presidency gave him a brand above politics, particularly for Americans too young to witness him in office. But Carter also lived long enough to see biographers and historians reassess his White House years more generously.\n\nHis record includes the deregulation of key industries, reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil, cautious management of the national debt and notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health. He focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictators to release thousands of political prisoners. He acknowledged America’s historical imperialism, pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders and relinquished control of the Panama Canal. He normalized relations with China.\n\n“I am not nominating Jimmy Carter for a place on Mount Rushmore,” Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s domestic policy director, wrote in a 2018 book.\n\n“He was not a great president” but also not the “hapless and weak” caricature voters rejected in 1980, Eizenstat said. Rather, Carter was “good and productive” and “delivered results, many of which were realized only after he left office.”\n\nMadeleine Albright, a national security staffer for Carter and Clinton’s secretary of state, wrote in Eizenstat’s forward that Carter was “consequential and successful” and expressed hope that “perceptions will continue to evolve” about his presidency.\n\n“Our country was lucky to have him as our leader,” said Albright, who died in 2022.\n\nJonathan Alter, who penned a comprehensive Carter biography published in 2020, said in an interview that Carter should be remembered for “an epic American life” spanning from a humble start in a home with no electricity or indoor plumbing through decades on the world stage across two centuries.\n\n“He will likely go down as one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history,” Alter told The Associated Press.\n\nA small-town start\n\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains and spent his early years in nearby Archery. His family was a minority in the mostly Black community, decades before the civil rights movement played out at the dawn of Carter’s political career.\n\nCarter, who campaigned as a moderate on race relations but governed more progressively, talked often of the influence of his Black caregivers and playmates but also noted his advantages: His land-owning father sat atop Archery’s tenant-farming system and owned a main street grocery. His mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns.\n\nSeeking to broaden his world beyond Plains and its population of fewer than 1,000 — then and now — Carter won an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946. That same year he married Rosalynn Smith, another Plains native, a decision he considered more important than any he made as head of state. She shared his desire to see the world, sacrificing college to support his Navy career.\n\nCarter climbed in rank to lieutenant, but then his father was diagnosed with cancer, so the submarine officer set aside his ambitions of admiralty and moved the family back to Plains. His decision angered Rosalynn, even as she dived into the peanut business alongside her husband.\n\nCarter again failed to talk with his wife before his first run for office — he later called it “inconceivable” not to have consulted her on such major life decisions — but this time, she was on board.\n\n“My wife is much more political,” Carter told the AP in 2021.\n\nHe won a state Senate seat in 1962 but wasn’t long for the General Assembly and its back-slapping, deal-cutting ways. He ran for governor in 1966 — losing to arch-segregationist Lester Maddox — and then immediately focused on the next campaign.\n\nCarter had spoken out against church segregation as a Baptist deacon and opposed racist “Dixiecrats” as a state senator. Yet as a local school board leader in the 1950s he had not pushed to end school segregation even after the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision, despite his private support for integration. And in 1970, Carter ran for governor again as the more conservative Democrat against Carl Sanders, a wealthy businessman Carter mocked as “Cufflinks Carl.” Sanders never forgave him for anonymous, race-baiting flyers, which Carter disavowed.\n\nUltimately, Carter won his races by attracting both Black voters and culturally conservative whites. Once in office, he was more direct.\n\n“I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,” he declared in his 1971 inaugural address, setting a new standard for Southern governors that landed him on the cover of Time magazine.\n\n‘Jimmy Who?’\n\nHis statehouse initiatives included environmental protection, boosting rural education and overhauling antiquated executive branch structures. He proclaimed Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the slain civil rights leader’s home state. And he decided, as he received presidential candidates in 1972, that they were no more talented than he was.\n\nIn 1974, he ran Democrats’ national campaign arm. Then he declared his own candidacy for 1976. An Atlanta newspaper responded with the headline: “Jimmy Who?”\n\nThe Carters and a “Peanut Brigade” of family members and Georgia supporters camped out in Iowa and New Hampshire, establishing both states as presidential proving grounds. His first Senate endorsement: a young first-termer from Delaware named Joe Biden.\n\nYet it was Carter’s ability to navigate America’s complex racial and rural politics that cemented the nomination. He swept the Deep South that November, the last Democrat to do so, as many white Southerners shifted to Republicans in response to civil rights initiatives.\n\nA self-declared “born-again Christian,” Carter drew snickers by referring to Scripture in a Playboy magazine interview, saying he “had looked on many women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.” The remarks gave Ford a new foothold and television comedians pounced — including NBC’s new “Saturday Night Live” show. But voters weary of cynicism in politics found it endearing.\n\nCarter chose Minnesota Sen. Walter “Fritz” Mondale as his running mate on a “Grits and Fritz” ticket. In office, he elevated the vice presidency and the first lady’s office. Mondale’s governing partnership was a model for influential successors Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden. Rosalynn Carter was one of the most involved presidential spouses in history, welcomed into Cabinet meetings and huddles with lawmakers and top aides.\n\nThe Carters presided with uncommon informality: He used his nickname “Jimmy” even when taking the oath of office, carried his own luggage and tried to silence the Marine Band’s “Hail to the Chief.” They bought their clothes off the rack. Carter wore a cardigan for a White House address, urging Americans to conserve energy by turning down their thermostats. Amy, the youngest of four children, attended District of Columbia public school.\n\nWashington’s social and media elite scorned their style. But the larger concern was that “he hated politics,” according to Eizenstat, leaving him nowhere to turn politically once economic turmoil and foreign policy challenges took their toll.\n\nAccomplishments, and ‘malaise’\n\nCarter partially deregulated the airline, railroad and trucking industries and established the departments of Education and Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He designated millions of acres of Alaska as national parks or wildlife refuges. He appointed a then-record number of women and nonwhite people to federal posts. He never had a Supreme Court nomination, but he elevated civil rights attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the nation’s second highest court, positioning her for a promotion in 1993. He appointed Paul Volker, the Federal Reserve chairman whose policies would help the economy boom in the 1980s — after Carter left office. He built on Nixon’s opening with China, and though he tolerated autocrats in Asia, pushed Latin America from dictatorships to democracy.\n\nBut he couldn’t immediately tame inflation or the related energy crisis.\n\nAnd then came Iran.\n\nAfter he admitted the exiled Shah of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun in 1979 by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Negotiations to free the hostages broke down repeatedly ahead of the failed rescue attempt.\n\nThe same year, Carter signed SALT II, the new strategic arms treaty with Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, only to pull it back, impose trade sanctions and order a U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.\n\nAn exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence\n\nHoping to instill optimism, he delivered what the media dubbed his “malaise” speech, although he didn’t use that word. He declared the nation was suffering “a crisis of confidence.” By then, many Americans had lost confidence in the president, not themselves.\n\nCarter campaigned sparingly for reelection because of the hostage crisis, instead sending Rosalynn as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him for the Democratic nomination. Carter famously said he’d “kick his ass,” but was hobbled by Kennedy as Reagan rallied a broad coalition with “make America great again” appeals and asking voters whether they were “better off than you were four years ago.”\n\nReagan further capitalized on Carter’s lecturing tone, eviscerating him in their lone fall debate with the quip: “There you go again.” Carter lost all but six states and Republicans rolled to a new Senate majority.\n\nCarter successfully negotiated the hostages’ freedom after the election, but in one final, bitter turn of events, Tehran waited until hours after Carter left office to let them walk free.\n\n‘A wonderful life’\n\nAt 56, Carter returned to Georgia with “no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.”\n\nFour decades after launching The Carter Center, he still talked of unfinished business.\n\n“I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,” Carter told the AP in 2021. “But it’s turned out to be much more long-lasting and insidious than I had thought it was. I think in general, the world itself is much more divided than in previous years.”\n\nStill, he affirmed what he said when he underwent treatment for a cancer diagnosis in his 10th decade of life.\n\n“I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,” he said in 2015. “I’ve had a wonderful life. I’ve had thousands of friends, I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.”\n\nFormer Associated Press journalist Alex Sanz contributed to this report.\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

It's the first such invitation for the UK since the bitter days of the Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe focus of the February meeting is future security and defence co-operation. The backdrop: the volatile state of the world from Europe's perspective.\n\nWars rage in the Middle East and in Europe - with Russia aided in its assault on Ukraine by Iran, North Korea and China.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty haunting this continent, Donald Trump is poised to re-enter the White House.\n\nHe threatens Western cohesion with his pledge to slap punitive tariffs on imports - a big worry to the EU and the UK - and to potentially walk away from Nato, the transatlantic defence alliance Europeans have relied on for security, since its founding after World War Two.\n\nThreats a reminder of shared values\n\nThese threats to security and to trade revenues have helped remind the EU and the UK of the common values they share in unpredictable times.\n\nThe EU felt weakened by Brexit in 2016. It meant losing a big economy and its only significant military power apart from France.\n\nAs for post-Brexit UK, now free from the rules of EU membership, it's also now a far smaller power on the world stage.\n\nAnd, closer to home, the Labour government has realised Europe is key to delivering on a number of priority pledges to the UK public.\n\n\"The economy, defence, migration... there's a European element to all of this, making EU relations important for the whole government agenda. Things which will make a success of this government are tied up with Europe,\" says Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nLabour has repeatedly promised an \"ambitious reset\" of EU-UK relations.\n\nThere has been lots of shuttle diplomacy and symbolism since it won the general election in the summer.\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, Chancellor Rachel Reeves gave a speech at a summit of EU finance ministers, and the prime minister popped over to Brussels for a sit-down with EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nGoodwill in Brussels but scepticism too\n\nBut what does this \"reset\" really mean? What can we expect in 2025?\n\nMight the UK government allow some freedom of movement in exchange for economic benefits on EU trade?\n\nAn EU-UK summit is planned for spring, and a number of political figures and high-level diplomats from EU member states and the UK spoke to me on condition of anonymity ahead of bilateral negotiations getting started.\n\nI kept hearing of the \"enormous amount of goodwill\" in the EU towards the new Labour government with its oft-repeated \"reset\" enthusiasm.\n\nAt the same time though, there is a clear note of Brussels scepticism the Labour government would do well to take heed of, if it wants to see tangible results.\n\n\"The headspace is there. The appetite is there in Europe for closer UK relations,\" one EU figure told me.\n\n\"What's less clear is what London is really interested in - and what trade-offs it's willing to make to get there. That's key and that appears not to have been bottomed out in London yet.\"\n\nDefence and security a win-win agreement\n\nThe defence and security arrangement I have mentioned is the proverbial \"low-hanging fruit\" as far as an EU-UK reset is concerned.\n\nIt's relatively easy to formalise what is already happening: co-operation over Russia sanctions for example, as well as discussions - already taking place inside Nato - over military and defence capabilities and how to best protect Europe against cyber-attacks and attacks on key installations like energy infrastructure in the North Sea.\n\nIt's seen as a win-win agreement.\n\nAnd there is no proposal to make a defence pact legally binding.\n\nThe Labour government does not have to worry here about being seen - by the political opposition or those in the UK who voted Leave - as attempting to \"roll back Brexit\". And it is sensitive about this potential accusation.\n\nBut Labour has also made promises on trade and the economy: to \"make Brexit work\" and to \"tear down\" the trade barriers hard Brexit imposed. The Office for Budget Responsibility reckons Brexit will cost the UK economy 4% of GDP in the long term.\n\nLabour wants to avoid that, but that's not as straightforward as it might sound.\n\nNo 'backdoor' for UK to EU trade deals\n\nEU figures say they're confused by the UK government proclaiming an \"ambitious\" reset while insisting on maintaining restrictive post-Brexit red lines.\n\nA recent working paper setting out EU interests noted there were \"limited economic gains on offer\" because of the UK ruling out rejoining the EU's customs union or single market or accepting the free movement of people.\n\nSome in the EU suspect the UK government believes it can get a quid pro quo on trade for defence. That they say, is never going to happen.\n\n\"The UK is mistaken if it thinks it can use an agreement on defence as a backdoor to getting sweet deals with us on trade,\" an EU diplomat told me.\n\n\"For us, it's like being in a weird tug of war. With the devil on one EU shoulder and an angel on the other. In terms of values, there is more that unites us than divides us with the UK.\n\n\"The EU wants to take action to get the UK closer, but on the other hand, we can't do away with technical minutiae that are the foundation of the EU. We can't make special deals, even if that limits the relationship with the UK.\"\n\nIn order to see significant improvement in economic relations, both sides will have to make compromises.\n\nIn Brussels, there is no appetite to rip up the TCA - the already-existing trade agreement between the EU and UK. But you do detect an EU openness to starting negotiations on different economic sectors simultaneously.\n\n\"We can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" insisted one EU diplomat.\n\nThere's also an acknowledgement on the UK side that sectoral agreements might well have to involve aligning with EU rules in those sectors.\n\nEU looks for return of youth mobility scheme\n\nThe key to any compromise that Labour might make with the EU going forward will be: Can they sell the result back home as a win for the British public?\n\nThe EU will push hard for long term fishing rights in UK waters.\n\nIt also wants a Youth Mobility Scheme, allowing 18-30 year olds to work and/or study in the UK or the EU for up to three years, paying local fees at university if they choose the study option.\n\nThe UK government insists there will be no return to freedom of movement with the EU.\n\nMigration is a hot button issue. But it's notable that Labour has not explicitly ruled out the youth scheme. They've only said they've \"no plans\" to go for it.\n\nOn youth mobility, the assumption is that more EU youngsters would take advantage of a mobility scheme than UK citizens because of language barriers.\n\nBut the UK government might use openness to the EU-requested mobility scheme and/or a fishing agreement as leverage to negotiate something important for UK interests, such as the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which eases cross-Channel business, or the mobility of UK artists and entertainers to travel in the EU.\n\nBoth of these were listed in the Labour election manifesto as priorities if the party got into government.\n\nLabour also wants to move on a veterinary agreement with the EU, to reduce barriers in the trade of food and agricultural products. That would require UK alignment with EU animal and plant health rules.\n\nClimate change and illegal migration\n\nThe EU and UK are both interested in better co-operation and coordination on energy and climate.\n\nSir Keir also labelled this a priority.\n\nLinking carbon emissions trading schemes, as the EU does with a number of other countries, would mean the UK avoiding EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) implications - a cost feared by UK businesses.\n\nAnd removing post-Brexit blockages on the electricity market would deliver €44bn (£36bn) in savings to EU and UK consumers by 2040 and reduce investment costs in North Sea wind by 16%, according to Baringa business consultancy.\n\nThe North Sea basin comprises the UK plus EU member states Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands and Single Market member Norway. It's one of the most promising regions in the world for offshore wind.\n\nOn illegal migration, the EU says it's open to co-operating more closely with the UK. It wants the UK to crack down more on people working illegally in the country.\n\nFrance complains that the ease with which it says irregular migrants can disappear and make a living is a major a pull-factor to the UK for economic migrants.\n\nThe EU has ruled out the UK being able to send migrants, arriving illegally on its shores aboard small boats, back to the EU countries they set off from.\n\nVoters moving faster than their governments\n\nWhatever the developments in EU-UK relations in 2025 and beyond, they are likely to happen slowly because of political concerns and because negotiations have a habit of getting bogged down in detail.\n\nIn direct contrast, a recent poll by YouGov and Datapraxis for the European Council of Foreign Relations suggests voters in the EU and UK are far more gung-ho than leaders in Brussels and London about jumping over previous political taboos to strengthen ties.\n\nThe poll found that around half of those asked in the UK believe greater engagement with the EU is the best way to boost the UK economy (50%), strengthen its security (53%) and effectively manage migration (58%).\n\nWhen asked who the UK government should prioritise relations with, 50% choose Europe and only 17% the US.\n\nA huge 68% of respondents in Britain see a benefit in reintroducing cross-Channel freedom of movement in exchange for access to the European single market.\n\nThe desire for co-operation, and willingness to forgo previous red lines, is also reciprocated in Europe.\n\nA majority of voters in Poland (54%) and Germany (53%) – and a prevailing opinion in Spain (43%), Italy (42%) and France (41%) – believe the EU should grant the UK special access to certain parts of the European single market to secure a closer security-based relationship.\n\nGeopolitical threats and uncertainties appear to be shifting public opinion dramatically. Will the political class in the UK and EU choose to keep up?\n\n courtesy of BBC NEWS\n\nby Katya Adler\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at pr@brudirect.com","url":"https://www.brudirect.com/news.php?id=195646","image":"https://www.brudirect.com/images/news/PSX_20240330_081354.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-30 00:04:51","author":"Katya Adler","authors":["Katya Adler"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.219},{"id":276953274,"title":"Longest-lived US president was always happy to speak his mind","text":"Jimmy Carter, the United States’ longest-lived president, was never afraid of speaking his mind.\n\nForthright and fearless, the Nobel Prize winner took pot-shots at former prime minister Tony Blair and ex-US president George W Bush among others.\n\nHis death came after repeated bouts of illness in which images of the increasingly frail former president failed to erase memories of his fierce spirit.\n\nDemocrat James Earl “Jimmy” Carter Jr swept to power in 1977 with his Trust Me campaign helping to beat Republican president Gerald Ford.\n\nServing as 39th US president from 1977 to 1981, he sought to make government “competent and compassionate” but was ousted by the unstoppable Hollywood appeal of a certain Ronald Reagan.\n\nA skilled sportsman, Mr Carter left his home of Plains, Georgia, to join the US Navy, returning later to run his family’s peanut business.\n\nA stint in the Georgia senate lit the touchpaper on his political career and he rose to the top of the Democratic movement.\n\nBut he will also be remembered for a bizarre encounter with a deeply disgruntled opponent.\n\nThe president was enjoying a relaxing fishing trip near his home town in 1979 when his craft was attacked by a furious swamp rabbit which reportedly swam up to the boat hissing wildly.\n\nThe press had a field day, with one paper bearing the headline President Attacked By Rabbit.\n\nAway from encounters with belligerent bunnies, Mr Carter’s willingness to address politically uncomfortable topics did not diminish with age.\n\nHe recently said that he would be willing to travel to North Korea for peace talks on behalf of US President Donald Trump.\n\nHe also famously mounted a ferocious and personal attack on Tony Blair over the Iraq war, weeks before the prime minister left office in June 2007.\n\nMr Carter, who had already denounced George W Bush’s presidency as “the worst in history”, used an interview on BBC radio to condemn Mr Blair for his tight relations with Mr Bush, particularly concerning the Iraq War.\n\nAsked how he would characterise Mr Blair’s relationship with Mr Bush, Mr Carter replied: “Abominable. Loyal, blind, apparently subservient.\n\n“I think that the almost undeviating support by Great Britain for the ill-advised policies of President Bush in Iraq have been a major tragedy for the world.”\n\nMr Carter was also voluble over the Rhodesia crisis, which was about to end during his presidency.\n\nHis support for Robert Mugabe at the time generated widespread criticism.\n\nHe was said to have ignored the warnings of many prominent Zimbabweans, black and white, about what sort of leader Mugabe would be.\n\nThis was seen by Mr Carter’s critics as “deserving a prominent place among the outrages of the Carter years”.\n\nMr Carter has since said he and his administration had spent more effort and worry on Rhodesia than on the Middle East.\n\nHe admitted he had supported two revolutionaries in Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, and with hindsight said later that Mugabe had been “a good leader gone bad”, having at first been “a very enlightened president”.\n\nOne US commentator wrote: “History will not look kindly on those in the West who insisted on bringing the avowed Marxist Mugabe into the government.\n\n“In particular, the Jimmy Carter foreign policy… bears some responsibility for the fate of a small African country with scant connection to American national interests.”\n\nIn recent years Mr Carter developed a reputation as an international peace negotiator.\n\nHe won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his commitment to finding peaceful solutions to international conflicts, his work with human rights and democracy initiatives, and his promotion of economic and social programmes.\n\nMr Carter was dispatched to North Korea in August 2008 to secure the release of US citizen Aijalon Mahli Gomes, who had been sentenced to eight years of hard labour after being found guilty of illegally entering North Korea. He successfully secured the release of Mr Gomes.\n\nIn 2010 he returned to the White House to greet President Barack Obama and discuss international affairs amid rising tensions on the Korean peninsula.\n\nProving politics runs in the family, in 2013 his grandson Jason, a state senator, announced his bid to become governor in Georgia, where his famous grandfather governed before becoming president. He eventually lost to incumbent Republican Nathan Deal.\n\nFears that Mr Carter’s health was deteriorating were sparked in 2015 when he cut short an election observation visit in Guyana because he was “not feeling well”.\n\nIt would have been Mr Carter’s 39th trip to personally observe an international election.\n\nThree months later, on August 12, he revealed he had cancer which had been diagnosed after he underwent surgery to remove a small mass in his liver.\n\nMr Obama was among the well-wishers hoping for Mr Carter’s full recovery after it was confirmed the cancer had spread widely.\n\nMelanoma had been found in his brain and liver, and Mr Carter underwent immunotherapy and radiation therapy, before announcing in March the following year that he no longer needed any treatment.\n\nIn 2017, Mr Carter was taken to hospital as a precaution, after he became dehydrated at a home-building project in Canada.\n\nHe was admitted to hospital on multiple occasions in 2019 having had a series of falls, suffering a brain bleed and a broken pelvis, as well as a stint to be treated for a urinary tract infection.\n\nMr Carter spent much of the coronavirus pandemic largely at his home in Georgia, and did not attend Joe Biden’s presidential inauguration in 2021, but extended his “best wishes”.\n\nFormer first lady Rosalynn Carter, the closest adviser to Mr Carter during his term as US president, died in November 2023.\n\nShe had been living with dementia and suffering many months of declining health.\n\n“Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” Mr Carter said in a statement following her death.\n\n“She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.”","url":"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/news/national/longest-lived-us-president-was-always-happy-to-speak-his-mind-124112/","image":"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/_media/img/SKTEYRH4Z8IR2VM4YF8J.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-30 00:03:54","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":276954960,"title":"Jimmy Carter, Former U.S. President and Three-Time Grammy Winner, Dies at 100","text":"Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, endured humbling defeat after one tumultuous term and then redefined life after the White House as a global humanitarian, has died. He was 100 years old.\n\n The longest-lived American president, and the president who’s won the most Grammy Awards — three, for audiobook or spoken word recordings — died on Sunday (Dec. 29), more than a year after entering hospice care, at his home in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife, Rosalynn, who died at 96 in November 2023, spent most of their lives, The Carter Center said.\n\n “Our founder, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, passed away this afternoon in Plains, Georgia,” the center said in posting about his death on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). It added in a statement that he died peacefully, surrounded by his family.\n\n As reactions poured in from around the world, President Joe Biden mourned Carter’s death, saying the world lost an “extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian” and that he lost a dear friend. Biden cited Carter’s compassion and moral clarity, his work to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and advocate for the disadvantaged as an example for others.\n\n “To all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility,” Biden said in a statement. “He showed that we are a great nation because we are a good people – decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.”\n\n Biden said he is ordering a state funeral for Carter in Washington. \n\n Businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, citizen of the world: Carter forged a path that still challenges political assumptions and stands out among the 45 men who reached the nation’s highest office. The 39th president leveraged his ambition with a keen intellect, deep religious faith and prodigious work ethic, conducting diplomatic missions into his 80s and building houses for the poor well into his 90s.\n\n “My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,” Carter once said.\n\n A moderate Democrat, Carter entered the 1976 presidential race as a little-known Georgia governor with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and technocratic plans reflecting his education as an engineer. His no-frills campaign depended on public financing, and his promise not to deceive the American people resonated after Richard Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia.\n\n “If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,” Carter repeated before narrowly beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who had lost popularity pardoning Nixon.\n\n Carter governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women’s rights and America’s global role. His most acclaimed achievement in office was a Mideast peace deal that he brokered by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for 13 days in 1978. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy.\n\n Yet Carter’s electoral coalition splintered under double-digit inflation, gasoline lines and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His bleakest hour came when eight Americans died in a failed hostage rescue in April 1980, helping to ensure his landslide defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan.\n\n Carter acknowledged in his 2020 White House Diary that he could be “micromanaging” and “excessively autocratic,” complicating dealings with Congress and the federal bureaucracy. He also turned a cold shoulder to Washington’s news media and lobbyists, not fully appreciating their influence on his political fortunes. (Although White House Diary did not receive a nomination, in his lifetime Carter received a total of 10 Grammy Award nominations, and three wins, for audiobook recordings: Our Endangered Values: America’s Moral Crisis (2007), A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety (2016) and Faith – A Journey for All (2019). Carter could posthumously win a fourth Grammy for his spoken word album Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration, which is nominated for best audio book, narration and storytelling recording at the 2025 Grammys.)\n\n “It didn’t take us long to realize that the underestimation existed, but by that time we were not able to repair the mistake,” Carter told historians in 1982, suggesting that he had “an inherent incompatibility” with Washington insiders.\n\n Carter insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to “protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully” and “enhance human rights here and abroad” — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term.\n\n Ignominious defeat, though, allowed for renewal. The Carters founded The Carter Center in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind base of operations, asserting themselves as international peacemakers and champions of democracy, public health and human rights.\n\n “I was not interested in just building a museum or storing my White House records and memorabilia,” Carter wrote in a memoir published after his 90th birthday. “I wanted a place where we could work.”\n\n That work included easing nuclear tensions in North and South Korea, helping to avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti and negotiating cease-fires in Bosnia and Sudan. By 2022, The Carter Center had declared at least 113 elections in Latin America, Asia and Africa to be free or fraudulent. Recently, the center began monitoring U.S. elections as well.\n\n Carter’s stubborn self-assuredness and even self-righteousness proved effective once he was unencumbered by the Washington order, sometimes to the point of frustrating his successors.\n\n He went “where others are not treading,” he said, to places like Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had wandered across the border in 2010.\n\n “I can say what I like. I can meet whom I want. I can take on projects that please me and reject the ones that don’t,” Carter said.\n\n He announced an arms-reduction-for-aid deal with North Korea without clearing the details with Bill Clinton’s White House. He openly criticized President George W. Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also criticized America’s approach to Israel with his 2006 book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid. And he repeatedly countered U.S. administrations by insisting North Korea should be included in international affairs, a position that most aligned Carter with Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n Among the center’s many public health initiatives, Carter vowed to eradicate the guinea worm parasite during his lifetime, and nearly achieved it: Cases dropped from millions in the 1980s to nearly a handful. With hardhats and hammers, the Carters also built homes with Habitat for Humanity.\n\n The Nobel committee’s 2002 Peace Prize cites his “untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.” Carter should have won it alongside Sadat and Begin in 1978, the chairman added.\n\n Carter accepted the recognition saying there was more work to be done.\n\n “The world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place,” he said. “The greater ease of travel and communication has not been matched by equal understanding and mutual respect.”\n\n Carter’s globetrotting took him to remote villages where he met little “Jimmy Carters,” so named by admiring parents. But he spent most of his days in the same one-story Plains house — expanded and guarded by Secret Service agents — where they lived before he became governor. He regularly taught Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church until his mobility declined and the coronavirus pandemic raged. Those sessions drew visitors from around the world to the small sanctuary where Carter will receive his final send-off after a state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral.\n\n The common assessment that he was a better ex-president than president rankled Carter and his allies. His prolific post-presidency gave him a brand above politics, particularly for Americans too young to witness him in office. But Carter also lived long enough to see biographers and historians reassess his White House years more generously.\n\n His record includes the deregulation of key industries, reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil, cautious management of the national debt and notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health. He focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictators to release thousands of political prisoners. He acknowledged America’s historical imperialism, pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders and relinquished control of the Panama Canal. He normalized relations with China.\n\n “I am not nominating Jimmy Carter for a place on Mount Rushmore,” Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s domestic policy director, wrote in a 2018 book.\n\n “He was not a great president” but also not the “hapless and weak” caricature voters rejected in 1980, Eizenstat said. Rather, Carter was “good and productive” and “delivered results, many of which were realized only after he left office.”\n\n Madeleine Albright, a national security staffer for Carter and Clinton’s secretary of state, wrote in Eizenstat’s forward that Carter was “consequential and successful” and expressed hope that “perceptions will continue to evolve” about his presidency.\n\n “Our country was lucky to have him as our leader,” said Albright, who died in 2022.\n\n Jonathan Alter, who penned a comprehensive Carter biography published in 2020, said in an interview that Carter should be remembered for “an epic American life” spanning from a humble start in a home with no electricity or indoor plumbing through decades on the world stage across two centuries.\n\n “He will likely go down as one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history,” Alter told The Associated Press.\n\n James Earl Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains and spent his early years in nearby Archery. His family was a minority in the mostly Black community, decades before the civil rights movement played out at the dawn of Carter’s political career.\n\n Carter, who campaigned as a moderate on race relations but governed more progressively, talked often of the influence of his Black caregivers and playmates but also noted his advantages: His land-owning father sat atop Archery’s tenant-farming system and owned a main street grocery. His mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns.\n\n Seeking to broaden his world beyond Plains and its population of fewer than 1,000 — then and now — Carter won an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946. That same year he married Rosalynn Smith, another Plains native, a decision he considered more important than any he made as head of state. She shared his desire to see the world, sacrificing college to support his Navy career.\n\n Carter climbed in rank to lieutenant, but then his father was diagnosed with cancer, so the submarine officer set aside his ambitions of admiralty and moved the family back to Plains. His decision angered Rosalynn, even as she dived into the peanut business alongside her husband.\n\n Carter again failed to talk with his wife before his first run for office — he later called it “inconceivable” not to have consulted her on such major life decisions — but this time, she was on board.\n\n “My wife is much more political,” Carter told the AP in 2021.\n\n He won a state Senate seat in 1962 but wasn’t long for the General Assembly and its back-slapping, deal-cutting ways. He ran for governor in 1966 — losing to arch-segregationist Lester Maddox — and then immediately focused on the next campaign.\n\n Carter had spoken out against church segregation as a Baptist deacon and opposed racist “Dixiecrats” as a state senator. Yet as a local school board leader in the 1950s he had not pushed to end school segregation even after the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision, despite his private support for integration. And in 1970, Carter ran for governor again as the more conservative Democrat against Carl Sanders, a wealthy businessman Carter mocked as “Cufflinks Carl.” Sanders never forgave him for anonymous, race-baiting flyers, which Carter disavowed.\n\n Ultimately, Carter won his races by attracting both Black voters and culturally conservative whites. Once in office, he was more direct.\n\n “I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,” he declared in his 1971 inaugural address, setting a new standard for Southern governors that landed him on the cover of Time magazine.\n\n His statehouse initiatives included environmental protection, boosting rural education and overhauling antiquated executive branch structures. He proclaimed Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the slain civil rights leader’s home state. And he decided, as he received presidential candidates in 1972, that they were no more talented than he was.\n\n In 1974, he ran the Democrats’ national campaign arm. Then he declared his own candidacy for 1976. An Atlanta newspaper responded with the headline: “Jimmy Who?”\n\n The Carters and a “Peanut Brigade” of family members and Georgia supporters camped out in Iowa and New Hampshire, establishing both states as presidential proving grounds. His first Senate endorsement: a young first-termer from Delaware named Joe Biden.\n\n Yet it was Carter’s ability to navigate America’s complex racial and rural politics that cemented the nomination. He swept the Deep South that November, the last Democrat to do so, as many white Southerners shifted to Republicans in response to civil rights initiatives.\n\n A self-declared “born-again Christian,” Carter drew snickers by referring to Scripture in a Playboy magazine interview, saying he “had looked on many women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.” The remarks gave Ford a new foothold and television comedians pounced — including NBC’s new Saturday Night Live show. But voters weary of cynicism in politics found it endearing.\n\n Carter chose Minnesota Sen. Walter “Fritz” Mondale as his running mate on a “Grits and Fritz” ticket. In office, he elevated the vice presidency and the first lady’s office. Mondale’s governing partnership was a model for influential successors Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden. Rosalynn Carter was one of the most involved presidential spouses in history, welcomed into Cabinet meetings and huddles with lawmakers and top aides.\n\n The Carters presided with uncommon informality: He used his nickname “Jimmy” even when taking the oath of office, carried his own luggage and tried to silence the Marine Band’s “Hail to the Chief.” They bought their clothes off the rack. Carter wore a cardigan for a White House address, urging Americans to conserve energy by turning down their thermostats. Amy, the youngest of four children, attended District of Columbia public school.\n\n Washington’s social and media elite scorned their style. But the larger concern was that “he hated politics,” according to Eizenstat, leaving him nowhere to turn politically once economic turmoil and foreign policy challenges took their toll.\n\n Carter partially deregulated the airline, railroad and trucking industries and established the departments of Education and Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He designated millions of acres of Alaska as national parks or wildlife refuges. He appointed a then-record number of women and nonwhite people to federal posts. He never had a Supreme Court nomination, but he elevated civil rights attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the nation’s second highest court, positioning her for a promotion in 1993. He appointed Paul Volker, the Federal Reserve chairman whose policies would help the economy boom in the 1980s — after Carter left office. He built on Nixon’s opening with China, and though he tolerated autocrats in Asia, pushed Latin America from dictatorships to democracy.\n\n But he couldn’t immediately tame inflation or the related energy crisis.\n\n And then came Iran.\n\n After he admitted the exiled Shah of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun in 1979 by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Negotiations to free the hostages broke down repeatedly ahead of the failed rescue attempt.\n\n The same year, Carter signed SALT II, the new strategic arms treaty with Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, only to pull it back, impose trade sanctions and order a U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.\n\n Hoping to instill optimism, he delivered what the media dubbed his “malaise” speech, although he didn’t use that word. He declared the nation was suffering “a crisis of confidence.” By then, many Americans had lost confidence in the president, not themselves.\n\n Carter campaigned sparingly for reelection because of the hostage crisis, instead sending Rosalynn as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him for the Democratic nomination. Carter famously said he’d “kick his a–,” but was hobbled by Kennedy as Reagan rallied a broad coalition with “make America great again” appeals and asking voters whether they were “better off than you were four years ago.”\n\n Reagan further capitalized on Carter’s lecturing tone, eviscerating him in their lone fall debate with the quip: “There you go again.” Carter lost all but six states and Republicans rolled to a new Senate majority.\n\n Carter successfully negotiated the hostages’ freedom after the election, but in one final, bitter turn of events, Tehran waited until hours after Carter left office to let them walk free.\n\n At 56, Carter returned to Georgia with “no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.”\n\n Four decades after launching The Carter Center, he still talked of unfinished business.\n\n “I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,” Carter told the AP in 2021. “But it’s turned out to be much more long-lasting and insidious than I had thought it was. I think in general, the world itself is much more divided than in previous years.”\n\n Still, he affirmed what he said when he underwent treatment for a cancer diagnosis in his 10th decade of life.\n\n “I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,” he said in 2015. “I’ve had a wonderful life. I’ve had thousands of friends, I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.”","summary":"Carter, who's won more Grammys than any other president, is nominated again at the 2025 ceremony for 'Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration.'","url":"https://www.billboard.com/culture/politics/jimmy-carter-dead-1235866679/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/jimmy-carter-2018-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-30 00:02:07","author":"Ashley Iasimone","authors":["Ashley Iasimone"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.492},{"id":276959980,"title":"Trump's win means less scrutiny for shady sugar daddy Elon Musk","text":"Winning the 2024 election didn’t just return Donald Trump to power. It also allowed him to dodge multiple criminal cases. And while his unofficial vice president, Elon Musk, didn’t need a Trump win to stay out of jail—at least under any existing charges—the victory likely freed Musk and his companies from regulatory oversight. That’s an exceedingly lucky break for Musk, currently being scrutinized by multiple government agencies for everything from his inflated claims about self-driving Tesla cars to his SpaceX rocket launches polluting wetlands to his purchase of social media platform X—just to name a few. \n\nTo be perfectly fair, Trump’s victory means a far friendlier atmosphere for all greedy billionaires who hate regulations, not just Musk personally. But Musk is the one sitting next to Trump at Thanksgiving and the one who threw roughly $260 million at Trump’s campaign while fawning over him on X and in person. \n\nSo which pesky investigations and regulations is Musk probably free of now that his bestie is headed to the White House?\n\nFor starters, perhaps he’ll get out from under the alphabet soup of agencies looking into Tesla’s so-called full self-driving system, or FSD. Musk has promised a vision of a completely autonomous hands-free Tesla since 2013. It’s not a vision that has ever come true. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has twice required Tesla to recall FSD because of the system’s bad habit of ignoring traffic laws, including being programmed to run stop signs at slow speeds. In October, the agency opened another inquiry after the company reported four crashes, one of which killed a pedestrian, when FSD was used in low-visibility conditions like fog. \n\nThe issue isn’t just that FSD is unsafe. It’s also that Tesla hoovered up cash by selling a product that basically doesn’t exist. Tesla owners filed a class-action lawsuit in 2022 alleging the company defrauded them by charging $15,000 for an FSD package that didn’t result in a Tesla being able to drive itself successfully. Tesla’s defense? Full self-driving is merely an aspirational goal, so a failure to provide it isn’t a deliberate fraud—just bad luck. Perhaps that’s the same excuse Tesla would have trotted out in response to the Department of Justice’s criminal investigation into whether the company committed wire fraud by deceiving consumers about FSD’s capabilities and securities fraud by deceiving investors. \n\nTrump named former reality show star and former Congressman Sean Duffy to head the Department of Transportation, of which NHTSA is a part, and tapped one of his impeachment defense attorneys, Pam Bondi, to head the DOJ after Matt Gaetz’s nomination flamed out. There’s no reason to think either of these people will grow a spine and continue investigating “first buddy” Elon Musk or Tesla. \n\nTrump’s election also probably gives SpaceX breathing room. Musk’s private space company, which receives literal billions in government money, hasn’t been terribly interested in following government rules. \n\nIn September, the Environmental Protection Agency fined SpaceX $148,378 for dumping industrial wastewater and pollutants into wetlands near its Texas launch site. The company paid that fine, albeit with some whining about how it was “disappointing” to pay when it disagreed with the allegations, but it’s planning on challenging the recent $633,000 fine from the Federal Aviation Administration. The regulatory agency proposed the fine after two launches in 2023 where the company allegedly didn’t get FAA approval for launch procedure changes and didn’t follow license requirements. \n\nThis isn’t SpaceX’s first run-in with the FAA. The aerospace company paid a $175,000 fine in October 2023 over not submitting required safety data to the agency before a 2022 launch of Starlink satellites. After an April 2023 launch where one of the company’s rockets blew up shortly after takeoff, sending debris over South Texas, the FAA required the agency to make dozens of changes before another launch. \n\nLike the NHTSA, the FAA is part of the Transportation Department. Sean Duffy’s past as an airline industry lobbyist doesn’t inspire confidence that he’ll take a hard line against SpaceX. \n\nAnd as far as whether the EPA will continue to pose any problems for Musk? Under Trump, that agency will be run by former GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin, whose primary qualification seems to be hating EPA regulations. He’s voted against replacing lead water pipes and cleaning up brownfields and sees his mission at the EPA as pursuing “energy dominance.” Again, not exactly someone who will bring the hammer down on Musk or his companies. \n\nMusk is also in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the possibility he delayed disclosing his acquisition of Twitter stock in 2022. Investors must disclose when they accumulate 5% of a publicly traded company, a requirement that ostensible super-genius Musk says he misunderstood somehow. Under President Joe Biden, current SEC chair Gary Gensler has aggressively pursued enforcement efforts, a trend in no way expected to continue under whoever Trump picks. \n\nLightning round! Musk tried hard to violate a consent order with the Federal Trade Commission by giving “Twitter Files” writers improper access to user data, but he was thwarted by Twitter employees who actually followed the order. He’s faced numerous unfair labor practices claims and been investigated multiple times by the National Labor Relations Board, so he’s suing to have the board declared unconstitutional. He lost out on $885 million in government subsidies after the Federal Communications Commission found that Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet service, couldn’t meet the speed metrics for the government’s rural broadband program. \n\nLuckily for the multibillionaire, the incoming head of the FCC is a pal of Musk’s who thinks it is “regulatory harassment” to require Starlink to meet program requirements. \n\nMusk will also have the advantage of helming a newly invented entity, the cringily titled Department of Government Efficiency (aka DOGE—ugh), that can put his rivals under a microscope. DOGE’s co-head, fellow tech billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, has already said he’ll examine a government loan to Rivian, a competing electric vehicle manufacturer, calling the loan “a political shot across the bow at Elon Musk and Tesla.” Though DOGE is not an actual department—you need Congress to create one of those—and cannot slash spending directly, Musk could still suggest to Trump that government funding of fiber optic cables in rural areas be gutted. This would leave satellite services like Starlink as the only option for some rural consumers—an option either those consumers or the government would then have to pay for. \n\nUntil Trump was elected in 2016, it was impossible to imagine giving billionaires like Musk so much opportunity to use the levers of government to openly and directly benefit themselves. Now that Trump has won a second term in office, Musk is just one of many oligarchs looking forward to an extremely lucrative four years. It’s lucky for them—but terrible for the rest of us.","summary":"Winning the 2024 election didn’t just return Donald Trump to power. It also allowed him to dodge multiple criminal cases.

Here are some of the reactions to Carter’s death at age 100.\n\nPresident Biden, first lady Dr. Jill Biden\n\nPresident Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden praised Carter and mourned the loss of “an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian.”\n\n“Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well,” the Bidens said in a statement. “With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us. He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe.”\n\nThey urged Americans to study Carter, whom they described as “a man of principle, faith, and humility.”\n\n“He showed that we are great nation because we are a good people — decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong,” the Bidens said.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\n\nIn a statement posted on Truth Social, former president and now President-elect Donald Trump wrote:\n\n “I just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History. The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude. Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.” \n\nSen. Raphael Warnock\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat who represents Carter’s home state of Georgia in Congress, called Carter “one of my heroes.”\n\n“His leadership was driven by love, his life’s project grounded in compassion and a commitment to human dignity,” Warnock said in a statement. “For those of us who have the privilege of representing our communities in elected office, Jimmy Carter is a shining example of what it means to make your faith come alive through the noble work of public service.”\n\nWarnock spoke fondly of Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, who died in November 2023.\n\n“He brought his family to worship at my church. At a family dinner, I remember the President and his amazing wife, Rosalyn, holding my daughter, then just two months old, as if she were their own granddaughter. They were among my favorite people,” Warnock said.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who represents Georgia, said Carter “will be remembered for his commitment to democracy and human rights, his enduring faith, his philanthropic leadership, and his deep love of family.”\n\n“From Plains to across the State of Georgia, the United States, and around the world, millions will forever admire and appreciate all that President Carter did for the United States and for the global community,” Ossoff wrote in a statement. “The State of Georgia and the United States are better places because of President Jimmy Carter. I join all Georgians and all Americans in mourning his loss. May Jimmy Carter’s memory be a blessing.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Carter “personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion, and through integrity.”\n\n“From his legacy as President, to his dedication to improving human rights across the globe, and his tireless efforts alongside his wife Rosalynn, in building a better world through Habitat for Humanity, he inspired millions with his unwavering commitment to justice and equality,” Schumer wrote. \n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican representing Kentucky and the party’s longtime Senate leader, reflected on Carter’s humble origins as a peanut farmer and member of the U.S. military before becoming president. \n\n“He returned home and saved the family farm before feeling drawn to a different sort of public service. And less than 15 years after his first campaign for the state Senate, his fellow Americans elected him leader of the free world,” McConnell said.\n\n“Jimmy Carter’s character and commitment, just like his crops, were fruits of all-American soil. After every season when life led him to lofty service far from home, he came back home again, determined to plow his unique experiences and influence into helping others; into building and teaching and volunteering; into further enriching the same rich soil that had made his own life possible,” McConnell said.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, praised Carter’s service to the nation and his efforts to advance the cause of peace around the world.\n\n“Today, the thoughts of Americans and the prayers of Congress are lifted up on behalf of the Carter family,” Johnson said in a statement. “President Carter’s story was one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless opportunities available in this great nation. Because of his work in brokering the Camp David Accords and his advocacy with Habitat for Humanity, the world is a more peaceful place, and more Americans have a place to call home. No one can deny that President Carter led an extraordinary life of service to his country. May he rest in peace.”\n\nFormer President George W. Bush\n\nFormer President George W. Bush, a Republican who served as the 43rd president of the United States, said Carter was “a man of deeply held convictions.”\n\n“He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations. We join our fellow citizens in giving thanks for Jimmy Carter and in prayer for his family,” Bush said in a statement.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama\n\nIn a lengthy post on social media, former Democratic President Barack Obama reflected on the decades Carter spent teaching Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia — lessons that brought visitors from around the world.\n\n “Some who came to hear him speak were undoubtedly there because of what President Carter accomplished in his four years in the White House – the Camp David Accords he brokered that reshaped the Middle East; the work he did to diversify the federal judiciary, including nominating a pioneering women’s rights activist and lawyer named Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the federal bench; the environmental reforms he put in place, becoming one of the first leaders in the world to recognize the problem of climate change. Others were likely there because of what President Carter accomplished in the longest, and most impactful, post-presidency in American history – monitoring more than 100 elections around the world; helping virtually eliminate Guinea worm disease, an infection that had haunted Africa for centuries; becoming the only former president to earn a Nobel Peace Prize; and building or repairing thousands of homes in more than a dozen countries with his beloved Rosalynn as part of Habitat for Humanity. But I’m willing to bet that many people in that church on Sunday morning were there, at least in part, because of something more fundamental: President Carter’s decency. Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did — advocating for the public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more important than reelection — things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God’s image. Whenever I had a chance to spend time with President Carter, it was clear that he didn’t just profess these values. He embodied them. And in doing so, he taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service. In his Nobel acceptance speech, President Carter said, ‘God gives us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace.’ He made that choice again and again over the course of his 100 years, and the world is better for it.” \n\nVice President Kamala Harris\n\nVice President Kamala Harris called Carter’s life “a testament to the power of service.” “He reminded our nation and the world that there is strength in decency and compassion,” she said in a statement.\n\n“President Jimmy Carter was guided by a deep and abiding faith — in God, in America, and in humanity,” she said. “As President, he protected our air and water, promoted transparency in government, and brokered an historic peace treaty between Egypt and Israel at Camp David,” and she noted that after he left office, he “continued his fight for peace, democracy, and human dignity through the Carter Center.”\n\n“I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come. Our world is a better place because of President Carter.”","summary":"The death on Sunday of former President Jimmy Carter, the nation&#8217;s oldest former president in history, quickly prompted tributes from the U.S. and abroad, with responses coming in from world leaders and ordinary citizens, celebrities and politicians and people whose lives he affected.

Part Deux\n\n Jack Gleason ——Bio and Archives--December 29, 2024\nCover Story | CFP Comments | Reader Friendly | Subscribe | Email Us\n\nIt’s been about six weeks since “the Great Drone Scare of 2024” commenced.\n\nTen days ago I wrote an article using basic logic to puzzle out the who, what, when and why.\n\nJason Sullivan, the drone expert from Unleashed.news, wrote the most complete article I’ve seen about what the drones actually are.\nDiese Gummibärchen sind eine echte „Abnehmbombe“! (Schock)SchlankheitsgummisYou Might Also Like Ads by Ad.Style\n“Real-World Testing in Plain Sight”\nHe agreed with me that they’re not aliens or foreign. The drones are from the United States military and are obviously a US PSYOP to frighten the public. But for what purpose?\nSullivan’s follow-up article was released on The Gateway Pundit yesterday.\nHe concludes that this is “Real-World Testing in Plain Sight.”\n“Without a shadow of a doubt, the overwhelming and irrefutable evidence reveals that the so-called “mystery drones” are none other than the PteroDynamics X-P4 Transwing VTOL UAS and Skyways V2.6 drones—technological marvels actively tested under NAWCAD’s BWUAS program. Every aspect of their performance, from gravity-defying darting motions to seamless morphing transformations and silent hovering, perfectly matches the thousands of eyewitness accounts flooding in from New Jersey and beyond.”\n“But the true revelation lies not just in identifying these drones but in recognizing the spectacle surrounding their deployment. These are not covert operations shrouded in secrecy; they are deliberate, high-visibility demonstrations. Flying with navigational lights blazing, these drones perform aggressive maneuvers directly over suburban neighborhoods, rural areas, and even critical infrastructure, demanding public attention. At the same time, government agencies orchestrate a coordinated denial campaign, sowing confusion and fueling wild speculation—everything from extraterrestrial origins to foreign adversaries is on the table.”\nYou Might Also LikeDiese Gummibärchen sind eine echte „Abnehmbombe“!

Flying with navigational lights blazing like Christmas trees, they perform aggressive maneuvers directly over neighborhoods, darting left and right, hovering at low altitudes, and then accelerating at high speeds into the night sky. Their behavior is not subtle; it’s theatrical.”\n“This is also a psychological operation (PSYOP), designed to create hysteria and provoke wild speculation.”\nSullivan offers a brief history of “False Flags and Manufactured Consent,” starting with the Gulf of Tonkin and the Iraq war.\nHe then lists three possible reasons for the drone scare…\n\n“War escalation – Using public outrage to justify conflict with a nation like Iran, China, or Russia.\nMartial law – Enabling domestic crackdowns under the guise of national security.\nElection interference – Delaying or undermining a peaceful transfer of power under the pretext of national crisis.”\nHe concludes, “This is not a conspiracy theory—it’s a pattern of behavior deeply embedded in the history of U.S. foreign policy. The intentional obfuscation surrounding these drones, combined with their potential for a catastrophic incident, makes it clear that this situation is far more than it appears. \n\nLook at statements on H.R.8610 from both sides of the political spectrum\nWe must ask ourselves: Are these drones being used to test the boundaries of public perception and prepare for a false flag operation that could thrust us into yet another manufactured conflict?”\nSo H.R.8610 looks like the shiny new 2025 version of the Patriot Act that will allow total surveillance of all electronic signals in the United States, “in order to keep us safe.” I can’t even imagine what else will be buried deep in the continuing resolution. We’ll just have to read it after they vote for it.\n\nTo get a clue, look at statements on H.R.8610 from both sides of the political spectrum…\nOn the 14th, liberal puppet Kathy Hochul urgently called for the passage of the bill.\nSenator Chuck Schumer praised the bill, which \"explicitly authorizes state and local authorities to conduct drone detection and helps them better coordinate with federal law enforcement agencies to keep communities safe.\"\n“Reps. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) and Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) [A RINO] sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) urging them to include a measure in the continuing resolution that addresses the recent spike in drone sightings.”\nEven the NFL has weighed in asking for the legislation to protect their stadiums. Is this a clue?\n\nDiese Gummibärchen sind eine echte „Abnehmbombe“! (Schock)SchlankheitsgummisYou Might Also Like Ads by Ad.Style\n\nSweeping authority to surveil every electronic transmission in the country\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul blocked the request stating his concerns that the bill would allow sweeping authority to surveil every electronic transmission in the country. \"It's about unchecked government overreach. It's about capitalizing on fear and media-driven hysteria\" that could violate the civil liberties of Americans.\nThankfully, on December 18th, Reuters reported “The U.S. Senate rejected a bid on Wednesday to fast-track legislation to expand U.S. government authority to detect and destroy drones that could pose security threats over stadiums and other locations.” But the fight for H.R.8610 isn’t over.\nSo are the drones part of a plan to start World War III, a way to declare Martial Law, a plot to deny Trump the presidency, or a way to scare Americans into accepting the end of their electronic privacy?\nI’m still not sure. All of the above?\nWhichever their plan, it relies on panicking the American people to accept the final elimination of their freedoms. But the last four years - and some would say “fifty years” of U.S. history shows that our government is no longer to be trusted.\n\nDiese Gummibärchen sind eine echte „Abnehmbombe“! (Schock)SchlankheitsgummisYou Might Also Like Ads by Ad.Style\nWhat if there was a panic and no one came?\nWhat if there was a panic and no one came?\nIt looks like things might be shaping up that way. In a recent article, I pointed out how Americans have reached the tipping point – we no longer trust anything said by our government or the “mainstream media.” We’re not going to take this crap any more.\nTalk is cheap, action is priceless. Take a minute to contact your representatives at the national level and tell them…\nYou’re watching them carefully.\nIf they continue to ignore the will of their voters who have demanded Donald Trump’s agenda of world peace and domestic prosperity, we will primary them, and we will be selecting candidates for 2026 starting today. Elon Musk has promised to fund them, and we’ll be working on their campaigns as volunteers and donors.\nWe see them failing to do their jobs – from FEMA’s purposeful lack of performance in North Carolina to continued election fraud across the country, we’re mad as hell and we’re not going to take it anymore.\nDo your jobs or YOU’RE FIRED!\n\n View Comments \nJack Gleason——Bio and Archives\nJack Gleason is a common sense conservative writer.

After all, I was a vocal evangelical-Christian critic of Trump, and now the religious right was gathering steam for revenge. Some Trump-supporting evangelicals wanted me to be fired or the religious organization I was working for at the time to be defunded. I was rattled by what a Trump presidency would mean for American democracy and, more important, for the witness of the Church after white evangelicals proved to be Trump’s most loyal base. Carter was unfazed.\n\n“These things have happened before,” he said. “Everything has a way of coming back around. What seems unstoppable and inevitable never is.”\n\nI thought to myself, Well, he should know. Carter had experienced himself how quickly political realities change.\n\nIn 1976, Carter’s evangelical Christianity was part of his appeal to some Americans and befuddling to others. One television newscaster assured viewers that Carter’s having been “born again” did not entail a claim to receiving direct messages from God. His emergence seemingly from nowhere had prompted Newsweek to declare 1976 “The Year of the Evangelical.”\n\n“The idea of a Baptist in the White House has sent some Americans into panic,” remarked Duke McCall, who was president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary during the 1976 presidential campaign. “Maybe they did not notice that Harry Truman and Warren G. Harding were Baptist presidents. The trouble is that Jimmy Carter not only is a Southern Baptist—he talks like one.”\n\nIndeed he did.\n\nCarter’s most prominent statement of the 1976 campaign was saying that he couldn’t judge other people, because he had “looked on a lot of women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.” To secular America, such talk sounded alien and awkward. For some the comment was quaint and prudish, and for others it was akin to one’s uncle choosing the Thanksgiving table to confess his kinky sexual fantasies. To evangelical America, though, the words recalled Jesus’s admonition in the Sermon on the Mount that no one (except Jesus himself) could claim to be without sin. Giving a word of testimony about one’s own sin was routine in Sunday-school classes all over the country. That Carter told this to Playboy and included the words screws and shacks up was a different matter.\n\nThe seminary president’s suggestion that Carter was not just a Baptist but a Southern Baptist, and that he “talks like one” left undefined whether he meant Carter’s un-self-conscious God talk or his widely lampooned Georgia accent. He talked “like one” of us in more ways than one.\n\nSouthern Baptists knew that the world outside the Bible Belt didn’t understand our revivals or our conversion testimonies or our biblical allusions. We also knew that the same people mocked our accents, too. A U.S. president from the Deep South was as incredible to some parts of America, it seemed, as the television show Hee Haw winning an Emmy.\n\nCarter captured the white evangelical vote, winning the Bible Belt (including my home state of Mississippi). An evangelical publisher released The Miracle of Jimmy Carter. His public witness was praised in Christianity Today, and he had the support of such figures as Pat Robertson and Richard John Neuhaus.\n\nAnd then he went from Bible Belt icon to loathed foe of a newly energized religious-right political network in four short years—a network that was itself a kind of trans-denominational, parachurch “evangelical” project. As Randall Balmer’s biography, Redeemer, demonstrates, Carter was representative of a kind of fusion evangelicalism—strong on the need for personal conversion and sharing one’s faith with others but also politically liberal or moderate on such questions as racial justice, women’s rights, nuclear disarmament, and so on.\n\nCarter clearly was out of step with most of his fellow white evangelicals—especially on abortion (about which he was squeamish but which he was unwilling to see legally curbed), the Equal Rights Amendment, and other “family values” questions. While identity politics at first earned Carter an unusual coalition of the South’s Black and white working-class constituencies, the accent and the testimony were eventually not enough.\n\nRonald Reagan didn’t go to church—much less teach Sunday school—and yet he solidified white evangelicals, especially southerners, against Carter. That Republican-evangelical alliance has, if anything, grown more and more uniform ever since.\n\nIn fact Carter became an example commonly offered by Trump-supporting evangelical leaders as to why they could support a three-times-married casino magnate who boasted of his adultery. “Jimmy Carter was a good Sunday-school teacher, but he wouldn’t stand up for us,” they would say in the 1980s. “Ronald Reagan would.” By the time of Trump, almost every example of his lack of personal character would be met with “We’re electing a president, not a pastor.”\n\nIn some ways, this argument—whatever one thinks of Carter or Reagan or Trump—is sound and in line with American evangelical heritage. The colonial-era Baptists would never have allowed Thomas Jefferson or James Madison to teach Sunday school but were more than happy to ally with them for religious liberty. Being born again does not give one any special expertise in governance.\n\nFew evangelicals, Carter supporters or not, questioned his personal integrity. He might lust in his heart, but no one could imagine Jimmy Carter paying hush money to a porn star. The idea that personal integrity is not enough had morphed, by the Trump era, into the idea that personal integrity doesn’t matter at all. When Donald Trump Jr. ridiculed the idea of “turning the other cheek” as a sign of weakness, the biblical reference seemed just as lost on this generation as “adultery in my heart” had to the last—except, this time, it seemed lost on evangelicals themselves.\n\nI expected the 2016 meeting with Carter to be a kind of awkward “I told you so” session. I am, after all, from the more conservative theological wing of Southern Baptist life; Carter, the more moderate. I was then president of the public-policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention with which Carter had loudly broken in the early 2000s, arguing that the “conservative” leaders were concerned not about biblical fidelity but about power. I couldn’t have imagined that five years after our meeting, I would be gone from Southern Baptist life too.\n\nThe reality of the conversation, though, was the opposite. Carter wanted to know how the missions boards were doing, reminiscing that he had expected to serve on a “Bold Mission Thrust” effort in 1978, but “I couldn’t because of work.” He asked about the Baptist Woman’s Missionary Union and talked about the Brotherhood Commission, a now-defunct Southern Baptist men’s ministry. He talked—in detail—about the workings of Southern Baptist entities, about the personalities of past Southern Baptist leaders. I would later remark to my wife that I couldn’t think of a single Southern Baptist Church member, save maybe one, who would have known even half the acronyms and names he discussed.\n\nThis, too, is part of an evangelical America that no longer exists. Survey after survey shows the rise of nondenominational churches, and the collapse of membership in the Christian denominations. Most people in a typical Southern Baptist church would see themselves as devoted to the gospel and to Jesus but would hardly shape their identity around being Southern Baptist. In fact, some studies—such as those referenced by the political scientist Daniel K. Williams—show one of the most rapidly growing sectors of politically active self-identified “evangelicals” as those who never attend church at all. It’s not just that they want a president and not a pastor in the Oval Office. They don’t want a pastor at all.\n\nNow that Jimmy Carter has died—our longest-living president—I think of what he said when he finally got around to what he wanted to talk about, back in 2016. “Getting beat up in public is hard,” he said. “I want to pray for you.”\n\nI don’t remember what all he said in the prayer. I remember he used all of these phrases pulled straight from the Baptist Hymnal. I remember him asking God to keep “my heart close to Jesus.” And I remember that at the end he pronounced Amen the way any Southern Baptist from our background would: “Ay-men.”\n\nIf I could go back to that meeting, I would probably talk less with him about Trump and more about what those of us who are born-again Christians believe about eternal life. I might have said that death, like political ups and downs, is not the last word. “Everything has a way of coming back around,” I might say. “What seems unstoppable and inevitable never is.”\n\nBut, then again, he already knew that.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/jimmy-carter-death-evangelical-church-donald-trump/673180/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/f4yxiVpcYc38gZKfM8p-PO1Utf4=/0x630:1516x1420/1200x625/media/img/mt/2023/02/image_5/original.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-29 23:38:50","author":"Russell Moore","authors":["Russell Moore"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.379},{"id":276949714,"title":"James Fallows: Jimmy Carter Was a Lucky Man","text":"Life is unfair, as a Democratic president once put it. That was John F. Kennedy, at a press conference early in his term.\n\nJimmy Carter did not go through as extreme a range of the blessings and cruelties of fate as did Kennedy and his family. But I think Carter’s long years in the public eye highlighted a theme of most lives, public and private: the tension between what we plan and what happens. Between the luck that people can make for themselves and the blind chance they cannot foresee or control.\n\nIn the decades of weekly Bible classes he led in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, Jimmy Carter must have covered Proverbs 19:21. One contemporary translation of that verse renders it as: “Man proposes, God disposes.”\n\nNot everything in his life happened the way Jimmy Carter proposed or preferred. But he made the very most of the years that God and the Fates granted him.\n\nAmericans generally know Jimmy Carter as the gray-haired retiree who came into the news when building houses or fighting diseases or monitoring elections, and whose political past became shorthand for the threadbare America of the 1970s. Most of today’s Americans had not been born by the time Carter left office in 1981. Only about one-fifth are old enough to have voted when he won and then lost the presidency. It is hard for Americans to imagine Jimmy Carter as young—almost as hard as it is to imagine John F. Kennedy as old.\n\nBut there are consistent accounts of Carter’s personality throughout his long life: as a Depression-era child in rural Georgia, as a hotshot Naval Academy graduate working in Hyman Rickover’s then-futuristic-seeming nuclear-powered submarine force, as a small businessman who entered politics but eventually was forced out of it, as the inventor of the modern post-presidency.\n\nWhat these accounts all stress is that, old or young, powerful or diminished, Jimmy Carter has always been the same person. That is the message that comes through from Carter’s own prepresidential campaign autobiography, Why Not the Best?, and his many postpresidential books, of which the most charming and revealing is An Hour Before Daylight: Memories of a Rural Boyhood. It is a theme of Jonathan Alter’s insightful biography, His Very Best. It is what I learned in two and a half years of working directly with Carter as a speechwriter during the 1976 campaign and on the White House staff, and in my connections with the Carter diaspora since then.\n\nWhatever his role, whatever the outside assessment of him, whether luck was running with him or against, Carter was the same. He was self-controlled and disciplined. He liked mordant, edgy humor. He was enormously intelligent—and aware of it—politically crafty, and deeply spiritual. And he was intelligent, crafty, and spiritual enough to recognize inevitable trade-offs between his ambitions and his ideals. People who knew him at one stage of his life would recognize him at another.\n\nJimmy Carter didn’t change. Luck and circumstances did.\n\nJimmy Carter made his luck, and benefited from luck, when he ran for president. He couldn’t have done it without his own discipline and commitment, and his strategy. He seemed to shake every hand in Iowa—but his team was also the first to recognize that the new Iowa caucus system opened the chance for an outsider to leap into the presidency. At a time when his national name recognition was 1 percent, he spent all day walking up to strangers and saying, “My name is Jimmy Carter, and I’m running for president.” Stop and imagine doing that yourself, even once. Carter was easier to admire—when delivering his stump speech to a rapt crowd, when introducing himself at a PTA meeting or in a diner—than he was to work for. But that is probably true of most public figures with such a drive to succeed.\n\nBecause he was so engaging in person, and made such a connection in countless small-group meetings across Iowa, he won the caucuses and went on to win the nomination and the presidency. No other candidate has gone from near-invisibility to the White House in so short a time. (Barack Obama became a Democratic Party star with his famous convention speech in 2004, four years before he won the presidency. Donald Trump had been a celebrity for decades.)\n\nThis is how Carter and his team helped themselves. Other developments they hadn’t planned affected the race—mainly to their benefit.\n\nBy early 1976, Carter had become the new thing. He embraced rock music and quoted Bob Dylan. He was as powerful and exciting a fusion of cultures as any candidate who came after him. He was a Naval Academy graduate and an Allman Brothers fan. He was deeply of the South and of the Church. He also spoke about Vietnam as a racist war. He quoted poems by Dylan Thomas. He was, yes, cool. He appeared at a Law Day meeting at the University of Georgia’s law school and upbraided the audience about the injustice of America’s legal system. Here’s just one sample of the speech, which would now be considered part of the Sanders-Warren platform:\n\nIt’s worth reading the whole thing.\n\nBut what if Hunter S. Thompson had not noticed this speech and announced that he “liked Jimmy Carter” in an influential article in Rolling Stone? What if Time and Newsweek, also very influential then, had not certified him as a serious potential leader with their coverage? What if the civil-rights figures Martin Luther King Sr. and Andrew Young had not endorsed Carter to Black audiences around the country, and reassured white liberals that he was the southern voice an inclusive America needed? (As governor of Georgia, Carter had placed a portrait of MLK Jr. in the state capitol.) What if Jerry Brown had not waited so long to enter the primaries? What if Teddy Kennedy had dared to run? What if Mo Udall had figured out the Iowa-caucus angle before Carter did? What if Scoop Jackson had not been so dull? Or George Wallace so extreme?\n\nAnd for the general election, what if Gerald Ford had not pardoned Richard Nixon, turning Watergate into Ford’s own problem? (The Carter team knew that this was a campaign plus. But in the first sentence of his inaugural address, Carter thanked Ford for all he had done “to heal our land.”) What if Saturday Night Live, then in its first season and itself hugely influential, had not made Ford the butt of ongoing jokes? What if Ford had not blundered in a crucial presidential debate? What if Carter’s trademark lines on the stump—I’ll never lie to you and We need a government as good as its people—had not been so tuned to the battered spirit of that moment, and had been received with sneers rather than support?\n\nWhat if, what if. There are a thousand more possibilities. In the end the race was very close. Luck ran his way.\n\nThen he was in office. Intelligent, disciplined, self-contained, spiritual. President Carter made some of his own luck, good and bad—as I described in this magazine 44 years ago. There is little I would change in that assessment, highly controversial at the time, except to say that in 1979 Carter still had nearly half of his time in office ahead of him, and most of his adult life. I argued then that his was a “passionless” presidency. He revealed his passions—his ideals, his commitments—in the long years to come.\n\nIn office he also had the challenge of trying to govern a nearly ungovernable America: less than two years after its humiliating withdrawal from Saigon, in its first years of energy crisis and energy shortage, on the cusp of the “stagflation” that has made his era a symbol of economic dysfunction. It seems hard to believe now, but it’s true: The prime interest rate in 1980, the year Carter ran for reelection, exceeded 20 percent. You never hear, “Let’s go back to the late ’70s.”\n\nProbably only a country as near-impossible to lead as the United States of that time could have given someone like Jimmy Carter a chance to lead it.\n\nDespite it all, Carter had broader support during his first year in office than almost any of his successors, except briefly the two Bushes in wartime emergencies. Despite it all, most reckonings have suggested that Carter might well have beaten Ronald Reagan, and held on for a second term, if one more helicopter had been sent on the “Desert One” rescue mission in Iran, or if fewer of the helicopters that were sent had failed. Or if, before that, Teddy Kennedy had not challenged Carter in the Democratic primary. Or if John Anderson had not run as an independent in the general election. What if the ayatollah’s Iranian government had not stonewalled on negotiations to free its U.S. hostages until after Carter had been defeated? What if, what if.\n\nCarter claimed for years that he came within one broken helicopter of reelection. It’s plausible. We’ll never know.\n\nBecause we do know, in retrospect, that Reagan had two landslide victories, over Carter and then Walter Mondale, and that the 1980 election broke heavily in Reagan’s favor in its final weeks, it’s natural to believe that Carter never had a chance. But it looked so different at the time. History changed, through effort and luck, when Carter arrived on the national stage in 1976. And it changed, through effort and luck, when he departed four years later.\n\nEffort and luck combined for Jimmy Carter’s first two acts: becoming president, and serving in office.\n\nLuck played a profoundly important role in his third act, allowing him to live mostly vigorously until age 98, and to celebrate his 76th wedding anniversary with his beloved wife, Rosalynn. He had 42 full years in the postpresidential role—10 times longer than his term in office, by far the most of any former president.\n\nThis extended span mattered for reasons within Carter’s control, and beyond it. Good fortune, medical science, and a lifetime history as a trim, fit athlete (he was a good tennis player, a runner, and a skillful softball pitcher), helped Carter survive several bouts of cancer and other tolls of aging. But his faith, will, idealism, and purpose allowed him to invent and exemplify a new role for former presidents, and to see his own years in office reconsidered.\n\nSuppose that, like Lyndon B. Johnson, he had died of a literal and figurative broken heart at age 64. His record and achievements would have concluded with Ronald Reagan still in office, and his story would have been summarized as ending on a loss. Carter could never have received the Nobel Peace Prize, which he won while nearing age 80, in 2002. (Nobel Prizes cannot be given posthumously.)\n\nWith health like Lyndon Johnson’s, Jimmy Carter would not have had a chance to establish his new identity—and to see prevailing assessments of his role as president change as profoundly as those of Harry Truman did. As with Truman, the passing years have made it easier to see what Carter achieved, and to recognize what he was trying to do even when unsuccessful. But Truman was no longer alive to see that happen. For Carter I think the process of reassessment will go on.\n\nIt is hard for most Americans to imagine the Jimmy Carter of those days. It is hard even for me to recognize how different the country is as a whole.\n\nJust to talk about politics: The South was then the Democrats’ base, and the West Coast was hostile territory. Jimmy Carter swept all states of the old Confederacy except Virginia, and lost every state west of the Rockies except Hawaii. In Electoral College calculations, the GOP started by counting on California.\n\nThe Democrats held enormous majorities in both the Senate and the House. Carter griped about dealing with Congress, as all presidents do. But under Majority Leader Robert Byrd, the Democrats held 61 seats in the Senate through Carter’s time. In the House, under Speaker Tip O’Neill, they had a margin of nearly 150 seats (not a typo). The serious legislative dealmaking was among the Democrats.\n\nIn culture and economics—well, you just need to watch some movies from the 1970s, Rocky, Taxi Driver, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon (or, if you prefer, Saturday Night Fever and Star Wars). The United States was a country fraying on all its edges, just beginning to absorb the shock of the Vietnam years, in its first wave of grappling with globalization and environmental constraints.\n\nPrevailing memories reached back far beyond Vietnam to the Korean War, World War II, and the Great Depression. In campaign speeches, Carter talked about the difference it made to him, as a boy, when Franklin Roosevelt’s Rural Electrification Administration brought electric power to small communities like his. We on the speechwriting staff could rely on the story for applause. Enough people remembered.\n\nThere were no cellphones then, nor even bulky “portable” phones. Computers meant behemoths at major data centers.\n\nAnd in civic life, Richard Nixon’s downfall seemed to have reinforced the idea that there was such a thing as public shame. It was construed as embarrassing for Jimmy Carter that his hard-luck brother, Billy, was in a penny-ante way cashing on the family fame by promoting six packs of his own “Billy Beer.” Carter, from a small-town business-owning background, felt that he had to sell the family peanut mill to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. After Nixon’s scandals and Spiro Agnew’s resignation, “doing the right thing” mattered, and Carter did so.\n\nJimmy Carter took office in the “before” times. We live in an unrecognizable “after.” He did his best, in office and out, to promote the values he cared about through it all.\n\nWhat did he do in office? He did a lot. He was visionary about climate and the environment. He changed the composition of the federal courts. For better and worse he deregulated countless industries, from craft brewing to the airlines. I direct you to Stuart Eizenstat’s detailed and authoritative President Carter: The White House Years for specifics. I’ll just add:\n\nJimmy Carter survived to see many of his ambitions realized, including near eradication of the dreaded Guinea worm, which, unglamorous as it sounds, represents an increase in human well-being greater than most leaders have achieved. He survived to see his character, vision, and sincerity recognized, and to know that other ex-presidents will be judged by the standard he has set.\n\nHe was an unlucky president, and a lucky man.\n\nWe are lucky to have had him. Blessed.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/jimmy-carter-accomplishments-james-fallows/673146/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/2YF0kIo9b5BQtnekCdqBgvwo0eE=/0x621:2160x1746/1200x625/media/img/mt/2023/02/Jimmy_Carter-2/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-29 23:38:50","author":"James Fallows","authors":["James Fallows"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.053},{"id":276948990,"title":"BIG claim by Donald Trump, accuses Democrats of paying millions to Beyoncé, Oprah for...","text":"Donald Trump has accused the Democratic Party of paying millions of dollars to celebrities to endorse Kamala Harris. In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that the Democrats spent large sums of money to secure the support of stars like Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, and Reverend Al Sharpton, calling the actions “totally against the law.” Trump specifically mentioned figures of $11 million, $2 million, and $500,000, accusing the Democrats of paying these amounts to get endorsements. He also referred to Sharpton as a “third-rate con man.” However, the sources of these figures remain unclear. Beyoncé and Oprah did appear alongside Harris during her presidential campaign. Beyoncé performed at events, and Oprah hosted a live-stream event in September. Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, interviewed Harris and held a rally to encourage people to vote. His nonprofit, the National Action Network, reportedly received a $500,000 donation from Harris’ campaign, although MSNBC stated it was unaware of any such donation, according to reports. Oprah Winfrey has denied being paid for her support. She stated that her production company, Harpo, was only compensated for providing production services for the event. Initially, reports suggested Harpo received $1 million, but it was later revealed that the actual payment was closer to $2.5 million, a small portion of Harris’ $1.5 billion campaign budget.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-big-claim-by-donald-trump-accuses-democrats-of-paying-millions-to-beyonc-oprah-for-kamala-harris-3124796","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2024/12/29/2669300-image-2024-12-19t112447.924.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-29 23:33:50","author":"Shivam Verma","authors":["Shivam Verma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.931},{"id":276948918,"title":"Know US tech firm that helped track Osama Bin Laden and counter terrorism long before rise of AI","text":"Palantir Technologies, a data analytics company, started as a tech intelligence startup to provide data intelligence and security aid to the US government long before AI became a tech rage. It used to provide US intelligence agencies with high technology to recognised threats before they arise. It is rumored that the company with its cutting-edge technology likely helped the US government track down Osama bin Laden. The story of the company has its roots in the tragic event of 9/11. Palantir’s CEO Alex Karp realised the deep flaws in American intelligence that led to such a tragic event and recognised them. He felt there was a need for better tools and technology to prevent such terrorist acts and threats of such large scale. After this event, Karp co-founded Palantir with Peter Thiel in 2003. Their goal was to use data in such a way that threats like these can be prevented. The CEO said that he has created such a company that turns huge amounts of data into powerful tools used for intelligence and national security. Palantir’s products Gotham and Metropolis are Palantir’s two main products. Counterterrorism analysts at numerous US government agencies use Gotham. Till a few years ago they sold the data to only the government sector. However, the company has a secretive reputation stemming from their operations in fields like spycraft, antiterrorism, and intelligence collection. While Metropolis is mostly utilized by financial services firms, Gotham is utilized for a variety of purposes, including counterterrorism. What does Palantir do? War, surveillance, and AI are Palantir’s main areas of operations which heavily dealt in tech and privacy issues. They create software that enables soldiers and spies to track down the threats by making connections between mountains of data that are impossible for a human to handle on their own. And they do all of this while attempting to tightly control any personal information that shouldn't be involved. Not just military intelligence, they expanded into the fields of finance, medicine, and even aviation. For example, Palantir was there to help manage the crisis when COVID-19 threw the world into disarray by using data analysis to track the virus's spread and distribute supplies. However, this heroic way of functioning has not let the company or its founders out of controversies as they have always swum in the risky waters of tech and privacy. The company transformed the way technology is used in the most sensitive areas of security and privacy. By providing solutions to increase operational efficiency and reduce expenses, Palantir has set its eyes on revolutionizing the business sector. Their products are now also used to detect fraud and help charity organisations. Examples include, investigating illegal financial transactions connected to global human trafficking, they declined a sizable contract with a major tobacco corporation because they were concerned that the data might identify the groups most vulnerable to cigarette sales. Palantir’s rise in market Under Karp's direction, Palantir has become a significant force in AI and machine learning. The company's stock has risen 300 percent since April 2023, greatly exceeding both Nvidia's 180 percent gain and the S&P 500's 28 percent increase. The company has won large contracts, such as the USD 178 million TITAN combat system and the USD 480 million Maven AI project. The value of Palantir's cofounders' stock holdings skyrocketed through 2024 when the company's market capitalization nearly doubled. Who is Alex Karp? Alex Karp, an unsual leader, has been the company’s CEO since 2004, and as of December 2024, Forbes estimated his net worth at US$7.7 billion. He completed his PhD in neoclassical social theory from Goethe University Frankfurt after which he founded Palantir. Karp donated to Joe Biden during 2020 election and even this time he supported Kamala Harris while Thiel supported Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/technology/report-know-us-tech-firm-that-helped-track-osama-bin-laden-and-counter-terrorism-long-before-rise-of-ai-palantir-alex-karp-3124810","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2024/12/29/2669315-alex-karp-is-the-ceo-of-palantir.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-29 23:33:50","author":"Vaishali Shastri","authors":["Vaishali Shastri"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.079},{"id":276948876,"title":"Donald Trump sides with Elon Musk on H-1B visa debate: Here's what it means","text":"In a major shift from his earlier stance, US-President elect Donald Trump has expressed his support for the H-1B visa programme and acknowledged frequently using it for his own properties, calling it a \"great programme,\" according to a report by New York Post. Calling it a \"great programme,\" the President-elect said he has \"always\" been in its favour. \"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favour of the visas. That's why we have them,\" Trump said in a telephonic interview with the New York Post. He added, \"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It's a great programme.\" Notably, during Trump's first term, the administration imposed restrictions on H-1B visas, citing concerns over \"abuse\" and \"economic strain.\" In 2016, Trump condemned the program, describing it as a means for companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign employees. Restrictions tightened further in 2020 in response to economic challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump's latest remarks comes after a major divide emerged within his MAGA team in the United States, as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy who advocated for the expansion of the visa program for 'highly skilled workers' faced heavy backlash from within President-elect's base. Musk and Ramaswamy -- both foreign origin leaders heading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- reignited the debate on H-1B visas, while reflecting a divide over immigration policy as Trump prepares to assume office. The debate over H1B visas and immigration policy has intensified following Trump's announcement of Sriram Krishnan as the White House policy adviser on artificial intelligence. Krishnan has previously supported removing per-country caps for green cards, a stance that has sparked mixed reactions. While some Trump supporters back this approach, citing its potential to fill critical gaps in the tech workforce, others see it as conflicting with the administration's broader immigration goals. The H1B visa debate has exposed deeper divides in US immigration policy, particularly regarding the balance between skilled immigration and domestic workforce development. With Indian workers comprising 72 per cent of H1B recipients in fiscal year 2023, this issue also has implications for US-India relations.

And in doing so, he taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service.\n\n“In his Nobel acceptance speech, President Carter said, ‘God gives us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace,'” Obama said. “He made that choice again and again over the course of his 100 years, and the world is better for it.”\n\nBut the messages came from across the political spectrum. \n\n“I just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter,” President-elect Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\n“Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,” Trump wrote. “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden also reacted to Carter’s death, calling him “an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian” in a statement released by the White House. \n\n“With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us,” Biden said. “He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe.\n\n“He was a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism,” he said. “We will always cherish seeing him and Rosalynn together. The love shared between Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.”\n\nAmong the scores of others offering condolences was former President George W. Bush, who issued a statement on X through the Bush presidential center. \n\n“James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions,” the statement said. “He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. \n\n“His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations,” Bush wrote. “We join our fellow citizens in giving thanks for Jimmy Carter and in prayer for his family.”\n\nMeanwhile, former President Bill Clinton also honored Carter for being “guided by his faith.”\n\n“From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia, to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama,” Clinton said in the statement, “he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world.”\n\nAlso commenting was New York’s senior senator.\n\n“Today we mourn the loss of one of our most humble and devoted public servants,” US Sen. Chuck Schumer wrote on X. “President Carter personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion and through integrity.\n\n“He taught us that the strength of a leader lies not in rhetoric but in action, not in personal gain but in service to others,” Schumer wrote.\n\nCarter, 100, was the longest-living former president in US history. \n\nHe died in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, after spending nearly two years in hospice care — and more than a year after former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who died at the age of 77. \n\nThe former president’s death was announced by the Carter Center. \n\nThe 39th president, a former peanut farmer, remained active in civic duties until he was sidelined by ill health in recent years, including his work for Habitat for Humanity. \n\nHe was also a former recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, earning the award in 2002 for his ongoing work as a global humanitarian. \n\nIn a post on X Sunday House Speaker Mike Johnson also paid his respects. \n\n“President Carter’s story was one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless opportunities available in this great nation,” Johnson wrote. “Because of his work in brokering the Camp David Accords and his advocacy with Habitat for Humanity, the world is a more peaceful place, and more Americans have a place to call home. \n\n“No one can deny that President Carter led an extraordinary life of service to his country,” he said. \n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore said Sunday that Carter’s legacy is marked not just by his elected service but also “his leadership over the 42 years after he left office.\n\n“It is a testament to his unyielding determination to help build a more just and peaceful world,” Gore said.\n\nWith Post wires","summary":"A

Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History.\n\n“The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude,” he continued. “Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.”\n\nCarter’s son, Chip, confirmed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that his father died in his home in Plains, Georgia at 3:45 pm after having entered hospice care in February 2023.\n\nTrump’s stance on Carter has notoriously been fickle, with the president-elect mocking him as recently as two months ago on his 100th birthday in October while campaigning in Waunakee, Wisconsin.\n\nAt the time, Trump called President Joe Biden the “worst” president in U.S. history and said that “Jimmy Carter is the happiest man because Jimmy Carter is considered a brilliant president in comparison.”\n\nDuring the campaign, Carter made his support for Trump’s opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, abundantly clear, repeatedly reiterating that he intended to vote for her throughout her campaign.\n\n“He’s plugged in,” Chip told The Associated Press in October. “I asked him two months ago if he was trying to live to be 100, and he said, ‘No, I’m trying to live to vote for Kamala Harris.’”","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-pulls-180-jimmy-carter-232520989.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FZJw96ERT9hiZe1C6jVzCg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/9f752611c8fadf933646642cec9500df","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-29 23:25:20","author":"Yasmeen Hamadeh","authors":["Yasmeen Hamadeh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":276957374,"title":"Jimmy Carter dies at 100: Trump, Biden, Obama all honor the 39th president's legacy - USA TODAY","text":"Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States who dedicated much of his life to humanitarian causes, died in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, his family announced Sunday.\n\nThe former president was known for his work with philanthropic organizations like Habitat for Humanity and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. \n\nIn the White House from 1977 to 1981, Carter negotiated the landmark Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt, transferred the Panama Canal to Panamanian ownership, dramatically expanded public lands in Alaska and established formal diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China.\n\nCarter had been in ailing health during the past decade and had been in hospice care for more than a year when he died.\n\nKeep up with live coverage from the USA TODAY Network as tributes to Carter pour in from around the world.\n\n Harris says Carter's 'life is a testament to the power of service'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said in a statement that \"Jimmy Carter’s life is a testament to the power of service — as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy, the 76th Governor of Georgia, and the 39th President of the United States. He reminded our nation and the world that there is strength in decency and compassion.\"\n\nHarris also reflected on Carter's efforts to protect the environment, promote government transparency and work toward peace around the world.\n\n\"I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come. Our world is a better place because of President Carter,\" Harris said.\n\nJimmy Carter told his son, Chip Carter, earlier this year \"I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,\" in the 2024 election the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The Carter Center confirmed to USA TODAY the former president voted by mail for the vice president in Georgia.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sarah D. Wire\n\n Obamas reflect on Carter's faith, 'decency'\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama on Sunday remembered Carter's commitment to his faith, reflecting on his decades of teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia and the worshippers who flocked to the church.\n\n\"Some who came to hear him speak were undoubtedly there because of what President Carter accomplished in his four years in the White House – the Camp David Accords he brokered that reshaped the Middle East; the work he did to diversify the federal judiciary, including nominating a pioneering women’s rights activist and lawyer named Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the federal bench; the environmental reforms he put in place, becoming one of the first leaders in the world to recognize the problem of climate change,\" the Obamas said.\n\n\"Others were likely there because of what President Carter accomplished in the longest, and most impactful, post-presidency in American history,\" they said, noting \"But I’m willing to bet that many people in that church on Sunday morning were there, at least in part, because of something more fundamental: President Carter’s decency.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\n Bushes say Carter 'dignified the office' of the presidency\n\nFormer President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush on Sunday said Carter \"dignified the office\" of the presidency during his lifetime of service.\n\n\"James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions. He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office,\" they said.\n\n\"And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations,\" they added.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\n Clintons say Carter worked for 'a better, fairer world'\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday praised Jimmy Carter for his efforts for “a better, fairer world.”\n\n“Hillary and I mourn the passing of President Jimmy Carter and give thanks for his long, good life,” the two said in a statement. “Guided by his faith, President Carter lived to serve others— until the very end.”\n\nThe Clintons met Carter in 1975 and were “proud, early supporters of his Presidential campaign,” they said in their statement. Bill Clinton said he was proud to have presented Carter, and his wife Rosalynn, with the Medal of Freedom in 1999.\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton in the statement highlighted his work throughout his political career, from state senator, to president and to his efforts post presidency.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\n Bidens reflect on Carter's 'compassion and moral clarity'\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden in a statement said \"America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian\" in the wake of Carter's death.\n\n\"Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well,\" the president and first lady said.\n\n\"With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us.

He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe.”\n\n “He was a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism,” the statement continued. “We will always cherish seeing him and Rosalynn together. The love shared between Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism.”\n\n “We will miss them both dearly,” the Bidens wrote of the late couple, “but take solace knowing they are reunited once again and will remain forever in our hearts.”\n\n The Bidens' statement continued, “To the entire Carter family, we send our gratitude for sharing them with America and the world. To their staff — from the earliest days to the final ones — we have no doubt that you will continue to do the good works that carry on their legacy.\n\n “And to all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning — the good life — study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith and humility. He showed that we are [a] great nation because we are a good people — decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.”\n\n Barack and Michelle Obama \n\n Barack Obama shared a particularly touching tribute to Carter on Medium, praising the \"remarkable\" former president for both his political accomplishments and his \"decency.\"\n\n \"For decades, you could walk into Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia on some Sunday mornings and see hundreds of tourists from around the world crammed into the pews,\" he wrote. \"And standing in front of them, asking with a wink if there were any visitors that morning, would be President Jimmy Carter — preparing to teach Sunday school, just like he had done for most of his adult life.\"\"Some who came to hear him speak,\" he wrote, \"were undoubtedly there because of what President Carter accomplished in his four years in the White House — the Camp David Accords he brokered that reshaped the Middle East; the work he did to diversify the federal judiciary, including nominating a pioneering women’s rights activist and lawyer named Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the federal bench; the environmental reforms he put in place, becoming one of the first leaders in the world to recognize the problem of climate change.\"\n\n Obama continued, \"Others were likely there because of what President Carter accomplished in the longest, and most impactful, post-presidency in American history — monitoring more than 100 elections around the world; helping virtually eliminate Guinea worm disease, an infection that had haunted Africa for centuries; becoming the only former president to earn a Nobel Peace Prize; and building or repairing thousands of homes in more than a dozen countries with his beloved Rosalynn as part of Habitat for Humanity.\"\"But I’m willing to bet that many people in that church on Sunday morning were there, at least in part, because of something more fundamental: President Carter’s decency,\" the former president continued. \"Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did — advocating for the public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more important than reelection — things like integrity, respect and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God’s image.\"\"Whenever I had a chance to spend time with President Carter, it was clear that he didn’t just profess these values. He embodied them,\" Obama wrote. \"And in doing so, he taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service. In his Nobel acceptance speech, President Carter said, 'God gives us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace.' He made that choice again and again over the course of his 100 years, and the world is better for it.\"Carter's Georgia church, Obama wrote, \"will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away — buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road, his memory calling all of us to heed our better angels.\"\n\n The former president concluded his tribute to Carter by stating that he and former first lady Michelle Obama \"send our thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable man.\"\n\n Donald Trump \n\n President-elect Donald Trump shared a tribute to Carter on Truth Social, writing, “I just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History.”\n\n “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans,” Trump continued. “For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.”\n\n The president-elect finished by stating that he and wife Melania Trump “are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.”\n\n Bill and Hillary Clinton \n\n Bill Clinton paid tribute to Carter in a joint statement with wife Hillary Clinton on X (formerly known as Twitter). “Hillary and I mourn the passing of President Jimmy Carter and give thanks for his long, good life,” the statement began. “Guided by his faith, President Carter lived to serve others — until the very end.”\n\n The former president went on to celebrate Carter for his accomplishments in and outside of the White House.\n\n “From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia; to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama, and secure peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David; to his post-Presidential efforts at the Carter Center supporting honest elections, advancing peace, combating disease, and promoting democracy; to his and Rosalynn's devotion and hard work at Habitat for Humanity-he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world,” the statement read.\n\n “Hillary and I met President Carter in 1975 and were proud, early supporters of his Presidential campaign,” the Clintons continued. “I will always be proud to have presented the Medal of Freedom to him and Rosalynn in 1999, and to have worked with him in the years after he left the White House.”\n\n “Our prayers are with Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy and their families,” the statement concluded.\n\n George W. and Laura Bush \n\n George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush honored Carter with an official statement on the George W. Bush Presidential Center website, writing, “Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy, and the entire Carter family.”\n\n “James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions,” the statement continued. “He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations.”\n\n “We join our fellow citizens in giving thanks for Jimmy Carter and in prayer for his family,” the statement concluded.\n\n King Charles \n\n King Charles issued a statement on Carter's death via Buckingham Palace: “It was with great sadness that I learned of the death of President Carter. He was a committed public servant, and devoted his life to promoting peace and human rights.”\n\n The King's statement continued, “His dedication and humility served as an inspiration to many, and I remember with great fondness his visit to the United Kingdom in 1977. My thoughts and prayers are with President Carter’s family and the American people at this time.”\n\n Chuck Schumer \n\n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer paid tribute to Carter on X, sharing a headshot of the late president and writing, “As we remember President Carter's extraordinary life, we also honor the countless lives he touched through his vision and generosity.”\n\n “My thoughts are with the Carter family and all those mourning this incredible man,” Schumer continued. “May his memory be a blessing and an enduring reminder of what it means to truly serve.”","summary":"From Barack Obama to King Charles, here are all of the politicians and world leaders honoring the 39th president of the United States","url":"https://people.com/politicians-world-leaders-pay-tribute-to-jimmy-carter-after-his-death-at-age-100-8767356","image":"https://people.com/thmb/OY7MHJ81TLBHpMN9NiTeXL8uw7s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/Jimmy-Carter-122924-5fa4f844ed5e4addb69e5127f0360c35.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-29 23:24:32","author":"Bailey Richards","authors":["Bailey Richards"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.378},{"id":276952060,"title":"Jimmy Carter Passes Away With One Final Parting Gift for Trump","text":"The former president added a new layer to Trump’s inauguration day. \n\nHAKUNA MATATA\n\nThe Disney prequel had a comeback over the five-day Christmas stretch, while ‘Sonic 3′ kept up its brisk pace.\n\nSALE ON SALE\n\nScore even more savings this week at J.Crew’s online outlet during its massive post-holiday sale.\n\nTheir invite came after Bezos traveled to Mar-a-Lago earlier this month to bend the knee to her father, President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nPUFF PUFF PASS\n\nThe “Succession” actor was only 17 when he decided to pull a prank on Ruffalo and switch out a prop joint with the real deal.\n\nThe Carol Bike uses AI personalization technology to give you maximum results in the shortest time possible. \n\nThe men, aged 37 and 59, succumbed to the conditions in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington State. \n\nNOT FORGOTTEN\n\nThe 16-year-old actor died in a car accident last week.\n\nANNUAL HEADACHE\n\nThe Bravo star says Cooper ends up becoming “Mr. Bravo” during their New Year’s Eve special.\n\nDolan was known for founding HBO and Cablevision, as well as owning multiple pro sports teams.\n\nESPRESSO YOURSELF\n\nThis bold Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur is a bar cart essential.\n\n‘MIND-BOGGLING’\n\nTina Knowles took to her Instagram to shut down her daughter’s critics. \n\nFAMOUS LINE\n\nMusk’s response to one social media user appeared to be heavily borrowed from “Tropic Thunder.”","summary":"Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesFormer President Jimmy Carter left one last parting gift for president-elect Donald Trump after his death at 100 on Sunday.

Ultimately, the market remained in a tight range with relatively little fluctuation over the year. Going into 2025, the industry is now watching closely to see what repercussions Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House in the US may have, with the possibility of wool tariffs looming. The EMI peaked in January at 1213c and began falling after that, with a bounce period in May and June. Prices dropped again, reaching a low of 1087c in late September before lifting over the 1100c mark in early October. Supply at auctions declined from April onwards, with reduced offerings particularly notable in Western Australia as the state&apos;s flock dropped back, driven by challenging seasonal conditions and the passing of the live sheep export ban. Price fluctuations have been seen in recent months, though minor positive movements weren&apos;t enough to sway growers to support Australian Wool Innovation&apos;s urgings for the industry to boost the wool levy to 2 per cent. The November WoolPoll saw 37.85pc of growers support a 2pc levy in the primary vote, while the 1.5pc rate gained 37.35pc of the vote, but once preferences were allocated it surged ahead to 55.83pc. The result means that AWI will look to slash its spending by $13 million from its spending, with AWI chairman Jock Laurie saying in the aftermath of the result that the company was encouraged by how many people voted for 2pc even among difficult market conditions. AWI chairman Jock Laurie said knowing the future levy rate would allow the company to look at the budget going forward and look at the priorities. \"Seasonally wise it&apos;s difficult, the market has been flat, the profitability in the industry is most certainly flat... I think we&apos;ve got a feeling that the industry want to invest in themselves and so we were very encouraged by that,\" he said at the time. Managing director of Mecardo Robert Herrmann said overall, the market had been relatively flat throughout 2024, but there had been a few brighter spots. \"The superfine wools are finding good demand and it seems to be that there&apos;s regular reporting via AWEX that the better style wools and wools with better measurements seem to either survive any correction better or lead any rally upwards, they seem to be in strong demand,\" he said. \"I think the other thing that is of interest... the wools that have quality assurance recognition attached to them are doing well.\" Sluggish demand for new woollen garments and apparel products globally is among the key factors weighing upon the market, with data from China&apos;s customs showing 2023 apparel exports for the nation were down 7.8pc year on year. Mr Herrmann said the past two years had highlighted wool&apos;s role as a high-priced commodity, which meant the trade struggled when economic conditions were subdued in consuming countries. \"The market isn&apos;t going to be held back by an oversupply in volume, we know that,\" he said. \"The sheep numbers are down, production is forecast to be down 10 per cent this year compared to last year, so again that&apos;s going to be positive but we know that&apos;s not what drives prices. \"What drives prices is activity in the consuming countries and if that doesn&apos;t happen, then we&apos;re still not going to see much change from where we are now, unfortunately. Mr Herrmann said if the US imposed tariffs that would slow down China&apos;s export capacities, it would impact on the nation&apos;s domestic demand for wool. \"See now, 50pc of the wool we sell to China is consumed in China now so it&apos;s not just a big processing country, it&apos;s a big consuming country so it needs to continue to have strong domestic GDP,\" he said. Fox & Lillie&apos;s Central and North East Victoria wool representative Ron Creek said sentiment among growers had been a little brighter over the past month due to some market improvement and better clearance rates. \"I think there&apos;s a lot of people that are sitting back to see what the resulting actions will be with a change of government in the US and what possibly that may do for tariffs,\" he said. \"However I think the underlying view is there are less wool sheep around to be shorn, which may create a level of demand because the numbers won&apos;t be out there.\" Mr Creek said in addition to widespread destocking in Western Australia, there had also been a decline in numbers on the east coast as growers made different production decisions or shifted to shedding sheep due to difficulties obtaining labour. Mr Creek said while market conditions had been tough, growers had been focusing on production and improvements in the mutton and lamb market would help underpin the industry. \"To look at wool in isolation as opposed to being a sheep unit has got to be weighed up in that balance going forward,\" he said. \"Once upon a time the lambing percentages we got out of Merino sheep were the old cliche of &apos;we just want every Merino ewe to have a lamb&apos;, that&apos;s way gone now and we&apos;re seeing commercial operators with Merino over Merino having conceptions much higher than 150 per cent and having 130pc lambs weaned... it&apos;s a production driven focus with a lot of growers now and wool&apos;s become part of that program. \"What I mean by part of that program is the adoption of maybe going from annualised shearing to maybe two shearings in three years or the odd one that&apos;s doing the six-month program to work in with that production program.\" Mr Creek said while premiums for wool through sustainability schemes hadn&apos;t been as strong in 2024, growers needed to maintain their individual production standards, providing that expenses didn&apos;t incur heavily on production. \"We know the reliance on RWS wools to go into certain markets and that will continue,\" he said.","url":"https://www.farmonline.com.au/story/8814166/wool-market-outlook-challenging-2024-gives-way-to-uncertain-2025/?cs=28270","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/XftCMkCcRPa3Vky3YfP3wJ/294d75c9-eec2-4e05-98e3-0a2992238921.jpg/r0_0_1760_990_w1760_h990_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-29 23:20:50","author":"Victoria Nugent","authors":["Victoria Nugent"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.307}]}
