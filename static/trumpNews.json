Trump Slams Media After Alaska Summit Fails To Deliver Ukraine Ceasefire","text":"President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to fiercely criticise media coverage of his August 15 summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, calling outlets “sick” for framing the talks as a “major defeat.” In a fiery post, Trump argued that hosting the summit at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was a strategic coup, claiming Putin “would have loved doing the meeting anywhere else but the US” He accused the “Democrat run and controlled media” of twisting the narrative, asserting they would have criticised an overseas summit as “terrible” too. The summit, aimed at ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, yielded no ceasefire, with Trump stating, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” and Putin vaguely referencing “agreements” without specifics. Trump’s frustration boiled over as he claimed the media’s bias was part of a broader agenda, even alleging they “want CRIME” in Washington, D.C., and other “BLUE Cities.” He touted his administration’s efforts, claiming “ZERO illegals in last 3 months” at the southern border and promising to make D.C. a model for urban safety. Trump’s Broader Claims and Public Reaction In his post, Trump tied the summit coverage to broader grievances, claiming media bias fuels crime in Democrat-led cities. His assertion of “ZERO illegals” at the border lacks verification, as no official data from US Customs and Border Protection supports this for the past three months. Trump’s media attacks echo his pre-summit complaints, where he criticised outlets for quoting “fired losers” like Bolton and claimed, “If I got Moscow and Leningrad free, the Fake News would say I made a bad deal!” according to The Hill. As he prepares to brief Zelenskyy, Trump’s rhetoric signals a defensive stance, framing the summit as a success despite the lack of a ceasefire, with plans for a potential trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy, possibly in Moscow.

Chelsea’s return to competitive football following the Club World Cup in the United States was marked by a distinct lack of fanfare.\n\nThere were no performances by Robbie Williams in a white tracksuit, no brass bands trying to outshine fireworks, and no appearances by Donald Trump.\n\nInstead, Chelsea had Law 13 to thank for their fortunate break. Due to this specific rule stating that Marc Guehi stood too close to the Chelsea wall when Eberechi Eze took his free-kick past Robert Sanchez, Enzo Maresca’s team avoided a potential loss in their Premier League opener at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOn Friday, Chelsea will meet West Ham at the London Stadium, with Maresca optimistic that his team will have shaken off any residual effects from their previous outing.\n\n‘We could have been more effective on counter attacks and defended better, but it’s only the season’s first game,’ he stated. ‘Gradually, we will improve step by step.’\n\n‘They (Palace) played about eight games (in pre-season). We played just two. We tried our best. We didn’t lose a clean sheet.’\n\nThis is indeed accurate. Although Chelsea prevented Palace from scoring, it required VAR’s James Bell advising referee Darren England to rule out Eze’s early goal—a decision based on a regulation unfamiliar to many at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBut watching Chelsea struggle to stitch together attacking sequences thereafter, you could not help thinking back to what was said during the pre-match press conference at Cobham on Friday.\n\nMaresca had underlined the importance of Levi Colwill. Not only in how he defends but in how he is used to build attacks from the back with the line-breaking passes he is capable of producing.\n\nThat is why Chelsea’s head coach wants to sign a suitable centre back this month with Colwill’s ACL injury set to sideline him for the foreseeable. Despite Chelsea having more central defenders than many of their rivals, Maresca believes no like-for-like replacement exists within his squad, and he was further hamstrung here by losing Tosin Adarabioyo to a knock in training.\n\nChelsea’s decision-makers disagree with Maresca, and essentially, they have told him that he must find an internal solution because their chequebook is closed for centre backs. They have already spent significant sums this summer – £48.5million on Jamie Gittens, £37m on Jorrel Hato, £60m on Joao Pedro, £30m on Liam Delap and so on – and reckon their squad is strong enough.\n\nWith that, one of the club’s own in Josh Acheampong was selected at the heart of Maresca’s defence instead. At 19 years and 104 days, he was the second-youngest player to start for Chelsea in their opening game of a Premier League season, after Glen Johnson in 2003-04.\n\nWhen Marc Cucurella inverted into midfield to leave Chelsea with a back three, it was on Acheampong to pretend to be Colwill with Reece James on his right and Trevoh Chalobah on his left. Acheampong was ‘the guy in the middle’, as Maresca likes to describe it.\n\nAcheampong held his own overall, though he was the one who gave away possession while trying to pass from the back as Palace won their free-kick from which Eze scored. While the visitors celebrated, Chelsea’s set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva immediately began badgering the fourth official, Michael Salisbury, alerting him to Guehi’s position next to Chelsea’s wall.\n\nMaresca was asked again on signing a replacement for Colwill afterwards and spikily said: ‘You like to talk about central defenders? I already spoke. Thank you very much.’\n\nWith Maresca having seemingly lost his battle with those above him over a centre-back signing, he must find a solution and fast, given how crucial that position is to the way his team play.\n\nChelsea had chances to score, especially towards the end. Andrey Santos skied one in stoppage time which was such a waste of a chance that Palmer sank to his knees upon witnessing it.\n\nBut overall, this was not how Chelsea’s supporters imagined their afternoon going after arriving with such optimism, even singing ‘champions of the world’ within 10 seconds of kick-off as new artwork was unveiled above the Shed End to remind everyone of that fact.\n\nCucurella had a header cleared off the line at the very start, but it was not until the 90th minute when Dean Henderson would next be tested as Liam Delap blasted the ball directly at Crystal Palace’s goalkeeper. No club had seen more players grab goals on their Premier League debut than Chelsea. Their record stood at 27, but Delap could not add to that total here, nor Joao Pedro or Jamie Gittens or Estevao Willian, who was brought on as a second-half substitute.\n\nChelsea want to tell anyone and everyone that they are world champions but whether they can play like they are, so soon after that slog of a summer, remains to be seen.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nForget the Lord Mayor’s Show.

This reduction was largely attributed to greater youth involvement, gun buyback efforts, and community collaborations. \n\nMayors from the African American Mayors Association are now intent on preventing Trump from undermining the successes they believe haven’t been properly acknowledged. They are leveraging the federal law enforcement actions in the nation’s capital to refute his claims about America’s major urban areas.\n\n“This situation provides a platform for us to amplify our voices and challenge the notion that crime is rampant across major U.S. cities. The facts don’t support this narrative,” stated Van Johnson, Savannah’s mayor and president of the African American Mayors Association. \n\nAfter initiating the deployment of 800 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., the president aims to target other cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Oakland, labeling them as mismanaged and crime-plagued. A commonality among these cities is their leadership by Black mayors. \n\n“All members in our association were acutely aware that the mayors in question were Black or seen as Democrats,” Johnson remarked. “Regrettably, this seems to play a role, but as mayors, we engage with everyone, regardless of affiliation.” \n\nThe federal government’s actions have heightened some of the mayors’ desires to champion the strategies used to help make their cities safer.\n\nSome places are seeing dramatic drops in crime rates\n\nTrump argued that federal law enforcement had to step in after a prominent employee of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was attacked in an attempted carjacking. He also pointed to homeless encampments, graffiti and potholes as evidence of Washington “getting worse.”\n\nHowever statistics published by Washington’s Metropolitan Police contradict the president and show violent crime has dropped there since a post-pandemic peak in 2023.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson scoffed at Trump’s remarks, hailing the city’s “historic progress driving down homicides by more than 30% and shootings by almost 40% in the last year alone.”\n\nMayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, where homicides fell 14% between 2023 and 2024, called the federal takeover nothing but a performative “power grab.”\n\nIn Baltimore, officials say they have seen historic decreases in homicides and nonfatal shootings this year, and those have been on the decline since 2022, according to the city’s public safety data dashboard. Carjackings were down 20% in 2023, and other major crimes fell in 2024. Only burglaries have climbed slightly.\n\nThe lower crime rates are attributed to tackling violence with a “public health” approach, city officials say. In 2021, under Mayor Brandon Scott, Baltimore created a Comprehensive Violence Prevention Plan that called for more investment in community violence intervention, more services for crime victims and other initiatives.\n\nScott accused Trump of exploiting crime as a “wedge issue and dog whistle” rather than caring about curbing violence.\n\n“He has actively undermined efforts that are making a difference saving lives in cities across the country in favor of militarized policing of Black communities,” Scott said via email.\n\nThe Democratic mayor pointed out that the Justice Department has slashed over $1 million in funding this year that would have gone toward community anti-violence measures. He vowed to keep on making headway, regardless.\n\n“We will continue to closely work with our regional federal law enforcement agencies, who have been great partners, and will do everything in our power to continue the progress despite the roadblocks this administration attempts to implement,” Scott said.\n\nCommunity organizations help curb violence\n\nJust last week Oakland officials touted significant decreases in crime in the first half of this year compared with the same period in 2024, including a 21% drop in homicides and a 29% decrease in all violent crime, according to the midyear report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association. Officials credited collaborations with community organizations and crisis response services through the city’s Department of Violence Prevention, established in 2017.\n\n“These results show that we’re on the right track,” Mayor Barbara Lee said at a news conference. “We’re going to keep building on this progress with the same comprehensive approach that got us here.”\n\nAfter Trump gave his assessment of Oakland last week, she rejected it as “fearmongering.”\n\nSocial justice advocates agree that crime has gone down and say Trump is perpetuating exaggerated perceptions that have long plagued Oakland.\n\nNicole Lee, executive director of Urban Peace Movement, an Oakland-based organization that focuses on empowering communities of color and young people through initiatives such as leadership training and assistance to victims of gun violence, said much credit for the gains on lower crime rates is due to community groups.\n\n“We really want to acknowledge all of the hard work that our network of community partners and community organizations have been doing over the past couple of years coming out of the pandemic to really create real community safety,” Lee said. “The things we are doing are working.”\n\nShe worries that an intervention by military forces would undermine that progress.\n\n“It creates kind of an environment of fear in our community,” Lee said.\n\nPatrols and youth curfews\n\nIn Washington, agents from multiple federal agencies, National Guard members and even the United States Park Police have been seen performing law enforcement duties from patrolling the National Mall to questioning people parked illegally.\n\nPentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said the guard troops will not be armed but declined to elaborate on their assignments to safety patrols and beautification efforts.\n\nSavannah’s Johnson said he is all for partnering with the federal government, but troops on city streets is not what he envisioned. Instead, cities need federal assistance for things like multistate investigation and fighting problems such as gun trafficking, and cybercrimes.\n\n“I’m a former law enforcement officer. There is a different skill set that is used for municipal law enforcement agencies than the military,” Johnson said.\n\nThere has also been speculation that federal intervention could entail curfews for young people.\n\nBut that would do more harm, Nicole Lee said, disproportionately affecting young people of color and wrongfully assuming that youths are the main instigators of violence.\n\n“If you’re a young person, basically you can be cited, criminalized, simply for being outside after certain hours,” Lee said. “Not only does that not solve anything in regard to violence and crime, it puts young people in the crosshairs of the criminal justice system.”\n\nA game of wait-and-see\n\nFor now, Johnson said, the mayors are watching their counterpart in Washington, Muriel Bowser, closely to see how she navigates the unprecedented federal intervention. She has been walking a fine line between critiquing and cooperating since Trump’s takeover, but things ramped up Friday when officials sued to try to block the takeover.\n\nJohnson praised Bowser for carrying on with dignity and grace.\n\n“Black mayors are resilient. We are intrinsically children of struggle,” Johnson said. “We learn to adapt quickly, and I believe that we will and we are.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAmid President Donald Trump&#8217;s portrayal of Washington, D.C. as a crime-infested area&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Black Mayors Challenge Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Lawless&#8217; Label with Big Drops in Violent Crime Rates first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/black-mayors-challenge-trumps-lawless-label-with-big-drops-in-violent-crime-rates/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Federal-DC-Takeover-Black-mayors-of-cities-Pres-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 00:21:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":351922096,"title":"White House AI czar David Sacks says 'AI psychosis' is similar to the 'moral panic' of social media's early days","text":"AI can create a diet plan, organize a calendar, and provide answers to an endless variety of burning questions. Can it also cause a psychiatric breakdown?David Sacks, the White House official spearheading America's AI policies, doesn't think so. President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar discussed \"AI psychosis\" during an episode of the \"All-In Podcast\" published Friday.While most people engage with chatbots without a problem, a small number of users say the bots have encouraged delusions and other concerning behavior. For some, ChatGPT serves as an alternative to professional therapists.A psychiatrist earlier told Business Insider that some of his patients exhibiting what's been described as \"AI psychosis,\" a nonclinical term, used the technology before experiencing mental health issues, \"but they turned to it in the wrong place at the wrong time, and it supercharged some of their vulnerabilities.\"During the podcast, Sacks doubted the whole concept of \"AI psychosis.\"\"I mean, what are we talking about here? People doing too much research?\" he asked. \"This feels like the moral panic that was created over social media, but updated for AI.\"Sacks then referred to a recent article featuring a psychiatrist, who said they didn't believe using a chatbot inherently induced \"AI psychosis\" if there aren't other risk factors — including social and genetic — involved.\"In other words, this is just a manifestation or outlet for pre-existing problems,\" Sacks said. \"I think it's fair to say we're in the midst of a mental health crisis in this country.\"Sacks attributed the crisis instead to the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns. \"That's what seems to have triggered a lot of these mental health declines,\" he said.After several reports of users suffering mental breaks while using ChatGPT, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed the issue on X after the company rolled out the highly anticipated GPT-5.\"People have used technology, including AI, in self-destructive ways; if a user is in a mentally fragile state and prone to delusion, we do not want the AI to reinforce that,\" Altman wrote. \"Most users can keep a clear line between reality and fiction or role-play, but a small percentage cannot.\"Earlier this month, OpenAI introduced safeguards in ChatGPT, including a prompt encouraging users to take breaks after long conversations with the chatbot. The update will also change how the chatbot responds to users asking about personal challenges.","summary":"David Sacks, the White House AI czar, doesn't believe \"AI psychosis\" is real.

On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly agreed to allow US security guarantees for Ukraine and made concessions on \"land swaps\" as part of a potential peace deal during his summit with Trump, according to Trump's top envoy Steve Witkoff, as reported by CNN. Russia, however, has yet to mention such agreements, which appear to contradict Putin's past statements. The White House meeting will be divided into two sessions, people familiar with the planning told CNN. Trump and Zelenskyy are expected to meet individually with their delegations first, before joining a larger group session and potentially a lunch with the visiting European leaders. Talks are expected to focus on Russia's demands on land concessions and the contours of security guarantees for Ukraine, including the role of the US.

The exhibition, titled \"Dear Kundun\" - Tibetan Children's Art Exhibition, was inaugurated on Sunday by the Tibet Fund and Khadhok, a Tibetan Artists' organisation.

The selected works are deeply personal responses to a simple, yet powerful question: \"What does His Holiness mean to you?\" Through their paintings, these young artists express gratitude, hope and the quiet resilience of a generation in exile.

The initiative forms part of Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Block 70 proposal for the Philippine military’s multi-role fighter programme.\nJess Koloini, business development lead for Lockheed Martin’s F-16 programme, described the partnership as an investment in “new capabilities and intellectual properties” through close cooperation with the Philippines’ leading universities and companies.\n“This partnership will not only support the country’s ‘self-reliant defence posture’, but also create a lasting impact on the Filipino workforce, driving economic growth and prosperity,” he said.\n\nUnder the agreement, SMU’s Centre for Digital and Human-Augmented Manufacturing and its Deason Innovation Gym will help strengthen Philippine research and development capacity in digital modelling, simulations, robotics, automation, artificial intelligence and virtual and augmented reality.\nThe project grants Philippine partners access to advanced innovation tools at SMU, provides funding for business incubation and academic initiatives and encourages collaboration with top local universities and firms to generate new technologies and intellectual property.\n“This partnership is an investment in the strength of the Filipino workforce,” said Ben Zoghi, SMU’s associate dean for Advanced Studies and Industry Partnerships.\n“These projects will significantly boost the Philippines’ academia and industry, enabling them to leverage digital innovation technologies to drive economic growth and global industrial competitiveness.”\nSoft power, hard gain\nObservers say the initiative will enable the United States to embed itself further into the Philippines’ military, academic and industrial sectors.\n“For China, this development will be perceived as yet another sign that the Philippines is moving closer to the United States, not only tactically but in a more structural sense,” said Arnaud Leveau, an assistant professor of geopolitics at Paris Dauphine University.\n“It reinforces the impression that the Philippines is increasingly positioning itself within the US security architecture in the region. More broadly, for Southeast Asia, this illustrates how the US-China rivalry is extending into technological and educational domains, and not merely traditional defence cooperation.”\n\nPolitical analyst Sylwia Monika Gorska agreed, noting that the new facility would develop expertise in digital modelling, simulations, robotics, automation, and AI – precisely the skills required to support and modernise complex defence platforms.\n“This directly supports [Manila’s] Self-Reliant Defence Posture Revitalisation Act, which is about reducing dependence on foreign suppliers by building domestic industrial and technical capacity,” Gorska said.\nShe described the collaboration as both a defence capability boost and an example of “classic soft-power engagement: deepening relationships through knowledge transfer, workforce training and integration into allied innovation networks”\n“But those same capabilities have clear defence applications,” Gorska said. “Giving the Philippines more control over the readiness and modernisation of its fleet.”\nWhile it had been framed to avoid overt military signalling, Gorska emphasised that the strategic outcome of the project was a more robust and autonomous defence capability. “It’s a softer route to hard-power gains,” she added.\nFuture F-16s\nIn March, Washington approved the sale of 16 F-16C Block 70/72 jets and four F-16B Block 70/72 fighters to Manila. But Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez later admitted the government was still seeking the funds to buy the US jets, worth US$5.58 billion.\nEven if the F-16 deal does not materialise, Gorska said the infrastructure and expertise developed through the Lockheed Martin partnership would position Manila to more effectively integrate future advanced or dual-use systems, embedding the Philippines deeper within allied defence innovation networks.\n“If the US$5.58 billion sale is approved, the Manila centre’s engineering and prototyping capabilities would allow more maintenance, upgrades and systems integration to be done locally rather than in foreign depots. That would shorten turnaround times, reduce reliance on overseas support and give the Philippines greater control over the readiness of its fleet,” she said.\n“There’s an economic and resilience dimension, too. Linking defence modernisation with civilian innovation capacity reduces the vulnerabilities that come from over-reliance on a single external supplier.”\nLockheed Martin’s presence in the Philippines highlighted the market’s potential, said Sherwin Ona, an associate professor of political science at De La Salle University, noting that Manila had been eyeing the company’s F-16 Viper, as well as US missile and electronic systems such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System.\n\nHe called the offer to establish innovation hubs with local universities “a plus for the country”.\n“Upgrading the skills and capacities of Filipinos is crucial in building its defence industries. This proposal directly supports the self-reliance defence programme of the Marcos administration,” said Ona, also a visiting fellow at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defence and Security Research.\nChris Gardiner, CEO of the Institute for Regional Security in Canberra, suggested that the partnership could serve as a model of the Swedish ‘Triple Helix’ – a close collaboration between industry, academia and the defence sector.\n“This advanced tech partnership is exactly what the Philippines needs for strengthened defence self-reliance,” he said.\nGardiner said that Lockheed Martin typically invested in local tech capabilities where the workforce was skilled, government policy was supportive and there was a clear return on investment – criteria that Manila met.\n“The US wants self-reliant defence partners in the Indo-Pacific and this is a step that will strengthen US perceptions of the Philippines’ burden sharing and determination, and also better position the Philippines to play a balancing role in a region facing advanced tech arms competition,” he said.\n“And of course, in investing in US tech, the Philippines strengthens its standing with the US President Donald Trump administration even further”.\nHowever, Gorska cautioned that deepening defence-industrial integration between the US and the Philippines was likely to provoke a response from Beijing.\n“The facility deepens US-Philippine defence-industrial integration, which Beijing will likely read as part of a broader US strategy to lock in partnerships in the Indo-Pacific,” she said, potentially drawing “sharper reactions from China – through diplomatic pressure, economic measures or heightened military activity near Philippine-claimed waters”.\n“Over time, this combination of capability growth, alliance depth and industrial autonomy will make the Philippines a more credible security partner. The trade-off is that it may also intensify strategic frictions with China.”","summary":"Lockheed Martin is set to establish an R&D facility in Manila in partnership with a major Philippine university, in a move analysts say will both strengthen the nation’s technological foundations and enmesh it further into Washington’s regional security framework.\nThe American defence giant announced on Tuesday a collaboration with Southern Methodist University (SMU) aimed at boosting innovation, developing advanced technologies and nurturing local talent in partnership with Philippine academic...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3321952/why-lockheed-martins-philippine-rd-hub-will-be-chinas-radar","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/15/b8dc3298-c843-4f86-9bcc-5798081ed40a_314515d2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 00:00:13","author":"Jeoffrey Maitem","authors":["Jeoffrey Maitem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":351922632,"title":"Eric Swalwell rejects Michelle Obama's 'when they go low, we go high' message, vows to 'bury' Republicans","text":"Rep.

For the next stretch of questioning, she says, she was not allowed to change clothes.\n\n'When they finally allowed me to change out of my pajamas and put on a bra, it was only on the condition that the female agent accompany me to my bedroom to watch me change,' Terry wrote. \n\n'The whole situation was demeaning because I didn't have a bra on, and I had to change my clothes and undergarments in front of a stranger.'\n\nFederal prosecutors claim Terry's wardrobe woes are the least of her problems. She was charged with breaching the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which keeps tabs on overseas influence. \n\nThe indictment accuses her of promoting South Korean policy positions in US media, sharing non-public government information, and smoothing access to Washington powerbrokers for Seoul's officials, all while being lavished with gifts.\n\nIn glossy surveillance stills filed in court, Terry is seen clutching luxury shopping bags outside Washington boutiques while South Korean handlers settle the bill.\n\nProsecutors say one such scene unfolded at Bottega Veneta in 2019, another at Louis Vuitton in 2021.\n\nShe is also alleged to have published op-eds at Seoul's request, including an April 2023 column for a South Korean newspaper praising a summit between presidents Joe Biden and Yoon Suk Yeol, for which she was paid $500.\n\nBorn in Seoul and raised in Virginia, Terry is no ordinary defendant.\n\nShe spent seven years at the CIA, then became director of Korean, Japanese and Oceanic Affairs at the National Security Council under both President George W Bush and President Barack Obama.\n\nMore recently, she was a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, until being placed on unpaid leave after she was charged.\n\nTerry shares a $2.2 million, six-room, wood-paneled apartment with her husband, Russian-American historian and columnist Max Boot.\n\nThe pair are fixtures in the New York social scene, seen at cultural galas, policy forums and glittering dinner parties.\n\nBut according to a recent New York Magazine profile, the indictment has sapped Terry's energy and cast a long shadow over her once-active social calendar.\n\nRequests for comment from Terry, her lawyers and prosecutors all went unanswered.\n\nAt the time of Terry's indictment, her attorney, Lee Wolosky, blasted the charges as 'unfounded' and said they distorted the work of 'a scholar and news analyst known for her independence.'\n\nWolosky pointed out that Terry was often a harsh critic of the South Korean government during the very years she is accused of working for it.\n\nTerry's defense team has gone on the offensive, arguing that prosecutors are mischaracterizing the standard, legitimate work of foreign policy experts - professionals who routinely meet foreign officials, exchange policy views and sometimes accept tokens of appreciation.\n\nIn a motion to dismiss filed in February, they also said the prosecution 'threatens the ways in which all academics, think tankers and journalists do their work - work that is essential to a healthy democracy.'\n\nTheir stance has drawn the support of heavyweight advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Knight First Amendment Institute, and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, all of which have filed amicus briefs on her behalf.\n\n'Over the last decade, the government has increasingly invoked FARA to stigmatize, stifle and suppress viewpoints it doesn't like,' said ACLU senior counsel Aamra Ahmad. 'The court should take this opportunity to ensure FARA is read narrowly.'\n\nGeorge Wang, of the Knight Institute, echoed those concerns, warning that a broad interpretation of the law 'raises serious First Amendment concerns' and could chill protected speech.\n\nThose arguments may get a boost from Washington's changing political winds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has signaled a major pullback on prosecutions under FARA.\n\nIn February, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the disbandment of the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, citing the need to 'end risks of further weaponization' of the law and to 'free resources to address more pressing priorities.'\n\nHer memo directed that criminal FARA cases be 'limited to instances of alleged conduct similar to more traditional espionage by foreign government actors,' with future enforcement focusing on civil and regulatory measures.\n\nWhile the policy does not retroactively cancel ongoing prosecutions, it casts doubt on cases like Terry's, which revolve around alleged influence operations rather than espionage in the classic sense.\n\nFARA, enacted in 1938 to combat Nazi propaganda, requires individuals lobbying in the US on behalf of foreign governments to register with the Justice Department. Critics say it is outdated, vague and selectively enforced.\n\nIn January, the national security outlet Lawfare described it as 'a sword of Damocles' hanging over journalists, academics and political operatives as no one is ever quite sure when it will fall.\n\nKen Silverstein, a veteran reporter on lobbying issues, was even blunter. \n\n'Half of the foreign lobbyists in Washington don't register because they can get away without doing it,' he told New York Magazine.\n\n'Of the half that do, many don't provide the information they're supposed to, or they provide deliberately misleading information.'\n\nFor Terry, the political and legal debates are unfolding alongside the more personal toll of her case - one that, she argues, began with the FBI's humiliating handling of her on that June morning.\n\nHer filing describes being boxed in by agents in her own home, unable to step into her bedroom to dress without surveillance, her request to maintain a shred of privacy denied until she accepted a chaperone.\n\nAs her legal battle moves forward, a federal judge will have to decide whether those alleged early-morning indignities - and the broader constitutional questions raised by her allies - are enough to derail one of the most high-profile foreign agent cases in years.","summary":"She faced prosecution after officials claimed they discovered she was secretly working for South Korea - but that was only the start of her humiliation.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15001307/White-House-insider-demeaning-interrogation-FBI.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/14/21/87423203-0-image-m-13_1755202682095.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-17 23:52:50","author":"Editor,James Reinl","authors":["Editor","James Reinl"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":351927860,"title":"Maureen Dowd Shocker: Trump Making the Right Moves on D.C.

(They’re eating the cats and the dogs!) But progressives should not fall into Trump’s trap and play down crime, once more getting on the wrong side of an inflammatory issue. As with inflation, they should remember that personal experiences can count more than sanguine statistics.\nEven if Trump is being diabolical, Democrats should not pretend everything is fine here (in DC). Because it’s not.\n\nThe columnist built her conclusion with a series of anecdotes about her sister, “Peggy,” who was having a “bad day” by ending up at D.C. police headquarters after her Buick was stolen in front of Dowd’s house while they dined in trendy Georgetown.\n\n“Two polite officers who responded to our call said they could do little, amid a rash of brazen car thefts by teenagers,” she wrote. “One officer said that, even if they saw the perp driving in her car, they could not chase him, because of laws passed by the D.C. Council.”\n\nWATCH — Trump Invites Media on D.C. Police Ride-Alongs to See Crime Firsthand:\n\nThe car turned up in a Maryland suburb the next morning, where sister Peggy paid a $215 towing charge and found it littered with junk food, “a used condom,” and some stolen debit cards.\n\nHer sister had the car detailed and then “celebrated its return” by going shopping at Bloomingdales, only to return to her car and find it had been T-boned in the lot.\n\nDowd continued:\n\nThen, icing on the cake, she got over $1,800 worth of speed-camera tickets that the car thieves had racked up going 70 in 25-mile-per-hour zones, and some for running red lights. One ticket revealed that the car was stolen just after she got out of it, at 7 p.m., still light outside. For all we know, the thieves watched her get out. She had to go down to headquarters on Friday to get the police report so she could appeal the tickets.\n\nDowd added, “It’s hardly the most heinous crime, but you hear a lot about Washingtonians and their personal experiences being preyed on.”\n\nThe columnist did bemoan FBI agents “leaving their desk” to become “beat cops” and the National Guard troops raising the “specter” of martial law. She also called Trump the city’s number one “scofflaw” for “inciting” the January 6 mob and then pardoning the protestors.\n\nHowever, “It is also true that many D.C. residents are secretly glad to see more uniforms,” she wrote. “No matter what statistics say, they don’t feel safe.”\n\nWATCH — This Is How Angry They Are About Stopping Crime in D.C.???:\n\nShe admitted she finds herself “packing pepper spray,” feeling “more wary” walking around the city, and being disturbed by asking someone to “unlock the Claritin at CVS because the police don’t lock up the smash-and-grabbers.”\n\nDowd is not the only liberal commentator citing secret liberal support of the crime cleanup.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough last week told his audience that D.C. “isn’t safe, it’s a mess” and said he’s been getting calls from liberals who are quietly supporting the Trump effort.\n\nDowd quoted Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and the author of the forthcoming book When You Come at the King: Inside DOJ’s Pursuit of the President, From Nixon to Trump, in summing up “the dilemma.”\n\n“Yes, Trump is hypocritical and scattershot on public safety,” he told the columnist. “And yes, he’s likely doing this as a flex.

Europe’s leaders aim to do the same","text":"With Alaska in the rear-view mirror, Donald Trump is walking into a very different situation as he returns to work at the White House this week. \n\nHis summit with Vladimir Putin is over, though the fallout continues. On Friday, the U.S. literally rolled out the red carpet for the Russian leader and accused war criminal as he arrived in Anchorage for Ukraine peace talks -- though no Ukrainians were invited to the meeting. \n\nTrump flew back to Washington having publicly walked back his own call for a ceasefire and having reportedly endorsed a Russian demand for Ukraine to cede the entirety of the Donbas region, including territory currently controlled by Ukrainian forces.\n\nHaving completed one of his characteristically chummy conversations with Putin, Trump now faces the so-called “coalition of the willing”: a group of European leaders united behind the defense of Ukraine and adamant that no agreement can be made without the support of Kyiv.\n\nThe president’s guests could strike a very different tone, given how Trump’s last face-to-face meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office devolved into a near-shouting match.\n\nBut there are indications that Zelensky’s allies want to avoid that spectacle and instead lean on figures with whom Trump enjoys warmer relations as they seek to perform damage control: including, chiefly, walking back Trump from his support for any agreement that would cede Ukrainian territory not already occupied by Russian forces. \n\nAnd European leaders are also insistent that Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, be directly involved in peace talks with Russia — something which it had appeared U.S. officials had successfully pushed Putin towards in May, only for Russia to delay and demur.\n\nThe sheer size of the delegation heading to Washington on Monday seems to suggest that a show of force is Zelensky’s aim. Besides the Ukrainian leader, joining Trump at the White House will be British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Finnish president Alexander Stubb, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, French president Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen along with Nato’s secretary-general Mark Rutte. \n\nThough large, the choice of members was not random. Each member of the posse has, in their own dealings with Trump, cultivated friendly relations with the U.S. president — save for Zelensky, who clashed with Trump when he visited in February. \n\nPublicly, those headed to the White House were positive on the effects of Trump’s summit. \"President Trump's efforts have brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia's illegal war in Ukraine,” Starmer said.\n\nThe British prime minister and his counterparts could be relying on Trump’s tendency to rapidly change his position as he and other European leaders launch a charm offensive.\n\nThough none of Trump’s European counterparts will say it, critics of the Republican president in the U.S. called Friday’s summit a “setback” for Ukrainians and Europe at large.\n\n“Vladimir Putin got the red carpet treatment on American soil. But we got no ceasefire, no imminent meeting between Putin and Zelensky,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, said Sunday on ABC’s This Week. He added Trump was “flattered” by the Russian president.\n\nU.S. officials are likely to walk into Monday’s meeting eager to portray news of Putin’s openness to a U.S.-backed security agreement as a win for the Ukrainian side. But there’s a sense that a major gulf still exists between what Putin and Ukraine’s government are willing to accept, and that little progress was made towards bridging it largely as a result of Trump’s hesitance to use any kind of leverage against Putin.\n\nEven that development may be met with skepticism. It’s no secret to European leaders that support among Republicans and even progressives for direct U.S. military intervention in Ukraine is strikingly low. On Saturday, Zelensky himself responded to the news, writing in a post to Twitter/X: “Security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term, with the involvement of both Europe and the U.S.”\n\nThe inclusion of the word “reliably” suggests that Zelensky won’t accept anything short of a concrete regional security agreement in exchange for dropping Ukraine’s ambitions of joining the Nato alliance, which would grant Article 5 protections. Under Article 5 of the Nato charter, member-states must come to the aid of any member-state that is attacked individually. The provision has been activated only once, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n“All issues important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided without Ukraine,” Zelensky added.\n\nSome had been optimistic that the use of leverage was imminent after Trump’s statements ahead of the summit indicated that he no longer believed Putin’s claims of wanting an end to the conflict. In social media posts and public statements, the U.S. president appeared to be moving closer to levying sanctions against the Russian government. \n\nEuropean leaders hoped they were successful in driving that point home, in talks with Trump ahead of the Anchorage summit, but that progress seems to have evaporated. It may fall on Starmer and others like Stubb, who is known as a “Trump whisperer”, to re-convince the president that Putin’s demand for a full seizure of the Donbas region is a poison pill aimed at driving Ukraine away from the table.\n\nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied that Trump’s position on whether Putin was serious had changed “at all”, potentially giving the delegation a reason to hope that the U.S. president could be made to understand that Ukraine wouldn’t consider ceding further territorial gains to Russia.\n\n\"I don't think his mind has changed at all. I think ultimately, if this whole effort doesn't work out, then there is going to have to be additional consequences to Russia. But we're trying to avoid that by reaching a peace agreement,\" Rubio said.","summary":"Trump’s meeting with Putin rolled back key red lines that Zelensky says Ukraine won’t cross.

In 2021, the company “was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years,” according to the report.\n\n“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working,” she said. “But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract.”\n\nRep. Michael Cloud (R-TX) has said the EV order should be canceled because the project “has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”\n\nDonald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, told AP that canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.\n\n“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,” he said.\n\nAs part of the ongoing climate change debate, most anything running on carbon-based fuel is in the crosshairs of climate advocates and academics churning out studies on the issue.\n\nWATCH — Climate Doomers Vandalize Trump Tower’s “45” Presidential Plaque:\n\nAccording to the AP report:\n\nA 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks.\nThat’s a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the University’s Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.\n\nThe EV effort had the strong backing of President Joe Biden, who called for an all-electric federal fleet of cars and trucks.\n\nThe government so far has ordered 51,500 Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles from various builders, according to AP.\n\nTo date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones, the wire service reported.","summary":"“Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the completion of their appointed rounds” goes the U.S. Postal Service creed – but not with electric vehicles, if some Republican lawmakers have their way.\n\n\nThe post GOP Senators: Scrap the Post Office Electric Vehicle &#8216;Boondoggle&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2025/08/17/30759804gop-senators-scrap-the-post-office-electric-vehicle-boondoggle/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/08/AP25226771458421-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-17 23:35:37","author":"Lowell Cauffiel","authors":["Lowell Cauffiel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.579},{"id":351929334,"title":"Dow futures rise as updates this week from the Fed and top retailers will test Wall Street’s big rally","text":"Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 48 points, or 0.11%.

In their first meeting in six years, the two leaders discussed the war in Ukraine. The U.S. president pushed for peace in the region but no ceasefire deal came out of the talks. However on Sunday, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff revealed that Putin had agreed to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee.\n\nOn Sunday, NBC’s Kristen Welker confronted Rubio with video when he was a senator, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In it, he proclaims that western leaders were repeatedly bamboozled by Putin due to the mistaken belief that it was possible the Russian leader would ever keep his word, and had a desire to broker peace agreements and avoid conflict.\n\n“This guy lies. Habitually lies. He’s never kept a deal he ever signed, and he lies all the time. And I don’t know why--but he plays us like a violin in the west, because we want to cut a deal with everybody,” Senator Rubio said in the clip from three years ago. “You can’t cut a deal with a guy like this. He’s a professional, experienced liar.”\n\nWelker then asked Rubio: “Mr. Secretary, given that, what makes you think that if you are able to reach a deal with President Putin, that he would stick to it. Based on what you said, he is a liar.”\n\nRubio replied that Putin’s dishonesty was what made a U.S.-backed security agreement for Ukraine so important. Putin’s openness to Ukraine inking a Nato-like security guarantee with American or European forces as part of a broader peace agreement, was described as a “game-changer”by Witkoff.\n\n“That’s the point. That’s why the deal has to have enforceable mechanisms in it,” Rubio said. “That’s why the deal has to have things like security guarantees.”\n\nTrump, however, has not committed publicly to honoring any kind of U.S.-backed security agreement for Ukraine, and often contradicts his own advisers. \n\nTrump is set to meet Monday with Zelensky, several European leaders and NATO’s secretary-general. \n\nIn Alaska, Trump and Putin also reportedly agreed that the U.S. would consider backing a Russian proposal that the cession of the Donbas region, including parts occupied by Ukraine, would be part of an agreement for the war to end.\n\nRubio’s explanation on Putin is just the latest sign of how the former senator has been put in awkward positions by his new Cabinet role.

In their first meeting in six years, the two leaders discussed the war in Ukraine. The U.S. president pushed for peace in the region but no ceasefire deal came out of the talks. However on Sunday, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff revealed that Putin had agreed to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee.\n\nOn Sunday, NBC’s Kristen Welker confronted Rubio with video when he was a senator, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In it, he proclaims that western leaders were repeatedly bamboozled by Putin due to the mistaken belief that it was possible the Russian leader would ever keep his word, and had a desire to broker peace agreements and avoid conflict.\n\n“This guy lies. Habitually lies. He’s never kept a deal he ever signed, and he lies all the time. And I don’t know why--but he plays us like a violin in the west, because we want to cut a deal with everybody,” Senator Rubio said in the clip from three years ago. “You can’t cut a deal with a guy like this. He’s a professional, experienced liar.”\n\nWelker then asked Rubio: “Mr. Secretary, given that, what makes you think that if you are able to reach a deal with President Putin, that he would stick to it. Based on what you said, he is a liar.”\n\nRubio replied that Putin’s dishonesty was what made a U.S.-backed security agreement for Ukraine so important. Putin’s openness to Ukraine inking a Nato-like security guarantee with American or European forces as part of a broader peace agreement, was described as a “game-changer”by Witkoff.\n\n“That’s the point. That’s why the deal has to have enforceable mechanisms in it,” Rubio said. “That’s why the deal has to have things like security guarantees.”\n\nTrump, however, has not committed publicly to honoring any kind of U.S.-backed security agreement for Ukraine, and often contradicts his own advisers.\n\nTrump is set to meet Monday with Zelensky, several European leaders and NATO’s secretary-general.\n\nIn Alaska, Trump and Putin also reportedly agreed that the U.S. would consider backing a Russian proposal that the cession of the Donbas region, including parts occupied by Ukraine, would be part of an agreement for the war to end.\n\nRubio’s explanation on Putin is just the latest sign of how the former senator has been put in awkward positions by his new Cabinet role. While in Congress, Senator Rubio was one of the strongest bipartisan voices to address broad reform of the U.S. immigration system, though it ultimately failed.\n\nHe was also an outspoken opponent of tariffs and after January 6, Rubio was one of many Republicans who denounced Trump, and his supporters who attacked the Capitol. At the time he argued that the attack would damage America’s image on the world stage, something he was separately confronted about on ABC News in January.

He also took swipes at President Donald Trump while bragging about a family \"Swiftie\" group chat and talking about how he blasts \"Tay Tay\" while mowing the lawn. Comey opened by accusing Trump of humiliating America alongside Vladimir Putin, calling it \"a bad dream you can’t wake up from.\" Comey said he’s been to two Swift concerts and even helped relatives afford tickets. MAURENE COMEY, PROSECUTOR IN 'DIDDY,' EPSTEIN, MAXWELL CASES, DAUGHTER OF EX FBI HEAD, FIRED FROM DOJ \"I’m in a family’s Switie group chat. I know all her music and I listen to it in my headphones when I cut the grass,\" Comey said. His favorites? The 10-minute \"All Too Well\" and \"Exile\" with Bon Iver. \"Taylor Swift has grown up with my family and provided us a soundtrack, really, as we've grown ourselves and learned and adapted and dealt with adversity and celebration,\" he said, adding that millions of families likely feel the same. Comey explained that at every stage of Swift’s career, she has shown a way that resonated with kids, which also felt right to him as a parent, and she has continued to do that even as an adult artist. FBI DIRECTOR PATEL SAYS HE'S HAD TO DIVERT RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE 'COPYCATS' OF COMEY '86 47' POST Comey said Swift’s example helps him resist \"bullies\" without becoming like them. He contrasted that with satirical posts mocking Trump, which he called funny but also troubling. \"But I gotta be honest, it also leaves me with a strange feeling at times, because I don't want us to become like Trump and his followers,\" he continued. \"There are far more decent, honest, kind people in America than there are mean jerks. And don't get me wrong, we have our jerks, millions of them.\" He accused the GOP of \"stunning coarseness,\" while saying it’s a minority view in America.

Of course, we need to stand up to jerks and defend what matters, but I think we have to try to do that without becoming like them, which is what makes me think about Taylor Swift,\" he said. \"She's made clear that she sees Donald Trump for what he is. Last year, she urged Americans not to make the serious mistake of electing him. \"Of course, we're now living with the consequences of that mistake. But while our elderly makeup-covered president is posting about whether Taylor Swift is still hot and declaring that he can't stand her, what's she doing? Living her best life, producing great music and, as she urged all of us to do during the podcast, not giving the jerks power over her mind,\" Comey continued.

What we can do is stop it from hurting us, from changing us,\" he added. He then talked about the second time he saw Swift in concert, 14 years ago in Hartford, Connecticut. During the concert, he said, Swift sang a song, asking nasty people, \"why you gotta be so mean.\" \"I bet you got pushed around. Somebody made you cold. But the cycle ends right now, because you can’t leave me down that road,\" Comey said, reciting Swift’s lyrics for ‘Mean.’ \"You’ll be glad I didn’t sing that.

Cambridge Dictionary","text":"Thousands of new words, including popular social media slang such as \"Skibidi\", \"tradwife\", and \"delulu\", are set to be added to the Cambridge Dictionary this year. \n\nOver 6,000 terms will join the lexicon, reflecting modern life with additions like \"mouse jiggler\" from remote working, and \"forever chemical\" highlighting climate change concerns.\n\nSlang term “skibidi”, a jibberish word, joined the world’s largest online dictionary in the past 12 months.\n\nDefined in the dictionary as “a word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a joke’, an example of its use is: “What the skibidi are you doing?”\n\nThe term was coined by the creator of a viral animated video series called “skibidi toilet” on YouTube, Cambridge Dictionary said, and Kim Kardashian revealed her familiarity with the phrase when she posted a video on Instagram in October showing a necklace her daughter had given her as a birthday present, engraved with “skibidi toilet”.\n\n“Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, lexical programme manager at Cambridge Dictionary.\n\n“Tradwife”, short for traditional wife, has also grown in popularity, Cambridge Dictionary said, thanks to the digital world.\n\nMeaning, a married woman who stays at home doing cooking, cleaning, and has children that she takes care of, the dictionary definition also says a “tradwife” is “especially one who posts on social media”.\n\nAs well as new phrases, some shortened versions of existing terms have been added, including “delulu”, a play on the world delusional, with a similar definition: “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to”.\n\nMr McIntosh said Cambridge Dictionary only adds words which they believe will stand the test of time.\n\n“It’s not every day you get to see words like ‘skibidi’ and ‘delulu’ make their way into the Cambridge Dictionary,” he said.\n\n“We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power.”\n\nCambridge Dictionary uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a database of more than two billion words of written and spoken English, to observe how new words are used by different people, how often and in what contexts they are used.\n\nMore remote working since the pandemic helped “mouse jiggler”, meaning a device or piece of software used to make it seem as though you are working when you are not, gain its place in the dictionary.\n\nSome composite terms such as “broligarchy” were also added.\n\nMerging “bro” and “oligarchy”, the term means “a small group of men, especially men owning or involved in a technology business, who are extremely rich and powerful, and who have or want political influence”, and was used to describe tech leaders Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg attending Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.\n\nMeanwhile, new entries like “work wife” and “work spouse” acknowledge workplace relationships where two people help and trust each other, Cambridge Dictionary said.","summary":"Over 6,000 terms will join the

Trump and Vladimir Putin agreed at their summit in Alaska last week that the U.S. would be able to offer security guarantees to Ukraine, according to Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, even as many details of Friday’s meeting remain unclear.\n\n“We got to an agreement that the U.S. and other nations could effectively offer Article 5-like language to Ukraine,” Witkoff said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” referring to the NATO provision that says if one ally is attacked, it is considered an attack on all member states.\n\nWitkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio fanned out across the Sunday morning US news talk shows to offer conflicting details of the Alaska summit that neither president revealed in their brief news conference following the meeting\n\nIt remains unclear what kind of security guarantees are being discussed with Putin, and Rubio offered less certainty about the topic than Witkoff did.\n\n“That will be part of the conversation tomorrow, at the end of the day,” Rubio said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” referring to Monday’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House. “It would be a huge concession. It would be a very big move by the president if he were to offer a U.S. commitment to security guarantee.”\n\n“That will be his decision to make,” he added.\n\nWitkoff, who attended the leaders’ meeting at a military base in Alaska on Friday, said their agreement stopped short of allowing Ukraine to achieve its longstanding goal of NATO membership.\n\n“Putin says the red flag is NATO admission,” Witkoff said.\n\nZelenskyy said it would be a “significant change” if the U.S. agrees to work with Europe on security guarantees, but noted there aren’t any details yet on how that would work.\n\n“We need security to work in practice, like Article 5 of NATO,” he wrote Sunday in a post on X.\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that such a guarantee, if in the final agreement, would be crucial because “any commitment that Vladimir Putin makes to not invade Ukraine, again, isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.”\n\nThe Connecticut senator added that any agreement by Trump to allow Russia to maintain a hold on Ukrainian territory would be a “stunning development” that would offer “another sense that Putin is just in charge of these negotiations.”\n\nTerritorial concessions\n\nPutin went into the summit demanding that Ukraine give up territory that Russia seized in its three-year war. Witkoff said Putin “made some concessions with regards with all five of those regions,” and added, “There needs to be a discussion of Donetsk” with Zelenskyy, suggesting there is room to negotiate.\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine’s constitution doesn’t allow it to give up or trade land, adding in a post on X that the issue should only be discussed at meetings that include Ukraine, as well as Russia and the U.S. Trump did not invite Zelenskyy to the meeting in Alaska.\n\nEuropean leaders will be joining Zelenskyy at the White House meeting with Trump, in a show of support as Ukraine’s leader faces growing U.S. pressure to agree to a quick peace deal with Russia that involves giving up territory.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have confirmed their participation. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will join the talks as well, according to an official.\n\nMacron said that any agreement needs to maintain the strength of Ukraine’s military, as well as include the involvement of European and even U.S. support, including training and logistics.\n\n“Several states are ready to do it,” Macron told reporters outside the presidential summer residence in the south of France, adding that allied forces may also be stationed in “non-hot zones” inside Ukraine. “We’re going to present that in asking the U.S. up to what point they’re ready to join these forces.”\n\nTrump on Sunday insisted that he made “BIG PROGRESS ON RUSSIA” in a post on Truth Social.\n\nWhile Trump had gone into Friday’s summit with Putin seeking a ceasefire, he’d emerged saying he was going to focus on a final settlement.\n\nWitkoff said the switch was made because Putin and Trump made “so much progress” that there was no need for a ceasefire period in which the details would be worked out.\n\n“The thesis of a ceasefire is that you’d be discussing all of these issues that we already resolved” in Alaska, Witkoff said on CNN, noting that they couldn’t finalize any discussion of land swaps because Zelenskyy needed to be directly involved.\n\nRubio contradicted Witkoff as well on “Meet the Press,” where he said that the U.S. hasn’t ruled out a ceasefire in Ukraine as part of the goal of brokering a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, while arguing that additional sanctions would be unlikely to force Putin to accept a deal.\n\nRubio also said that the U.S. remains committed to crafting a deal that includes both “what the border lines are going to look like” and Russia accepting that Ukraine “is a sovereign country.”\n\n“They have a right, like every sovereign country does in the world, to have, to enter into security alliances with other countries to prevent an invasion in the future, to prevent threats to their national security,” Rubio said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “That’s not an unreasonable request.”\n\nRubio said no US sanctions on Russia have been relaxed and the U.S. may eventually end up imposing tougher penalties if talks stall.\n\n“And so those options remain to the president,” he said. “The minute he takes those steps, all talks stop.”\n\nEngaging with Russia is necessary to end the war, “as distasteful people may find it,” Rubio said.\n\nAsked whether a ceasefire is off the table, Rubio said, “No, it’s not off the table.” At the same time, he added, “Let’s be frank, this is not our war.”\n\n— Eric Martin and Wendy Benjaminson / Bloomberg News","summary":"Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agreed at their summit in Alaska last week that the U.S. would be able to offer security guarantees to Ukraine, according to Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, even as many details of Friday’s meeting remain unclear.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/17/us-russia-agree-on-ukraine-security/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2230321913.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-17 23:04:38","author":"Bloomberg News","authors":["Bloomberg News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":351928454,"title":"‘NEITHER SIDE IS GOING TO SURRENDER’: Rubio States Russia and Ukraine Will Have to Make Concessions","text":"Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday morning that both Russia and Ukraine are bound to “give and get” in order to ultimately achieve a peace agreement.\n\n“You can’t have a peace agreement unless both sides give and get,” Rubio said. “You can’t have a peace agreement unless both sides make concessions. That’s a fact. That’s true in virtually any negotiation.”\n\n“If not, it’s just called surrender. Neither side is going to surrender. So both sides are going to have to make concessions.”\n\nDuring the interview, ABC News’ Martha Raddatz questioned the secretary of state on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin made any concessions during Friday’s summit in Alaska with President Donald Trump. Rubio categorically refused to answer, saying he believes that peace agreements “don’t work when they’re conducted in the media.”\n\n“Of course, concessions were asked, but what utility would there be of me going on a program and telling you, ‘We’ve wagged our finger at Putin and told him, “You must do this, and you must do that.”’ It’s going to make it harder and less likely that they’re going to agree to these things. So these negotiations, as much as everyone would love it to be a live pay-per-view event, only work best when they are conducted privately in serious negotiations.”\n\nPutin expressed his mission to see an end to the conflict. However, according to Fox News, the Russian leader is demanding total control of the Donbas region in exchange for ending the war.\n\nIn advance of his Monday meeting at the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy categorically rejected Putin’s demand, stating that such a concession would go against Ukraine’s constitution.\n\n“Ultimately,” Rubio said, “that is something that Ukraine will have to decide.”\n\n“It’s their territory. It’s their country. Ultimately, what they’re willing to live with is what they’ll have to decide on, and maybe the answer is they’re not willing to live with any of this. We don’t know, but that’s what we need to explore in the meantime.”\n\n“The one thing we do know that Ukraine has repeatedly and publicly talked about,” Rubio added, “is security guarantees. They need to be able to enter into security guarantees that ensure that this is never going to happen again. That they’re not going to get re-invaded in two and a half to four years, or whenever it may be. They don’t want to be back here again. They want to be able to go on to rebuild their country and live their lives.”","summary":"Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week&#8221; Sunday morning that both Russia and Ukraine are bound to &#8220;give and get&#8221; in order...

Dictionary","text":"“Skibidi”, “tradwife”, “delulu” and other slang terms popularised by social media are among thousands of new words to be added to the Cambridge Dictionary this year.\n\nContinued remote working has introduced terms like “mouse jiggler” and concerns over climate change see the phrase “forever chemical” added, alongside more than 6,000 others words.\n\nSlang term “skibidi”, a gibberish word, joined the world’s largest online dictionary in the past 12 months.\n\nDefined in the dictionary as “a word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a joke’, an example of its use is: “What the skibidi are you doing?”\n\nThe term was coined by the creator of a viral animated video series called “skibidi toilet” on YouTube, Cambridge Dictionary said, and Kim Kardashian revealed her familiarity with the phrase when she posted a video on Instagram in October showing a necklace her daughter had given her as a birthday present, engraved with “skibidi toilet”.\n\n“Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, lexical programme manager at Cambridge Dictionary.\n\n“Tradwife”, short for traditional wife, has also grown in popularity, Cambridge Dictionary said, thanks to the digital world.\n\nMeaning, a married woman who stays at home doing cooking, cleaning, and has children that she takes care of, the dictionary definition also says a “tradwife” is “especially one who posts on social media”.\n\nAs well as new phrases, some shortened versions of existing terms have been added, including “delulu”, a play on the world delusional, with a similar definition: “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to”.\n\nMr McIntosh said Cambridge Dictionary only adds words which they believe will stand the test of time.\n\n“It’s not every day you get to see words like ‘skibidi’ and ‘delulu’ make their way into the Cambridge Dictionary,” he said.\n\n“We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power.”\n\nCambridge Dictionary uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a database of more than two billion words of written and spoken English, to observe how new words are used by different people, how often and in what contexts they are used.\n\nMore remote working since the pandemic helped “mouse jiggler”, meaning a device or piece of software used to make it seem as though you are working when you are not, gain its place in the dictionary.\n\nSome composite terms such as “broligarchy” were also added.\n\nMerging “bro” and “oligarchy”, the term means “a small group of men, especially men owning or involved in a technology business, who are extremely rich and powerful, and who have or want political influence”, and was used to describe tech leaders Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg attending Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.\n\nMeanwhile, new entries like “work wife” and “work spouse” acknowledge workplace relationships where two people help and trust each other, Cambridge Dictionary said.","summary":"Slang terms popularised by social media are

Cambridge dictionary – do you know what they mean?","text":"Mouse jiggler is one of 6,000 words that have been added to the Cambridge Dictionary this year (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nDo you know your skibidi from your delulu? Both are among the new words to be added to the Cambridge Dictionary.\n\nOne of the world’s largest glossaries of words has grown by another 6,000 terms and phrases in the past 12 months, reflecting new trends and topics, from climate change to familial relationships.\n\nSo what’s new in the ultimate lexical library this year? Prepare to indulge in a word salad.\n\n1. What the skibidi are you talking about?\n\nPerhaps the most bizarre addition to the Cambridge Dictionary is skibidi.\n\nAnd if that sounds like a nonsense word, that’s because it’s gibberish. \n\nLike most gibberish, skibidi doesn’t actually have any direct meaning.\n\nIn fact it’s defined in the dictionary as ‘a word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a joke’.\n\nWhat the skibidi am I talking about, you ask? Put simply, it’s a phrase you can use instead of the bog standard expression ‘what on earth’.\n\nThe term was actually coined by the creator of a viral animated YouTube video series called ‘skibidi toilet’.\n\nIt has since been picked up by several celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, who shared a post on Instagram in October showing a necklace her daughter had given her as a birthday present, engraved with ‘skibidi toilet’.\n\n Skibidi and delulu are just some of thousands of new words added to the Cambridge Dictionary to reflect new trends (Picture: University of Cambridge)\n\n2. It’s all delulu\n\nEnglish has many marvellous ways of saying nonsense, and 2025 lingo has just brought another.\n\nDelulu is a contraction of ‘delusional’ meaning, according to the dictionary ‘believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to’.\n\nColin Mcintosh, the lexical programme manager at Cambridge Dictionary, explained lexicographers only add words they believe will stand the test of time and will continue to be used in decades to come.\n\n‘It’s not every day you get to see words like ‘skibidi’ and ‘delulu’ make their way into the Cambridge Dictionary,” he explained.\n\n‘We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power.’\n\n3. What’s the word for a ‘stay-at-home mum’?\n\nNo, not a housewife, but a tradwife – a married woman with children who stays at home cooking and cleaning.\n\nIt sounds rather like a hark back to sometime around 1955, the days of the BBC radio’s Housewives Choice – in other words not the first phrase that comes to mind in 2025.\n\nBut fast forward 70 years and a tradwife is a stay-at-home spouse with one major difference from her slightly outdated counterpart.\n\nAccording to Cambridge Dictionary, a tradwife likes to show off her day-to-day activities online, especially by posting on social media.\n\n3. The word for a group of tech bros\n\n Elon Musk is one of a small group of powerful tech titans referred to as the ‘broligarchy’ (Picture: NCAA Photos)\n\nWith the return of Donald Trump to the White House earlier this year, 2025 has so far shaped up to be the year of tech titans.\n\nAnd yes, there’s a word for that – it’s called a broligarchy.\n\nA portmanteau of ‘bro’ and ‘oligarchy’, it refers to a small group of men in the technology business who wield a large amount of power and wealth and ‘who have or want political influence’.\n\nSound familiar? Well the term was used to refer to the likes of, you’ve guessed it, X owner and Tesla founder Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, when they all attended Trump’s inauguration in January.\n\n4. Working hard from home… or hardly working\n\nAnother word in the new habits category is that gadget used by homeworkers to keep up the pretence they’re busy hitting deadlines when they’re actually kicking back and relaxing.\n\nTell me you haven’t reached for the ‘mouse-jiggler’ once in a while.\n\nA classic product of the post-pandemic world of remote working, mouse jigglers can be both hardware and software designed to keep the mouse icon moving across the screen and prevent standby mode from kicking in.\n\n5. Climate lingo\n\n Forever chemicals is one of several new phrases added relating to the ongoing debate over climate change (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nLast on our list of highlights is a term introduced thanks to the ongoing spotlight on climate change.\n\nForever chemicals, man-made substances in living organisms and in the environment that accumulate over time and can’t break down naturally.\n\nSometimes known as PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) have been used in manufacturing since the 1950s and have found themselves in nearly everything – from carpets and skin products to jet engines and electronics.\n\nBut the term only found its way into the Cambridge dictionary this year. \n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.","summary":"One of the world's largest glossaries of words has grown by another 6,000 terms and phrases in the past 12 months, reflecting new trends and topics, from climate change to familial relationships.","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/08/18/newly-slang-added-2025-cambridge-dictionary-know-mean-23934432/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SEI_262479737-252f.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-17 23:01:00","author":"Ryan Prosser","authors":["Ryan Prosser"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.271},{"id":351929264,"title":"Thank you for your attention to Trump’s weird new tic","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nDonald Trump has a new verbal tic. He throws it out indiscriminately online, whether he’s threatening unhoused people or whining about Bruce Springsteen or announcing U.S. attacks on Iran’s nuclear sites.\n\n“Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nTrump has posted some version of this onto his Truth Social account 91 times since winning last year’s presidential election. But the funny thing is, prior to the election, he almost never used the phrase online: just five times across both his Truth Social and X accounts, in more than 16 years of online life.\n\nDaily Kos reviewed Roll Call’s database of all of Trump’s posts to Truth Social and X, formerly known as Twitter, where he began posting on May 4, 2009. Our count includes slight variants on the phrase (like \"Thank you for your attention to this problem\") and spelling errors, such as when Trump threatened Apple with tariffs in May but wrote, “Thank your for your attention to this matter!” And it excludes his deleted posts as well as any time he has reposted his own thank-you, which has happened at least twice. \n\nTrump’s first documented use of the phrase on his social media accounts came in August 2019, when he—gasp—announced higher tariffs on China during his first term. Between then and the election, he whipped out the thank-you just four more times, regarding topics as disparate as a federal abortion ban and his 2020 election denialism/football.\n\nHe then deployed the phrase three days after the 2024 election, in an attempt to steady the stock price of Truth Social, which had bounced around following his win.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until after he reassumed the White House that his thank-yous exploded. Three posts in February became five in both March and April, became 15 in May. He hit his monthly record in July, at 26 uses. But with 17 in August already, he’s on track to eclipse that.\n\nOne of the more curious times he used it was when he addressed a Wall Street Journal report about his birthday note to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. \n\n“The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper,” he posted on July 17. “Thank you for your attention to this matter! DJT.”\n\nBut five days earlier, he was chastising people for … paying attention to the scandal … while also thanking them for paying attention.\n\n“One year ago our Country was DEAD, now it’s the ‘HOTTEST’ Country anywhere in the World. Let’s keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,” he wrote. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nOne of the oddest aspects of his new catchphrase is that since he is the president, whatever he says is, by default, news—and people are going to pay attention to it. Why is he suddenly thanking us for feeding him the attention he craves—attention that we sort of have to give to him since he is, again, the president? \n\nMaybe he’s just trying to make his posts sound more like official press releases. Perhaps someone in his office persuaded him to be a tiny bit more gracious, to appear less like the bigoted, semi-sentient grandpa he is. Or maybe it had something to do with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nOn Feb. 28, Trump and Vice President JD Vance met with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office to ostensibly discuss further military aid to the embattled nation. But the true purpose of the meeting quickly became clear: Trump thought Zelenskyy was ungrateful and wanted to humiliate him. Notably, Vance demanded to know if Zelenskyy had ever “said thank you once” to Trump. (Zelenskyy had thanked the U.S. many times for its assistance.)\n\nIn the week before that ambush, Trump issued three “Thank you for your attention to this matter!” posts, each about different topics—but that’s more than he had sent out in any one month prior to that. \n\nIn the month after the ambush, Trump posted five more thank-yous. And from there, his use of the phrase snowballed. It’s possible that Zelenskky’s pushback during the ambush made “thank you” stick in his head. Some of his posts afterward wield the phrase almost sarcastically.\n\nOr maybe—probably—that’s just grasping at straws.\n\nWhatever it is, Trump has given his critics a new motto to mock him with.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Speaking of Republicans trying to gerrymander congressional maps, a new poll from YouGov finds that only 30% of Americans support Texas redrawing its map to further benefit Republicans. Support for Texas Democrats who left the state to stall the redraw is slightly underwater, with 36 approving of them leaving and 40% disapproving. But also underwater is state Attorney General Ken Paxton’s threat to expel the Democrats from the state House. Thirty-six percent approve, while 44% disapprove.\n\n Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell was moved to a cushier prison after she met with Trump’s Justice Department, in what appears to be a quid pro quo for her silence. And it turns out the public ain’t a fan of that. Just 14% of Americans say she should’ve been moved to a minimum-security prison, according to YouGov. At the same time, only about one-third of Americans think Trump ordered the move, though the plurality (48%) aren’t sure whom they think ordered it.\n\nWith all the grim news out there, and to keep in the lighter spirit of this article, we want to tackle a less pressing but hotly debated topic: What’s the most polarizing food?\n\nPer a fresh YouGov poll, eggs come out as the most beloved food, with 51% of Americans saying they “love” them. The most reviled is liver, with 40% saying they “hate” it. \n\nThe most polarizing, though, is sushi, according to the Daily Kos Food Polarization Index.™️(The methodology for this can be found in the chart’s footnote.) Sushi evokes the strongest but most balanced reactions from Americans, with 23% loving the food and 27% hating it.\n\nWhat foods do you hate, love, or can’t understand how others love?","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump has a new verbal tic.

Here's What History Says Could Be Coming in 2026.","text":"We're about two months away from the official 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement, and you're definitely not alone if you're itching to know what kind of boost you'll get next year. It's a pretty big deal, especially if you depend on your benefits for more than half your income.\n\nGuesses are already circulating about what the COLA will look like. While they're still subject to change, there's a lot we can learn from past and current projections to get us in the ballpark where the 2026 Social Security COLA will fall.\n\nHow the Social Security Administration calculates COLAs\n\nThe reason we can only guess about what the 2026 Social Security COLA will be is due to how it's calculated. The Social Security Administration (SSA) bases COLAs on changes in average third-quarter inflation data from one year to the next, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).\n\nBasically, it adds the CPI-W numbers for July, August, and September of the current year and divides the total by three. Then, it compares this to the average from the previous year. For example, the Q3 2024 average was 2.5% higher than the Q3 2023 average, so Social Security checks saw a 2.5% COLA for 2025.\n\nThe July 2025 figure just came in, and it's roughly 2.5% higher than the July 2024 number. But we're still waiting on those August and September data points. Once the September number comes in on Oct. 15, 2025, calculating the COLA will be simple math. Until then, we're left with projections and examinations of past trends.\n\nWhat we can infer about the 2026 COLA\n\nLooking at historical COLA trends can't really tell us anything about the next COLA, because it's highly dependent on inflation levels, which fluctuate over time. Instead, we look to projections from organizations like The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonpartisan senior group, to get an idea of what to expect.\n\nLooking back on TSCL's predictions, we know they're generally pretty accurate, especially as we near the announcement date. As early as April of last year, TSCL predicted a 2.6% COLA -- just 0.1% higher than the actual 2025 COLA. In May 2023, it projected a 3.1% 2024 COLA, which wound up just 0.1% under the 3.2% COLA seniors saw that year. \n\nTSCL's latest estimate for the 2026 COLA is 2.7%. It's likely that the COLA will be somewhere in this neighborhood, though there's reason to believe it could still fluctuate a little. Unlike years past when TSCL's predictions largely held steady, they've been slowly climbing all year, starting from 2.1% in January. This could be because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which many believe could push up the inflation rate in the coming months.\n\nThe average COLA over the last 25 years or so is around 2.5%, so seniors will likely see an average to slightly above-average boost next year. But the dollar amount may still fall short of what seniors were hoping for. The average monthly Social Security retirement benefit as of July 2025 was about $2,007 per month. The average spousal benefit was just $954 per month. A 2.7% increase would only add $54 and $26, respectively, to these checks in 2026.\n\nAgain, the actual COLA could be a little higher than this, based on what inflation does over the next few months. But if you're worried that your benefits may not go far enough next year, you may need to look into other ways to cover your costs, like relying more on personal savings or cutting back on expenses if you can.","summary":"You don't have to wait until the official announcement to get some idea of what to expect next year.","url":"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2025/08/17/what-to-expect-next-years-social-security-cola/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F829473%2Fserious-senior-staring-at-laptop.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-17 23:00:00","author":"Kailey Hagen","authors":["Kailey Hagen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":351914914,"title":"Zelensky Cites Russia’s Challenges; Trump Eyes Resolution Strategy","text":"The geopolitical landscape over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine sees a new wrinkle, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky points to the significant role Russia continues to play in complicating the peace process. Even as diplomatic channels remain taut and delicate, the involvement of international figures like former U.S. President Donald Trump introduces potential strategies toward a resolution.\n\nZelensky Highlights Russia’s Role in Ongoing Conflict\n\nDuring a recent address, President Zelensky stressed the challenges posed by Russia in the efforts to bring an end to the war. He underscored the complexities added by Russia’s actions, which continue to pose a significant hurdle to a peaceful resolution. The Ukrainian leader’s remarks serve as a poignant reminder of the critical role international diplomacy must play in navigating the crisis.\n\nZelensky emphasized that Russia’s military and strategic maneuvers, alongside its political ploys, have severely hindered the prospects for peace. The Ukrainian government remains resolute in its commitment to defending its sovereignty, despite the formidable challenges posed by the neighboring nation.\n\nTrump Proposes Diplomatic Strategies\n\nOn the international front, Donald Trump has suggested he could broker peace negotiations to help resolve the conflict. With a history of unconventional diplomatic efforts, Trump’s potential involvement introduces a different dimension to the crisis resolution. His prior engagements in international diplomacy, including meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, cast a lens on what his approach might entail.\n\nTrump’s propositions, although viewed with skepticism by some, are seen by others as a reflection of his administration’s ability to negotiate favorably complicated foreign policy challenges. Nonetheless, his suggestions must navigate the intricate realities of the current geopolitical environment, where numerous nations have vested interests.\n\nThe International Community’s Stance\n\nThe European Union continues its support for Ukraine, advocating for a diplomatic resolution while imposing sanctions on Russia.\nThe United States remains committed to assisting Ukraine through military aid and diplomatic backing.\nNATO’s involvement underscores the importance of collective defense mechanisms in Eastern Europe.\n\nChallenges and Prospects for Peace\n\nThe path toward peace is fraught with complexities. Zelensky’s administration has been navigating a myriad of challenges, including geopolitical alliances and the balancing act of internal and international expectations. The prospect of engaging with Russia through formal dialogue remains a contentious issue. Critics argue that such discussions might legitimize Russia’s actions, while proponents suggest dialogue as a crucial step towards de-escalation.\n\nFurthermore, the influence of external mediators, such as Trump, could offer new avenues for discourse but also add layers of complexity to the situation. The potential involvement of the former president is met with varying degrees of optimism and skepticism, reflecting the broader international divide on handling the Ukraine-Russia conflict.\n\nAs negotiations for peace continue, the need for a collaborative and multilateral approach is evident. The international community remains vigilant in its efforts and united in the aim to restore stability and peace in Ukraine. The outcomes of these endeavors, shaped by the interplay of national interests and diplomatic strategies, will be pivotal in the weeks and months to come.","summary":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has spotlighted Russia's continued role in undermining peace efforts amid the ongoing war, calling for stronger international diplomacy to counter Moscow’s military and political strategies. Meanwhile, former U.S. President Donald Trump has floated the idea of brokering negotiations, bringing a controversial but potentially impactful player into the mix. As global powers like the EU, U.S., and NATO maintain support for Ukraine, the road to peace remains uncertain—complicated by competing agendas and the high stakes of geopolitical maneuvering.

Trump met with Putin for nearly three hours Friday at a U.S. military base in Anchorage. In their first meeting in six years the two leaders discussed the war in Ukraine. Trump has pushed for peace in the region but no ceasefire deal came out of the talks.\n\n“That’s why you have these European leaders coming as backup tomorrow. Can you reassure them?” Margaret Brennan asked Rubio. \n\n“That’s not true,” Rubio replied. “They’re not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelensky from being bullied. They’re coming here tomorrow because we’ve been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. There were meetings in the U.K. over the following, the previous weekend.”\n\nHe added that the suggestion of bullying was a “stupid media narrative”.\n\n\"They’re coming here tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them to come. We invited them to come. The president invited them to come,\" Rubio insisted. \n\nThe secretary of state noted that the U.S. has met with Zelensky many more times than with Putin. \n\nBrennan recalled Trump's meeting with Zelensky in Washington, D.C. during which Vice President JD Vance asked the Ukrainian leader how often he'd said \"thank you\" for America's help with the war.\n\n“You're right now, not in a very good position. You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now with us,” Trump also said to Zelensky during the extraordinary meeting. His fiery response came after Zelensky told Trump the U.S. would “feel it in the future” if Trump ignored Russia’s actions in Europe. \n\n“I’m not playing cards right now, I’m very serious Mr President. I am a wartime president,” Zelensky replied, further infuriating Trump. \n\n“You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War Three,” Trump shouted. “You're gambling with World War Three, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, far more than a lot of people say they should.”\n\nAfter that, Vance asked Zelensky “have you said thank you once?”\n\n “A lot of times. Even today,” Zelensky replied. Rubio was present in the Oval Office for that meeting. \n\nRubio also appeared Sunday on NBC’s morning show where he was asked if he could name a single concession that Trump was going to ask Russia to make. Rubio refused to answer, insisting that doing so would potentially degrade the negotiations. \n\n\"Well I'm not going to name those things because if I do, you can imagine, our negotiations could fall apart,\" Rubio said. \"I know everybody wants to know what's happening — and to a certain degree that's important — but what's more important is these negotiations work.\"","summary":"Secretary of State Marco Rubio has blasted the \"stupid media narrative\" that President Donald Trump is going to \"bully\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into signing a bad deal with Russia.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marco-rubio-trump-bullying-zelensky-b2809269.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/28/17/00/President-Trump-Hosts-Ukrainian-President-Zelensky-At-The-White-House-we9dx617.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/blfYNSd2-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-17 22:38:06","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":351918936,"title":"South Africa's Head General Visited Iranian Special Forces Unit","text":"General Rudzani Maphwanya, Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), met in Tehran with an array of Iran’s top military leadership, including its defence minister, in a calculated affront to Washington.
