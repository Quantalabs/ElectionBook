Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who opened the hearing by accusing Vought of favoring the rich over working-class Americans.\n\nMerkley accused Vought of favoring \"tax giveaways\" to the nation's wealthiest at the expense of working families.\n\n\"This vision, as laid out, is the great betrayal of American working families,\" Merkley said.\n\nMerkley accused Vought of favoring policies that would increase wealth disparities in the United States and \"make the government by and for the powerful instead of by and for the people.\"\n\nHe cited cuts made to social safety, healthcare, housing and college programs in 2021 as examples of ways in which Vought's policies while director of the OMB harms working class families, despite Vought not being the OMB director in 2021 and Democrats fully controlling the federal government.\n\nVought was acting OMB director from Jan. 2, 2019, to July 22, 2020.\n\nMerkley also questioned Vought's fitness as OMB director, saying Vought opposes abortion and supports the notion that the 2020 general election was \"rigged\" in President Joe Biden's favor.\n\nAfter Merkley finished, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said it's likely that all Budget Committee Republicans would vote for Vought's nomination while none of the Democrats would.\n\nHe said Vought's personal stance on abortion is irrelevant and Trump also said the 2020 election was rigged but won another term in office.\n\nGraham asked Vought to explain how he sees the role of OMB director and said he is glad Trump nominated Vought for the position.\n\nVought said he supports Trump's vision of a federal government that, he said, represents all Americans instead of the special interests of an entrenched few.\n\nHe said he is driven by a commitment to taxpayers and their families and is the son of an electrician and school teachers.\n\n\"They are a reminder of the burden the government can place on everyday Americans,\" he said of his parents' struggles to make ends meet.\n\nHe said he fears for his daughter's future due to the size of the federal debt that has exceeded $36 trillion.\n\n\"A strong inter-agency process delivers the best results for all Americans,\" Vought said and called the OMB an integral part of that process.\n\n\"We have to use taxpayer dollars wisely because inflation driven by irresponsible spending taxes Americans twice,\" Vought said.\n\n\"The average American household has lost roughly $2,000 of purchasing power since January 2021. The forgotten men and women of this country ... deserve a government that empowers them to achieve their dreams.\"\n\nVought said he will work with their \"best interest at heart\" to ensure decisions are made to create a \"more prosperous future for all Americans.\"\n\nVought said it's important to continue the 2017 tax cuts implemented during Trump's first administration but are scheduled to end this year.\n\nHe also supports policies supporting U.S. energy independence, regulating the development and implantation of artificial intelligence and reducing federal spending in a responsible way.\n\nFormer vice presidential candidate and Budget Committee member Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., questioned Vought's qualifications as OMB director due to the nominee's prior work with the Center for Renewing America, which produced the controversial Project 2025 that Democrats assailed during the 2024 election cycle.\n\nVought founded the center as a think tank in 2021, which produced the lengthy Project 2025 as a hard-right conservative roadmap for rebuilding the nation following the COVID-19 pandemic and four years of progressive Biden administration policies. Project 2025 consolidates executive power dramatically and promotes an authoritarian Christian framework of federal government across multiple branches and departments.\n\nKaine noted Project 2025's policy proposals to end \"woke and weaponized government.\"\n\nAmong the policy proposals Kaine cited are proposed budget cuts for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Pell Grants, Medicaid and low-income housing programs.\n\nAfter citing each respective proposal, Kaine asked: \"Its that woke and weaponized?\"\n\nVought said he was not at the committee hearing to answer questions on behalf of the Center for Renewing America and refused to answer Kaine's repeated queries about what Vought considers to be \"woke and weaponized.\"\n\nAlthough he is not a Budget Committee member, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Tuesday evening issued a statement regarding Vought's nomination as OMB director.\n\nSchumer posted the statement on X and prefaced it by saying: \"Russell Vought's vision isn't just reckless; it is downright catastrophic to the economic security of American families.\"\n\nRepublican members of the Senate Budget Committee generally disagreed with Merkley, Kaine and Schumer regarding Vought and the policies he supports.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked Vought if anyone unlawfully in the United States should have access to taxpayer-funded benefits, including welfare, Medicaid and housing.\n\nVought said he would commit to working with Congress to reform such programs and ending taxpayer support for those who are illegally in the United States.","summary":"Russell Vought, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, promised to help American taxpayers while undergoing a contentious confirmation hearing on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/01/22/vought-confirmation-hearing/7491737590587/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7491737590587/2025/upi/490a1dd8b3bc89a9327192bcfaeb8470/v1.2/Democrats-assail-OMB-director-nominee-Russell-Vought-over-political-cultural-issues.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:54:12","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.132},{"id":282897390,"title":"What is Stargate?

Joining the lawsuit under pseudonyms, the women argued that Trump’s order deprives their future children of their constitutional rights.\n\n\"The principle of birthright citizenship is a foundation of our national democracy, is woven throughout the laws of our nation, and has shaped a shared sense of national belonging for generation after generation of citizens,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe complaint makes a similar claim as the four other federal lawsuits signed on by a combined 22 states and two cities; however, this lawsuit differs by having multiple plaintiffs who would be directly impacted by the executive order. The 38-page filing provides personal details of how the lives of each woman and their future children would be changed under Trump's plan.\n\nMonica – a medical doctor from Venezuela with temporary protected status who joined the lawsuit under the pseudonym– said she joined the lawsuit because she fears her future child will become stateless, as her home country facing an ongoing humanitarian, political and economic crisis.\n\n\"I'm 12 weeks pregnant. I should be worried about the health of my child. I should be thinking about that primarily and instead my husband and I are stressed, we're anxious and we're depressed about the reality that my child may not be able to become a US citizen,\" she said.\n\nMaribel – who joined the lawsuit under a pseudonym along with four other women – has lived in the United States for more than half her life after emigrating from El Salvador and Guatemala. She is due to have her third child in July but worries Trump's executive order will split her young family, the lawsuit said.\n\n\"She fears her unborn child will not have the same rights to citizenship as the future child's older sisters, and could even be subject to deportation, separating the family,\" the lawsuit read.\n\n\"Every day, babies are being born in the United States whose constitutionally guaranteed citizenship will be called into doubt under the Executive Order,\" the lawsuit argued.\n\nLiza and her husband Igor fled Russia to the United States for asylum, and they are expecting a child in May. They can't imagine being forced to bring their newborn back to a country that will likely prosecute them, the lawsuit said.\n\n\"Neither Liza nor Igor feel they can return to Russia without being persecuted, and they therefore do not feel they can apply for Russian citizenship for their child. Because of that, Liza and Igor are worried their child will be stateless,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nJuana – who is two months pregnant – fears what the future might hold for her and her future child if they are sent back to Colombia if her asylum claim falls through, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"She wants her unborn child to be able to grow up without fear and with a sense of belonging in the United States. The thought that her unborn child could be denied U.S. citizenship and deported to Colombia without her is terrifying,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nTrinidad is a Venezuelan immigrant who is due in August, but she fears that her child will be stateless under Trump's executive order, caught between Venezuela's democratic crisis and the legal tumult of the United States immigration system, the lawsuit said.\n\nMonica and her partner both have Temporary Protected Status after seeking asylum from Venezuela in the United States, but they are worried their child may be ineligible for both the United States and Venezuelan citizenship. Monica said she came to the United States in 2019 with her husband and thought they were doing \"everything the right way\" by paying taxes, working and buying their own home, she said.\n\n\"We had reached a point of stability in this country and wanted to have a child,\" Monica said.\n\nA happy change in their lives quickly devolved into fear, she said, when they saw Trump act on his promise to end the United States' promise of birthright citizenship with the swipe of a sharpie.\n\n\"This is a really difficult situation where I truly do not see a way out for my child, a way forward for my child to be able to get through this,\" she said.\n\nBecause Venezuela no longer offers consular services in the United States, Monica said she is unable to explore the possibility of getting her child citizenship there. Her lawyers do not know if Trump's executive order would apply to people with temporary protected status, so determining if her child will be an American citizen meant filing a lawsuit against the president, she said.\n\n\"This executive order has just left us with more uncertainty than even before. Will my child be a US citizen? Will he be nothing? We just do not know what to do,\" she said.","summary":"Five undocumented pregnant women sue President Donald Trump over birthright citizenship executive order.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-throws-immigration-system-uncertainty-parents-confront-potential/story?id=117965558","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5dc12421-40df-4e87-b7b4-32b634c7dd4e/donald-trump-1-rt-gmh-241230_1735574541155_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:51:43","author":"James Hill,Peter Charalambous","authors":["James Hill","Peter Charalambous"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.088},{"id":282896266,"title":"Trump signs order re-designating Houthis as foreign terrorist organization","text":"WASHINGTON, January 23. /TASS/.

Since mid-November 2023, dozens of civilian ships have been attacked by the Houthi in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\n\nIn response to Ansar Allah's actions, the US authorities announced the creation of an international coalition and preparations for an operation codenamed Prosperity Guardian, expected to ensure freedom of navigation and protection of ships in the Red Sea.

In his role leading the former president's protective team, he oversaw 85 personnel. \"He proved his fearless courage when he risked his own life to help save mine from an assassin's bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania,\" Trump wrote Wednesday. Curran first joined the agency in September 2001, and was promoted to deputy special agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Detail on Dec. 29. That unit — boasting hundreds of agents — is charged with protecting the current president and the first family. Trump's pick spurns the recommendations of two bipartisan commissions who recommended in 2015 and earlier this year that the next president choose someone outside the agency to serve as director. Unlike other cabinet positions or the FBI director, appointment to lead the Secret Service requires no Senate confirmation vote. Curran will replace Ron Rowe, who has filled the role of acting director since July, when Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle stepped down following harsh backlash for the agency's failure to prevent a would-be assassin from targetingTrump during a campaign rally, plus injuring two rally-goers and fatally wounding 50 year old Cory Comperatore. The top-ranking position will be Curran's first job at the service's headquarters. He is currently not a member of the Senior Executive Service, comprising the highest ranking officials within the agency.","summary":"Sean Curran previously served as the special agent in charge of President Trump's security detail for four years and sprung to cover him on stage during the first assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-selects-sean-curran-to-lead-secret-service/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/23/28ab70b6-9925-4cc0-9fec-4ee2cfafe02a/thumbnail/1200x630/dab6e344edf165ba049b63378c6536ea/gettyimages-2194383933.jpg?v=e306e7b9fefc168c00baa623d76d1eaf","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:42:00","author":"Nicole Sganga","authors":["Nicole Sganga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.221},{"id":282896324,"title":"Joni Mitchell, 81, looks radiant on very rare public outing with a male pal in Beverly Hills","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jan 23rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne-in-12 people living in London is an illegal immigrant, shock data reveals: Almost 600,000 of the capital's residents have NO right to be in the UK, previously secret report says\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Reynolds make shock request after Justin Baldoni's lawyer released bombshell video\n\nSouthern Britain is hit with a TORNADO warning TODAY… before Storm Eowyn blows in tomorrow - as experts fear a 'one-in-100-year' storm will rip across UK with 'off-the-scale' 125mph winds\n\nHeartbroken family of boy, 12, stabbed to death on his way home from school say he was a 'golden kid' without 'a bad bone in his body' - as police grill 14-year-old for murder\n\nTrump hints at possible retaliation for Joe Biden with cryptic warning\n\nI've been travelling to the Caribbean for 25 years.

Kiev hopes for the cessation of hostilities this year, Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime Minister and Economics Minister Yulia Sviridenko said.\n\n\"We hope that the war will end this year,\" she said in an interview with the Polish RMF FM radio station.\n\nAccording to Sviridenko, the Ukrainian authorities believe that a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin is possible. \"On the one hand, this is possible but everything will depend on when it happens. Talks can be arranged when Ukraine is strong enough and to be strong we need to boost our defense production,\" she explained, adding that Kiev expects US President Donald Trump’s administration to play an active role in the negotiating process.\n\nTrump said on January 7 that the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict could take more than 24 hours, a timeframe he had set during his election campaign. His envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said however that he would like to meet a 100-day deadline. On January 21, Trump did not rule out the possibility of a complete halt of US arms supplies to Kiev and declared his readiness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at any convenient moment. At the same time, the US leader did not rule out that the US will tighten sanctions on Russia if it refused to engage in peace talks.\n\nAs Putin noted earlier, Moscow was open to a dialogue with the new US administration on the Ukrainian conflict, the most important thing being to eliminate the root causes of the crisis. He reiterated that Russia had taken note of statements by Trump himself and his team about the wish to restore contacts, as well as the need to do everything to prevent a third world war.","summary":"According to Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime Minister and Economics Minister Yulia Sviridenko, the Ukrainian authorities believe that a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin is possible","url":"https://tass.com/world/1902981","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:40:55","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":282898154,"title":"Convicted US Capitol rioter rejects Trump pardon","text":"A participant in the 6 January 2021 US Capitol riot has rejected a pardon from United States President, Donald Trump, citing accountability and respect for the rule of law.\n\nPamela Hemphill, who pleaded guilty and served a 60-day prison sentence for her role in the riot, told the BBC, “We were wrong that day.”\n\nHemphill, known as the “Maga granny” on social media, criticised Trump’s decision to pardon or commute sentences for those involved in the riot.\n\n“Accepting a pardon would only insult the Capitol police officers, rule of law and, of course, our nation,” she said. “I pleaded guilty because I was guilty, and accepting a pardon also would serve to contribute to their gaslighting and false narrative.”\n\nHemphill accused Trump of attempting to “rewrite history” and reiterated that the actions on that day were unlawful. “We were wrong that day, we broke the law – there should be no pardons,” she said during an interview with the BBC World Service’s Newsday programme.\n\nALSO READ: FULL LIST: Trump signs executive orders on border closure, deportation, others\n\nTrump’s decision to issue pardons for nearly 1,600 individuals tied to the Capitol riot came just hours into his presidency. At a Tuesday press conference, he defended the move, saying, “These people have already served years in prison, and they’ve served them viciously. It’s a disgusting prison. It’s been horrible. It’s inhumane.”\n\nHowever, the decision has faced criticism, including from members of Trump’s own party. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina expressed disapproval, stating, “I just can’t agree with the move,” and warning it could pose “legitimate safety issues on Capitol Hill.” Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma echoed these concerns, emphasising, “If you attack a police officer, that’s a very serious issue and they should pay a price for that.”\n\nThe refusal of a presidential pardon is not unprecedented. Under the US Constitution, individuals have the right to decline pardons, a position upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nAmong those pardoned was Jacob Chansley, widely known as the “QAnon Shaman.” Released in 2023 after serving 27 months of a 41-month sentence, Chansley shared his reaction to the pardon, telling the BBC, “I walked outside and I screamed ‘freedom’ at the top of my lungs and then gave a good Native American war cry.”\n\nALSO READ TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE","summary":"Tribune Online\n\nConvicted US Capitol rioter rejects Trump pardon\n\n\nA participant in the 6 January 2021 US Capitol riot has rejected a pardon from United States President, Donald Trump, citing accountability and respect for the rule of law.

But Europe needs to step up, and do more long-term work to secure real energy independence.”\n\n“You can’t keep buying gas from Moscow while also expecting security guarantees and help from the Americans,” Zelensky said. “That’s just wrong.”","summary":"At the World Economic Forum, the president calls for energy independence from Moscow and discusses Trump’s proposed oil boost, encourages cooperation from non-European countries to help end the war.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/45894","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/01/23/5837bde1d8d417b5c7311f9e70e5a7d0.jpeg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:38:19","author":"John Moretti","authors":["John Moretti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":0.02},{"id":282895192,"title":"Trump: ‘We can do it the easy way, or the hard way – and the easy way is always better’","text":"President Donald Trump says he would like to do Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, a “favor,” by allowing them to settle their war in Ukraine now.\n\n“We can do it the easy way or the hard way – and the easy way is always better,” Trump said in a posting on social media:\n\nHe explained, “I’m not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin – and this despite the Radical Left’s Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX.”\n\nHe said, “We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process. All of that being said, I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War!”\n\nHe explained, “IT’S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. If we don’t make a ‘deal,’ and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries. Let’s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with! We can do it the easy way, or the hard way – and the easy way is always better. It’s time to ‘MAKE A DEAL.’ NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!”\n\nOne of Trump’s pledges during his campaign was that he would work to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, to which the U.S. under Joe Biden sent billions and billions of dollars, soon.\n\nThe Daily Wire noted the “various” other countries likely would include China, as Beijing and Moscow “have grown closer in recent years.”\n\nThe report said, “Russia has also received help in the war from North Korea, which recently dispatched thousands of its own soldiers to join the fight against Ukraine.”\n\nThe Trump plans are the latest example, the report said, of Trump’s “willingness to wield the United States’ economic might to pressure other countries.

It precluded ICE agents from carrying out immigration enforcement actions in locations like hospitals, places of worship, schools, or during events such as weddings or parades unless there is an urgent need, such as a person who poses an imminent threat or if the agents have sought higher approval to do so.\n\nThe Biden administration later issued an expanded definition of “sensitive locations,” which added places like playgrounds, homeless shelters, emergency response centers, and domestic-violence shelters.\n\nThe order was signed by Acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman, who is serving as head of the agency pending the confirmation of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\n“This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP [Customs and Border Protection] and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens — including murders [sic] and rapists — who have illegally come into our country,” a DHS spokesperson said Jan. 21.\n\n“Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense.”\n\nThe possibility of the policy change had been telegraphed in December, when three unnamed sources stated that Trump planned to change the policy as soon as his first day in office as part of his broader immigration agenda. Trump on Monday signed a series of executive orders on immigration, including several that put into motion his campaign promises to close the border to asylum seekers and to carry out mass deportations of people residing in the U.S. illegally — a plan numerous Catholic leaders have criticized as unjust. \n\nCatholic and other Christian leaders had spoken out with “grave concern” over Trump’s plans to end the “sensitive locations” policy. The Catholic bishops of Arizona in December argued that raids at “sensitive locations” like churches would violate basic human rights, including religious freedom and the right to family unity, and undermine societal stability by discouraging undocumented immigrants from seeking essential services.\n\nCommenting on the then-prospective change, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network Inc. (CLINIC), a group launched by the U.S. bishops in 1988 to support community-based immigration programs and represent low-income migrants, said in December it is “deeply concerned about any changes that would undermine the safety and well-being of immigrants and their families.”\n\n“Sensitive locations — such as houses of worship, schools, and hospitals — are sanctuaries where individuals seek solace, education, and critical care without fear of intimidation or detention,” Anna Gallagher, CLINIC’s executive director, said in a statement to CNA.\n\n“This policy has long recognized the importance of these spaces for fostering trust and community stability. Rescinding it would not only disrupt families and communities but could also deter individuals from accessing essential services, such as education and health care, or practicing their faith freely … We call for the preservation of protections at sensitive locations to ensure immigrants and their families can live without fear and fulfill their basic needs, including the practice of religion.”","summary":"cna","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/trump-ends-policy-of-treating-churches-as-sensitive-locations-for-immigration-raids","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20250122180128_016b332e060c0bd7f847035fc56a2d354a517fba3fc1018979b723690db3fe09.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:31:04","author":"Jonah McKeown/cna","authors":["Jonah McKeown/cna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.021},{"id":282895308,"title":"Elon Musk worked Vivek Ramaswamy out of DOGE following ‘differences’: Report","text":"As Indian-origin entrepreneur and Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy pulled out of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), just 69 days after he was announced the co-head of the team along with tech billionaire Elon Musk, a report has revealed that it was the Tesla CEO who wanted Ramaswamy ‘out’ of the team.Politico reported citing three people with Elon Musk’s preference said the billionaire made it known that he wanted Ramaswamy out of DOGE in recent days. Hours after Trump’s inauguration as the 47th US President, Ramaswamy announced that he would not co-head DOGE. Musk’s ability to ice out Ramaswamy, who for a variety of reasons had irked some Republicans in Trump’s circle, is the latest sign of his influence in the incoming administration. It presages an encore of all of the infighting that marked Trump’s first term. Ramaswamy “just burned through the bridges and he finally burned Elon,” said a Republican strategist close to Trump advisers. “Everyone wants him out of Mar-a-Lago, out of DC.”According to the report, Ramaswamy’s comments on X during a discussion of H-1B visas were the ‘main reason’ for some Republicans’ getting frustrated with him.In December last year, the Indian-origin leader criticised American culture, saying that tech companies hire foreign workers because the country that has “venerated mediocrity over excellence.”“They wanted him out before the tweet — but kicked him to the curb when that came out,” one of the three people familiar with his departure, told Politico.Ramaswamy is planning to announce a run for Ohio Governor next week, as reported by Politico. A person close to DOGE said Musk did not think it was feasible for him to campaign for office while working on DOGE.Meanwhile, Trump transition spokesperson Anna Kelly lauded Ramaswamy and said that he “played a critical role in helping us create DOGE” and that his plan to run for governor “requires him to remain outside of DOGE based on the structure that we announced today.”Politico reported citing sources, that Ramaswamy maintained to confidants as late as Saturday evening that he was actively involved in DOGE, saying he was at work writing executive orders. However, a person familiar with the arrangement informed that he had done almost no DOGE-related work since early December.Last week, he was hoping to achieve some significant milestones before leaving to run for governor. Now, Ramaswamy and his team are trying to present his exit in a positive light, especially since it’s happening as Trump begins his term.Ramaswamy has chosen not to comment on the rumoured tensions between him and Musk. A person familiar with Ramaswamy’s thinking said they are now on good terms and that “the reality is that it wasn’t possible” to run for governor and co-lead DOGE “both at once.”Ramaswamy attended US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, where he spoke to Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff.On Monday morning, Ramaswamy posted a photo of himself with Musk shaking hands.“A new dawn,” he wrote.But he was already on his way out. That same day, a person close to Ramaswamy who was granted anonymity to speak freely confirmed Ramaswamy was leaving, the Politico report stated.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2025/01/elon-musk-worked-vivek-ramaswamy-out-of-doge-following-differences-report/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ANI-20250122234634.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:30:45","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":282898156,"title":"Stop ‘ridiculous war’ in Ukraine or face new sanctions — Trump warns Putin","text":"United States President, Donald Trump, has issued a stern warning to Russian President, Vladimir Putin, threatening higher tariffs and additional sanctions if Russia does not bring an end to the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump stated that by seeking to resolve the war, he was doing both Russia and its president “a very big favour.”\n\nHe also reiterated his earlier claim that he could negotiate a settlement to Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022, within a single day.\n\nDuring a news conference on Tuesday, Trump disclosed plans to speak with Putin “very soon,” noting that it “sounds likely” he would impose tougher sanctions if no progress was made.\n\nHowever, in his social media post, he adopted a more forceful tone, stating, “I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR.

The timing of this statement reflects the Quad’s collective resolve to counter Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, despite uncertainties surrounding Trump’s foreign policy direction.\nQuad Nations' Commitment to a Free and Open Indo-Pacific\nIn their joint statement, the Quad foreign ministers reaffirmed their dedication to maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific, underscoring the importance of rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Japan’s readout of the meeting highlighted concerns over Chinese territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, areas that remain major points of contention.\n“Our four nations maintain our conviction that international law, economic opportunity, peace, stability, and security in all domains, including the maritime domain, underpin the development and prosperity of the peoples of the Indo-Pacific,” the statement declared.\nThe ministers also pledged to hold regular meetings and announced plans for a summit in India later this year, further solidifying their collaborative efforts.\nMaritime and Economic Security a Priority for Quad Nations\nThe Quad’s commitment extends to bolstering regional maritime, economic, and technological security. The statement emphasized the importance of reliable and resilient supply chains in the face of growing threats. This message is particularly crucial for nations like India and Japan, which are eager to counterbalance China’s expanding influence in the region.\nExternal Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar underscored the significance of the meeting, stating, “The timing underlines the priority that member-states attach to Quad. The meeting today sends a clear message that in an uncertain and volatile world, Quad will continue to be a force for global good.”\nHistorical Context: The Evolution of Quad\nQuad’s journey as a strategic grouping began in 2007 but gained momentum only in recent years. Under Trump’s first term, the Quad was revived, and in 2019, its foreign ministers held their first formal meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. The group was later upgraded to the summit level under President Joe Biden, but Trump’s role in revitalizing the mechanism is widely acknowledged.\nSpeaking on Trump’s earlier concerns about alliances and burden-sharing, Jaishankar remarked, “These don’t apply to Quad as everybody pays their fair share.”\nQuad Nations' Unified Approach for the Indo-Pacific\nThe Quad Nations envision a partnership that leverages the collective strengths of governments, the private sector, and people-to-people relationships to ensure the region’s sustainable development and stability. Jaishankar likened their collaboration to sharing a meal, where “everybody goes for dinner, you split the bill, and everybody thinks it’s the right thing to do.”\nThe Quad’s strong stance against unilateral aggression sends a clear signal to China while reassuring allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific. Despite Trump’s recent outreach to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Quad’s message underscores its resolve to work collectively to ensure regional stability and counter any threats to international law and order.\nALSO READ: Trump Cancels The Biden-Era App Designed To Aid Illegal Migrants In Achieving Legal Status","summary":"Hours after US President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term, the Quad nations—comprising the United States, India, Japan, and Australia—issued a joint statement firmly opposing any unilateral attempts to alter the status quo through force or coercion.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/quad-nations-oppose-change-to-status-quo-by-force-a-clear-message-to-china/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Quad-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:20:52","author":"Srishti Mukherjee","authors":["Srishti Mukherjee"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.357},{"id":282891210,"title":"Trump Orders 1,500 More Troops to Mexico Border to Strengthen Immigration Measures","text":"US President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of 1,500 additional troops to the southern border with Mexico, the White House confirmed on Wednesday. This move is part of a broader effort to combat illegal immigration and strengthen border security.\n“President Trump signed an executive order for 1,500 additional troops for the United States' southern border,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a briefing.\nCurrently, around 2,500 US National Guard and Reserve forces are stationed along the border. The newly deployed active-duty troops will join them, marking a significant increase in military presence in the region.\nTroop Roles and Responsibilities\nThe additional troops will not engage directly in law enforcement but will support border patrol agents by handling logistics, transportation, and construction of barriers. These roles are consistent with past deployments under both the Trump administration and former President Joe Biden.\nThis move aligns with Trump’s broader immigration strategy, which he has emphasized since his first presidential term, to curb unlawful border crossings and enhance national security.\nTrump's Executive Order Raises Possibility of Invoking Insurrection Act\nThrough an executive order, Trump has directed the secretary of defense and the homeland security chief to evaluate the potential need to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act. If invoked, this act would allow the use of military personnel for civilian law enforcement duties on US soil.\nThe Insurrection Act was last used in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots following the acquittal of police officers involved in the beating of Rodney King.\nEarly Action in Trump’s New Term\nThe troop deployment was one of Trump’s first major actions since his return to the White House. Earlier in the week, he signed an order instructing the Department of Defense to develop a plan to “seal the borders” and address issues of “unlawful mass migration.”\nIn his inaugural address on Monday, Trump declared, “I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will be stopped immediately, and we will start the process of returning millions of criminal aliens to their countries of origin.”\nMilitary Presence at the US-Mexico Border\nThe use of military personnel at the US-Mexico border is not new. Since the 1990s, troops have been deployed intermittently to address issues related to migration, drug trafficking, and transnational crime.\nThis latest deployment is expected to enhance existing efforts to secure the border while addressing logistical and operational challenges faced by border patrol agents.\nThe decision to send additional troops has sparked debate. While supporters argue that it demonstrates a strong commitment to border security, critics have raised concerns about the potential militarization of the border and its impact on humanitarian efforts.\nALSO READ: Trump Cancels The Biden-Era App Designed To Aid Illegal Migrants In Achieving Legal Status","summary":"US President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of 1,500 additional troops to the southern border with Mexico, the White House confirmed on Wednesday.

This decision comes for the second time after the Biden administration reversed the original designation made during Trump’s first term.\nHouthi Attacks Escalate Amid Regional Tensions\nThe Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group, intensified attacks on US military and commercial vessels in the Red Sea following the October 7 Hamas assault on Israel. The group also targeted ships they alleged were linked to Israel, framing their actions as solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. These attacks coincided with Israel’s military retaliation, which caused widespread devastation in Gaza.\nBiden Administration’s Stance on the Houthis\nDuring his presidency, Joe Biden lifted the Houthi terror designation early in his term, citing concerns that such measures could obstruct humanitarian aid delivery to Yemen. At the time, Yemen was grappling with one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Instead of fully restoring the FTO label, Biden designated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity.\nHowever, a recommendation to relist the Houthis as an FTO was presented to Biden during his final month in office. Biden deferred the decision, leaving it for the incoming administration.\nTrump’s Renewed Focus on Iran and Security\nThe Washington Free Beacon, which first reported the redesignation, revealed that Trump’s order not only condemned Iran’s support for the Houthis but also outlined US policy to “eliminate Houthi capabilities and operations.” This move aligns with Trump’s broader stance of increasing pressure on Iran and its proxies.\nMaritime Security and Financial Costs: Response to Houthis\nIn response to the growing Houthi threat, the US established a maritime coalition in January to deter the group and secure international shipping lanes. The Houthis’ attacks have cost the US billions of dollars, especially with the continuous deployment of aircraft carrier strike groups to the region.\nA Brown University study estimated that these operations have surpassed $4.86 billion, with a carrier strike group’s daily operation costing approximately $9 million.\nCeasefire by Houthis Brings Temporary Relief\nRecently, the Houthis signaled their willingness to halt attacks on Israel as part of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. While this development offers a brief respite, Trump’s redesignation of the group as an FTO underscores ongoing concerns over their actions and Iran’s influence in the region.\nThe reclassification of the Houthis as an FTO is a significant policy shift, reflecting heightened tensions in the Middle East. While it signals a hardline approach to counterterrorism, critics worry about the potential humanitarian impact on Yemen, which continues to struggle under the weight of war and famine.\nALSO READ: Trump Cancels The Biden-Era App Designed To Aid Illegal Migrants In Achieving Legal Status","summary":"US President Donald Trump has once again designated Yemen’s Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), the White House announced on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/donald-trump-to-redesignate-yemens-houthis-as-a-terrorist-organization/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Trump-on-Greenland.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:20:52","author":"Srishti Mukherjee","authors":["Srishti Mukherjee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.013},{"id":282891790,"title":"As Jan. 6 leaders call for retribution, judges warn against revisionism","text":"Two newly freed leaders of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups called for investigations into the prosecution of people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, assailing judges, jurors and prosecutors as they sought “retribution” after being granted clemency from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe statements by Proud Boys leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, released from sentences of 22 years and 18 years for seditious conspiracy, came before House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) on Wednesday announced formation of a new Judiciary subcommittee led by Rep.

Stocks rallied during the Jan. 22 trading session, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index reaching a record high.\n\nInvestor optimism fueled the stock market’s gains midweek. Traders have signaled that Trump may have softened his position on trade policy, especially on tariffs.\n\nThe 47th president signed a presidential memorandum hours after taking office. It did not include sweeping universal tariffs.\n\nSpeaking to reporters as he was signing executive orders, Trump revealed that he was considering levies on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1.\n\nAt a Jan. 21 White House news conference, Trump noted that his administration was considering imposing an “approximately 25 percent” tariff on the country’s North American neighbors due to border concerns.\n\nHe also told reporters that he was weighing a 10 percent tariff on China as early as Feb. 1.\n\n“We’re talking about a tariff of 10 percent on China based on the fact that they’re sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada,” Trump said. “Probably Feb. 1 is the date we’re looking at.”\n\nWhile on the campaign trail, Trump proposed an across-the-board 10-20 percent tariff on all U.S. imports and 60-100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nFinancial markets breathed a sigh of relief that President Trump’s slate of executive orders did not feature tariffs, said Tom Essaye, the president and founder of Sevens Report Research.\n\n“Looking forward, we should expect ‘off the cuff’ tariff threats from Trump from time to time (including the impromptu threat of 20% tariffs on Mexico and Canada on February 1st),” Essaye said in a note emailed to The Epoch Times.\n\n“But, looking beyond that, the reality is that Trump’s executive order for departments to review trade policies likely puts any meaningful tariff news on hold until April and again.”\n\nWith the week light on major economic reports, Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok said market watchers are observing the “animal spirits,” a term coined by economist John Maynard Keynes to describe confidence and optimism in driving market dynamics.\n\nIncoming trends, Slok said, will highlight tailwinds from AI spending, data center investments, and Biden-era government initiatives—the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, for example.\n\n“Combined with additional tailwinds to growth from high stock prices, high home prices, high crypto prices, Fed cuts, higher animal spirits, and potential Trump policies, the bottom line is that the US economy is entering 2025 on a firm footing,” Slok said in a note emailed to The Epoch Times.\n\n“With GDP currently at 3.1 percent and core inflation at 3.2 percent, we continue to worry more about upside risks to growth and inflation.”\n\nLast month, the index dipped 0.1 percent, down from an upwardly revised 0.4 percent increase in November.\n\nThe companies plan to invest an initial $100 billion and construct data centers in Texas. This initiative, Trump noted, will establish the physical and digital foundation to “power the next generation of advancements” in AI.\n\n“This monumental undertaking is a resounding declaration of confidence in America’s potential under a new President,” Trump said in the Roosevelt Room flanked by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI head Sam Altman, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “This is the money that normally would have gone to China or other countries.”\n\nThe next major earnings report will be GE Aerospace, American Express, and Verizon.\n\nUnless the Federal Reserve signals a hawkish position next week or Wall Street witnesses abysmal earnings releases, “the bulls seem firmly in control,” Vawda said.","summary":"Solid start to the earnings season helps lift U.S. stocks.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/sp-500-hits-fresh-record-high-as-stocks-extend-gains-on-trump-optimism-ai-investments-5797092","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/01/23/id5797304-GettyImages-2195293513-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:12:32","author":"Andrew Moran","authors":["Andrew Moran"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041},{"id":282895200,"title":"Biden shuts down his ‘pardon me’ administration","text":"On July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) issued a 6-3 decision concerning the criminal liability of President Donald Trump for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021. It ruled he could not be prosecuted, either as a sitting or former president, for actions that fell within his constitutional presidential powers. It was the first time SCOTUS recognized any form of presidential immunity from prosecution.\n\nIn a 43-page ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts stated some immunity was necessary to enable a president to “execute the duties of his office fearlessly and fairly.” He explained “absolute” immunity was mandated for presidents exercising their “core constitutional powers, such as the issuance of pardons.” Roberts’ pardon reference was interesting in light of former President Joe Biden’s unfettered use of the power during the last days of his presidency.\n\nBut the SCOTUS ruling was not well-received by Democrats who contended it was partisan. Accordingly, in August of that year, Democrats introduced legislation seeking to restore checks on presidential immunity. The bill was cited as the “No Kings Act” to underscore the fact no one was above the law. Ironically, as a president who during the past two months has handed out pardons as if he were a king, Biden declared back then, “This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America … not even the president of the United States.”\n\nPossessed of a core constitutional power as a serving president, Biden had the legal authority to issue a pardon to whomever he chose – a power granted by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, of the Constitution. There is only one exception specified in the Constitution that denies such power and that is in cases involving impeachment. However, despite this sole written exception, historically there have been two instances of case law where revocation of a presidential pardon was achieved even though impeachment was not an issue.\n\nThe first such withdrawal occurred in 1869 after a pardon issued by outgoing President Andrew Johnson which incoming President Ulysses S. Grant sought to revoke. The judge ruled a pardon could not be revoked once completed, raising the issue then at what point does completion occur. The court determined completion became effective upon delivery to the recipient or one authorized to accept delivery on the recipient’s behalf. In this case, as the pardon was still in the possession of a messenger, delivery had not been completed, and Grant prevailed.\n\nThe second case occurred in 2008, involving President George W. Bush revoking a pardon he had issued a day earlier but had not yet delivered. Issued on behalf of Brooklyn developer Isaac Toussie who had pleaded guilty to mail fraud and other crimes, Bush, upon learning additional information about the recipient, successfully revoked it based on non-delivery.\n\nThe issue of presidential pardons has gained a high profile due to Biden doing what he told us just prior to taking office, in December 2020, he would never do. During a CNN interview, he was informed of rumors that Trump was contemplating doing something for his closest allies rarely done: issuing preemptive pardons – i.e., pardons issued before any charges have even been filed. But if no one has acted criminally, as Biden suggests, why then preemptively pardon them?\n\nAsked about it at that time, then President-elect Biden expressed his objection. He stated, “Well, it concerns me in terms of what kind of precedent it sets in how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice.” He then assured listeners, “You’re not going to see in our administration that kind of approach to pardons.”\n\nContrary to this assurance, that is exactly what Biden did just before leaving office on Jan. 20, 2025. Doing so has proven to be one of the most controversial acts of his presidency. The recipients not only included five of his family members but a list of others such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired JCS Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, members of the former House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riots and their staff.\n\nOne anti-Trump critic hoping to add his name to the pardon me-too list but failed to get so recognized was Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nBiden left office on Jan. 20 as the least popular president in 75 years. While numerous factors contributed to this, such as inflation and illegal immigration, his pardoning of son Hunter, after pledging not to and then extending pardons as well to five other family members just minutes before heading off to Trump’s inauguration, did nothing to improve his popularity.\n\nThere are three reasons for this related to his pardons:\n\nWhile what he did was legal under the Constitution, Biden failed to act ethically by issuing a blanket pardon for Hunter and other Biden family members that dismissed 11 years of potential criminal activity just to ensure every potential crime was covered.\nIn issuing Hunter’s pardon as well as those for other family members and for the anti-Trump critics, Biden justified his doing so by citing a flawed judicial system, undermining public trust in it. But the same judicial system convicting 1,500 January 6th defendants caused him no similar concerns. In fact, he had the audacity to tell them if they accepted pardons from Trump it would be a “confession of guilt for your crimes,” dismissing his own pardons as having a similar impact by specifically stating they were not an admission of guilt.\nThere is evidence Biden himself may have financially benefited from Hunter’s questionable acts in selling access to his father’s office. Banks reported their concerns about payments to the Bidens through numerous shell companies. Whether rightly or wrongly, such family pardons support the public’s perception Biden sought to cover up his personal involvement by issuing them.\n\nWhile Biden’s pardons prevent recipients from being held accountable for federal crimes, there may still be criminal acts they violated under state laws. If so, these hopefully will be pursued to determine what the truth is.\n\nIt will be interesting to see now that January 6 defendants were pardoned or had sentences commuted by the new president whether Biden supporters allege Trump has abused his authority. Doing so in the wake of Biden’s personal pardon extravaganza would be the height of hypocrisy.","summary":"Joe left office on Jan. 20 as the least popular president in 75 years","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/biden-shuts-down-his-pardon-me-administration/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/joe-biden-hostages-release-20250119-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:11:02","author":"Lt.

YouTube star MrBeast is among several wealthy figures who want to.\n\n“TikTok, I’m on a private jet right now about to put in my official offer for this platform,” Jimmy Donaldson, better known on the internet as the creator MrBeast, said in a video Monday. “I might become your guys’ new CEO.”\n\nDonaldson is one of a handful of people who have said they are interested in acquiring the app in a bid to satisfy a U.S. law that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell it. But he, like others who are interested, would most likely have to pull together co-investors to come up with the funds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday he was interested in Elon Musk or Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying it. Billionaire Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty also created a consortium called “The People’s Bid,” which said it put an offer on the table.\n\nThe possibility of a TikTok sale once seemed remote. But in recent days, the idea has gained fresh momentum. Trump signed an executive order Monday giving ByteDance a 75-day extension to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner, effectively delaying the nationwide ban of the app that was originally set to take effect Sunday. The app’s U.S. operations have been valued at up to $50 billion if ByteDance does sell.\n\nJust hours before Trump signed the order Monday, China indicated that it might be softening its opposition to a sale. Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, expressed a willingness to allow ByteDance to sell at least part of the company. General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, who is a major investor in ByteDance and is on its board of directors, told Axios on Wednesday that a deal will get done and that there could be solutions “short of [ByteDance’s] divestiture.”\n\nBecause of this shift, the big question is now about who or what will buy TikTok and not whether ByteDance will sell it, some experts say. Still, it will be complicated. People have also expressed concerns over how a sale might affect TikTok’s unique algorithm, which is known for its ability to curate highly personalized feeds and may be hard to replicate by a new owner.\n\n“What happens to the algorithm? Will this be an outright sale or a JV/partnership structure?” Dan Ives, an analyst for the financial services firm Wedbush Securities, wrote in an analyst note Wednesday. “Our view is ByteDance is willing to play ball and look for a legitimate deal/JV partner to keep TikTok up and running while protecting its algorithm. From the beginning we have only seen a few core potential bidders for the TikTok asset that would be ‘approved’ by Beijing.”\n\nTrump has proposed the idea of a joint venture that produces a 50-50 ownership split between ByteDance and the United States, although it’s unclear whether he means ownership by the U.S. government or a U.S. company. For now, however, the law would still require ByteDance to give up at least 80% of its stake.\n\nOver the weekend, TikTok went dark for less than a day before coming back online, in both instances crediting Trump’s efforts to work with the company on “a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.”\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, TikTok is still not available for redownload on the Apple and Google app stores. \n\nEarlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials were considering the possibility of selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to Musk — particularly as Beijing evaluates how China can work with the new Trump administration. Musk has been appointed to helm the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to Bloomberg’s report, one possibility under Musk might be some kind of merger between X (formerly Twitter), which he bought for $44 billion in 2022, and TikTok.\n\nBut ByteDance has denied the report, responding to several news outlets: “We can’t be expected to comment on pure fiction.”\n\nRepresentatives for TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\nMusk, who is also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has not addressed the rumors — but he has posted several times on X that the ban would contradict freedom of speech.\n\n“This law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!” Musk wrote on X in March in response to concerns about the scope of the law. “If it were just about TikTok, it would only cite ‘foreign control’ as the issue, but it does not.”\n\nMusk, who has extensive business interests in China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIves, one of the most prominent analysts in the tech industry, wrote that he believes Musk is the most likely person to be leading a successful bid for the app, citing his “iron clad relationship with Trump.” \n\n“​​We continue to believe Musk will be heavily involved in finding a solution for TikTok and ultimately could build a consortium to buy TikTok,” he wrote. “Other strategic/financial players are looking at this golden asset, but it needs to be formally approved by Beijing and will never be sold with the algorithm in our view.”\n\nIves added that Ellison and his company, Oracle, could also still play a pivotal role.\n\nOracle is one of TikTok’s most vital service providers, managing and storing user data. \n\nEllison has been a vocal and financial supporter of Republican causes, including hosting fundraisers for Trump during the 2016 election cycle. On Tuesday, the two men appeared together at a news conference to unveil a new venture backed by the White House: Stargate, a partnership between Oracle, OpenAI and Japanese investment holding company SoftBank, focused on powering artificial intelligence production.\n\nDuring that appearance, after Trump floated Musk or Ellison as prospective buyers for TikTok, Ellison responded, “Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President.”\n\nSteven Mnuchin, who served as treasury secretary during Trump’s first term, has also expressed a personal interest in purchasing TikTok.\n\nIn 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban TikTok due to national security concerns, then-Secretary Mnuchin oversaw the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which was tasked with evaluating the risks associated with the app. He facilitated negotiations and conversations with potential bidders, a process that came to an end when TikTok won a court appeal and the ban was halted.\n\nIn March, Mnuchin told CNBC that he was putting together an investor group to “buy TikTok,” a plan he said was put on hold because of China’s unwillingness to negotiate. This week, Mnuchin said TikTok U.S. is “worth a lot of money” and stressed that “if it’s managed correctly and it can grow into other areas such as e-commerce and expand in the U.S., it’s terrific business.”\n\nAmong those not in Trump’s direct orbit, Donaldson, the YouTube superstar, has been the most public about his interest. \n\nDonaldson, who has more than 346 million YouTube subscribers, posted about wanting to buy TikTok earlier this month. The creator, 26, is one of the internet’s most recognizable faces, having grown a multimillion-dollar company, which employs hundreds of people in North Carolina and pumps out videos featuring competitions and stunts that regularly attract tens of millions of views.\n\n“Okay fine, I’ll buy Tik Tok so it doesn’t get banned,” he wrote in one X post, later adding: “Unironically I’ve had so many billionaires reach out to me since I tweeted this, let’s see if we can pull this off.”\n\nDonaldson’s spokesperson Matthew Hiltzik confirmed that the creator would be interested in buying TikTok as part of a group, and is holding discussions with prospective buyers but has not exclusively joined any bids.\n\nAnother person who has entertained the idea of potentially buying TikTok is Canadian entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary, a longtime “shark,” or investor, on the business reality TV series “Shark Tank.” He’s part of “The People’s Bid” consortium.\n\nIn a Fox News appearance Friday, just after the Supreme Court upheld the law banning TikTok, O’Leary said he offered up $20 billion to buy TikTok, saying that selling TikTok is “the obvious solution” for ByteDance.\n\nA representative for O’Leary did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlso joining the fray last week was artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI, which has put in a bid to ByteDance to merge with TikTok.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWho will “save” TikTok?

This comes off of his day-one action … to direct the Department of Defense to make homeland security a core mission of the agency,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.\n\nAround 2,200 active-duty troops are already stationed at the border as part of Joint Task Force-North, whose headquarters is based in El Paso, Texas. The soldiers are operating together with the National Guard and the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents. \n\nAccording to CNN, the troops are currently assisting in “mostly logistical and bureaucratic tasks,” such as data entry and monitoring. \n\nActing Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses said that the Pentagon will dispatch “helicopters with associated crews, and intelligence analysts to support increased detection and monitoring efforts.”\n\nThe Pentagon will also “provide military airlift to support DHS deportation flights of more than five thousand illegal aliens from the San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas, sectors detained by Customs and Border Protection,” Salesses told reporters. “This is just the beginning,” he added. \n\nOverall, Trump is preparing to send around 10,000 troops to the border with Mexico, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday, citing an internal CBP document.\n\nTrump, who took office on Monday, has vowed to protect the country from the “invasion” of illegal migrants. In an executive order signed shortly after inauguration, he said that many undocumented migrants “present significant threats to national security and public safety” and are “committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans.”\n\nOn Monday, Trump declared a national emergency at the border and shut down a CBP app designed to help migrants make appointments at border crossings. \n\nThe US has seen an influx of migrants during Joe Biden’s presidency. Border agents logged a record 2.8 million encounters with migrants in 2023. More than 1.5 million migrants were recorded as “gotaways” – individuals who evaded CBP detection – between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, according to the Department of Homeland Security.","summary":"The US is sending 1,500 additional soldiers to monitor the border with Mexico \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/611482-trump-sends-troops-border/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/679188572030277d95008015.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:09:20","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.196},{"id":282889920,"title":"Britons now favour European allies over US as ‘unpredictable’ Trump returns, study finds","text":"Britons now favour Europe over the United States as an ally, a new study has found, marking a complete reversal of public opinion from almost 60 years ago.\n\nThe study, by the Policy Institute at King’s College London, found that a majority of 53 per cent now say Britain should prioritise Europe, compared with 31 per cent who say the opposite – an almost mirror image of opinion back in 1967, when the public favoured America over Europe by 53 per cent to 33 per cent.\n\nProfessor Bobby Duffy, director of KCL’s Policy Institute, said the shift is related to both the “febrile and unpredictable political atmosphere around the re-election of President Trump” and “the many years building closer ties to Europe since the 1960s.”\n\nIt comes amid fears that the president’s plans to introduce tariffs and instigate a trade war will force Britain to choose between striking a trade deal with the incoming US president and continuing to pursue closer ties with the EU in a planned reset of Britain’s relationship with the bloc.\n\nBut in December, Sir Keir Starmer rejected demands that he make a choice between a trade deal with the US and closer relations with the EU, saying such a suggestion is “plain wrong”. \n\nMeanwhile, insiders this week told The Independent that Mr Trump’s new administration believes it has Sir Keir’s government “over a barrel” on trade as Britain becomes increasingly reliant on a US trade deal. \n\nSenior sources in the president’s team said the UK had no choice but to seek a trade agreement after the prime minister said his government’s success would be judged primarily on economic growth.\n\nDespite the public generally being in favour of Europe, Reform UK voters have a marked commitment to America, with 55 per cent to 31 per cent saying Britain should side with the US over Europe if it ever had to choose between them as allies.\n\nBy contrast, Conservative voters are much more closely divided, with 43 per cent backing America and 40 per cent backing Europe. \n\nLabour voters, however, heavily prefer Europe with just 23 per cent choosing the US and 65 per cent siding with Europe. \n\nThe polling comes just days after Nigel Farage travelled to Washington DC for the inauguration of Donald Trump, a close ally of the Reform UK leader. \n\nThe research – relying on data conducted by Focaldata in December 2024 and data from historic polls – also says the public are now almost twice as likely to say they’d prefer the UK to be more like Sweden and Switzerland (51 per cent) instead of trying be a leading world power (28 per cent). \n\n“These long-term trends remind us how much we’ve changed, with UK public opinion being shaped by decades of national and global politics.\n\n“We have moved away from seeing the US as key allies in the 1960s, which won’t just be related to the febrile and unpredictable political atmosphere around the re-election of President Trump, but also to the many years building closer ties to Europe since the 1960s”, Professor Duffy said.\n\nHe added: “Some of these international uncertainties, as well as perhaps increased realism in our global standing, mean most would now prefer Britain take a lower profile on the world stage, following Sweden or Switzerland’s example, rather than trying to be a leading power.” \n\nMr Farage and right-wing Tories, including Boris Johnson, flew into Washington this week for Mr Trump’s inauguration - but the British Labour government largely watched the festivities from afar.\n\nThe Reform UK leader was asked by members of Mr Trump’s team to speak at events around the inauguration and hosted a glitzy champagne-fuelled party for the incoming president.\n\nAhead of the inauguration, he was proclaimed “the next prime minister of Great Britain” at the party which was a coming together of top Maga conservatives with Reform UK, Brexiteers and top Tories.\n\nThe polling, which surveyed 1,033 UK adults, was conducted by Focaldata between December 11 and 12 2024.","summary":"It comes after Trump insiders told The Independent that the new US administration believes it has Sir Keir’s government “over a barrel” on trade as Britain becomes increasingly reliant on a US deal","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-ally-us-europe-trump-polling-b2684211.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/22/05/GettyImages-2194586878.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZAzhGq5T-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:09:05","author":"Millie Cooke","authors":["Millie Cooke"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":282895196,"title":"Trump battles globalism in public health","text":"Good riddance to the World Health Organization – more aptly called the Woke Health Oligarchy.\n\nOn his first day, President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from WHO, a necessary step in putting the health of Americans first. Immediately the left-wing media sounded the alarm, quoting globalist-minded scientists at American universities and think tanks falsely claiming that Trump’s move will isolate the U.S. from worldwide efforts to detect and limit deadly diseases.\n\nThese claims willfully ignore WHO’s disgraceful record. WHO was founded to create an international method of sharing data and fighting disease. But when it faced its biggest test – the virus emanating from China in the winter of 2019-20 – it proved to be a puppet of the Chinese Communist Party. WHO pandered to Beijing, colluding to keep the disease a secret and likely increasing the death toll by millions. \n\nAs Elise Stefanik, Trump’s United Nations ambassador nominee, told Congress Tuesday, “We cannot tolerate entities that are taken over by CCP propaganda.”\n\nRoll the tape.\n\nLie No. 1 – In December 2019 and January 2020, while Chinese officials were arresting locals for discussing the Wuhan virus and censoring information flowing out of the country, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus heaped praise on the Chinese for their “openness to sharing information” and falsely claimed that “China has bought the world time.”\n\nLie No. 2 – Ghebreyesus kowtowed to China and delayed declaring COVID-19 an international health emergency until February 2020, after it had spread to 18 countries.\n\nLie No. 3 – The WHO promised an investigation into the virus’s origins but allowed China to block the WHO investigators from talking to Chinese scientists or disease victims, or even examining patient data. WHO went along with the phony conclusion that a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology was “extremely unlikely.”\n\nDespite these lies, the scientific establishment at most U.S. universities and scientists at the federal health agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention paint a glowing false picture of WHO, claiming the U.S. will be less safe without it.\n\nMany, including WHO’s biggest advocate, Anthony Fauci, also back WHO’s ongoing push for a global pandemic treaty.\n\nThat treaty proposal is a confiscatory piece of mischief that would have forced the U.S. to hand over a whopping 20% of medical supplies to WHO in the event of a global crisis. All for the sake of global equity. WHO – meaning China – would decide which countries get the supplies – and prevent the U.S. from prioritizing Americans’ needs. \n\nTypical of the dangerous global thinking dominating academic science, Harvard health expert Jesse Bump says the treaty is designed to correct “the shameful and selfish actions of rich countries in the COVID pandemic.”\n\nExiting WHO is a first step, but the Trump administration also needs to clean house at the federal health agencies, replacing the globalist bias that has caused these agencies to squander billions in other parts of the world while falling short protecting Americans.\n\nYou can thank former President Barack Obama and his CDC head Thomas Frieden for launching an America Last philosophy. When Frieden was asked about his top priority, he said it was eradicating polio, though there were only 74 cases in remote parts of the world and none in the U.S.\n\nObama committed billions to building labs and health infrastructure throughout Africa and Asia, while many health departments in the U.S. were hampered by a lack of these facilities, including disease surveillance systems.\n\nWhen the mosquito-borne disease Zika struck in 2016, Frieden allocated staff and funding for mosquito control in South America but not to the 26 states in the U.S. threatened by the disease. Frieden insisted mosquito control was a local responsibility here. Tell that to a mother in Florida or Texas who gave birth to a brain-damaged baby.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, little attention was paid to how globalism diverted health resources to far-off countries that are not even necessarily allies.

But a week before Trump became president, the Department essentially did the same to its own investigation of Trump. The Department’s hand-picked Trump prosecutor, Jack Smith, quit and released a report on the investigation that resulted in the indictment of Trump on four counts involving the 2020 election and Jan. 6. The report did not have a lot of new information in it – Smith has poured out his evidence in filing after filing for more than a year – but it did contain Smith’s assessment that he could have convicted Trump had Trump not won the presidency and is thus no longer subject to federal prosecution.\n\nWhat else would Smith say? It’s not really a surprise that he would claim, “I coulda won.” But that is not the most striking part of the end of Smith’s investigation.\n\nIn retrospect, what stands out about Smith’s prosecution is this: The single guiding fact of his prosecution – that he was working to indict, try, convict and jail Trump before the 2024 election – was something he could never, ever admit. Justice Department guidelines unambiguously forbid such political moves: “Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.”\n\nThat is exactly what Smith was doing. Many Democrats, including President Joe Biden himself, were angry that Smith and Attorney General Merrick Garland, who appointed Smith on Nov. 18, 2022, got a slow start in the Trump prosecution. Smith indicted Trump on Aug. 1, 2023, and by the end of the year, the prosecutor was racing to get the former president into a courtroom. But Smith would never say why he was in such a hurry.\n\nIn December 2023, Smith and Trump were arguing over Trump’s contention that he was immune from Smith’s prosecution. The matter was set to go to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, but all of a sudden, Smith made what he acknowledged was an “extraordinary request.” He asked the Supreme Court to jump into the case, take it away from the Circuit Court, and decide it once and for all. The idea was that the case was headed to the Supreme Court in the end anyway, so why not just eliminate the step at the appeals court and save a lot of time?\n\nBut why the rush? Smith would not say. But he was in such a hurry that he simultaneously filed the case with the appeals court so they could be working on it in the event that the Supreme Court turned him down.\n\nAnd that is what happened. The Supreme Court told Smith he had to go through the regular appeals process, which meant he had to wait for the case to get through the appeals court before it could be appealed to the highest court. As expected, the appeals court ruled against Trump, who of course appealed to the Supreme Court. By February, Smith was urging the Supreme Court to rush, rush, rush to decide the case as quickly as possible.\n\nBut why should the Court hurry so much? Again, Smith did not mention the election. Instead, he said that the public had a “compelling interest” of “unique national importance” in putting Trump on trial ASAP. Smith wrote that there would be “serious harm to the government – and to the public – [in] postponing the resolution of the criminal charges.” \n\nAll this time, Smith never, ever mentioned the election he was racing to beat. Obviously, if he said, I am trying to put the Republican presidential nominee in jail before the election – that wouldn’t have gone over too well with many Americans. But that is exactly what Smith was trying to do.\n\nPeople noticed. In February 2024, Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who opposes Trump, wrote, “This rush violates Justice Department rules. The Supreme Court now faces the question whether it too will be a party to this rush and, if not, how it will avoid it.” Goldsmith continued: “If this were any other defendant than Donald Trump, the rush to trial – which cannot possibly give the Trump legal team adequate time to prepare its defense – would be deemed wildly unfair. Smith’s timing decisions clearly have a ‘purpose of affecting’ the presidential election, at least in the sense of wanting the American people to have the benefit of his evidence and the jury’s verdict before voting in November.”\n\nIn the end, Smith failed all around. He ran out of time. He was not able to put Trump on trial, and then – worst-case scenario for the prosecutor – the defendant was elected president of the United States. The case is over. \n\nBut Americans learned something from the man the Justice Department chose to pursue President Biden’s political opponent. They learned that the prosecutor will never, ever admit what he is doing, even if everyone can see it, plain as day. Americans knew what Jack Smith, cheered on by Democrats and their allies in the media, was trying to accomplish, and a winning margin of the voters put an end to it on Election Day.","summary":"Jack Smith was racing to get Donald Trump into a courtroom","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/when-the-defendant-youre-prosecuting-is-elected-president/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jack-smith-speaking-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-23 00:05:42","author":"Byron York","authors":["Byron York"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.602},{"id":282895202,"title":"NPR can’t even be factual on Inauguration Day","text":"Even on Inauguration Day, you can count on taxpayer-funded National Public Radio to act like a hive of Democrats. It’s not surprising. As longtime NPR editor Uri Berliner reported last year, he investigated D.C. voting records and found “87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans.” \n\nOn “Morning Edition” before Donald Trump was sworn in, co-host Leila Fadel interviewed Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. After some milder opening questions, Fadel turned to revenge: “President-elect Trump did promise dozens of times on the campaign trail that his rivals, critics, even some private citizens should be investigated, prosecuted, put in jail or otherwise punished. Do these pardons and this peaceful transfer of power that’s happening today put an end to talk of revenge in politics?”\n\nDonalds expressed concerns about preemptive pardons, calling out the House Jan. 6 committee, the Pelosi-Picked Panel: “What this really demonstrates is the fact that they knew that they were doing things that were wrong. No. 1, you’re not allowed to destroy evidence in a congressional hearing. That is against federal law. So by Joe Biden providing these pardons to those staffers and, frankly, the members of those committee, he once again is subverting the law.”\n\nFadel tried to “fact-check” Donalds: “So far, we have no evidence that anything was destroyed.”\n\nThen NPR doubled down later in the morning show. Fadel asked their White House correspondent, Tamara Keith: “Earlier in the program, I asked Republican Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida in the House about these preemptive pardons. And he said, quote, ‘you’re not allowed to destroy evidence in a congressional hearing.’ Is there any truth to the insinuation that the select committee destroyed evidence?”\n\nKeith repeated their error: “No, and this has been repeated by Trump and his allies. The reality is that that evidence has been properly archived with the National Archives. Not all of it was released publicly because it was sensitive.”\n\nDemocrats take issue with the word “destroyed.” Perhaps the word they could accept is the Democrats “failed to archive” their records. Is there a substantial difference for anyone wanting to review the committee’s actions?\n\nIn a Dec. 17 report, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., reviewed the performance of the Pelosi-Picked Panel as chair of the Oversight Subcommittee of the House Administration Committee. \n\nHe found: “The Select Committee failed to archive or provide the Subcommittee with any of its video recordings of witness interviews, as many as 900 interview summaries or transcripts, more than one terabyte of digital data.” \n\nHow much is a terabyte? It is said a terabyte could hold 1,000 copies of the Encyclopedia Britannica. \n\nThere was also this revelation: “Concerningly, of the documents that were archived, the Select Committee delivered more than 100 encrypted, password protected documents and never provided the passwords.”\n\nIf Republicans had created a stacked committee with two very cooperative Democrats and didn’t allow the Democrat leadership to submit their own committee members, the Democrats and their media minions like NPR would have thoroughly probed their actions. But the NPR anchor acted like a babe in the woods who has never located or read Loudermilk’s report.\n\nSure enough, put the name “Barry Loudermilk” in the NPR.org search engine for the last year, and you get zero results – just like NPR has zero Republicans in editorial positions. \n\nThe Republican half of America is routinely abused and shafted by “public” radio and TV networks they are forced to subsidize. NPR and PBS can’t even be civil and factual on Inauguration Day. Their government funding should be immediately stopped.

Naquetta Ricks reflected on the harrowing conflict that forced her to leave West Africa for Aurora. Her family escaped the civil war in Liberia after her mother’s fiance was murdered by a firing squad.\n\n“Behind every undocumented person is a human story: a parent striving to provide for their children, a person trying to flee violence,” Ricks, an Aurora Democrat, said Wednesday. “No person should face intolerance based on their immigration status.”\n\nBehind her, more than two dozen Coloradans — immigrants, advocates and elected officials — gathered on the steps of the west foyer’s staircase in opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, which are expected to include mass deportations.\n\nAs the new Republican administration in Washington, D.C., handed down orders, community leaders argued that the effects would include suffering by communities in Colorado. It’s a state with over 570,000 foreign-born residents as of 2021, according to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.\n\nDuring Trump’s first few days in office, he’s started tackling immigration through a series of executive orders. He declared a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border and designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Trump elevated the construction of the southern border wall to a higher priority, along with the detention and removal of people without legal status.\n\nUnconfirmed reports of potential ICE raids in major American cities, including Denver, have circulated before and after Trump’s Monday inauguration. But as of Wednesday afternoon, no large-scale operations had been reported yet in any city.\n\nTrump also proclaimed sweeping limitations on birthright citizenship, which is extended to children born in the U.S. in spite of their parents’ legal status. That move was soon challenged with lawsuits, including cases filed by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and over 20 other states.\n\nFor State Rep. Junie Joseph, a Boulder Democrat and Haitian immigrant, Trump’s proposals would come at both economic and social costs, particularly because mass deportations could separate children from their parents.\n\n“The prospect of mass deportation not only threatens the stability of immigrant families,” Joseph said Wednesday, “but also it creates a crisis for children who may lose one or both parents.”\n\nIf that happens, an “overwhelming” influx of children would enter Colorado’s child welfare system, which Joseph described as “already under significant strain,” pointing to a state budget shortfall of more than $670 million.\n\nTrump’s policies also could hurt families with mixed legal status, like Cristian Solano-Córdova‘s. Born in Mexico, Solano-Córdova was brought across the southern border at 3 years old by his mother, with his younger sister in tow.\n\nAll three are immigrants without legal status, though Solano-Córdova qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) since he arrived in the U.S. as a child. He went on to graduate from Metropolitan State University of Denver, where he served as the student body president.\n\nBut as the family members worry about their fate, Solano-Córdova also wonders what will happen to another sibling: the youngest daughter, who is an American citizen since she was born on U.S. soil.\n\nConsidering the future, Solano-Córdova said: “She might need great strength to overcome great threats.”\n\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.","summary":"\"No person should face intolerance based on their immigration status,\" State Rep.

Without such benefits, both companies would effectively be operating at a loss.\n\nSome industry watchers in Korea believe the complete repeal of the IRA is unlikely, but say the eligibility requirements for subsidies received by battery companies could face significant changes.\n\nKoo Ja-min, an attorney at Covington & Burling LLP and a member of the IRA advisory team of the Korea Battery Industry Association, said in a recent seminar in Seoul, \"It would be difficult to pass a bill repealing the IRA.\"\n\nHe highlighted that the IRA has driven over $100 billion in clean energy investments and created more than 100,000 jobs in districts largely represented by Republicans. \"Of the top 10 districts receiving the most IRA-related investments, eight are Republican-led,\" he explained.\n\nThe automotive sector is bracing for potential headwinds as well.\n\nTrump's campaign hinted at rolling back federal mandates for electric vehicles (EVs), a move that could slow Korean automakers' EV exports.\n\nHyundai Motor Group, which holds the second-largest market share for EVs in the U.S. after Tesla, could face significant challenges in expanding its foothold.\n\nFollowing Trump's reelection in November, Hyundai Motor promoted Jose Munoz, the company's global chief operating officer, as its new CEO, appointing a foreign national to the top post for the first time since its foundation more than five decades ago.\n\nThe surprise appointment of Munoz has been seen as demonstrating the Korean automotive giant's resolve to thoroughly prepare for increasingly uncertain market conditions under a second Trump administration.\n\n\"Munoz's appointment as CEO is seen as reflecting Hyundai's determination to better deal with the potential fallout in the U.S. market after Trump begins his second term,\" an automotive industry watcher said, asking for anonymity.\n\nRegarding U.S. EV policy under Trump, Munoz said earlier this month he doesn't want to speculate whether benefits will stay or go, saying, \"That's something I can't control,\" but stressed that he was confident the group can \"find a way as always.\"\n\nHyundai Motor's U.S. unit recently donated $1 million to the inauguration fund for Trump, the first for a Korean business, raising speculation of a potential future meeting between Trump and Euisun Chung, executive chair of Hyundai Motor Group.\n\nKorea's shipbuilding industry, meanwhile, sees Trump's return to power as an opportunity.\n\nDuring a phone conversation with Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol following his election in November, Trump expressed interest in collaborating with Korean shipyards, particularly in naval shipbuilding, repairs and maintenance.\n\nWhile Korea had long held the top spot in shipbuilding orders, China overtook it in recent years, claiming 60 percent of the global market share in 2023.\n\n\"Trump's administration appears to be keen on addressing the U.S. Navy's declining capacity by leveraging Korean expertise,\" a shipbuilding industry observer said.\n\nMajor Korean players like HD Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hanwha Ocean have already laid the groundwork for cooperation, securing master ship repair agreements with the U.S. Naval Supply Systems Command.\n\nPossible universal tariffs could also pose challenges for Korean companies.\n\nAccording to foreign media reports, Trump could announce as many as 100 executive orders and related measures on his first day in office. Among these, industry experts believe there is a strong likelihood of measures related to universal tariffs being included.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has repeatedly pledged to impose a minimum 10 percent, and up to 20 percent, tariff on all imported goods, and raise tariffs on imports from China to as high as 60 percent.\n\nSuch sweeping tariff actions, if implemented, could significantly reshape global trade dynamics and add new challenges for Korean exporters reliant on the U.S. market.\n\n\"Korean businesses are closely monitoring these developments, as they could introduce additional costs and disrupt supply chains, particularly for key industries like automotive, electronics and steel,\" an official at the Korea International Trade Association said.\n\nWith the international economic order undergoing rapid changes, there is also a growing call to move away from the traditional export-driven economic model.\n\nChey Tae-won, head of SK Group and chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, remarked in an interview with KBS on Sunday, \"The export-driven economic model that has been utilized for decades no longer functions as effectively under the current trade order.\"\n\nHe suggested alternative strategies, including those involving enhanced global economic cooperation, increased overseas investments and attracting foreign citizens as ways to adapt to the evolving global landscape.

Three tech giants, in their pursuit for global dominance in AI, have united for the cause - setting up the world's largest AI project. It will be called 'Stargate'. The announcement was made by Donald Trump at a special press conference at the White House. Elon Musk, however, has cast his doubt over the mega project.\n\nThe team which will spearhead the ambitious project includes Sam Altman, founder of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son. Nvidia is also reportedly in talks over a possible partnership in the project, however, there is no confirmation from their side yet.\n\nSTARGATE LAUNCH AT WHITE HOUSE\n\nThe CEOs of the three firms joined President Donald Trump at the White House to officially launch the Stargate project. Announcing it, President Trump said this will be \"the largest AI infrastructure project in history\", with an investment of \"at least $500 billion\", of which the first installment will be $100 billion. The President further said that the project will create more than 100,000 jobs in the US.\n\nStargate, he said, will build \"the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI.\" Adding to that, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said Stargate's first one-million square-feet data centre is already under construction in Texas.\n\nELON MUSK'S 'FOMO' MOMENT?\n\nInterestingly, one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters and confidant, Elon Musk, has been kept out of the project.

His post seems to suggest that he might be somewhat irked by this mega project.\n\nAnnouncing The Stargate Project\n\nThe Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. We will begin deploying $100 billion immediately. This infrastructure will secure…\n\nReplying directly to OpenAI's post on X about Stargate, Elon Musk wrote, \"They don't actually have the money ($500 billion).\" In another post, he said, \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"\n\nSoftBank has well under $10B secured.

Being a non-profit, when it required funding, Elon Musk had even funded the project. But Musk left OpenAi in 2018.\n\nIn recent times, the relationship between Elon Musk and Sam Altman / OpenAI has soured to a great degree, with the world's richest person suing the ChatGPT maker. Musk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI and Sam Altman, claiming that the ChatGPT-maker violates licensing agreements and anti-trust laws.\n\nIn one of his lawsuits, Elon Musk has even claimed that OpenAI and Sam Altman have manipulated him from the very beginning - when they 'lured' him into co-founding the company.\n\nIn his latest lawsuit against tech partner-turned-arch-rival Sam Altman, Musk claims the OpenAI case is a \"textbook tale of altruism versus greed\". Musk further claimed that Sam Altman and his partners betrayed Musk by turning the company from a non-profit into a largely for-profit enterprise. \"The perfidy and deceit is of Shakespearean proportions,\" Musk's lawsuit states.\n\nOpenAI has denied these allegations, however, it is a fact that OpenAI recently declared that it will move from being a 'non-profit' to a 'for-profit' organisation - a move that faced a lot of criticism.\n\nSAM ALTMAN'S THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nSam Altman has now declared that Stargate will solidify America's position as a global leader in AI technology. Thanking President Donald Trump at the White House press conference, Mr Altman said, \"I think this will be the most important project of this era, and we wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President.\"\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, cloud giant Oracle, which is one of the partners in Stargate, has roughly $11 billion in cash and securities. SoftBank, the third partner in the project has roughly $30 billion. OpenAI, which is running on borrowed funds so far, is a loss-making organisation - But at the press conference the three firms committed to invest an initial $100 billion in the Stargate project, and at least $500 billion over the next four years.","summary":"The Stargate project, led by OpenAI&apos;s Sam Altman - to build the &quot;world&apos;s largest AI infrastructure&quot; - was announced by Donald Trump at a special press conference at the White House.

Indonesia's mining ministry plans to cut, opens new tab the nickel ore mining quota to 200 million metric tons this year from a previously planned 240 million.\n\nThe news has sparked a modest price revival, LME 3-month nickel rising by 3% since the start of January. Whether it's enough to generate a more sustained recovery remains to be seen.\n\nOUT OF THE SHADOWS\n\nIndonesia has emerged as the world's dominant nickel producer over the last decade.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe country's mined production exploded from 358,000 tons in 2017 to 2.2 million tons in 2023, according to the World Bureau of Metals Statistics. Indonesian supply was equivalent to over half of global demand that year.\n\nThe Indonesian supply tsunami initially washed through the Class II segment of the nickel market in the form of stainless steel inputs such as nickel pig iron.\n\nThat's changed over the last two years after Chinese operators mastered the technology to convert Indonesia's relatively low-grade resource into high-purity Class I products such as sulphate and refined metal.\n\nAd Break Coming Up \n\n NEXT StayNext\n\nOffEnglish \n\n 480pAuto (480p) \n\nAbout ConnatixV555142 \nAbout ConnatixV555142 \n\nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nThe processing revolution has transferred the market surplus from the Class II shadows to the highly visible world of exchange trading.\n\nSTOCKS SURGE\n\nThe LME has listed five Chinese brands and one Indonesian brand of refined nickel since its 2022 meltdown.\n\nThe impact is clear to see in rising LME inventory.\n\nLow LME stocks were one of the reasons for the price going supernova in March 2022. They continued sliding through the first half of 2023, falling below 40,000 tons for the first time since 2007.\n\nLME inventory has since surged to 172,206 tons on the back of Chinese and Indonesian deliveries.\n\nThere was no Chinese nickel in the LME storage system until August 2023. As of the end of December 2024 there were 70,000 tons, accounting for 47% of on-warrant stocks. The first Indonesian metal turned up in July last year and amounted to over 7,000 tons by the close of December.\n\nLME registered stocks are only part of the bigger stocks picture.\n\nLME off-warrant stocks have also grown, while Shanghai Futures Exchange stocks have risen to a five-year high of 35,327 tons.\n\nTotal exchange inventory was almost 230,000 tons at the end of November 2023, the highest level since 2021.\n\nThis is good news for both exchanges. The physical liquidity boost has helped restore confidence in both markets, generating a recovery in trading volumes after activity slumped in the wake of the 2022 nickel crisis.\n\nIt's been less good news for anyone in the nickel production business outside Indonesia and China. Rising stocks have driven the price ever lower.\n\nBATTERY DEMAND STUTTERS\n\nIt's not as if nickel demand has collapsed.\n\nThe stainless steel sector, which still accounts for the largest share of the metal's usage, performed strongly in 2024. Global melt-shop production rose by 6.3% year-on-year in the first half of last year, according to industry association worldstainless.\n\nBut nickel's usage in electric vehicle (EV) batteries has been weaker than expected.\n\nAlthough global EV sales grew by 25% in 2025, most of the growth came from China, where automotive companies are increasingly shifting to non-nickel battery chemistry such as lithium-iron-phosphate.\n\nWestern car-makers are sticking with nickel in their batteries but EV sales rose by a relatively modest 9% in North America and contracted by 3% in Europe last year, according to consultancy Rho Motion.\n\nMoreover, both Western and Chinese car buyers are choosing hybrids over pure battery models and hybrids need smaller batteries.\n\nResearchers at Adamas Intelligence estimate that the global sales-weighted average amount of nickel deployed per passenger vehicle battery was 12.6 kg in November 2024, down 16% from November 2023.\n\nWhile European EV sales are expected to recover this year as tougher emission rules kick in, North American sales face the challenge of Donald Trump rolling back the Biden administration's EV subsidy scheme.\n\nSUPPLY DISCIPLINE\n\nIndonesia has made no secret of its desire to leverage its nickel supply dominance into pricing dominance.\n\nIt now has that power.\n\nThe key question for the nickel market is how it will use that power.\n\nThe cut to this year's ore quotas suggests that Jakarta knows the price has fallen too far even for some of its own producers.\n\nThe trick will be tailoring production rates to a fast-evolving EV battery demand dynamic. Without supply discipline from the world's dominant producer, a sustained nickel price recovery will remain elusive.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.\n\nEditing by Jane Merriman\n\nXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nAndy HomeThomson ReutersSenior metals columnist who previously covered industrial metals markets for Metals Week and was EMEA commodities editor at Knight-Ridder (subsequently Bridge).

It was filled with tech titans like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Apple’s Tim Cook. Even luxury billionaire Bernard Arnault and his family — whose LVMH includes top fashion houses like Givenchy, Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dior — were there.\n\nStill, this cultural thawing toward Trump will have its limits. Despite Melania Trump stealing the show in that incredible hat by Eric Javits, she’ll never be featured on the cover of Vogue. That ship has sailed.\n\nBut I would like to truly test this vibe shift and issue a challenge to Anna Wintour: Put Usha Vance on a cover.\n\nThe 39-year-old is everything Vogue claims to champion. She’s the first Indian-American second lady. She has effortless personal style. She is incredibly accomplished. A Yale law grad, Usha was a corporate litigator and clerked for Justice Roberts as well as Brett Kavanagh before he was on the high court.\n\nShe is the embodiment of the modern American dream.\n\nMost women would be lost in a sea of Trumps, what with Melania and Ivanka looking like leggy generals in a model army. But Usha quietly shined at Sunday’s VP dinner, in her figure-flattering Oscar de la Renta velvet gown. For a dinner at the National Building Museum, she paid homage to her roots in a stunning dress by Indian designer Gauruv Gupta.\n\nStanding next to her husband JD Vance as he was sworn in Monday, Usha dazzled in more Oscar — this time, a pink cashmere overcoat with matching scarf — followed by an embellished Reem Acra gown for the night’s Commander in Chief ball.\n\n(Perhaps her greatest feat is the fact that she does not cover her stray grays, yet still looks impossibly polished.)\n\nHer best accessory, though, was the thousand-watt smile she directed at her husband, with whom she shares kids Ewan, Mirabel and Vivek.\n\nThe three kids —7, 4 and 3— stood on the dais with a stuffed animal, cheeky gestures and Band Aids. It was not only adorable, but relatable: a showcase of Usha’s maternal touch.\n\nVance has long credited his wife as foundational to own success. The kid from Appalachia called her his Yale “spirit guide.”\n\n“The sad fact is that I couldn’t do it without Usha,” Vance wrote in “Hillbilly Elegy,” his bestselling book. “Even at my best, I’m a delayed explosion — I can be defused, but only with skill and precision.”\n\nNot only would she make a gorgeous Vogue cover, but she’d make for fascinating copy.\n\nBut I’m betting it won’t happen. Vogue under the stewardship of Dem fundraiser Wintour isn’t about American fashion or excellence.\n\nIt’s still about naked partisanship. The magazine, dubbed the “fashion bible,” is a de-facto arm of the DNC.\n\nJill Biden had two covers from 2021 to 2024 and they continue to refer to her as “Dr.” (Usha, by the way, has a juris doctor, but I’m guessing she wouldn’t strong-arm Vogue into calling her Esquire.) A portrait of Hillary Clinton graced the front of the glossy in December 1998 with the headline “The Extraordinary Hillary Clinton.” Michelle Obama was featured on three covers, in 2009, 2021 and 2016.\n\nAs for Republicans? The magazine photographed first ladies Laura Bush, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush but they mysteriously weren’t cover material.\n\nIn 2006, Melania was a cover girl in her Dior wedding gown. But those were different days, when Trump was a Democrat and helping NBC print money with his reality sensation, “The Apprentice.” When Melania became a Republican first lady, suddenly she wasn’t up to snuff. No more covers for her.\n\nSure, Vogue gave the requisite real estate on its website to this week’s inauguration: the who’s who, the what and the wear. They covered the basics about the designers. There was also a piece on Usha — an explainer, not a celebration, giving the basics of her existence to satisfy the Google searches.\n\nNext to that was a piece entitled, “These women won — and we commend them.” Predictably, topping the list was Sarah McBride, a newly elected trans member of Congress, followed by a bunch of Dem pols.\n\nBut this leftie resistance, which captured all mainstream institutions in 2016 and cast from polite society anyone who wasn’t a faithful toot soldier, is dying. It’s dusty and boring. As out of style as skintight skinny jeans.\n\nThe Vances are the future.\n\nAnd If Vogue was really faithful to its name, Wintour would shake things up and widen the tent.\n\nBut that would require taking a fashion risk.","summary":"Second Lady Usha Vance is everything Vogue claims to champion.

Hernandez Anderson, the director of Americans for immigrant Justice, said the first thing to keep is that undocumented residents do have constitutional rights, meaning that if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement comes knocking at their door, they have the right to remain silent about their immigration status.\n\nIn addition, Hernandez Anderson, residents do not have to open the door to an agent unless a warrant has been shown.\n\n“If you are detained, you have the right to ask why, and what is the basis or reasonable suspicion, and they should be able to provide those facts to you,” she said.\n\nCassandra Suprin, family defense program director for Americans for Immigrant Justice, said residents should always have their immigration documentation handy.\n\n“If you are apprehended, you have to show that you are here two years in the United States, so documents such as your income tax returns, utility bills, letters from the church, you attending school, having children in the United States. All of those documents could assist you,” she said.\n\nBut most importantly, these community leaders advised everyone to seek a lawyer and refrain from signing any papers without one next to them.\n\nThousands of refugees are currently stranded around the globe after Trump signed an executive order canceling travel for refugees who were already cleared to resettle in the U.S. Migrants can be arrested at schools and churches.\n\nIn addition, the Spanish-language version of the official White House website is gone, and the U.S. Coast Guard is increasing patrols along the Southeast U.S. border approaching Florida,\n\nTo find out more about available resources, go to the Florida Immigrant Coalition website.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

Trump took care to notice that there's one prominent name that wasn't on Biden's last-minute list: Joseph Robinette Biden himself. \n\n\"This guy went around giving everybody pardons,\" said Trump, fresh off of issuing a mass pardon for 1,500 accused January 6 rioters. \"The funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn't give himself a pardon. And if you look at it, it all had to do with him.\"\n\nIn the closing weeks of his presidency, Biden loosed his pardoning pen. He began his spree signings by issuing a pardon to protect his son, Hunter. The former president's oldest living son had been a target of prosecution for years. In a statement about his decision to pardon Hunter, Joe Biden said he felt that his son was being unfairly prosecuted by right-wing forces.\n\n\"From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" Biden wrote. \"Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form... It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.\" \n\nJust before leaving office, Biden issued pardons to many members of his family, as well as Trump targets like Liz Cheney and Gen. Mark Milley.\n\n\"I cannot in good conscience do nothing,” Biden said in a statement. “Even when individuals have done nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.”\n\nBiden did not pardon himself — and it's unclear if he could be prosecuted at all under the Supreme Court's recently created doctrine of presidential immunity — but Trump associates are still speaking of the \"Biden crime family\" in statements to the press. \n\n\"To us, it probably proves the point. The suspicion that, you know, they call it the Biden crime family,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Wednesday. \"If they weren’t the crime family, why do they need pardons? Right?\"\n\nOn the right-wing news channel Real America's Voice, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said Biden was \"guilty of some of the worst crimes of any president... in our nation's history,\" adding that Biden's family members \"do belong in prison.\"\n\nWatch

federal judges on Wednesday strongly condemned President Donald Trump's sweeping pardons of supporters who stormed the US Capitol four years ago in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\"No pardon can change the tragic truth of what happened on January 6, 2021,\" District Judge Tanya Chutkan said in an order dismissing the charges against a Capitol riot defendant.\n\n\"It cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake,\" Chutkan said. \"And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.\"\n\nTrump, just hours after taking office on Monday, granted pardons to more than 1,500 of his supporters who stormed the Capitol in a bid to halt congressional certification of Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nIn doing so, he also commuted the sentences of 14 members of the far-right Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia.\n\nChutkan presided over the criminal case filed against Trump by special counsel Jack Smith accusing him of seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nThe case never came to trial, and it was dismissed after Trump won the November election, in line with a long-standing Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nTwo other Washington-based federal judges who presided over cases involving Capitol riot defendants also dismissed the charges on Wednesday with strongly worded condemnations of the pardons.\n\nDistrict Judge Beryl Howell said there was no factual basis for dismissing the charges against two of the defendants before her court, only an assertion by the Trump White House that a \"grave national injustice\" had been done.\n\n\"No 'national injustice' occurred here, just as no outcome-determinative election fraud occurred in the 2020 presidential election,\" Howell said, adding that \"poor losers\" cannot be allowed to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power \"with impunity.\"\n\n\"That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law,\" she said.\n\n- 'Will not change the truth' -\n\nDistrict Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotel said the dismissal of charges and pardons \"will not change the truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.\"\n\n\"What occurred that day is preserved for the future through thousands of contemporaneous videos, transcripts of trials, jury verdicts, and judicial opinions,\" Kollar-Kotel said.\n\n\"Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies.\"\n\nTrump, whose first term as president ended under the cloud of the Capitol assault, has repeatedly played down the violence of January 6, even going so far as to describe it as a \"day of love.\"\n\nMore than 140 police officers were injured in hours of clashes with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.\n\nTrump repeatedly pledged during his election campaign to pardon those who took part in the Capitol assault, calling them \"patriots\" and \"political prisoners.\"\n\nThe Capitol assault followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 race.\n\nHe then encouraged the crowd to march on Congress.","summary":"Three federal judges on Wednesday strongly condemned President Donald Trump's sweeping pardons
