Of course, Zelensky said when asked in a Fox News interview if the relationship with Trump could be salvaged.US-Ukrainian ties are about more than two presidents, he said, adding that Ukraine badly needs Washington's help in the fight against Russia's far bigger and better-armed military. It will be difficult without your support, Zelensky said on Fox -- Trump's favorite news channel.Zelensky's olive branch came hours after the extraordinary Oval Office scene where the years-long US policy of massive support for Ukraine's fight against Russian invasion collapsed in a shouting match.The row saw European leaders scramble to voice support for Ukraine after Zelensky was made to leave the White House early and without signing a minerals-sharing deal seen as vital to an eventual US-brokered truce.During the ugly clash, played out in front of US and international media, Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelensky, accusing him of not being thankful and refusing to accept their proposed truce terms. You don't have the cards right now, Trump said. You're either going to make a deal or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out and I don't think it's going to be pretty. Zelensky departed shortly after, with Trump posting on social media that he can come back when he is ready for peace. US media reported that Zelensky had been told to leave by senior Trump officials.The president told journalists later Friday that Zelensky was overplaying his hand and should agree to end fighting immediately. Zelensky, however, refused to apologize, telling Fox News, I'm not sure that we did something bad. He did, however, say he wished the exchange had not taken place in front of reporters.- 'Not alone' -US allies in Europe -- already worried that Trump will force Ukraine to effectively hand victory to Russian President Vladimir Putin -- rushed to back Zelensky. You are not alone, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, fresh off his own visit to the White House, said he had spoken to both Trump and Zelensky by phone following the clash and vowed unwavering support for Kyiv.Far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called for a summit without delay between the United States, Europe and their allies on Ukraine.Trump and Vance are doing Putin's dirty work, top US Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer posted.But Russia was delighted with the collapse in relations between Kyiv and Washington.Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev called Zelensky an insolent pig who had received a proper slap down in the Oval Office. Trump's Republican Party echoed the Russians in blaming Zelensky.Ukraine appeared united behind Zelensky, with its army chief vowing to stand with him while the foreign minister praised his bravery. - Compromise with 'killer'? -The meltdown came after Trump said Ukraine will have to make compromises in a truce with Russia, which has occupied swaths of the country.Zelensky said there should be no compromises with a killer on our territory. After he pointed out that previous Western-backed peace efforts had failed to deter Russian aggression, Vance interrupted and called him disrespectful. The session then boiled over into Trump and Vance loudly berating the Ukrainian leader. He sat in evident discomfort as his hosts talked over him.- Trump's 'numerous' Putin calls -Trump has alarmed Kyiv and European allies with his abrupt U-turn in US policy, casting himself as a mediator between Putin and Zelensky and refusing to condemn the Russian invasion.He said in the Oval Office that he had spoken on numerous occasions to Putin -- more than has been publicly reported.Trump called Zelensky a dictator last week and has said he trusts Putin to keep his word over a ceasefire.Trump told Zelensky that as a mediator he could not criticize one of the main sides.However, speaking to Fox News, Zelensky said he wished Trump was really more on our side. Meanwhile Russia's assault on Ukraine continued.Russian infantry were on Friday storming the Ukrainian border from the Russian region of Kursk, near areas of the region that were seized last summer by Ukrainian forces, Kyiv said Friday.","summary":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expresses hope in mending ties with the US despite a heated clash with President Trump over Russia's invasion.

Vance’s disgraceful meltdown toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. In the meeting, Trump defended Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, attacked Zelenskyy, reiterated that Ukraine is losing the war, and much more.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers quickly responded, and Daily Kos has collected the comments from lawmakers, governors, former ambassadors, presidential candidates and the Democratic Party itself.\n\n“What we just witnessed between Donald Trump, JD Vance, and President Zelenskyy inside the White House was an ambush. It was a planned ambush designed to embarrass President Zelenskyy in order to benefit Vladimir Putin,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a video post.\n\n\"It's distressing to see that the president of the United States is walking away from our commitment in Ukraine, and doesn't seem to understand what a murderous dictator Vladimir Putin is,\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said to reporters on Capitol Hill.\n\n“The behavior of President Trump and Vice President Vance towards President Zelensky is shocking, disrespectful, and un-American,” said Rep. Diana Degette, Democrat from Colorado. “Ukraine is defending its sovereignty against an aggressive adversary, and the United States must stand with Ukraine against Putin’s illegal invasion. Unfortunately, the only person happy about how this played out is Putin.”\n\n“This was horrific. This was a tragedy and a tragedy for American national security interests,” said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul on MSNBC after the news broke.\n\n“[T]he United States should be thanking President Zelenskyy for Ukraine’s heroic stand on the frontlines of democracy against the Russian war criminal,” said Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, in a statement. “Former President Ronald Reagan and the late Senator John McCain are rolling over in their graves at the thought of an American president sullying America’s image by siding at the U.N. with dictators in Russia, North Korea, Belarus, and Nicaragua while disrespecting a true American ally—Ukraine.”\n\nSome Democrats pointed out how history will judge Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who told reporters after the meeting, “I have never been more proud of the president,” and called Zelenskyy a bad “investment.”\n\n“Today, I watched in horror as Trump and Vance shamefully echoed Kremlin propaganda to the leader of our ally, Ukraine,” Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on X. “Their disgraceful attacks on Zelenskyy directly advanced Putin’s dangerous agenda and greatly harmed America's credibility on the world stage. To my colleagues across the aisle: Will you continue to stand silent while your party’s leadership aligns itself with Putin? History will remember where you stood.”\n\nThe Democratic Party replied to a White House post and replaced the American flag with a Russian flag, then crossed out the “America First” White House caption with “Putin First.” \n\n“This is not diplomacy. This is closer to a tantrum. Trump and Vance berating our allies like [Zelenskyy] while cozying up to dictators like Putin, is a disgrace but not a surprise,” said Rep. LaMonica McIver, Democrat from New Jersey. \n\nFormer vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz wrote on Bluesky:\n\n“I have never witnessed such an embarrassing, pathetic, and shameful display from an American President and Vice President on the international stage,” said Rep. Jerry Connolly of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. “The war in Ukraine is a battle between dictatorship and democracy. Between freedom and oppression. Between good and evil. There can no longer be any doubt—Donald Trump has chosen evil. He has abandoned our friends, betrayed our values, and taken the side of a brutal, authoritarian regime over a democracy-loving people.”\n\n“President Trump’s simpering fealty to Vladimir Putin and Russia is embarrassing and dangerous,” said Illinois Gov. JB \n\n. “Illinois stands with Ukraine, and so should the White House.”\n\n“Absolute admiration for President Zelenskyy. The guy has balls. He went into the Oval Office and stood up to Russia’s best negotiators,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell of California.\n\n“President Trump and VP Vance's treatment of President Zelenskyy doesn’t represent us as a nation and is disrespectful to Ukraine, our ally that Russia invaded. U.S. foreign policy should be about democratic values—not this twisted protection racket that Trump wants to run,” said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters.\n\n“What just happened in the Oval Office was an embarrassment,” wrote Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois, who is co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus. “We're a fundamentally different country than a few weeks ago and unrecognizable to our allies. For over a century, the United States has stood for Democracy. Today, Donald Trump chose the side of dictators. The world order that was established after the Second World War is dead.”\n\n“Trump and Vance are doing Putin’s dirty work. Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a post. \n\n“Today President Trump shamefully supported violent dictator Vladimir Putin by humiliating the leader of our democratic ally, Ukraine, in the Oval Office,” said Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island. “Before today, America’s foreign policy always stood on the side of freedom, but now by siding with Putin, Trump is leading us into a dark and dangerous direction.”\n\n“Watching President Trump disgracefully use the Oval Office to bully one of our strongest allies in front of the press was appalling. Ukraine is our friend, Russia is our enemy—this should be painfully obvious to anyone in a position of power who supports democracy,” Rep. \n\nSánchez of California said in a statement. \n\n“I condemn President Trump and Vice President Vance’s behavior—and call upon each to publicly apologize to President Zelenskyy and to our ally Ukraine,” wrote Rep. Madeleine Dean, Democrat from Pennsylvania. “Instead of demonstrating leadership, they acted like two schoolyard bullies.”\n\n“President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom and their lives, but Trump has chosen to turn his back on them in favor of cozying up to Russia,” wrote Rep. Paul Tonko of New York in a statement. “Today's farce of a meeting is a betrayal of not only our ally, but of American values.”\n\nDaily Kos is different because we don't hold back, and we're not afraid to call out Trump.

After a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press (AP) investigation found.\n\nThe investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data, and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.\n\n“This is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,” said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI.\n\n“The implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.”\n\n As US tech titans ascend to prominent roles under president Donald Trump, the findings raise questions about Silicon Valley’s role in the future of automated warfare.\n\nMicrosoft expects its partnership with the Israeli military to grow, and what happens with Israel may help to determine the use of these emerging technologies around the world.\n\nThe Israeli military’s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI technology spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the October 7 attack, a review of internal company information showed.\n\nThe amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to over 13.6 petabytes — roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the US Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft’s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.\n\nIsrael’s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a “game changer” in yielding targets more swiftly.\n\nSince the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon say.\n\nThe investigation drew on interviews with six current and former members of the Israeli army, including three reserve intelligence officers. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss sensitive military operations.\n\nMore than a dozen current and former employees in Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon were also interviewed, most of whom also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution.\n\nJournalists reviewed internal company data and documents, including one detailing the terms of a $133m (€128m) contract between Microsoft and Israel’s ministry of defence.\n\nThe Israeli military says its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help to identify targets but independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage.\n\nA senior Israeli intelligence official said lawful military targets may include combatants fighting against Israel, wherever they are, and buildings used by militants. Officials insist that even when AI plays a role, there are always several layers of humans in the loop.\n\n“These AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,” said an Israeli military statement.\n\n“They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they’ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.”\n\nThe Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about cloud and AI services provided to the Israeli military. In a statement on its website, the company says it is committed “to champion the positive role of technology across the globe”.\n\nIn its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to manage the risks of AI throughout development “to reduce the risk of harm”, and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.\n\nAdvanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI’s largest investor.\n\nOpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel’s military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property, or harm people. However, about a year ago, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for “national security use cases that align with our mission”.\n\nIt is extremely hard to identify when AI systems enable errors because they are used with so many other forms of intelligence, including human intelligence, sources said. However, together, they can lead to wrongful deaths.\n\nIn November 2023, Hoda Hijazi was fleeing with her three young daughters and her mother from clashes between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah on the Lebanese border when their car was bombed.\n\nBefore they left, the adults told the girls to play in front of the house so that Israeli drones would know they were travelling with children. The women and girls drove alongside Hijazi’s uncle, Samir Ayoub, a journalist with a leftist radio station, who was caravanning in his own car. They heard the frenetic buzz of a drone very low overhead.\n\nSoon, an airstrike hit the car Hijazi was driving. It careened down a slope and burst into flames. Ayoub managed to pull Hijazi out, but her mother — Ayoub’s sister — and the three girls — Rimas, 14, Taline, 12, and Liane, 10 — were dead.\n\nBefore they left their home, Hijazi recalled, one of the girls had insisted on taking pictures of the cats in the garden “because maybe we won’t see them again”. In the end, she said, “the cats survived and the girls are gone”.\n\nVideo footage from a security camera at a convenience store shortly before the strike showed the Hijazi family in a Hyundai SUV, with the mother and one of the girls loading jugs of water. The family says the video proves Israeli drones should have seen the women and children.\n\nThe day after the family was hit, the Israeli military released video of the strike along with a package of similar videos and photos. A statement released with the images said Israeli fighter jets had “struck just over 450 Hamas targets”.\n\nVisual analysis matched the road and other geographical features in the Israeli military video to satellite imagery of the location where the three girls died, 1.7km from the store.\n\nAn Israeli intelligence officer said AI has been used to help to pinpoint all targets in the past three years. In this case, AI likely pinpointed a residence, and other intelligence gathering could have placed a person there. At some point, the car left the residence.\n\nHumans in the target room would have decided to strike. The error could have happened at any point, he said. Previous faulty information could have flagged the wrong residence, or they could have hit the wrong vehicle.\n\nThe AP also saw a message from a second source with knowledge of that airstrike who confirmed it was a mistake, but did not elaborate.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israeli military denied that AI systems were used during the airstrike itself, but refused to answer whether AI helped to select the target or whether it was wrong. The military told the AP that officials examined the incident and expressed “sorrow for the outcome”.\n\nMicrosoft and the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI are among a legion of US tech firms that have supported Israel’s wars in recent years.\n\nGoogle and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under Project Nimbus, a $1.2bn contract signed in 2021 when Israel first tested its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The military has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centres.\n\nRed Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, and Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in US defence contracts, has a “strategic partnership” providing AI systems to help Israel’s war efforts.\n\nGoogle said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI “that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security”.\n\nDell provided a statement saying the company commits to the highest standards in working with public and private organisations globally, including in Israel.\n\nRed Hat spokesperson Allison Showalter said the company is proud of its global customers, who comply with Red Hat’s terms to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.\n\nPalantir, Cisco, and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nThe Israeli military uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts, and audio messages, an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems said. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel’s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.\n\nHe said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military’s AI systems to pinpoint locations.\n\nThe Microsoft data reviewed shows that since the October 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.\n\n“Should we be basing these decisions on things that the model could be making up?” said Joshua Kroll, an assistant professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who spoke in his personal capacity, not reflecting the views of the US government.\n\nThe Israeli military said any phone conversation translated from Arabic or intelligence used in identifying a target has to be reviewed by an Arabic-speaking officer.\n\nErrors can still happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. One intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.\n\nIntercepted phone calls tied to a person’s profile also include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. However, it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.\n\nSometimes, the data attached to people’s profiles is wrong. For example, the system misidentified a list of high school students as potential militants, the officer said.\n\nAI alone could lead to the wrong conclusion, said another soldier who worked with the targeting systems. For example, AI might flag a house owned by someone linked to Hamas who does not live there. Before the house is hit, humans must confirm who is actually in it, he said.\n\nTal Mimran served 10 years as a reserve legal officer for the Israeli military, and on three Nato working groups examining the use of new technologies, including AI, in warfare. Previously, he said, it took a team of up to 20 people a day or more to review and approve a single airstrike. Now, with AI systems, the military is approving hundreds a week.\n\nMimran said over-reliance on AI could harden people’s existing biases.\n\n“Confirmation bias can prevent people from investigating on their own,” said Mimran, who teaches cyber law policy.\n\n“Some people might be lazy, but others might be afraid to go against the machine and be wrong and make a mistake.”\n\nAmong US tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.\n\nThat relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel’s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, a presentation last year by the military’s top information technology officer showed.\n\nAs she described how AI had provided Israel with “very significant operational effectiveness” in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.\n\n“We’ve already reached a point where our systems really need it,” said colonel Racheli Dembinsky, commander of the Center of Computing and Information Systems, known by its Hebrew acronym Mamram.\n\nOne three-year contract between Microsoft and the Israeli ministry of defence began in 2021 and was worth $133m, making it the company’s second largest military customer globally after the US, a document reviewed by the AP showed. \n\n The Israeli military is classified within Microsoft as an S500 client, meaning that it gets top priority as one of the company’s most important customers globally.\n\nThe Israeli military’s service agreements with Microsoft include at least 635 individual subscriptions listed under specific divisions, units, bases, or project code words.\n\nIn Israel, a team of at least nine Microsoft employees is dedicated to serving the military’s account. Among them is a senior executive who served 14 years in Unit 8200 and a former IT leader for military intelligence, their online resumes show.\n\nMicrosoft data is housed in server farms in two massive buildings outside Tel Aviv, enclosed behind high walls topped with barbed wire. Microsoft also operates a 46,000sq m corporate campus in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and another office in Gav-Yam in southern Israel, which has displayed a large Israeli flag.\n\nThe Israel defence forces have long been at the forefront of deploying AI for military use. In early 2021, it launched Gospel, an AI tool that sorts through Israel’s vast array of digitised information to suggest targets for potential strikes.\n\nIt also developed Lavender, which uses machine learning to filter out requested criteria from intelligence databases and narrow down lists of potential targets, including people.\n\nLavender ranks people between 0 and 100 based on how likely it is they are a militant, an intelligence officer who used the systems said. The ranking is based on intelligence, such as the person’s family tree, if someone’s father is a known militant who served time, and intercepted phone calls, he said.\n\nGaza is now in an uneasy ceasefire. However, recently, the Israeli government announced it would expand its AI developments across all its military branches.\n\nMeanwhile, US tech titans keep consolidating power in Washington. Microsoft gave $1m to Trump’s inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai got a prime seat at the president’s inauguration.\n\nOpenAI chief executive Sam Altman met with the president on Trump’s second full day in office to talk up a joint venture investing up to $500bn for AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a new book, Palantir CEO Alexander Karp calls for the US military and its allies to work closely with Silicon Valley to design, build, and acquire AI weaponry, including “the unmanned drone swarms and robots that will dominate the coming battlefield”. He writes: “The fate of the United States, and its allies, depends on the ability of their defense and intelligence agencies to evolve, and briskly.” \n\nAfter OpenAI changed its terms of use last year to allow for national security purposes, Google followed suit earlier this month with a similar change to its public ethics policy to remove language saying it would not use its AI for weapons and surveillance.

The move rescinds a mandate from former President Bill Clinton that required the government and organizations that received federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers.\n\nDesignating English as the national language “promotes unity, establishes efficiency in government operations, and creates a pathway for civic engagement,” according to the White House. But some activists and organizations think the move is just another way for the president to stoke division and fear.\n\n“This isn’t just an offensive gesture that sticks a thumb in the eye of millions of U.S. citizens who speak other languages, but also will directly harm those who have previously relied on language assistance for vital information,” Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, an advocacy group for immigration reform, said in an email.\n\nWhat does it mean to have an official language?\n\nAccording to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an official language is what is used by the government to conduct official, day-to-day business. Having one or more official languages can help define a nation’s character and the cultural identity of those who live in it.\n\nPrioritizing one language may place certain people in position of power and exclude others whose language is not recognized, according to the institute.\n\nU.S. English, a group that advocates for making English the official language in the United States, believes having an official language provides a common means of communication, encourages immigrants to learn English to use government services and “defines a much-needed common sense language policy.”\n\nCurrently there are more than 350 languages spoken in the United States, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The most widely spoken languages other than English are Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Arabic.\n\nPeople in the U.S. also speak Native North American languages such as Navajo, Yupik, Dakota, Apache, Keres and Cherokee, among others.\n\nPotential impact on citizenship and voting\n\nAnabel Mendoza, the communications director for United We Dream, a nonprofit immigrant advocacy organization, said limiting the language of federal communication will make it harder for people to become citizens if they are denied the ability to speak their native tongue throughout the process. Currently, people of certain age and residency requirements can qualify for a waiver to do the citizenship test and interview in their native language.\n\n“Trump is trying to send the message that if you’re not white, rich and speak English you don’t belong here,” Mendoza said. “Let me be clear: Immigrants are here to stay. No matter how hard Trump tries, he can’t erase us.”\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus announced Friday that New York Rep. Adriano Espaillat, caucus chair, will deliver, on behalf of Democrats, the official Spanish-language response to Trump’s upcoming joint address to Congress.\n\nGeorge Carrillo, co-founder & CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, said it seems like a step backwards in a country that has championed its diversity. He is also concerned how limiting governmental communication might affect U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico where the predominant language is Spanish.\n\n“This executive order, while framed as promoting unity, risks dismantling critical supports like ESL programs and multilingual resources that help immigrants adapt and contribute,” Carrillo said. “Imagine families navigating healthcare or legal systems without materials in a language they understand, it’s a barrier, not a bridge.”\n\nAPIAVote, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on registering Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, also expressed worry this could mean barriers for millions of voters such as naturalized citizens or elderly residents who aren’t English-proficient.\n\n“It will make it harder for them to participate civically and vote, as well as access critical healthcare, economic and education resources,” the group said in a statement.\n\nFurthermore, the organization says this action could make anyone who speaks another language a target.\n\n“The exclusionary nature of this policy will only fuel xenophobia and discrimination at a time when anti-Asian hate and hate against other minority and immigrant groups are rising.”\n\nStates that have English as the official language\n\nMore than 30 states, from California to New Hampshire, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands have already passed laws designating English as their official language, according to U.S. English. Hawaii is the only state to declare two official languages, English and Hawaiian.\n\nFor decades, lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to designate English as the official language, but those efforts failed. The most recent effort was in 2023, when Sens. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and JD Vance, R-Ohio, introduced the English Language Unity Act. Vance is now vice president.\n\nHow many countries have official languages?\n\nIt is estimated that over 170 countries have an official language, with some having more than one language.\n\nMexico does not have an official language. In Canada the official languages are English and French. According to Canada’s Official Languages Act of 1969, the purpose of designating two languages ensures “the equality of status” and protecting linguistic minorities “while taking into account the fact that they have different needs.”\n\nFigueroa reported from Austin, Texas.

Price in New York and Terry Tang in Phoenix contributed to this report.","summary":"As President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States, activists and advocacy groups are alarmed by what that will mean for non-English speakers when it comes to immigration, voter access and other issues.

It's an $825 t-shirt from Balenciaga with three of her faces on the front and her signature on the back.\nThe Paris-based fashion house's statement reads: 'Inspired by vintage fanclub merchandise, the series featuring aged figurative artwork that pays tribute to the Ambassadors.\n'Their printed signature on the t-shirt back replicates a permanent marker autograph on long-loved fan memorabilia, evoking the feel of a personally signed keepsake from one's favorite actress or musician.'\n\n Awkward moment Kim Kardashian squirms over 'erection' boast from longevity expert Bryan Johnson \nKim has long been associated with Balenciaga and has been a brand ambassador since January 2024. \nBalenciaga is Kim's absolute favorite brand and she's made that known in various ways including attending a ready-to-wear show wearing nothing but Balenciaga's logo on packing tape wound around her curves.\nShe also attended the Met Gala with the brand's fashion director Demna and has starred in several ad campaigns for the brand. \n'For several years now, Balenciaga's designs have been a part of my many looks — and some of my most iconic fashion moments,' Kardashian said in a statement when she was named brand ambassador.\n'This historic fashion house embraces modernity, craftsmanship and takes an innovative approach to design under Denma.'\n'For me, this longstanding relationship is built on mutual trust and a commitment to doing what's right. I'm excited about this next chapter for the brand and to become their ambassador,' she added. \n\nShe shared two photos of herself in what is marketed an an 'oversized' T-shirt on her Instagram Story and main page on Friday\n\nThe T-shirt is part of the French fashion house's Brand Ambassador Fan club Series which hit the market on Friday \n\nIn addition to Kim, t-shirts are available with the visages of the other Balenciaga ambassadors Isabelle Huppert, Michelle Yeoh, Nicole Kidman and Thai actor PP Krit Amnuaydechkorn\n\nThe Paris-based fashion house's statement reads: 'Inspired by vintage fanclub merchandise, the series featuring aged figurative artwork that pays tribute to the Ambassadors'\nOver Christmas 2022 the fashion house was accused of 'pedophilia' over their holiday ad campaign that featured very young children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage gear.\nKim spoke out about the controversy at the time.\n'As a mother of four, I have been shaken by the disturbing images,' the reality TV star said. \n'The safety of children must be held with the highest regard and any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society.'\nPublicly condemning the company and then singing its praises soon after raised eyebrows among Kim's fanbase but a crisis PR expert predicted that the move wouldn't do damage to the star's image.\n'Her public persona has thrived off of controversy,' Evan Nierman, CEO of global crisis PR firm Red Banyan told Newsweek in March 2024.\n'From the infamous sex tape that catapulted her fame, to the drama surrounding her marriage to Kanye West, Kim became a household name and brand by making controversy work in her favor.'\n'Kim is opportunistic and a brilliant businesswoman who is too big to be canceled,' Nierman said.\n\nThe SKIMS founder, 44, captioned her Instagram post, 'BALENCIAGA FALL 25,' while looking sanguine on a couch next to a pile of the Kim K T-shirts\n\nKim has other legal trouble to worry about after she falsely identified a man in a picture she posted to social media.\nShe claimed Ivan Cantu, 60, a Morgan Stanley project manager from Westchester was a man on death row awaiting execution in Texas who had the same name as Cantu.\nNow lawyers for the innocent Cantu have filed a lawsuit against Kardashian for libel and slander over the mix-up, saying she also caused him serious emotional stress.\nCantu's lawyers say there are few worse ways to harm someone's reputation than to wrongly accuse them of murdering two people.\nThe suit claims that Kardashian intentionally shared the post, and was 'negligent, reckless and/or violated standards of ethics and decency.'\nCantu is said to have suffered from embarrassment, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and counseling as a result of her actions.\nMichelle YeohBalenciagaNicole Kidman\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKim Kardashian poses in $825 T-shirt with her FACE on it as she reveals new collaboration with top designer\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The historical relations, strong relations, between our people.”\n\n“This is the most important—and of course [we’re] thankful to the president and to Congress—but first of all to your people,” Zelensky continued. “Your people helped to save our people.”\n\nZelensky will have his work cut out for him.\n\nAfter the Oval Office blowup, which began when Zelensky reminded his hosts of the numerous times Russia has broken ceasefire deals that didn’t include security guarantees, Trump cast doubt on the future of the minerals deal.\n\nA White House official told The Independent that the minerals deal was not signed on Friday, and Trump later accused Zelensky of being uninterested in seeking an overall peace.\n\n“I would say it didn’t work out exactly great from his standpoint. He very much overplayed his hand,” Trump said after the meeting. “We’re looking for peace. We’re not looking for somebody that’s going to sign up a strong power and then not make peace because they feel emboldened, and that’s what I saw happening.”\n\nDuring both the White House meeting and his subsequent Fox News interview, Zelensky argued that some form of security guarantee from the U.S. or European nations would be a key factor in reaching a genuine end to the war, given the numerous times Russia has violated previous agreements to end the conflict in the absence of such protections. \n\n“Everybody is afraid Putin will come back tomorrow,” Zelensky told anchor Brett Baier, adding, “It’s about just and lasting peace. We have to be very strong at the table of negotiations.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader argues security guarantees could come in the form of a European contingent of troops stationed in Ukraine, or further indications that the U.S. proactively sides with Ukraine in the conflict.\n\nIt was this line of discussion that set off Trump and Vice President JD Vance during the White House meeting.\n\n“I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,” an incensed Vice President Vance told Zelensky during the talks.\n\nTrump officials continued to fume after the meeting. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described Zelensky as “rude” and “antagonistic” in the face of U.S. goodwill. \n\nThe stunning diplomatic breakdown follows growing agitation in the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has put considerable distance between himself and Zelensky, accusing the Ukrainian of being a dictator and falsely claiming he started the war with Putin, while the White House sidelined Ukraine and has pursued direct negotiations with Russia. \n\nZelensky, for his part, suggested on Friday in the Fox interview that the U.S. seemed to be shifting from an ally of Ukraine to a more neutral stance on the conflict.\n\n“I want him to be more at our side,” the Ukrainian said of Trump, though he admitted that when it comes to ironing out issues in their partnership, “maybe sometimes some things we have to discuss out of the media.”\n\nOn Friday, the fallout continued beyond just the White House. \n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, one of Ukraine’s most vocal supporters with the GOP, suggested after the meeting that Zelensky “either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.”\n\nTop Democrats, meanwhile, criticized the Trump administration.\n\n“What just happened in the Oval Office was a planned ambush, designed to help a brutal Russian dictator and hurt America's security,” Senator Chris Murphy wrote on X. “Trump has become Putin's lapdog, and America's global power is hemorrhaging as America sides with dictators over democracy. What an embarrassment.”\n\nAndrew Feinberg contributed reporting to this story.","summary":"Ukrainian leader said he hopes still-to-be-signed mineral deal will be first step in larger peace process to end war with Russia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/zelensky-trump-white-house-deal-b2707017.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/28/23/25/GettyImages-2202565041.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/95rBR15f-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-01 00:34:55","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":295483078,"title":"Mark Wright makes rare comments about wife Michelle Keegan's pregnancy and becoming a dad for the first time","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Mar 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelensky 'kicked out' of White House after Trump showdown as peace talks collapse\n\nGene Hackman sheriff demolishes key death theory and reveals horrifying length of time star lay dead\n\nNow Keir Starmer hints at climbdown over Labour plans to let tech giants plunder Britain's creativity\n\nThis was a public punishment beating for Zelensky - they must have run out of champagne in the Kremlin: PATRICK BISHOP\n\nI'm a hospice nurse and I'm always asked about the afterlife - here's why I believe there is one\n\nZelensky refuses to apologize to Trump for White House brawl and accuses him of LYING\n\nFearne Cotton moves on from husband Jesse Wood as she's seen passionately kissing TV director 11 weeks after revealing marriage split\n\nHow ketamine helped me break my endless cycle of meaningless sex and find joy... by unlocking years-old traumas I didn't even know I had\n\nRevealed: Scandal consumes Molly Mae's inner circle as best friends Tayla Blue and Perrie Sian who comforted her after Tommy Fury split are now accused of 'ruining people's lives'\n\nPAUL BRACCHI: Did the BBC know a Hamas chief's son was starring in its documentary?

He came to Washington hoping to walk away with a minerals deal and concrete security guarantees for his beleaguered people.\n\nHe left with neither. \n\nWhen he last visited the White House, Joe Biden had welcomed him as a hero and promised to get Ukraine what it needed to prevail in the war against Russia.\n\nDonald Trump's position is starkly different. He refuses to even say he's on Ukraine's side, instead, calling himself an \"arbiter\".\n\nHe's long been a critic of Zelenskyy and his language has only sharpened in recent times, last week describing him as a \"modestly successful comedian\" who had become a \"dictator\".\n\nHe pointedly refuses to call Vladimir Putin a dictator.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Trump was living in a \"disinformation space\" and had effectively internalised Putin's talking points.\n\nIt appears Zelenskyy came armed to correct that, though it remains unclear whether he had meant to do it so publicly.\n\nVance torpedoes talks\n\nWhile there were moments of cordiality between the pair, there was an undercurrent of tension from the get-go. But it was an interjection from Vice-President JD Vance that removed the veneer of decorum and unleashed tempers.\n\nHe's long been a critic of funding for Ukraine and has claimed it's ruled by \"maybe the most corrupt leadership anywhere in the world\".\n\nHe's one of the leading voices of the MAGA movement who paints Ukraine as ungrateful freeloaders who aren't adequately appreciative of the support the US has provided.\n\nSat in his usual spot on the couch, the vice-president remained mostly silent as tensions were steadily rising between the two presidents. \n\nBut at around the 40-minute mark he intervened to attack the former president Joe Biden and support Donald Trump's repeated claim that the war in Ukraine would never have occurred if he'd been in charge at the time.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy then addressed the vice-president, pointing out that Vladimir Putin had first invaded Ukraine back in 2014, when Russian troops invaded Crimea and parts of the country's east.\n\nRussia held Ukrainian territory throughout Trump's first term and Ukrainians were being killed throughout. \n\n\"Mr. President, with respect\" Vance said. \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"\n\nThis is the point when Trump also threw away any pretence of hospitality to his guest.\n\n\"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III,\" he said.\n\nThe interaction between the two leader's was reminiscent of Donald Trump on the debate stage as he campaigned for the Republican primary back in 2016. \n\nHe was aggressive, belittling and was going for the Ukrainian president's jugular.\n\n\"This is going to be great TV,\" Trump remarked as the diplomatic squabble before the world's cameras drew to a close.\n\nZelenskyy delivers a history lesson\n\nIt's been a week of high-level diplomacy in Washington DC. We've seen French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer both separately hosted by Donald Trump in the White House. \n\nBoth offered effusive praise for their host while also making the case for continued support for Ukraine.\n\nBoth Macron and Starmer engaged in a careful diplomatic dance, keeping Trump happy even when disagreeing with him. It didn't hurt that Keir Stamer had an invitation from King Charles to dangle in front of Trump.\n\nThey pushed back publicly when Trump continued to claim that Europe's contributions to Ukraine were all in the form of loans while the US had just given the money. \n\nPerhaps Zelenskyy had seen this and thought he'd get away with similar pushback to misinformation, but Trump seemed unwilling to accept it with the same good humour.\n\nZelenskyy's body language was defensive from the outset — rolling his eyes and shrugging his shoulders at different points, which would have further irritated his hosts.\n\nIt's unclear whether Zelenskyy was deliberately tyring to assert himself or whether these were involuntary responses from a man who's seen his country being ripped apart during a brutal three-year invasion.\n\nWhile some may support his refusal to back down from the US president's attacks, others will accuse him of being an ungrateful and disrespectful guest.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this was meant as a political ambush by the Trump administration or whether it just went off the rails as two staunch leaders — a former comedian and former reality star — lost control of their emotions.\n\nUkrainian future hangs in the balance\n\nWe must look past the theatre of this event to what's at stake. \n\nThis meeting was a disaster for Ukraine. It appears that Donald Trump is ready to pull all support from the country. Zelenskyy will leave Washington with little to show for his visit except a damaged relationship with the most powerful man on earth. \n\nTrump wanted a deal to allow his country access to Ukraine's critical minerals, while Zelenskyy desperately wanted security guarantees. Neither got what they wanted.\n\nTrump's critics will see today's performance as the starkest illustration of how sympathetic he is towards Russia's leader and Putin's designs on Ukraine's territory.\n\nZelenskyy and his country cannot rely on Trump, nor the United States, and its future may now be determined by what happens in Europe.\n\nThe Ukrainian president is now on his way to London for a pre-planned summit with the continent's leaders. The question is whether they have the will and the ability to supply Ukraine with the necessary support to keep battling against Russia.\n\nThe US possesses the world's most powerful military and has provided Ukraine with a large amount of the high-tech weaponry that has allowed it to stay in the fight against its much larger opponent.\n\nWith that support now seemingly over, it will be up to European countries to step into the breach.\n\nAfter being kicked out of the White House, President Zelenskyy will be hoping to receive a warmer welcome in Europe. \n\nThe future of his country may depend on it.","summary":"It was supposed to be a major step towards peace.

Legacy outlets who have participated in the press pool for decades will still be allowed to join, fear not, but we will also be offering the privilege to well-deserving outlets who have never been allowed to share in this awesome responsibility,\" Leavitt said from the podium in the James S. Brady Briefing Room.For nearly a century, a press \"pool\" has followed the president every day and reported his movements, words and actions to the broader press corps through dispatches known as pool reports.

Vladimir Zelensky has overplayed his hand, and he has to announce the intention to make peace, US President Donald Trump said.\n\n\"We had a meeting today, as you know, with President Zelensky, and I would say it didn't work out exactly great. From his standpoint, I think he very much overplayed his hand. We're looking for peace,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nAsked what Zelensky has to do for talks to the resumed, the US president said: \"What he's got to say, I want to make peace. He doesn't have to stand there and say about [Russian President Vladimir] Putin this, Putin that, all negative things. He's got to say, I want to make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.\"\n\n\"We're looking for peace. We're not looking for somebody that's going to sign up a strong power and then not make peace because they feel emboldened, and that's what I saw happening. I'm looking for peace. We're not looking to go into a ten-year war and play games. We want peace. And it was just my impression that if we do that (enter into a resources agreement with Ukraine - TASS), if we sign up, he's looking for something that I'm not looking for. He's looking to go on and fight, fight, fight. We're looking to end the death,\" Trump stressed.\n\n\"But he's dealing with a very weak set of cards. If we sign he's dealing with a very strong set of cards, and then he doesn't want to make peace. It's very simple,\" he added.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Zelensky met with Trump at the White House. Their televised exchange suddenly unraveled into a shouting match, with Trump scolding Zelensky for being disrespectful to the US, and Vice President JD Vance saying that Zelensky had never thanked the country for all the support provided to Kiev. A news conference scheduled to follow the meeting was canceled, and the Ukrainian delegation left the White House earlier than planned. Bilateral talks and the scheduled signing of the deal on Ukrainian mineral resources were thwarted.","summary":"\"We're not looking to go into a ten-year war and play games,\" US leader said","url":"https://tass.com/world/1920883","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 00:30:54","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.648},{"id":295479664,"title":"India, EU set year-end deadline for mega FTA, decide to shore up defence cooperation","text":"NEW DELHI, Feb 28: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday agreed to seal a much-awaited free trade deal by this year and boost technology and defence cooperation — a move that came amid geopolitical headwinds and rising concerns over US President Donald Trump’s policy on tariffs.\nIn their talks, both the leaders also decided to expand two-way defence cooperation, especially in the Indo-Pacific with Von der Leyen announcing that the European Union (EU) was looking at firming up a security and defence pact with India in line with its partnerships with close allies Japan and South Korea.\nThe deadline for concluding the trade deal that would be the largest of its kind globally came over 17 years after the two sides first began negotiations for it.

It completes more than 100,000 compute jobs daily and is more productive than any other computer in the country, said James Peltier, who oversees about 25 staff involved with the supercomputer.\n\nWhat has been known as the Cedar supercomputer since its 2017 launch is set to be fully upgraded by April, after which it will carry a new name: Fir.\n\nThe evolution to be known as Fir, and future advancement to eventually include quantum computing, is important for research, business and sovereignty reasons.\n\nIn an era when U.S. President Donald Trump regularly refers to Canada as a 51st state and threatens to use “economic force” to achieve that goal, there is a dawning realization for many Canadians that unexpected and harmful protectionist measures from Canada’s longstanding trade partner are likely.\n\nWere Trump to suddenly levy large fees on any foreign individual or company using services from U.S. technology companies—as unlikely as that might seem—Canadian companies using compute resources from Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) would be left at a disadvantage.\n\n“I am concerned if any sovereign nation is beholden to another sovereign nation in terms of their innovation and their ability to move forward at their own pace,” said Peltier, who is SFU’s director of research with the computing group within IT services.\n\n“Canada has long been a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and technology, and we need to invest in the local infrastructure to allow that kind of innovation.”\n\nHaving Canadian companies consistently use U.S. offerings, such as Amazon’s cloud-based computing platform Amazon Web Services, which includes scalable compute services, contributes to Canada not having an effective alternative, Peltier told BIV.\n\nGranted, he said, building equivalent infrastructure in Canada would take a “significant investment from all levels of government” as well as the private sector, given that Amazon has invested billions of dollars in its operations.\n\nOther countries are similarly taking notice.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron this month announced that foreign and domestic companies plan to invest a total of 109 billion euros ($113 billion) in AI projects in France.\n\nMuch of that will likely be spent to enhance France’s compute capacity.\n\n“There’s a requirement for us to have some sort of sovereign capabilities here in Canada,” Peltier said. \n\nGovernment money helping to make supercomputer speedier\n\nSFU’s supercomputer data centre spans more than 7,800 square feet, although the computer itself occupies less than half of that space.\n\nAdministration work is done in the rest of the facility.\n\nThe computer has thousands of computer chips, including about 4,000 central processing units (CPUs). There are also hundreds of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are highly prized because they can process work related to AI.\n\nNew chips are substantially faster than old ones.\n\n“We’re looking at getting about 10 times the performance for each new GPU,” Peltier said.\n\n“We’re getting about a 40-per-cent increase [in compute power] on each CPU, and we’re getting about a 50-per-cent increase in the number of CPUs. So, it’s a fairly substantial upgrade.”\n\nHelping finance the supercomputer’s upgrade is more than $80 million in funding, announced last year. Nearly $41 million comes from the federal-government funded Digital Research Alliance of Canada (DRAC), SFU’s vice-president of research and innovation, Dugan O’Neil told BIV.\nDRAC is separately providing nearly $250,000 to fund three research-support positions.\n\nOther money to finance the supercomputer upgrade include $15 million from in-kind contributions from partners, and $24.5 million from the B.C. government, through the B.C. Knowledge Development Fund.\n\nO’Neil said he plans to apply for some of the $2.4 billion in federal money earmarked for AI that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced last year.\n\nExactly how much he is seeking depends on what rules surround getting the money and whether matched funding must come from provincial governments, he said.\n\nOttawa has said that of the $2.4 billion, about $1 billion is earmarked to build Canadian public supercomputing infrastructure, while $700 million is designated to help mobilize private-sector investments to increase AI-compute capacity.\n\n“None of that money has been rolled out yet,” O’Neil said.\n\n“Somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion dollars worth of equipment would fit in our data centre.”\n\nThe future of computing is quantum\n\nQuantum computing is set to be the next step in computing, and it has been a white-hot but volatile investment niche.\n\nSFU’s supercomputer, and standard desktop computers, are based on binary operations. Computer chips have billions of transistors, with each having a “bit” of data. Those bits have two states: On or off.\n\nCPUs handle the main functions of computers while GPUs can perform many smaller tasks at once.\n\nQuantum computers’ quantum bits, or qubits, can have multiple states. While a CPU or GPU chip’s bits may determine something as being either on or off, a qubit could find that it is both on and off at the same time—something called being in a superposition.\n\nAs a result, qubits process data much faster and significantly improve users’ ability to complete complex cryptography, among other tasks, and to do so much faster.\n\n“Right now, the state of quantum computing is as an emerging technology that, within the next five years, is going to become something that is for certain types of problems significantly better than classical computing,” said O’Neil.\n\nHe expects SFU’s supercomputer to eventually be updated to include qubits.\n\n“We’re also an institution that has researchers building quantum computers,” he added.\n\nSFU associate professor Stephanie Simmons is one of them. She founded and is chief quantum officer at the Coquitlam-based quantum-computing company Photonic, which raised US$100 million from investors in 2023.\n\n“We currently use Cedar for quantum algorithms development,” Simmons told BIV. “That research is a Photonic-SFU collaboration.”\n\nPhotonic this month announced that it had made a scientific breakthrough that would accelerate the timeline to useful quantum computing.\n\nToday’s quantum computers tend to produce a lot of errors because their qubits are sensitive and easily disrupted by environmental noise.\n\nThis makes correcting errors vital when using quantum computing applications.\n\n“We’ve been working on better error-correction codes,” Simmons said.\n\nA traditional way of trying to correct errors was through what she called “surface codes”—a method that requires so many qubits that industry insiders were projecting reliable quantum computing to be far in the future.\n\n“Excitingly, there are other ways,” she said, before explaining that instead of using surface codes, researchers could use codes called quantum low-density, parity-check codes, which need fewer qubits.\n\n“We have unleashed upon the world a new family of these codes that are way more efficient,” she said, referring to Photonic.\n\nThe timeline for when quantum computing will be viable has been a matter of debate.\n\nSpeculation late last year was that it was on the near-term horizon, which led to an investment craze in quantum-computing companies.\n\nShares in D-Wave Quantum Inc., which has extensive operations in Burnaby, closed out October trading at US$1.06 per share. Two months later, it ended the year trading close to eight times higher, at US$8.40.\n\nOther quantum-computing companies, such as IonQ Inc., Quantum Computing Inc. and Rigetti Computing Inc. saw similar parabolic share-price surges at the end of 2024.\n\nAll of those companies have seen share prices fall more than 40 per cent year-to-date.\n\nInfluential technology executive and Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang may have popped the quantum-computing investment bubble at the CES 2025 conference in Las Vegas in early January, when he said practical quantum computing use was decades away.\n\n“If you kind of said 15 years ... that’d probably be on the early side,” he said in a speech at the conference.\n\n“If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.”\n\nSimmons said she believes practical quantum computing activity will take place far sooner than does Huang.\n\n“We’re likely closer to five to eight years, when we start to see these larger-impact breakthroughs,” she said.","summary":"Country’s largest supercomputer will help advance innovation, research and AI capacity","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/technology/sfus-80m-supercomputer-upgrade-set-to-boost-canadian-business-10298272","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/250130-sfu-datacentre-017.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 00:30:00","author":"Glen Korstrom","authors":["Glen Korstrom"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":295479278,"title":"Trump administration to slash funding for enforcement of fair housing laws","text":"By JESSE BEDAYN, Associated Press\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has begun terminating grants to organizations that enforce the Fair Housing Act by taking complaints, investigating and litigating housing discrimination cases for Americans across the country, according to a document and information obtained by The Associated Press on Friday.\n\nThe grants are disbursed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to private nonprofits, which act as the frontline enforcement of the federal anti-discrimination law. They educate communities on their rights, test whether a landlord is racially discriminating, investigate complaints, resolve disputes and can fund legal counsel.\n\nOf some 34,000 fair housing complaints lodged in the U.S. in 2023, these private nonprofits processed 75%, according to a report from the National Fair Housing Alliance. The rest were fielded by state and local governments, with HUD and the U.S. Department of Justice working on less than 6% combined.\n\nIt’s the highest number of complaints since the first report in the 1990s, and over half were lodged for discrimination based on a disability.\n\nOf the 162 active grants going to the private nonprofits to do that work, nearly half are slated for cancellation, said Nikitra Bailey, executive vice president at the National Fair Housing Alliance. Bailey added that some organizations rely entirely on the grants and may have to shutter, others will have to lay off staff.\n\n“It’s doing it at a time when Americans want to see an end to the barrage of rising housing costs and a lack of housing supply,” said Bailey. “They need increased support and intervention from our federal government, not a withdrawal from basic civil rights.”\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for HUD said: “The Department is responsible for ensuring our grantees and contractors are in compliance with the President’s Executive Orders.

JB Pritzker gathered most of the state’s Democratic congressional delegation at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s hospital Friday to lay out in stark terms the damage that would be brought on vulnerable populations if President Donald Trump’s administration slashes Medicaid funding. \n\n“Red alert, everybody,” Pritzker said. “It is time to wake up. Get out. Do something.”\n\nAlong the way, he called billionaire Elon Musk “President Musk,” made the case that public opinion was quickly shifting against the Trump administration’s agenda and gave out a congressional phone number, urging people to tell their representatives the impact of the president’s new policies. \n\nEarlier in the day, Pritzker appeared on “The View” in a segment that was recorded Thursday. Host Joy Behar introduced the governor, who is widely thought to have presidential aspirations, as a “firebrand” Democrat. \n\n“Everything that he has done has been tearing down constitutional democracy and that’s what happened in Nazi Germany,” Pritzker said of Trump on the show. \n\nPritzker’s ubiquitousness comes at a moment when Democrats nationally are stumbling for their footing. In an information climate dominated by President Donald Trump and Musk, Pritzker is trying to step forward as a leading oppositional voice.\n\nThis week alone, the governor traveled to Washington, D.C., to lobby for federal funding for Illinois, delivered remarks to the pro-democracy group Democracy Forward, and appeared on media including CNN, MSNBC and on multiple podcasts. \n\nThe Nazi Germany reference on “The View” echoed Pritzker’s State of the State speech last week, which garnered national attention. \n\n“My oath is to the Constitution of our state and of our country. We don’t have kings in America — and I don’t intend to bend the knee to one. I am not speaking up in service to my ambitions — but in deference to my obligations,” Pritzker said at the state Capitol in Springfield. “If you think I’m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic.” \n\nPritzker has long relished playing an attack-dog role against Trump. Last year, he sunk millions of dollars of his own money into battleground state efforts to protect abortion rights. \n\nThis year, he’s trolled the president in ways big and small. He’s issued warnings against authoritarianism and threats to democracy, and accused Musk and Trump of attempting to steal private data of Americans. In January, Pritzker announced a new policy barring anyone tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol from becoming a state employee. After Trump took office and renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, Pritzker jokingly said he would rename Lake Michigan to “Lake Illinois.” \n\nPritzker is seeking to fill a void in a Democratic Party that suffered a devastating blow in November, losing all of the battleground states to Trump. Meanwhile, questions churn over Pritzker’s next political steps. On Friday, he said he had not yet made a decision on whether he would seek a third term as governor next year. The billionaire already wooed the party to hold a successful Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 2024. \n\n“JB Pritzker has shown a natural willingness to go toe to toe with the White House,” said Jaimey Sexton, a Chicago-based Democratic strategist. “It is comfortable for him to go toe to toe, with facts and without bluster.” \n\n“And he’ll do it with a smile on his face because he’s the affable billionaire,” Sexton continued.\n\nPritzker’s attacks on Trump have also drawn Republican ire, including from the likes of Karl Rove, who called him “over the top” on Fox News after Pritzker’s comments comparing the Trump administration’s actions to Nazi Germany. Trump has personally attacked Pritzker in the past as well. \n\nPritzker is also of Ukrainian descent, and at the close of his event in Chicago, he immediately posted a rebuke of Trump on X: “President Trump’s simpering fealty to Vladimir Putin and Russia is embarrassing and dangerous. Illinois stands with Ukraine, and so should the White House.”\n\nAsked on Friday how the governor can break through to the public when Trump has successfully dominated with messaging that ultimately won over voters in November, Pritzker pointed back to the public and noted the response to the early days of the Trump administration. \n\n“The messaging isn’t something we’re making up and selling out there. It’s not a campaign,” Pritzker said. “There is anger out there.” \n\n“There’s been an enormous shift. A big shift from the beginning of this administration only 39 days ago,” Pritzker continued. “A big shift in people demanding that Donald Trump carry out what he said he would do during his campaign and people understanding that he’s not doing that, and we gotta stop it.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO — Illinois Gov.

The shouting match that unfolded in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting between the two leaders on Friday seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping to fend off and ultimately conclude Russia's three-year onslaught. The exchange, which saw a frustrated Zelenskyy lectured by Trump and Vice President JD Vance over what they saw as his lack of gratitude for previous US support, delighted officials in Moscow, who saw it as a final breakdown in relations between Washington and the Ukrainian leader. But many Ukrainians on Friday seemed unfazed by the blowout between Zelenskyy and Trump, expressing a sense that the Ukrainian leader had stood up for their country's dignity and interests by firmly maintaining his stance in the face of chiding from some of the world's most powerful men. Nataliia Serhiienko, 67, a retiree in Kyiv, said she thinks Ukrainians approve of their president's performance in Washington, because Zelenskyy fought like a lion . They had a heated meeting, a very heated conversation, she said. But Zelenskyy was defending Ukraine's interests . The meeting at the White House was meant to produce a bilateral agreement that would establish a joint investment fund for reconstructing Ukraine, a deal that was seen as a potential step toward bringing an end to the war and tying the two countries' economies together for years to come. But as Zelenskyy and his team departed the White House at Trump's request, the deal went unsigned, and Ukraine's hopes for securing US security backing seemed farther away than ever. Yet as the Ukrainian leader was set to return to Kyiv empty handed, his support at home seemed undiminished. As two drones struck Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv on Friday night, the head of the region which sits on the border with Russia, Oleh Syniehubov, praised Zelenskyy. He said the president held strong to his insistence that no peace deal could be made without assurances for Ukraine's security against future Russian aggression. Our leader, despite the pressure, stands firm in defending the interests of Ukraine and Ukrainians... We need only a just peace with security guarantees, Syniehubov said. Kyiv resident Artem Vasyliev, 37, said he had seen complete disrespect from the United States in the Oval Office exchange, despite the fact that Ukraine was the first country that stood up to Russia . We are striving for democracy, and we are met with total disrespect, toward our warriors, our soldiers, and the people of our country, said Vasyliev, a native of Russian-occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Vasyliev criticised the US president for what he said was a failure to recognise the human cost of Russia's invasion, saying Trump doesn't understand that people are dying, that cities are being destroyed, people are suffering, mothers, children, soldiers . He cannot understand this, he is just a businessman. For him, money is sacred, he said. Ukrainian social media was awash in praise for Zelenskyy late Friday, with officials on the national, regional and local level chiming in to voice their support for their leader. The outpouring resembled a recent surge in Ukrainian unity after Trump denigrated Zelenskyy by making false claims that Ukraine was led by a dictator who started the war with Russia - comments that led some of the Ukrainian president's harshest critics to rally around him. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, which was mostly occupied by Russia early in the war but later partially retaken by Ukrainian forces, said three years of war had hardened his countrymen to the ups and downs of the fight to survive. We know what pressure is, on the front lines, in politics, in daily struggle, Prokudin said. It has made us stronger. It has made the president stronger. Determination is the force that drives us forward. And I am confident that we will endure this time as well. Trump's administration cast the heated exchange with Zelenskyy as part of its America First policy and slammed the Ukrainian leader for a perceived lack of gratitude for US assistance. But Zelenskyy's backers in Ukraine praised his commitment to acting in Ukraine's national interest - even if it meant coming into conflict with the president of the United States. Unwavering commitment to Ukraine's interests and devotion to his country. This is what we saw today in the United States. Support for the President of Ukraine, Vice Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba wrote on Telegram Friday. Not all of Ukraine's political figures, however, were as full-throated in their praise for how the Oval Office meeting concluded. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that he hoped that Ukraine does not lose the support of the United States, which is extremely important to us . Today is not the time for emotions, from either side. We need to find common ground, Klitschko wrote in a post on Telegram.","summary":"After a heated exchange with President Trump, Ukrainians rallied around President Zelenskyy for defending their country's interests.

I have never been more proud of the president,” Graham said. “What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again.”\n\nHe said he believed that Americans might change their minds about wanting to “do business” with Ukraine, although an overwhelming majority of Americans have said they support the country in recent polls.\n\n“I don’t think most Americans saw a guy that they would not want to go into business with,” the senator said. “The way he handled the meeting, the way he confronted the president, was just over the top.”\n\nDespite Graham’s longstanding relationship and show of support for Zelensky, he said he was not sure if the president should continue leading Ukraine. \n\n“I think the relationship between Ukraine and America is vitally important, but can Zelensky make a deal with the us after what I saw?

You helped us a lot from the very beginning, you helped us to survive. We are strategic partners.’\n\nWhen asked again, he refused again and tried to explain his own position.\n\n‘We have to be honest and we have to be direct with each other. Nobody wants to finish more than we because we are in this war, in this battle for freedom for our lives,’ he said.\n\nHe said he needs Trump to be ‘on the same side’ and needs him to stop Vladimir Putin. \n\n‘I want President Trump to be more on our side,’ he said when Baier asked if he felt it was okay for Trump to be ‘in the middle’ of negotiations. \n\n‘Trump said he will stop the war and I hope he will. We need to pressure him with Europe.’ \n\nZelensky then attempted to quote former President Ronald Reagan in saying what he wanted in a deal. \n\n‘Peace is not just the absence of war. We are speaking of a just, lasting peace,’ he said.\n\nZelensky also said that Trump was lying when the president said that he wants to go back into the White House and have a do-over right now. \n\n‘No. First of all, we want peace, that’s why we are in the US. The deal on minerals is the first step to security guarantees, it’s the first step closer to peace. We have a tough situation, to understand it is to be in Ukraine,’ he said.\n\nHe added: ‘But I respect my soldiers and our people, our civilians who work and support our warriors. I can’t just say stop because everyone is afraid that Putin will come back tomorrow.’ \n\nZelensky added that he respects Trump and the American people but reiterated that he felt he was being honest. \n\n‘I think this kind of spat is not good for both sides. I can’t change our Ukranian attitude to Russia. They are killers for us. This is very clear that Americans are the best friends, Europeans are the best friends. It doesn’t mean that we don’t want peace, we recognize the reality of the situation.’ \n\nHe also said that his country wants peace and diplomacy and said they are willing to negotiate, going against what Trump said that he wants to ‘fight fight fight.’ \n\n‘Ukraine wants peace and we will have diplomacy, we will have negotiations. It’s about just and lasting peace, we have to be very strong at the table of negotiations,’ he said.\n\nBaier asked him lastly if his relationship with Trump was repairable after this mess. \n\n‘Yes, of course, because it’s relations more than two presidents. It’s strong relations between our people and that’s why I always thank your people from our people.’ \n\nWhite House officials told DailyMail.com the stunning confrontation was not any kind of premeditated tag-team operation designed to humiliate the supplicant Zelensky to try to buckle his hard-line negotiating stance or somehow gain advantage in a scuttled rare earth minerals deal.\n\nTrump had been pleasant with Zelensky to start their interactions – although Trump’s first comment, caught on a hot-mic, was a glib remark about his informal clothing. (Zelensky has underdressed as a statement since Russia’s 2022 invasion of his country.)\n\n‘Zelensky should not have gone after JD,’ said a senior White House official in the minutes after the stunning confrontation played out on television. The official said Zelensky’s digs prompted Trump, 78, to defend his 40-year-old Number Two – and the situation quickly escalated. \n\nThe clash with the VP that kicked off the angry back-and-forth came in a meeting where Zelensky was on Trump’s turf in an effort to try to gain security guarantees in a rare earth minerals deal that Trump says will provide a form of protection by putting U.S. business interests inside his country.\n\nThe White House was looking for appreciation. Instead, some of Zelensky’s gestures got interpreted as if he couldn’t tolerate what he was hearing.\n\n‘This was not planned at all,’ said one source familiar with the situation, denying it was any kind of premeditated ambush.\n\nAs hot as things got inside the Oval Office, there were indications President Trump was relishing the blowup after it unfolded. \n\n‘This is going to be great television, I will say that,’ Trump remarked at the end.\n\nTrump called on a U.S.-based Polish reporter who pressed him on the U.S. posture toward Russia. Trump called the question ‘stupid’. But then later on in an exchange that lasted 50 minutes, Trump called on the same reporter – whose queries prompted Vance to say Ukraine had been ungrateful for billions in U.S. support.\n\nVance blamed previous Democratic U.S. administrations for failing to stop Russia, but Zelensky tried to shift the conversation back to Putin. ‘He killed people,’ he said.\n\n‘What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you speaking about,’ the Ukrainian asked, referring to Vance by his first name rather than his formal title.\n\nThe remark set off Vance – who lectured Zelensky, and then got told off by the visitor for failing to visit Ukraine as a senator, even while many others made the pilgrimage.\n\n‘I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country, Mr. President [Zelensky]. Mr. President, with respect. I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,’ said Vance.\n\n‘Have you ever been to Ukraine that you see the problems we have?’ Zelensky asked Vance, who last April in the Senate voted against a package with $61 billion in aid for Ukraine. \n\n‘I have been to – I’ve actually, I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people. You bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President,’ Vance shot back.\n\nThen Trump jumped in to defend his vice president. ‘You’ve allowed to be in a very bad position, and it happens to be right about that. YOu’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now.’\n\n‘I’m not playing cards,’ Zelensky responded, speaking over him. \n\n‘Have you said thank you once?’ Vance blasted Zelensky at one point in the conflagration. \n\n‘Just say thank you,’ Vance told him. ‘I said it a lot of times,’ Zelensky responded. \n\nZelensky’s first words had been: ‘Thank you so much, Mr. President, thank you for the invitation’ – although Vance appeared to be seeking gratitude for the massive infusion of military aid. \n\nZelensky could have a beef with Zelensky over some of his past comments. ‘I gotta be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,’ Vance said back in 2022, even as members of both parties were rallying around the country. \n\nAnd when Vance spoke at the Munich Security Conference this month, he elevated free speech issues over the Russia threat.\n\n‘The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia. It’s not China. It’s not any other external actor,’ Vance said at the time. ‘What I worry about is the threat from within — the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky refused to apologize and said he wants Donald Trump to be&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Zelensky Refuses to Apologize to Trump for White House Altercation and Calls Out Alleged Lies first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/zelensky-refuses-to-apologize-to-trump-for-white-house-altercation-and-calls-out-alleged-lies/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/28/23/95709263-0-image-m-16_1740784927532.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 00:21:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":295483770,"title":"Trump is bringing diplomacy back onto the world stage: White House deputy press secretary","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air February 28, 2025 06:12 \n\n Trump is bringing diplomacy back onto the world stage: White House deputy press secretary \n White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields joins ‘The Bottom Line’ to give his take on President Donald Trump’s fiery exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the the Oval Office.\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESPOLITICSWHITE HOUSE","summary":"White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields joins ‘The Bottom Line’ to give his take on President Donald Trump’s fiery exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the the Oval Office.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6369462073112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/a28bf1f4-a97f-4b58-a939-e8e66981d61e/3904ce23-b54d-43b6-beb8-605890a4f7fa/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-01 00:21:07","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":295482598,"title":"World News | After Oval Office Blowout, Ukrainians Rally Around Zelenskyy as Defender of Ukraine's Interests","text":"Kyiv, Mar 1 (AP) Soon after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy left the White House after an astonishing Oval Office blowout with President Donald Trump, Ukrainians rallied around Zelenskyy as a defender of his country's interests. The shouting match that unfolded in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting between the two leaders on Friday seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping to fend off and ultimately conclude Russia's three-year onslaught.

The exchange, which saw a frustrated Zelenskyy lectured by Trump and Vice President JD Vance over what they saw as his lack of gratitude for previous US support, delighted officials in Moscow, who saw it as a final breakdown in relations between Washington and the Ukrainian leader. But many Ukrainians on Friday seemed unfazed by the blowout between Zelenskyy and Trump, expressing a sense that the Ukrainian leader had stood up for their country's dignity and interests by firmly maintaining his stance in the face of chiding from some of the world's most powerful men.

Nataliia Serhiienko, 67, a retiree in Kyiv, said she thinks Ukrainians approve of their president's performance in Washington, \"because Zelenskyy fought like a lion”. “They had a heated meeting, a very heated conversation,” she said. But Zelenskyy \"was defending Ukraine's interests”. The meeting at the White House was meant to produce a bilateral agreement that would establish a joint investment fund for reconstructing Ukraine, a deal that was seen as a potential step toward bringing an end to the war and tying the two countries' economies together for years to come. But as Zelenskyy and his team departed the White House at Trump's request, the deal went unsigned, and Ukraine's hopes for securing US security backing seemed farther away than ever. Yet as the Ukrainian leader was set to return to Kyiv empty handed, his support at home seemed undiminished. As two drones struck Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv on Friday night, the head of the region which sits on the border with Russia, Oleh Syniehubov, praised Zelenskyy. He said the president held strong to his insistence that no peace deal could be made without assurances for Ukraine's security against future Russian aggression. “Our leader, despite the pressure, stands firm in defending the interests of Ukraine and Ukrainians... We need only a just peace with security guarantees,” Syniehubov said. Kyiv resident Artem Vasyliev, 37, said he had seen “complete disrespect” from the United States in the Oval Office exchange, despite the fact that Ukraine “was the first country that stood up to Russia”. “We are striving for democracy, and we are met with total disrespect, toward our warriors, our soldiers, and the people of our country,” said Vasyliev, a native of Russian-occupied Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Vasyliev criticised the US president for what he said was a failure to recognise the human cost of Russia's invasion, saying Trump \"doesn't understand that people are dying, that cities are being destroyed, people are suffering, mothers, children, soldiers”. “He cannot understand this, he is just a businessman. For him, money is sacred,” he said. Ukrainian social media was awash in praise for Zelenskyy late Friday, with officials on the national, regional and local level chiming in to voice their support for their leader. The outpouring resembled a recent surge in Ukrainian unity after Trump denigrated Zelenskyy by making false claims that Ukraine was led by a “dictator” who started the war with Russia — comments that led some of the Ukrainian president's harshest critics to rally around him. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, which was mostly occupied by Russia early in the war but later partially retaken by Ukrainian forces, said three years of war had hardened his countrymen to the ups and downs of the fight to survive. “We know what pressure is, on the front lines, in politics, in daily struggle,\" Prokudin said. \"It has made us stronger. It has made the president stronger. Determination is the force that drives us forward. And I am confident that we will endure this time as well.” Trump's administration cast the heated exchange with Zelenskyy as part of its “America First” policy and slammed the Ukrainian leader for a perceived lack of gratitude for US assistance. But Zelenskyy's backers in Ukraine praised his commitment to acting in Ukraine's national interest — even if it meant coming into conflict with the president of the United States. “Unwavering commitment to Ukraine's interests and devotion to his country. This is what we saw today in the United States. Support for the President of Ukraine,” Vice Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba wrote on Telegram Friday. Not all of Ukraine's political figures, however, were as full-throated in their praise for how the Oval Office meeting concluded. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that he hoped “that Ukraine does not lose the support of the United States, which is extremely important to us”. “Today is not the time for emotions, from either side. We need to find common ground,” Klitschko wrote in a post on Telegram.

The Ukrainian leader was told to leave, a U.S. official said.\n\nAn agreement between Ukraine and the United States to jointly develop Ukraine's rich natural resources, which Kyiv and its European allies had hoped would usher in better relations, was left unsigned and in limbo.\n\nEuropean leaders leapt to Zelenskiy's defense. German chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz said \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.\"\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nZelenskiy spoke by telephone with French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and EU Council President Antonio Costa, an official in the Ukrainian delegation in Washington told Reuters.\n\nBritain is due to host a meeting of Europe's leaders and Zelenskiy on Sunday to discuss a security backstop to any peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nTrump has lurched toward Russia since taking over as president, shocking traditional allies in Europe and beyond and leaving Ukraine increasingly vulnerable. Friday's outburst was the most public display of that shift.\n\nThe already-tense meeting blew up when Vance stressed the need for diplomacy to resolve the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two. Zelenskiy, his arms folded, countered that Putin could not be trusted and noted that Vance had never visited Ukraine.\n\n\"What kind of diplomacy are you talking about, JD?\" Zelenskiy asked after recounting failed diplomatic efforts with Russia.\n\n\"I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance shot back.\n\nZelenskiy openly challenged Trump over his softer approach toward Putin, urging him to \"make no compromises with a killer.\"\n\nTrump, whose team said he and Vance were \"standing up for Americans,\" quickly took to Truth Social after the meeting to accuse Zelenskiy of disrespecting the United States.\n\n\"I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,\" he wrote, using an alternative spelling of the leader's name. \"He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"\n\nTrump later told reporters as he left the White House for a weekend at his Florida home that Zelenskiy needs to realize he is losing the war.\n\n\"What he's got to say is, 'I want to make peace.' He doesn’t have to stand there and say 'Putin this, Putin that,' all negative things. He’s got to say, 'I want to make peace.' I don't want to fight a war anymore,\" Trump said.\n\nZelenskiy, asked during an interview by Fox News if his relationship with Trump could be salvaged after Friday's eruption, said, \"Yes of course\" and appeared to express some regret, adding \"I'm sorry for this.\"\n\nThe head of the Ukrainian armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, posted a statement on Telegram affirming that his troops stood by Zelenskiy and that Ukraine's strength was in its unity.\n\nAnxious Ukrainians following from afar largely rallied around their leader but fretted about the prospects of continuing flows of U.S. military aid that the country has relied on.\n\nIn Congress, reaction from Trump's Republican Party was mixed, while Democrats lambasted his handling of the meeting.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader conducted the meeting in his non-native English, and as it progressed he was drowned out by Trump and Vance.\n\n\"You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards,\" Trump said.\n\nItem 1 of 14 U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as U.S. Vice President JD Vance reacts at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 28, 2025.

You're gambling with the lives of millions of people, you're gambling with World War Three,\" the U.S. president continued.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev appeared to revel in the spectacle, writing on Telegram that the Ukrainian leader had received a \"brutal dressing down.\"\n\nAfter the talks, Trump directed two top aides to tell Zelenskiy it was time to leave, even as attendants were preparing to serve lunch to the delegations, according to a White House official.\n\nThe Ukrainians were instructed to depart despite their desire to continue the talks, the official added.\n\nThe falling-out meant that Ukraine and the United States failed to sign a much-vaunted minerals deal that Kyiv hoped would spur Trump to back Ukraine's war effort and potentially win support from Republicans in Congress for a new round of aid.\n\nTrump is not interested in revisiting the minerals deal at the moment, a senior White House official told Reuters on Friday evening.\n\nThe clash also undermined efforts by European leaders to convince Trump to provide security guarantees for Ukraine even if he has refused to deploy U.S. soldiers on Ukrainian soil to maintain peace. Such guarantees are seen as crucial to deter Russia from future aggression.\n\nTrump instead threatened to withdraw U.S. support from Ukraine.\n\n\"You're either going to make a deal, or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out. I don't think it's going to be pretty,\" Trump told Zelenskiy.\n\n\"Once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. But you're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest. That's not a nice thing.\"\n\nTrump stressed that Putin wants to make a deal.\n\nVance also interjected that it was disrespectful of Zelenskiy to come to the Oval Office to litigate his position, a point Trump agreed with.\n\n\"You didn't say thank you,\" Vance said. Zelenskiy, raising his voice, responded: \"I said a lot of times thank you to American people.\"\n\nZelenskiy, who won billions of dollars of U.S. weaponry and moral support from the Biden administration, is facing a sharply different attitude from Trump. Trump wants to quickly wind down the three-year war, improve ties with Russia and recoup money spent to support Ukraine.\n\n\"I hope I'm going to be remembered as a peacemaker,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier, Trump told Zelenskiy that his soldiers have been unbelievably brave and that the United States wants to see an end to the fighting and the money put to \"different kinds of use like rebuilding.\"\n\nUkraine has rapidly expanded its defense industry production but remains heavily reliant on foreign military assistance, while also struggling to replenish manpower as it battles a much larger foe.\n\nWhile Ukraine repelled Russia's invasion from the outskirts of Kyiv and recaptured swathes of territory in 2022, Russia still controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly taking ground since a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023.\n\nKyiv's troops hold a chunk of land in Russia's western Kursk region after a 2024 incursion.\n\nTrump has engaged in a long-distance feud with Zelenskiy in recent weeks, criticizing his handling of the war, calling him a \"dictator\" and urging him to agree to the minerals deal. He subsequently distanced himself from the \"dictator\" remark.\n\nTom Balmforth reported from London; additional reporting by Simon Lewis and Andrea Shalal; Writing by Mike Collett-White; Editing by Humeyra Pamuk, Colleen Jenkins, Gerry Doyle, Peter Graff and Rod Nickel\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nJeff MasonThomson ReutersJeff Mason is a White House Correspondent for Reuters.

As prime ministers and presidents across the continent scrambled to respond, they have held a series of emergency summits to discuss security.\n\nAnother major summit is scheduled for Sunday in London, hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. More than a dozen European and EU leaders, including Zelenskyy, will gather for a meeting meant to drive forward action on Ukraine and security.\n\nStarmer spoke with both Trump and Zelenskyy on Friday and maintained his strong support for Ukraine, his office said in a statement.\n\n“He retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine,” the statement said.\n\nThe European leaders' comments Friday largely did not mention Trump or Vance, but rather sought to assure Ukraine of their support as the war with Russia enters its fourth year. Zelenskyy re-posted their comments on X, writing “thank you for your support” to each — likely a dig at the Trump administration.\n\nDuring the extraordinary meeting Friday in Washington, Trump chided Zelenskyy after Vance, one of the administration’s most skeptical voices on Ukraine, said he was being disrespectful for debating Trump in the Oval Office in front of the American media.\n\n“Have you said ‘thank you’ once?” Vance asked Zelenskyy.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said four times during the course of their exchange that he was thankful or had already expressed his thanks.\n\nTrump then called off the signing of a minerals deal that he said would have moved Ukraine closer to ending its war with Russia. Zelenskyy left the White House shortly after Trump shouted at him, showing open disdain. The White House said the Ukrainian delegation was told to leave.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official said Zelenskyy spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and President of the European Council Antonio Costa after he left the White House, describing all the conversations as “supportive” of the Ukrainian leader. The official, who is familiar with the matter, requested anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nItaly’s Premier Giorgia Meloni, however, proposed “an immediate summit” between the United States and European allies “to speak frankly about how we intend to face today’s great challenges, starting with Ukraine.” She urged the West to stay united.\n\n“Every division of the West makes us all weaker and favors those who would like to see the decline of our civilization,” she said. “A division would not benefit anyone.”\n\nSome posts on X were directed to Zelenskyy. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told him “your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President.”\n\nAnd Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, wrote: “Dear Volodymyr @zelenskyyua, we stand with #Ukraine in good and in testing times. We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.”\n\nThe victory for Merz’s party Sunday in Germany’s national election ensured that Ukraine has an even stronger supporter in the European Union’s largest country. Merz during the campaign promised to unite Europe in the face of challenges from both Russia and the United States.\n\nBut Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party and one of Merz’s challengers, wrote “Historic. Trump & Vance!” on X with a link to a video of the meeting. AfD’s platform calls for the immediate lifting of sanctions against Russia and opposes weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Weidel also met with Vance in Munich.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán praised Trump for his conduct in the Oval Office, casting Zelenskyy as working against peace in his own country.\n\n“Strong men make peace, weak men make war,” Orbán wrote on X. “Today President Donald Trump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!”\n\nOrbán is a consistent backer of the Kremlin and has been outspokenly antagonistic against neighboring Ukraine. After winning the last Hungarian elections in 2022, less than six weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion, he cited Zelenskyy as one of the opponents he had defeated in the campaign.\n\nMeanwhile in Estonia, which borders Russia, Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said the only obstacle to peace is Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘s decision to continue the war.\n\n“It is time for Europe to step up,” Tsahkna said in a statement. “We do not need to wait for something else to happen; Europe has enough resources, including Russia’s frozen assets, to enable Ukraine to continue fighting.”\n\nAnd Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson’s reminded Ukraine of what’s at stake for the Nordic and Baltic countries, and others, if Russia’s aggression spreads.\n\n“You are not only fighting for your freedom but also for all of Europe’s,” Kristersson wrote on X. European officials from Austria, he Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Spain, among others, also offered their support to Ukraine. __\n\n— The Associated Press.

This time he’s urging his fellow Americans to give Elon Musk a chance. \n\nMusk has divided Americans with his roving role in President Donald Trump’s administration. \n\nThe South Africa native’s DOGE cuts in particular have proved polarizing, with his government agency-wide email asking employees to list five tasks they’d completed at work sparking outrage among employees. \n\nHowever, Smith, whose own presidential ambitions have made headlines in recent months, offered a different take. \n\n‘Elon Musk, he’s not born here. They’re making this argument he’s not an elected official, he hasn’t been confirmed by the senate and all of this,’ Smith began during a guest appearance on Fox News’ Hannity.\n\n‘Let me explain something: I get the discomfort. What they’re missing is that you messed things up so badly over the last several years. Give the man a chance to see what he does!’ \n\nThe ESPN analyst didn’t offer an entirely glowing report of Trump’s second term in office but he did insist he would reserve his criticism until seeing the results of the president’s initiatives. \n\n‘I’m looking at Donald Trump, I’m not comfortable with everything that I’m seeing,’ Smith confessed. ‘I’m not comfortable with everything that he’s doing like you are. But the flip side to it is that you are willing to see the results before I engage in condemnation.\n\n‘See, that’s the problem. The partisanship, they’re already showing it. And they’re echoing exactly what they were doing about the campaign, which means that they’re not going to resonate and they’re going to ensure that the Republicans probably win the midterms and then get four more years come 2028 because the same song and dance with the same argument is not going to cut the mustard.’ \n\nThe controversial take is just the latest in a series of bold political opinions Smith has divulged since November’s election. \n\nIn recent weeks, Smith shocked Bill Maher’s audience with his blunt verdict on why Trump won a second term in the White House – and admitted why he feels like a ‘damn fool’ for supporting Harris. \n\nAs a result of his hot takes, which have gone viral, Smith has generated a lot of support for a potential presidential bid. \n\nSmith, who previously spoke exclusively to DailyMail.com about a possible foray into the world of politics, has repeatedly hinted at running on the Democratic ticket in 2028 since Kamala Harris’ defeat to Trump at the ballot box in November. \n\nDespite his insistence that he has no desire to be president, the 57-year-old claimed that he would beat any candidate the Democratic party put forward.\n\n‘If they told me I had a legitimate, bonafide shot to win the presidency of the United States of America, I would entertain it,’ Smith told DailyMail.com in the buildup to this month’s Super Bowl. \n\n‘Because the part that I’m not joking about is I believe I could beat every candidate on that poll. Every candidate that they mentioned, from Kamala Harris right on down to (Pete) Buttigieg and to Tim Walz. I’d beat all of them. I do believe that. I really do.’\n\nIn a shock new gambling market first reported by Front Office Sports last week, he was listed as one of the favorites to be the Democrats’ nominee for 2028, only trailing Gavin Newsom Josh Shapiro and Wes Moore.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, a $100 bet on Stephen. A to win the race would win you $1,241, and his odds of winning the nomination are now reportedly 7.26%.\n\nIncredibly, Smith is currently tied with the likes of Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the betting on prediction market Kalshi, while he sits above Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama, Mark Cuban, John Fetterman and J.B. Pritzker.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nStephen A. Smith has weighed in on politics once again. This time&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Stephen A.

Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nI will say that even though I, in my private-sector days, was a technology investor in Silicon Valley, I haven’t quite figured out how to work my government computer yet. So, 30 days in, I’m going to have to wing this a little bit because I thought about what I was going to say on the morning over here, and that, of course, makes all the communication staff that are sitting backstage extremely nervous because they have no idea what I’m going to say. And before I went on, I talked to Luke, who’s one of my main communications guys, and I said, “Luke, this is all off the record, right? No one’s going to say or know what I said today, so I can just say whatever I want.” And I’m sure that none of you will leak it to Axios, and none of our friends in the media back there will stream it live.\n\nSo, let me, one, just offer a few notes of appreciation. First off, to Maureen Ferguson, who’s become a dear friend of mine and, I know, a great leader in this community. She and her husband, Mike, have been better and kinder to me than I deserve, and my entire family has been the beneficiary of it, especially in finding places to send my kids to school at the very last minute, because I’m a bit of a procrastinator—and Maureen and Mike have been very helpful in helping us navigate the D.C. school environment for our young children. And so, we’re grateful to them. I want to give a shout-out and a note of appreciation to Congressman Chris Smith from the great state of New Jersey, who I know received the great award. We’re grateful to his leadership and grateful for his friendship. And he is a very good guy. So, Chris, I assume you’re out there somewhere, though I can’t see you, but congratulations, man. We’re proud of you, and I’m proud to be here with you. I want to thank Mark Randall, who, of course, has hosted an incredible breakfast for now what? This is the 20th year, I believe, of the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast. And it seems like we’re doing pretty good here with the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast. And, of course, this breakfast holds a very special place in my heart. As Maureen mentioned, I came here last year as a very young senator, not knowing how much my life would change. And I’m thankful to God, but also thankful to the friendship of the people in this room for helping us get there, because I think that we have turned a new page in Washington, D.C., and we are going to take advantage of the opportunity that God has given us.So, I want to say a couple of words just about Trump administration policy, because while you’re certainly not always going to agree with everything that we do in President [Donald] Trump’s administration, I feel very confident in saying that between protecting the rights of pro-life protesters, between ensuring that we have an opportunity to protect the rights of the unborn in the first place, and, importantly, protecting the religious liberty of all people, but in particular Catholics, I think that we can say that President Trump, though not a Catholic himself, has been an incredibly good president for Catholics in the United States of America.Now, we know, of course, the last administration liked to throw people in jail for silently praying outside of [abortion] clinics. We know that they liked to harass pro-life fathers of seven—very often Catholic fathers—for participating in the pro-life movement. And we know that the last administration wanted to protect taxpayer-funded abortion right up until the moment of birth. \n\nOn every single one of those issues, in 30 short days, Donald J. Trump has gone in the exact opposite direction, and I am thankful for that, and I’m sure that every single person in this room is thankful for that as well.But I actually want to talk about a couple of other things. In particular, you know, one of the most important parts of President Trump’s policy, and where I think President Trump’s policy is most in accord with Christian social teaching and with the Catholic faith, is that more than any president of my lifetime, President Trump has pursued a path of peace. And we very often, I think, ignore the way in which our foreign policy is either an instrument or an impediment to people all over the world being able to practice their faith. And we know and as, of course, I learned in this breakfast last year, I believe there was some Nigerian priests who were being persecuted and were trying to protect their flock despite incredible persecution. We know that some of the biggest groups that are persecuted all over the world today are Christians.And the Trump administration promises you, whether it’s here at home with our own citizens or all over the world, we will be the biggest defenders of religious liberty and the rights of conscience, and I think those policies will fall to the benefit of Catholics, in particular, all over the world.But I would say, my friends, that it’s not enough simply to protect the rights of conscience to pursue funding opportunities and grant-making opportunities that protect the rights of people to engage in religious conscience. We also have to remember that oftentimes the biggest impediments to religious liberty have not come through malice from the United States government but have actually come through carelessness.And one of the things that I have to be honest that I am most ashamed about is that in the United States of America sometimes, it is our foreign misadventures that lead to the eradication of historical Christian communities all over the world. And so, when President Trump talks about the need to bring peace—whether it’s in Russia and Ukraine, whether it’s in the Middle East—we, of course, have to recognize that as a policy oriented toward saving lives and carrying out one of Christ’s most important commandments. But I think we also must recognize it as an effort to protect the religious liberty of Christians. Because over the past 40 years, it has often been historical Christian communities who bear the brunt of failed American foreign policy. And that is, in my view, perhaps the most important way in which Donald Trump has been a defender of Christian rights all over the world, is he has a foreign policy that is oriented toward peace. We have done it already so much in the past 30 days, and I’m proud that we will work for peace all over the world in the remaining four years of President Trump’s term. And I think that’s an important thing.\n\nNow, of course, we’re not always going to agree, and I’m sure that there are people in this room who agree, who agree or disagree with some of our views on foreign policy, on any number of issues.The one thing that I will promise you is that you’re always going to have an open door with me and with the president. I think that you’ve already seen that. And if you haven’t, please come and bring your concerns—and some of you have already brought many concerns to me over the last 30 days, but also your atta boys—because I think that part of being a good presidential administration for people of faith all over the United States, part of it is listening to people of faith when they have concerns. And I think that it’s important, and I’ll make this commitment to you, in front of God and in front of all those television cameras back there, that we will always listen to people of faith and people of conscience in the United States of America. You have an open door to the Trump administration, even and especially maybe when you disagree with us. So, please use that opportunity. Communicate with us when we get things right but also when we get things wrong. And that is my solemn obligation but also my request. Because, of course, as I’ve learned with all the—during the campaign, of course, I got Secret Service protection, and now it’s bumped up now that I’m the vice president of the United States. I live in a bubble, ladies and gentlemen. I live in a roaming bubble, and wherever I go, I’m surrounded by armed agents. The only way to keep me honest, and the only way to know what is actually affecting the real lives of people all over our country is for you to talk to us. And so, please consider that open door very much an invitation but also a request. And I will say that, you know, I believe, Maureen—and maybe this is wrong—that I’m the first Catholic convert to ever be vice president of the United States. And I appreciate that. I appreciate you guys clapping because it turns out there are some people on the internet who don’t like Catholic converts. And in fact, there are some Catholics who appear not to like Catholic converts. I’ve learned that the hard way. But, of course, the gross majority of my brothers and sisters in Christ have been incredibly welcoming and incredibly charitable, and for that, I’m grateful. And I wanted to just reflect on that, on being a Catholic, and particularly a Catholic convert, in public life, in the hopes that maybe it would provide some wisdom or some guidance or maybe just some interesting stories for those of you who are enjoying your breakfast. And you know, one of the things that I try to remind myself of as a convert is that there’s a lot I don’t know. When I was a kid, we used to call new converts to the faith “baby Christians,” and I recognize very much that I am a baby Catholic—that there are things about the faith that I don’t know. And so, I try to be humble as best I can when I talk about the faith in—publicly, because, of course, I’m not always going to get it right, and I don’t want my inadequacies in describing our faith to fall back on the faith itself.\n\n.@VP Vance spoke about his conversion to Catholicism at the 2025 National Catholic Prayer Breakfast: \"What attracted me to this Church, in particular, is the recognition that grace is not something that happens instantaneously; it's something that God works in us over a long… pic.twitter.com/jPtcclFOR6— EWTN News (@EWTNews) February 28, 2025\n\nAnd so, if you ever hear me pontificating about the Catholic faith, please recognize it comes from a place of deep belief, but it also comes from a place of not always knowing everything all the time.\n\nAnd you know, I say that—of course, I don’t try to comment on every single Catholic issue. I try not to get involved in the civil wars between Dominicans and Jesuits and conservative Catholics and progressive Catholics. But as Michael Corleone said in “The Godfather”: “Sometimes, they pull me back in.” Sometimes I can’t help—I can’t help but spout off. I am a politician, after all, ladies and gentlemen. \n\nBut the thing that I have tried—I’ve tried to remind people of, and the thing that I try to remind myself of, is that what attracted me to the Christian faith, and what attracted me to this church, in particular, is the recognition that grace is not something that happens instantaneously. It’s something that God works in us over a long period of time—sometimes many years and sometimes many decades. You know, I think that when I was a kid, my assumption is that grace is something where the Holy Spirit would come in and it would solve all of our problems. And I learned the hard way as a Catholic, in part by following the sacramental life as best as I could, that grace is very much a process, that God works in us over time. He makes us closer to him and makes us better people in the process. And so, when I first became a Catholic, you know, I would probably go to confession every other week because I would fail to go to Mass every other week. And you know, things would come up. You’d have business trips. You’d have—you know, the kids would get sick. And I just remember that this process of thinking, “OK, if I don’t go to church this week, I’m going to have to go and talk to some stranger about everything that I did bad the last two weeks.” And that process worked in me a much better discipline, a much better prayerful life. And you know, I’m batting probably, like, 95% of Sundays now that I actually go to Mass. And so, you know this is, I think, one of the geniuses—thank you. I think this is one of the geniuses of our faith, is that it teaches us through repetition, in some ways, and it forms us through a process, of course, that is, I think, at the heart of the mystery of faith: that somehow, by practicing the sacraments, even imperfectly, as I certainly do, God transforms us.\n\nAnd while I am as imperfect a Christian as any person in this room, I really do feel that God is transforming me every single day, and that’s one of the great blessings of our faith and one of the great blessings of following the sacraments as I try to do.\n\nAnd so, thank you all for welcoming a convert into your ranks—because I certainly benefit from it, and my family does, too. You know, the second thing that I take from my Catholic faith is a recognition that the deepest and most important things are not material. They’re not GDP. They’re not the numbers that we see in the stock market. The real measure of health in a society is the safety and stability and the health of our families and of our people. We are in the business, of course—we are in the business, of President Trump’s administration, of producing prosperity, but that prosperity is a means to an end, and that end is the flourishing, hopefully, of the life of every single citizen in the United States of America. That’s why we care about these things. And you know, I often remind myself that, you know, there have been times in the past, where, you know, the GDP numbers were maybe moving in the right direction, where the stock market was moving in the right direction, but the United States of America was losing life expectancy. I think that what the Catholic Church calls me to do is to say that if the stock market is doing OK but people are literally dying and losing years off of their life then we have to do better as a country. Catholicism, Christianity at its root, I think, teaches our public officials to care about the deep things, the important things: the protection of the unborn, the flourishing of our children, and the health and the sanctity of our marriages. \n\nAnd, yes, we care about prosperity, but we care about prosperity so that we can promote the common good of every citizen in the United States of America. And when I think about the deep things, the things that really matter, there was something really amazing that happened to me in November of 2024. All my friends were there. All my family was there. We were gathered together in a great moment of celebration. And, of course, I’m talking about when my 7-year-old chose to be baptized into the Christian faith. And Ewan is at school right now, so he won’t see this, but as amazing as it was to win the election, of course, in November of 2024, and as amazing as it was to know that President Trump would become president again and would get to accomplish so many good things for the American people, the thing that I was most excited about in November of 2024 is that, the week after we won the election, my son chose to be baptized in the Christian faith. Now, here’s the basic idea. And for those of you, of course, you all mostly, are cradle Catholics, I assume, and typically we do water baptism of infants in the Christian—in the Catholic Church very, very early on. But as many of you know, I am part of an interfaith marriage. My wife, though she comes to church with us almost every single Sunday, she is not Catholic herself. And so, the bargain that we have struck is that we will raise our kids Catholic, but we will let them choose the moment that they want to ultimately become baptized, and if that’s terrible sacrilege, blame the Dominicans, because they’re the ones who came up with this scheme.\n\nBut my 7-year-old elected to become baptized, and it was the proudest moment, maybe, that I’ve ever had as a father. And he took it very seriously, and he wanted to know, “What are the right things to say, Dad? What do I need to do? What does this mean? Why is this important?” And it was an amazing thing for me to see my 7-year-old working through these things himself.\n\nAnd when I talk about the deep things, the important things, that’s what I’m talking about. Of course, we care about our economic indicators. And of course, we care about the wages of our citizens. We care about those things because when our people are doing better, they can have the kinds of moments that promote the kind of flourishing that all of us believe is the very core of a good human life. And that, of course, in my case, was watching my little 7-year-old son become baptized. And so, while, again, I will never be perfect, I will always try to remind myself that the goal of our public policy is to promote the common good, and I will fight for that every single day that I am a public official. And that brings me to the final observation I’d like to make as a Christian—a Catholic convert in public life—is that, you know, sometimes the bishops don’t like what I say. And I’m sure, by the way, sometimes they’re right and sometimes they’re wrong. My goal is not to litigate when I’m right and when they’re wrong or vice versa. My goal is to maybe articulate the way that I think about being a Christian in public life when you also have religious leaders in public life who have a spiritual duty to speak on the issues of the day. And the way that I try to think about it is: The Catholic Church is a kind of technology. It’s a technology that was developed 2,000 years ago, and it’s coming into contact with a technology that’s about 10 years old, 20 years old, and that’s, of course, social media. And what I try to remind myself of is that the clergy are important spiritual leaders. You’ll sometimes hear people say, “Well, we’ll let, you know, the clergy talk about matters of the church, but we can ignore them when it comes to matters of public policy.” I think that’s the wrong way to look at it. That’s certainly not the right way to look at it for me. But what I try to remind myself of is that we are not called, as Christians, to obsess over every social media controversy that implicates the Catholic Church. Whether it involves a clergy or a bishop or the Holy Father himself, I think that we should, could, frankly, take a page out of the books of our grandparents who respected our clergy, who looked to them for guidance but didn’t obsess and fight over every single word that came out of their mouth and entered social media. I don’t think that’s good. And I’m not, again, counseling all of you, but I don’t think it’s good for us as Christians to constantly fight with one another over every single controversy in the church. Sometimes we should let this stuff play out a little bit and try to live our faith as best we can under the dictates of our faith and under the dictates of our spiritual leaders but not hold them to the standards of social media influencers, because they’re not. And I think, and that brings me, of course, to the last point that I want to make, which is that, as you’ve probably seen publicly, the Holy Father, Pope Francis, has criticized some of our policies when it comes to immigration. And again, my goal here is not to litigate with him or any other clergy member about who’s right and who’s wrong. You obviously know my views, and I will speak to them consistently because I think that I have to do it because it serves the best interest of the American people. What I want to do instead is remind—and I talk to a lot of conservative Catholics, and I talk to progressive Catholics too, and I think that sometimes a lot of conservative Catholics are too preoccupied with their political criticisms of a particular clergy member or the leader of the Catholic Church. And of course, I’m not telling you that you’re wrong, because sometimes I even agree with you. I think that what I would say is that it’s not in the best interest of any of us, again, to treat the religious leaders of our faith as just another social media influencer. And I think, frankly, that goes in both ways. If I can be so bold, I think it’s incumbent upon our religious leaders to recognize that in the era of social media, people will hang on every single word that they utter, even if that wasn’t their intention and even if a given declaration wasn’t meant for consumption in the social media age.\n\nBut every day since I heard of Pope Francis’ illness, I say a prayer for the Holy Father, because while, yes, I was certainly surprised when he criticized our immigration policy in the way that he has, I also know that the pope, I believe that the pope is fundamentally a person who cares about the flock of Christians under his leadership. And he’s a man who cares about the spiritual direction of the faith. And I say this because every day me and my children have said a prayer for the Holy Father, and we pray for his health and we pray for his comfort as he deals with what appears to be a pretty serious health crisis. \n\nAnd while, yes, some of our media and some of our social media influencers and even some of us fellow Catholics, I think, try to bring the Holy Father into every culture war battle in American politics, I will always remember the Holy Father—whether he makes its way through this illness, and I certainly hope that he does—I will always remember the Holy Father in March of 2020, at a time of incredible stress for, really, the entire world. Remember, that was the height of the COVID pandemic. None of us knew how bad it was. We heard reports from Italy of people dying en masse on ventilators. And personally, I had just, a few weeks earlier, welcomed our second child into the world.And so, when the COVID pandemic happened, I had a 3-week-old baby at home, and I went to Dick’s Sporting Goods, and I bought 900 rounds of ammunition—and then I went to Walmart and I bought two bags of rice, and I sat at home with my bags of rice and my 900 rounds of ammunition and said, “All right, we’re just going to wait this thing out.” And into that void, when a lot of people didn’t know how bad it was—and, of course, thankfully, the pandemic was not as bad as the very worst predictions—it was quite bad, but not as bad as the very worst predictions—I think all of us can remember that moment of the Holy Father standing in an empty St. Peter’s Square, holding the Eucharist above his head, and giving a sermon that I return to consistently, because it was incredibly meaningful to me at the time, and it remains meaningful today. And so, if you’ll forgive me, I hope that you’ll be okay with me reading just an excerpt of the homily that Pope Francis gave: “When evening had come”—which, of course, is from Mark chapter 4, verse 35. The Gospel passage we have heard begins like this. For weeks now, it has been evening. Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets, and our cities. It has taken over our lives, filling everything with a deafening silence and a distressing void that stops everything as it passes by. We feel it in the air. We notice it in people’s gestures. Their glances give them away. We find ourselves afraid and lost. Like the disciples in the Gospel, we were caught off guard by an unexpected, turbulent storm. We have realized that we are on the same boat, all of us, fragile and disoriented, but, at the same time, important and needed, all of us called to row together, each of us in need of comforting the other. On this boat are all of us. Just like those disciples, who spoke anxiously with one voice, saying, “We are perishing.” So, we too have realized that we cannot go on thinking of ourselves, but only together can we do this. It is easy to recognize ourselves in this story. What is harder to understand is Jesus’ attitude. While his disciples are quite naturally alarmed and desperate, he is in the stern, in the part of the boat that sinks first. And what does he do? In spite of the tempest, he sleeps on soundly, trusting in the Father. This is the only time in the Gospels we see Jesus sleeping. When he wakes up, after calming the wind and the waters, he turns to the disciples in a reproaching voice: “Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?” Let us try to understand. In what does the lack of the disciples’ faith consist, as contrasted with Jesus’ trust? They had not stopped believing in him; in fact, they called on him. But we see how they call on him: “Teacher, do you not care if we perish? Do you not care?” They think that Jesus is not interested in them, does not care about them. One of the things that hurts us and our families most when we hear said is: “Do you not care about me?” It is a phrase that wounds and unleashes storms in our hearts. It would have shaken Jesus too, because he, more than anyone, cares about us. Indeed, once they have called on him, he saves his disciples from their discouragement. The storm exposes our vulnerability and uncovers those false and superfluous certainties around which we have constructed our daily schedules, our projects, our habits, and priorities. It shows us how we have allowed to become dull and feeble the very things that nourish, sustain, and strengthen our lives and our communities. The tempest lays bare all our prepackaged ideas and forgetfulness of what nourishes our people’s souls; all those attempts that anesthetize us with ways of thinking and acting that supposably “save” us but instead prove incapable of putting us in touch with our roots and keeping alive the memory of those who have gone before us. We deprive ourselves of the antibodies we need to confront adversity. And I think that is an amazing phrase, that what we do so often in our lives, in our public life and our private lives, is, “We deprive ourselves of the antibodies we need to confront adversity.” And that is how I will always remember the Holy Father, is as a great pastor, as a man who can speak the truth of the faith in a very profound way at a moment of great crisis. And so, I would ask all of us, if you would join me in this prayer for Pope Francis. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Almighty and generous God, we thank you for your charity. Please grant your mercy upon Pope Francis so he may be restored from sickness and guide us in watchful care. We pray that you bless our Holy Father’s doctors, nurses, and medical staff with wisdom and capability so that you may work through them to renew the health of your shepherd through Christ our Lord. Amen. And I think that, as I conclude my remarks here, I’m not ever going to be perfect, I’m not ever going to get everything right, but what I will try to do is to try to be the kind of leader who hopes—who helps our shared civilization build those true antibodies against adversity.

Zelenskyy, who left Washington DC early following the dispute, was swiftly backed by European allies who reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine in the ongoing war against Russia.Trump had accused Zelenskyy of \"disrespecting America\" in a Truth Social post minutes after their exchange. European leaders stand by UkraineEU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas was among the first to respond, vowing to step up aid. “We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the aggressor,” she wrote in a post on X. She also noted, “The free world needs a new leader,” adding that Europe must rise to the challenge.— kajakallas (@kajakallas) Germany’s Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz also expressed his backing, stating on X, “We stand with Ukraine in good and in testing times.” Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz reinforced this stance, writing on X, “Ukraine can rely on Germany and on Europe.”— _FriedrichMerz (@_FriedrichMerz) French President Emmanuel Macron made it clear where he stood, stating, “There is one attacker: Russia. There is one people under attack: Ukraine.” His remarks were made while speaking to reporters in Portugal and later reiterated on X.— EmmanuelMacron (@EmmanuelMacron) European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed the support, addressing Zelenskyy directly in a post on X. “Your dignity honours the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless,” she wrote, promising continued cooperation towards “a just and lasting peace.”— vonderleyen (@vonderleyen) Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk reassured Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people that they were not alone, posting on X, “Dear President Zelenskyy, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also expressed solidarity, writing on X, “Ukraine, Spain stands with you” in Spanish, English, and Ukrainian.— donaldtusk (@donaldtusk) Germany’s outgoing foreign minister Annalena Baerbock reaffirmed Berlin’s support, stating on X, “Ukraine is not alone. Germany together with our European allies stands united alongside Ukraine – and against the Russian aggression.”— ABaerbock (@ABaerbock) Other European leaders also weighed in.

You are not only fighting for your freedom but also for all of Europe’s.

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on X, “President Zelenskyy is right. Peace without guarantees is not possible.” Ruslan Stefanchuk, Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, declared on X, “Full support for the President of Ukraine!

Trump reportedly told Zelenskyy, “You’re not acting at all thankful. It’s not a nice thing,” while also warning, “You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III.”After Zelenskyy pushed for stronger security guarantees, Trump broke off talks and later posted on Truth Social: “I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE.”Zelenskyy, however, appeared to express sarcastic gratitude to the American people after the failed talks, posting on X: “Thank you, America. Thank you for your support. Thank you for this visit. Thank you, US President, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.”— ZelenskyyUa (@ZelenskyyUa) As tensions between Kyiv and Washington grow after the White House clash, European leaders are voicing strong support for Ukraine. Many have reaffirmed their commitment to backing Ukraine both militarily and politically, stressing that the country is not alone in its fight against Russian aggression.","summary":"A heated exchange between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy leads to the collapse of a crucial minerals deal.

Celebrations in the world's most populous Muslim-majority country range from colourful nighttime parades and cleaning family graves to preparing food for predawn breakfasts and elaborate post-sundown meals known as “iftars”.

Each region in the vast archipelago nation of 17,000 islands has its own way to mark the start of Ramzan, when Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual intercourse from sunrise until sunset for the whole month. Even a tiny sip of water or a puff of smoke is enough to invalidate the fast. At night, family and friends gather and feast in a festive atmosphere.

Religious Affairs Minister Nasaruddin Umar announced Friday that Ramzan will begin on Saturday after the sighting of the crescent moon was confirmed by Islamic astronomy observers in Indonesia's westernmost province of Aceh. Shortly after the announcement, mosques flooded with devotees offering evening prayers known as “tarawih” on the first eve of Ramzan. In Jakarta's Istiqlal Grand Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, tens of thousands of worshippers crammed together shoulder-to-shoulder. The fasting is aimed at bringing the faithful closer to God and reminding them of the suffering of the poor. Muslims are expected to strictly observe daily prayers and engage in heightened religious contemplation. They are also urged to refrain from gossip, fighting or cursing during the holy month. Flares, drums and tradition Samsul Anwar, his wife and their 8-year-old nephew were among hundreds of people taking part in a torchlight parade along the streets of their neighbourhood in Tangerang, a city just outside the capital of Jakarta, on Wednesday after evening prayers. They carried torches, lit flares and played Islamic songs accompanied by the beat of rebana, the Arabic handheld percussion instrument, as they walked along the cramped streets of the densely populated neighbourhood. “Every year we welcome Ramzan with a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation,” said Anwar. Chinese Indonesian communities also participated in the parade by performing the vibrant “barongsai” or “lion dance,” a prominent part of Chinese New Year celebration, to the sound of drums and trumpets. The barongsai performance “was also held to show unity between the religious communities of Chinese and Muslim, aiming to increase religious tolerance,” Anwar said. Cost of living anxieties It's also an exciting time for business. Hotels, restaurants and cafes all prepare special Ramzan promotions, and shoppers flock to shopping centres for new clothes and home decorations for the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramzan. Children often receive new clothes and gifts. However, some Muslims worry how they will cope financially during Ramzan this year amid soaring prices. “Everything to do with cooking is rising (in cost) day by day,” said Asih Mulyawati, a mother of two who lives in Jakarta's outskirt of Tangerang. “I worry this situation will impact Ramzan celebrations.” Despite soaring food prices in the past month, popular markets such as Tanah Abang in Jakarta were teeming with shoppers buying clothes, shoes, cookies and sweets before the holiday. Indonesia's Trade Ministry has said prices of imported staple foods including wheat, sugar, beef and soybeans have increased sharply this year as a result of rising global commodity prices and supply chain disruptions. But many people say the rise in prices not only impacts imported foods but also local commodities like rice, eggs, chili, palm oil and onions. Many also blame the government for rising gas and electricity prices. “The current gloomy economic situation and extreme weather recently also contribute to the soaring prices and the weakening of people's purchasing power,” said Heru Tatok, a trader in Jakarta's Pasar Senen market.

I've not had to say \"No\" to somebody in telly. Newspapers, yes. Very much so, I have had to stand up for myself. \n'I'm against cancelling people. You've got to hear their point of view, so you can go, \"They're being an absolute t**t, what a load of old twaddle.\" You should never be cancelled for something that you believe, unless it is something heinous.' \nShe added: 'I may think you're the biggest w***er that ever roamed the earth, but you should be allowed to express your opinion. If we only talked to people that we agreed with, we'd be living in an echo chamber, all patting each other on the back saying, \"How smug are we?\"'\nLorraine also defended her working hours after being mocked online for her absences from her ITV show, with other presenters often stepping in.\nAnd after noticing her missing on numerous occasions, one mysterious person decided to create an X profile named LorraineKWatch to track how many times the host, 65, fronted her own show for an entire year.\nHitting back at her critics, she insisted she's been 'working five days a week for 40 years'.\nLorraine explained: 'Not presenting on Fridays gives me a chance to breathe and brings me in line with everyone else. \n'Phil and Holly used to do four days, lovely Ben and Cat do four.

It was a wee bit of a wrench.'\nShe admitted: 'Sometimes you've just got to take a step back in order to appreciate what you've got, and it has certainly made life a lot easier with my mum not being well. \n'She has this horrible kidney problem, but is doing OK now. As far as looking after her goes, also with Billie and then the writing, it has been a good change.'\nShe gushed: 'I couldn't give up the show because I love it – honestly, I'd do it until I was 95!

It's too toxic and life's too short. I'm 65. \n'It doesn't bother me if somebody says horrible things about me, but if I was starting out in my career, the kind of person I was in my late 20s and 30s, I'd be destroyed.'\nLorraine spoke out about the backlash she received online last year after she discovered the X account criticising her work ethic.\nSpeaking on Woman's Hour with host Anita Rani, Lorraine admitted she was aware of the account, as she quipped: 'I know, the amount of space that I occupy in people's heads is quite bizarre.'\nInsisting the account doesn't bother her, she explained: 'Its fine. I don't mind, I don't care. I probably would have cared before but I really don't now it's absolutely fine.'\n\nThe April issue of Woman&Home is on sale 6 March 2025\nThe star went on to explain the real reason she had been missing from a number of shows was because she was taking some time off to care for her mother who is unwell. \nLorraine continued: 'But you should never comment on things like that if you don't know what is going on in people's lives but I am having to take quite a few Fridays off because my mum is really not well.\n'So I can go home now and spend some more time with her and help her a bit more than I have been able to. So that is happening just now but that will change.\n'I have been doing five days a week for 40 years so I am just taking a wee bit of time off and obviously this week is half term which is why I am able to talk to you!'\nThe Island Swimmer by Lorraine Kelly is out in paperback on 13 March and the April issue of Woman&Home is on sale 6 March 2025\nGregg WallaceLorraine KellyITV\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLorraine Kelly insists no one should 'ever be cancelled' including Gregg Wallace as she weighs in on criticism over her four day working week\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The size of the sum handed over is not, of course, the crucial issue.\n\nIt’s simply implausible that some of the cash didn’t end up with the death cult. \n\nThe BBC might be reluctant to call it a terrorist organisation, but the group is proscribed as such under British law. Funding it is a crime.\n\nThe broadcaster cannot hide behind the fig leaf of being misled by the production company behind the programme, which proved to be Hamas propaganda.\n\nManagers had a duty to check its editorial and ethical standards were being met. Instead, its commitment to integrity, impartiality and conducting even the most basic due diligence went out the window.\n\nYes, the documentary has been removed from iPlayer, but is that really enough?

Mr Trump’s allies grasp that handing over the territory, which includes the Diego Garcia airbase, to a puppet of China is incredibly dangerous.\n\nThe US President prides himself on putting America’s interests first. \n\nHe should veto the deal – and rescue Britain from its inexplicably self-harming Government.\n\nJust when you thought our immigration tribunals couldn’t get any more absurd, they do. This time, they have blocked the deportation of an armed drug dealer from Poland on human rights grounds… because the criminal can’t speak Polish. \n\nSuch perverse rulings are eroding faith in the courts and their ability to keep the public safe. The immigration system needs a radical overhaul – starting by reining in our bleeding-heart judges.","summary":"DM Comment: After the Jimmy Savile and Princess Diana scandals, the BBC was supposed to clean up its act.

I’m from Ikorodu. I attended the Lagos State University. LASU was where my journey to change-making started. This was due to the culture on campus being militarised with the activities of fraternity groups. It was a very challenging environment at the time. However, I had the duty to lead some form of change. This made me start my work with a campus nonprofit organisation. It opened my eyes to several organisations, including the United Nations. Then, I stumbled upon the opportunity of a fellowship programme. It was a kind of opportunity for international nonprofit leaders who were supported by the US State Department. It allowed us to come to Washington DC. This was about 15 years ago. My coming to Washington DC allowed me to work on that programme and understand how to run a nonprofit organisation in Washington DC. It gave me an understanding of how to work with governments, communities, the private sector, and the media. I was just blessed that it was my entry point into the US.\n\nWhat was the idea behind the Nigerian Center?\n\nBefore I started the Nigerian Center, I consulted for financial institutions in America. I was helping them with storytelling, marketing, communication campaigns and strategies. While doing this, I saw the connections between Community Development Financial Institutions and the immigrant community. In Nigeria, CDFIs are like microfinance. In the US, CDFIs, which are grassroots financial institutions, receive support from the immigrant community. There is also a usual connection with community centres. I started to look into this concept of immigrant community centres. I saw that the most established immigrant groups in the United States, whether they are Jewish, Italian, Irish, Chinese, Latino, or Indian, often have this concept called a welcoming centre. It is a community centre. And I didn’t see that in a Nigerian community or across the African community, except for Ethiopians. Then I just took on the responsibility of starting the Nigerian Center. The most recent first Jewish centre in the country was founded in the 1800s, like 1854 or something like that. We started the Nigerian Center in 2022. So, if you look at that community, and how they become an economic powerhouse in America, you can make a connection to the presence of a community centre that provides a soft landing. It provides a support infrastructure system for new immigrants when they migrate here. What I see is that the story of the next generation does not have to be our story. And community centres like ours help us rewrite that narrative.\n\nWhat are the core values of the Nigerian Center?\n\nThe core overarching mission of the centre is to foster financial inclusion and social justice opportunities.\n\nHow have you been able to accomplish that?\n\nWhen we did our research, it was apparent that it was not rocket science. Our community’s number one challenge is legal justice and immigration. The US is a land of opportunities. Once you have taken care of your paperwork, every other thing finds a way to fall in line. But our people struggle with that aspect. In America, we have this culture of ‘don’t ask and don’t tell your immigration status.’ People have been struggling for decades to even get driving licences, travel documents, social security, and work authorisations. People are living beneath their potential, like PhD holders driving Uber and things like that. So, we approached the government of Washington DC. I told them of our plans and I was told that they had a programme that provided grants to legal aid centres for services for immigrants. I didn’t know that all along. So, we got a small funding in 2022 to open a walk-in immigration legal aid clinic. I’m so thankful that this organisation will be a catalyst to rewrite our community story right now. Once you come to the US from any part of the world, you can walk into a physical location called the Nigerian Center to speak to an attorney at no cost. We’ve kept our doors open since 2022. We’ve never missed a day and we’ve done impressive things. We’ve handled cases from student visas to family green cards to employment authorisation to asylum, diplomatic visas, juvenile visas for minors, and all kinds of legal cases. We’ve been doing that. We also started to do funding.\n\nApart from immigration or legal support, what other areas have immigrants benefited from the centre? \n\nWe provide loans to people when they come in here to start their business. The average loan is from $5,000 to $10,000. We can even do more than that to get credit, and to start a business, to put down payment for basic services, and resources. They may need a house or car. So, that’s the second programme we have. We also have a cultural programme whereby the second generation or those who have an affinity to culture can learn. I would say Igbo and Yoruba, particularly for those whose children are married into the culture or those who go to Nigeria for international development. Or those who just want to learn our languages.\n\nApart from grants, how do you raise funds to sponsor the projects run by the centre?\n\nWe are predominantly supported by grant funding. I think one of the things that we do is that we make the entire team a volunteer team. That also significantly has reduced our operating expenses. We expanded our sources of funding from the government to private foundations, individuals, and local businesses. It has been helpful. Some of our programs are paid programs like our language classes. We earn some revenue from our language classes and people just give the little they have to keep the work running. Pro bono services are the height of our financial sustainability and we continue to expand that more and more. So, our revenue is the combination of government grants, private foundations, individual donations, sponsorships, and earned income. We are on a budget of about $300,000. We are aiming to be $500,000 by the end of this fiscal year. In the next two or three years, then we can cross the million-dollar threshold in revenue to continue the work that we do.\n\nDoes the Nigerian Center cater only to Nigerians?\n\nOur programmes are open to Nigerian and non-Nigerians. We have attended to more than 100 people on immigration cases. Last year, we did 130 immigration cases and we had a little bit more with small businesses giving out about 35 loans, that were worth approximately $50,000 in investments. We had about 75 language classes. Those are direct services. We’re not counting our indirect services that go into the thousands. And it’s a mix of Nigerians and non-Nigerians.\n\nHow has the centre helped immigrants since the President Donald Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigrants?\n\nI want to start with the definition of illegal immigrant. We don’t hold that particular language or belief as a centre. Just because someone goes out of legal status doesn’t make them illegal. And I think there’s a criminalisation of legal status and conflicting people. We’ve been taking the lead in this actual programme. We’ve been leading campaigns like the Temporary Protected Status, the federal government advocacy campaign at the state level. And we continue to do so. We’ve stepped up with ‘Know Your Rights’ education. We’ve expanded our ‘Know Your Rights’ not just from a legal perspective, but with the involvement of government officials. The Nigerian Center has impacted people to come to tell their stories and educate folks, and policy experts are included. So, we started a campaign early this year called Washington Prosperity. The concept is that migrants or immigrants are economic prosperity agents. They contribute to the vitality and thriving communities. When you support organisations and programmes like immigrant justice in general, then you support your city’s prosperity. In terms of specific legal strategy, the center continues to get more cases. And it’s not just limited to those in Washington DC. You can call from any part of the country. And we’re also considering the title Immigration Defence Fund. We are bringing organisations like the Nigerian American Public Affairs Committee, and the Nigerian American Lawyers Association.\n\nThere was a time you called on the immediate US past president Joe Biden to protect the immigrants with some programmes. Did he grant that request before he left office? \n\nThe request was not granted, but it was successful in our yardstick. Keep in mind, that this campaign was the very first Nigerian community-led campaign in the United States that I know of in recent times. So, for the first time, we were able to mobilise over 50 congressional offices. We engaged these congressmen and senators to support our cause. We were able to mobilise over 100 human rights organisations, including the One Project. Several organisations including faith-based organisations such as the RCCG, the Catholic churches, and several groups came together. This was the very first time we saw that level of community and political capital at work. Also, we got feedback from the Biden administration. And while they were considering the request, they showed us how individually our community can get those benefits. One of them was Special Student Relief.","summary":"The Executive Director, Nigerian Center, Gbenga Ogunjimi, speaks with BIODUN BUSARI on the operations of the organisation in the United States How did your journey start in the United States?
