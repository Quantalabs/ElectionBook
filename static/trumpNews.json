The platform allows users to place bets on the outcome of events. Shares are sold for up to $1, and those who pick the correct outcome are paid $1 per share they hold.The gap on Tuesday is a slight jump for the former president, who last week was favored to win the election 60.3 percent to Harris' 39.7 percent. But Trump's chances have jumped significantly in a handful of swing states since October 17, including in Arizona, where Trump held a 68 percent chance of winning last week.On Tuesday, Trump's odds in Arizona jumped to 74 percent. His odds also jumped in North Carolina by 7 points (63 percent to 70 percent) and Georgia by 6 points (65 percent to 71 percent).The state that saw the biggest change from last week was Nevada. While Trump and Harris were tied at 50 percent on October 17, as of Tuesday, Trump holds a 63 percent chance of winning in November.Trump also jumped by a small margin in Pennsylvania (59 to 61 percent), Michigan (56 to 59 percent) and Wisconsin (56 to 57 percent). Harris is not favored to win in any battleground state as of Tuesday.Polymarket's betting odds are based on users' predictions, not polling. Most nationwide surveys have found that the race between Harris and Trump is neck-and-neck. Several election models, however, have predicted that Trump has a higher chance of securing the necessary 270 electoral votes.A report from The Wall Street Journal released last week found that Polymarket may have been \"manipulated\" by a small group of users to support Trump. According to the Journal's research, four mysterious accounts spent around $30 million betting on Trump in recent weeks, which tipped the platform in the former president's favor.Economist Rajiv Sethi told the Journal that he believed Polymarket odds had been swayed, adding, \"If I were trying to manipulate a market, this is exactly how I would do it.\"Crypto investor Adam Cochran also warned that the manipulation of Polymarket's odds could be an attempt to make future false claims of a \"stolen\" election. Several critics have warned that Trump is laying the groundwork to challenge the election results in the case he loses, similar to his actions leading up to the 2020 election when he pushed false claims of voter fraud.The former president told reporters on Monday that he has not \"seen\" any signs of election fraud this year but that he knows \"the other side, and they are not good.\"Newsweek sent an email to Harris and Trump's campaigns on Tuesday for comment on the Polymarket odds.","summary":"Harris' chances in four critical battleground states have dropped significantly over the past week on the betting platform Polymarket.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/betting-kamala-harris-donald-trump-polymarket-election-1973332","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2501947/harris-betting-odds-plunge-4-states.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-23 01:06:17","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":260719984,"title":"Biden Highlights Prescription Drug Savings in New Hampshire Speech","text":"President Joe Biden visited New Hampshire on Oct. 22 to promote his administration’s efforts to reduce prescription drug costs, stating his policies have saved Americans nearly $1 billion on medications this year.\n\nBiden’s speech took place two weeks before Election Day, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a tight race for the White House.\n\nSpeaking at a community college in Concord, Biden said signing the Inflation Reduction Act into law was “one of the proudest things” he has ever done.\n\n“Not a single Republican voted for this,” Biden said. “But thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we finally beat Big Pharma.”\n\nIn the first six months of this year alone, Biden said, nearly 1.5 million people enrolled in Medicare spent $1 billion less on drugs nationwide. That’s about $670 each.\n\n“That means, as of June, 1.5 million Americans who are enrolled in Medicare hit the cap and do not have to pay a dime more for drugs for the rest of the year,” he added.\n\nDuring his speech, Biden also took several jabs at his predecessor, criticizing Trump for his campaign promise to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nTrump said during the presidential debate in September that if he got elected, he would replace the Affordable Care Act. He said he had “concepts of a plan” to replace it.\n\nBiden was joined by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in New Hampshire. Speaking at the event, Sanders called on the pharmaceutical industry to “stop ripping off the American people.”\n\n“We’re spending over $13,000 for every man, woman, and child, an unsustainable amount of money,” Sanders said. “The truth of the matter is that the American people, whether they are Democrats, Republicans or Independents, are sick and tired of paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.”\n\nBiden is traveling this week to highlight his administration’s achievements and support Harris’s election efforts in the campaign’s final stretch.\n\nHe is scheduled to visit Arizona to deliver a speech on Friday.\n\n“The president will deliver remarks at the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona,” the White House announced. “The president will discuss the Biden-Harris administration’s record of delivering for tribal communities, including keeping his promise to make this historic visit to Indian Country—his first as president.”\n\nWith just two weeks until Election Day, polls show a neck-and-neck race between Harris and Trump in seven swing states, which are likely to determine the race for the White House.\n\nThe Harris campaign announced that the vice president would travel to deep-red Texas on Oct. 25 to emphasize her campaign message on abortion access in a state with restrictive abortion laws.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump will visit New York City one week before the election. He will hold a highly anticipated rally at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27.","summary":"The president said nearly 1.5 million Medicare enrollees saved $1 billion on prescription drugs in the first half of this year.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-highlights-prescription-drug-savings-in-new-hampshire-speech-5746026","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/22/id5746029-Biden-and-Bernie-Sanders-in-NH-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-23 00:53:05","author":"Emel Akan","authors":["Emel Akan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":260719358,"title":"Trump consigliere cops whopping blow","text":"Mr Giuliani, a prosecutor before he turned to politics, will be forced to fork over his three-bedroom apartment on East 66th Street, a prime location.\n\nHe will also lose a Mercedes-Benz SL500 and other valuables, including cash, to Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea Moss, per the ruling in their $US148 million defamation case against him, The New York Post reports.\n\nMr Giuliani, 80, has seven days to turn over his apartment – whose price he recently slashed by a million US dollars in a last-ditch bid to offload it – into a receivership controlled by Ms Freeman and Ms Moss.\n\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom condo, priced at $US5.18 million as of earlier this month, boasts a wood-panelled library, a wood-burning fireplace and views of Central Park.\n\nMr Giuliani has also been ordered, by Judge Lewis Liman, to turn over a picture signed by legendary New York Yankees player Reggie Jackson, a replica of Joe DiMaggio’s jersey, also signed, more than 20 luxury watches, a diamond, cash and furniture.\n\n“The Court also does not doubt that certain of the items may have sentimental value to defendant,” Judge Liman wrote in his 24-page ruling.\n\n“But that does not entitle the defendant to continued enjoyment of the assets to the detriment of the plaintiffs, to whom he owes approximately $US150 million.”\n\nA federal jury awarded the two Georgia election workers the whopping judgment last year.\n\nJudge Liman has yet to rule on whether the former New York City mayor will also need to hand over his valuable Yankees World Series rings, which his son Andrew claims were given to him as a gift.\n\nThe judge also reserved judgment for now on whether or not to force Mr Giuliani to turn over his multimillion-dollar condo in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe Fulton County workers filed the lawsuit against the man once lionised as “America’s mayor”, given his role in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, in 2021, claiming his lies that they processed fraudulent ballots during the 2020 presidential election led to them facing threats and racist verbal attacks.\n\nMr Giuliani was found liable for defaming Ms Moss and Ms Freeman in August of 2023, having failed to divulge electronic messages and financial records that the women's’ lawyers were entitled to during the litigation.\n\nThe former mayor led Donald Trump’s legal team after the 2020 election.

Many Australians cannot take their eyes off the high-stakes theatrics of the twists and turns. \n\nBut what’s it like right now to be an American in Australia, watching such drama from afar?\n\n‘Australians are eating it up’\n\n“Australians are lovely but sometimes devoid of self-awareness when they hear my American accent and come in hot with: ‘man, your country’s f**ked’ or ‘that Trump stuff’s crazy’ or ‘what a dumpster fire ya’ll are in’,” Jamarr Mills, who has lived in Sydney for six years, told news.com.au. \n\nSuch attitudes towards Trump’s “craziness” are reflected in recent polling conducted for the Lowy Institute, which revealed almost three-quarters of Australians (73 per cent) would prefer Kamala Harris as president, while less than one in four (22 per cent) prefer Donald Trump – a seven point drop from six months ago (29 per cent).\n\nMr Jamarr Mills, 34, can understand the excitement. \n\n“I get it,” he said, describing it as a “phenomenon” that Australians are “eating up”. \n\n“Especially with the intersections Kamala Harris crosses: black, Indian, cis woman. The prospect of having all that lived experience at the helm feels pivotal.”\n\nHe said he found that, living abroad, he could choose how much he engaged.\n\n“It’s important to have these conversations – obviously, what happens in the US reverberates worldwide, and can create trends,” he said. \n\nBut, to protect his mental health, he said he occasionally politely declined to discuss it. \n\nIt’s a marked difference from when he was travelling around Europe during Obama’s presidency. \n\n“People in every country wanted to engage with the joy and hope he symbolised,” Mills said. “They were energised by an American accent.” \n\nThat feeling has transformed. \n\n“It’s now exhaustion,” he said. \n\n“I need to be armed to discuss it, because it’s the first thing people ask upon hearing my accent.” \n\nHe said for Australians, it’s like watching The Real Housewives. \n\n“They’re like, ‘I love that character – they’re so wild! I can’t believe they said that!’ Whereas for Americans, we’re the kids of those real housewives, cringing, saying ‘oh God, mum’s drunk again, she got hold of Twitter and started saying stuff’.”\n\nRecently, Mr Mills was back in New York with an Australian friend who wanted to watch the presidential debate in a bar. \n\n“I told him I couldn’t think of anything worse,” he said, and added that other Americans abroad shared a similar sense of exhaustion. \n\n“I’d say you could ask even the most diehard patriotic American and they’d be glad to be away from it,” he said. \n\n“The beauty of being removed from it is the distance gives me more control over keeping my mental health in check.”\n\nVoting isn’t compulsory in the US\n\nAt least 110,000 Americans living in Australia are eligible to vote. Yet only 8.5 per cent of eligible Americans in Australia voted in the 2020 US election, according to the Federal Assistance Program. \n\nFor the 2024 election, for the first time in US history, the Democratic Party has made an investment in its Democrats Abroad group, spending almost half a million US dollars in the hope of harnessing global votes in battleground states. \n\nLeslie Crudup Villagarcia, 43, comes from one of those key battleground states, Pennsylvania, and has lived in Brisbane since 2009.\n\nWhile she has posted her ballot for Kamala Harris (“they have all these passwords and security measures to ensure you’re not voting more than once”), she won’t be joining the campaigning efforts of the Democrats Abroad.\n\nTrump’s first election left her “shaken”.\n\nThat night, she headed to Brisbane’s Pig n’ Whistle pub to watch results come in, but felt uncomfortable alongside Trump voters. \n\n“As we walked out, the guy I was seeing flipped a MAGA hat off a Trump supporter’s head,” she said. \n\n“He shouldn’t have done that. But it’s an illustration of the tension that can erupt.”\n\nVillagarcia has mixed feelings about the upcoming election. \n\n“I desperately want Kamala Harris to win – to have a Black woman as the next president of the US would be glorious” she said, adding that all her family in Pennsylvania were staunch Harris supporters. \n\n“As a Black woman myself, it’s been delicious watching Trump try and fail to discredit her.” She’s also protective of her own mental health. \n\n“I’m mindful of the fact the lead-up has fuelled more anti-Black-woman vitriol online, so I mostly stay out of social media conversations on the topic,” she said.\n\nOne of the reasons she left the US and wants to stay in Australia is because of what she sees as their “broken political system” – citing their rigid two-party system, the “ridiculous” electoral college and what she sees as Australia’s superior system of preferential voting.\n\nLooking at this US presidential election from the outside has been “harrowing, to say the least,” she said – and part of that has been racial and gendered. \n\n“It really has shown, to prove ourselves as Black women, we have to work 15 times harder, to show we’re valid beings who deserve a seat at the table, let alone people who can make our own tables. To have her in that position would be a really powerful statement. And a relief,” she said. s\n\n“I’d celebrate that, while in the same breath, I grieve for what’s happening in the Middle East. Both things can be true.”\n\nHer family is very politically engaged – her dad helped get out the vote for Obama. Yet, she said, if there was preferential voting, she’d vote for a candidate further left of Harris. \n\nIn her job as a life coach, she avoids situations where she might run into Trump supporters – “the joy of being self-employed”, she said. \n\nSo how will she feel if Trump wins?\n\n“I actually think that’s something I might have to process more privately,” she said. \n\n“As we’re having this conversation, I’ve realised I don’t think I actually want to go to that pub on results night on November 5. If I’m out in the city and Trump wins, I don’t want to be around people who celebrate that. I’d feel emotionally quite unsafe.”\n\n‘My family all vote Trump – now we never discuss it’\n\nAnnie Arthur is registered to vote in Georgia – also a key battleground state. \n\nThe 30-year-old blacksmith has lived in Sydney for more than two years and is always surprised by how much Australians know about the US election.\n\n“Often, they know more than I do – I’m actually trying to pay attention,” she said.\n\nWhile the mail-in vote from abroad was a simple process, Arthur was “incredibly nervous about my ballot being counted as valid”.\n\nThat’s because, in 2020, when Trump narrowly lost Georgia, he claimed without proof that widespread voter fraud in the state had cost him victory. \n\n“I’m a blue (Democrat) voter in a very red (Republican) district – so I need my vote to count,” she said.\n\nBut she hasn’t always been a “blue” voter, having once voted red. \n\nIn the first election she was eligible to vote in, she voted for Mitt Romney (a Republican). Some of this had to do with how and where she grew up: on the Bible Belt, with her father a pastor.\n\nBefore she has even told Australians this, though, she said they mostly assume she’s anti-Trump. \n\n“I definitely am – but I find it interesting how often people make that assumption given how little I talk about anything political,” she said. \n\nWhen she tells Australians her family is pro-Trump, they’re “always fascinated and want to know why – as though half the US isn’t the same,” she said. \n\n“Sometimes conversations are light and short. Others get pretty intellectual and intense.”\n\nArthur always fell in line with her family’s Christian conservative views, but began to diverge slightly as she got older. \n\n“It wasn’t until 2014, aged 19, when I came out as queer, that I started thinking independently from my family,” she said. \n\n“When the 2016 election came around, I remember being disgusted by Trump – but still falling in line with a lot of policies held by the Republican Party.” \n\nSince then, she has voted for Democrat candidates. \n\n“Despite some things I still believed fell on the Republican side, I knew I had to vote for a more socially liberal candidate. After all, what do my economic beliefs matter if I vote for a party where my existence and rights as a woman and a queer person don’t matter?”\n\nIn the 2020 election, her family had also changed their minds – but in a different direction. “Mum, dad, my two sisters and their husbands had gone from ‘Trump is the lesser of two evils’ to active Trump fans,” she said. \n\n“That part of America is a bubble.” \n\nShe quietly left her family’s group chat. \n\n“I only agreed to join back in if everyone agreed not to talk politics – because I was the only outsider in this,” she explained.\n\nSince then, they have steered clear of the subject. She has no idea what her family thinks about the 2020 election and whether it was “stolen” or what they think about the January 6 insurrection that followed. \n\n“And honestly, I’m afraid to ask,” she said. \n\n“The ignorance is better than if I were to have to face an ugly truth about my family.”\n\nArthur won’t be “particularly ecstatic” if Harris wins, but will feel “disappointment and heaviness” if Trump does. \n\n“I’m bracing for the worst but really hoping it doesn’t happen. I haven’t felt like a proud American in several years – and a Trump win would certainly be the nail in that coffin,” she said.\n\nNews.com.au approached the Republicans Overseas in search of an American Trump voter living in Australia, but they didn’t respond to requests. \n\nGreg Swenson, chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, told the ABC he’s unsure of who exactly runs the group’s branch in Australia. News.com.au also approached several case study finding services, Americans in Australia Facebook groups, social media conversations and conservative organisations in search of a Trump voter in Australia, yet nobody came forward.\n\nBut this, obviously, doesn’t negate his popularity in his own country. \n\nArthur fears there’s a likelihood of his re-election. \n\n“I’m not holding my breath,” she said. \n\n“After Hillary won the popular vote (by three million votes) but lost the election in 2016 and after the January 6 insurrection, I’ve become numb out of disappointment from the crazy things my country and its broken electoral system is capable of,” she said. \n\n“That said, I’d love to see a woman as president. \n\n“It’s about damn time.” \n\nGary Nunn is a freelance journalist.

But even the youngest residents, it seems, are well aware of the disdain many locals feel towards the man who wants their vote this November. Just mentioning Trump’s name to a friend – a mild-mannered, born and bred New Yorker – elicits expletives.\n\nA Siena College poll released on Tuesday found that 72 per cent of New York City voters viewed Trump unfavourably.","summary":"Donald Trump may well regain the presidency, but not with his home town’s support.

Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.’\n\nIt comes after Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris takes care to try to shut down ‘lock him up’ chants that have popped up at her campaign rallies.\n\nShe routinely says to leave the matter up to the courts.\n\nThe chants clash with her campaign based in part on preserving democracy and long and order from what she calls the Trump threat – and is similar to the ‘lock her up’ chants at Trump’s 2016 rallies that Democrats continue to call out. \n\nTrump has long centered his own campaign around contesting the criminal cases against him, and accuses rivals of practicing ‘lawfare’ against him. \n\nHe faces sentencing in September after his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, which could technically land him in jail, although many experts say the first-time white collar offender is likely to avoid doing jail time.\n\nHis son, Donald Trump Jr., teed off on Biden’s comments. \n\n‘They’re not even hiding it. The lawfare against my dad was always about election interference!’ he posted on X.\n\nTrump’s own campaign rhetoric has included multiple threats to go after people he calls the ‘enemy from within,’ including Senate candidate Adam Schiff. \n\nHe experienced a poll and campaign donation bump during his New York hush money trial, and has railed against ‘deranged’ special counsel Jack Smith bringing charges against him related to his January 6 election overturn effort. \n\nBiden, who only occasionally jumps on the campaign trail after committing a string of gaffes, made the comment after saying Trump was talking about abolishing the Education Department.\n\n‘This is a guy who also wants to replace every civil servant. Every single one. Things he has a right under the Supreme Court ruling on immunity to be able to if need be … to actually eliminate, physically eliminate, shoot, kill someone he believes to be a threat to him. I know this sounds bizarre. [If]I said this five years ago you’d lock me up – you gotta lock him up,’ he said. \n\n‘Politically lock him up,’ he added. \n\nAlthough Trump has repeatedly railed against his political opponents and threatened to use the machinery to government to go after them, he hasn’t spoken about being able to kill people who are a threat to him. \n\nHe continues to try to turn the Democrats’ own rhetoric against them.\n\n‘If we lose this election, we may not have a country anymore,’ he said at his Doral golf club on Monday. ‘They say we may never have an election again in this country. This is where we’re going,’ he said.\n\nDemocrats have raised increasing concern about whether Trump will once again declare victory and refuse to accept the results of the election, as he did in 2020. \n\nHe was coy once again when asked at a suburban area McDonald’s drive-thru Saturday whether he would accept the election results no matter the outcome.\n\n‘Yeah, sure, if it’s a fair election,’ Trump said. ‘I would always accept it. It’s got to be a fair election,’ he said. \n\nHe continue to call for a win that is ‘too big to rid’ – implying his rivals will cheat without offering evidence. \n\n‘We gotta lock Joe up,’ a former Biden aide quipped to Axios, noting that the statement was politically unhelpful.","summary":"President Joe Biden sparked fury Tuesday night by suggesting Donald Trump should&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/joe-biden-accidentally-reveals-desire-to-have-trump-imprisoned-just-two-weeks-before-the-election-we-need-to-put-him-behind-bars/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1729643322_rewrite-this-title-Joe-Biden-lets-slip-he-wants-Trump-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-23 00:28:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":260718410,"title":"Early vote totals indicate Trump is ‘going to be president on Election Day,’ veteran political journalist says ","text":"Former President Donald Trump is on track to win the 2024 presidential race based on the early voting numbers trickling in, according to a longtime political journalist. \n\n“If the early vote numbers stay the way they are, and that’s a big if, we’ll almost certainly know before Election Day who’s going to win,” Mark Halperin, the editor-in-chief of the 2WAY video platform, said Tuesday. \n\nHalperin, 59, noted that early voting data in at least some of the key swing states this cycle indicates that Trump, 78, is doing well enough at the moment to beat Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, when voters flock to the polls on Nov. 5. \n\n“[M]ake no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we’ll know that Donald Trump’s going to be president on Election Day,” he said. \n\nThe former NBC News reporter stressed that early voting numbers need to be tracked “day to day” and that those figures are “more important than the polls right now.” \n\n“It’s more important than almost anything,” Halperin argued, “because it’s giving us insight into a variety of factors that are counting for a Republican overperformance by various metrics in the early voting in the battleground states.” \n\nHalperin spotlighted the early vote totals coming in from Nevada, specifically populous Clark County, whose county seat is Las Vegas. \n\n“The Democrats usually have a huge lead there, [it’s] 4,500 votes,” the journalist said. “The rurals are overperforming their share of the electorate.”\n\nHalperin also pointed to reporting Monday from The Nevada Independent showing that Republicans are leading statewide by 8,000 votes. \n\n“[D]on’t overread the early vote, OK?” Halperin cautioned. “It can change. We don’t know exactly who’s casting these ballots, how they’re voting, etc.” \n\n“But every analyst I’ve talked to in the last 24 hours, including people who speak publicly, say if this continues, Donald Trump can’t lose because the Democrats can’t possibly do well enough on Election Day,” he added. \n\nThe latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Trump leading Harris in all seven battleground states, which include Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin.","summary":"“[M]ake no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we'll know that Donald Trump's going to be president on Election Day,” Mark Halperin said Tuesday. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/22/us-news/early-vote-totals-indicate-trump-is-going-to-be-president-on-election-day-mark-halperin/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-p92o8px4q-1729638504404.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1729624164&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/OS7rbLzY-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-23 00:20:27","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.106},{"id":260719418,"title":"Sam Smith puts on a leggy display in black shorts teamed with a pink shirt as they head for a leisurely lunch with pals in New York","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 23rd 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoyal approval!

As of Tuesday, more than 25% of active voters in Georgia had cast their ballots, according to Georgia state election official Gabriel Sterling.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, are battling for Georgia's 16 electoral votes. President Joe Biden carried the state in 2020 by 12,670 votes over Trump, becoming the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992.","summary":"Georgia's Supreme Court has rejected a Republican-led effort to reinstate seven new election rules, approved by the State Election Board, before Election Day as early voting is underway in the battleground state.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/10/22/georgia-supreme-court-refuses-to-reinstate-election-rules/8061729641233/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8061729641233/2024/upi/fe1cabf92789cf163e612026e65bfc56/v1.2/Georgia-Supreme-Court-rejects-Republican-led-effort-to-restore-new-election-rules.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-23 00:18:57","author":"Sheri Walsh","authors":["Sheri Walsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":260718406,"title":"Trump says car loan interest deduction will only apply to US-made vehicles: ‘Don’t want it to benefit other countries’","text":"GREENSBORO, N.C. – Former President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that his plan to make interest incurred on car loans fully tax deductible will only apply to vehicles manufactured in the US. \n\n“I don’t want it to benefit other countries,” Trump said at a rally in Greensboro, N.C. \n\n“I want it to benefit us,” the Republican nominee added.\n\n“So it’s deductibility of interest is great, but only if the car is manufactured in the United States,” Trump pledged. “Is that a great idea?”\n\n“Why the hell would we give them taxes if they manufacture the car in China or Japan, or lots of other places that stole our business over the years?”","summary":"“I want it to benefit us,” the Republican nominee added.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/22/us-news/trump-says-car-loan-interest-deduction-will-only-apply-to-us-made-vehicles/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/republican-presidential-nominee-former-u-92188246-e1729642696943.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-23 00:18:37","author":"Victor Nava,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Victor Nava","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":260718544,"title":"Yelp disables comments for the Pennsylvania McDonald’s where Trump served fries","text":"New York (CNN) — An influx of Yelp reviews – many of them bogus – of a Pennsylvania McDonald’s that former President Donald Trump visited Sunday, led the review platform to temporarily freeze the franchise’s Yelp page.\n\nMany of the recent latest reviews were ruthless. Some called out Trump for his criminal record.\n\n“Convicted felon sh*t-talking customers, especially women, did not wear gloves while preparing french fries, and only worked five minutes at a time before having to sit down or take a nap,” one said.\n\nOthers used the opportunity to take a different jab at the presidential candidate.\n\n“The fries were too salty as if someone who lost a major election had been crying over them for an hour,” one review said.\n\nSome users on Yelp blamed the McDonald’s franchise for allowing Trump to host a campaign event there.\n\n“If you make managerial decisions this bad I certainly am never going to eat anything you make,” another review said.\n\nStill, some on Yelp shrugged off the Trump campaign event.\n\n“I’ve been to this MacDonalds long before Trump came by and I’ll keep coming by long afterwards,” one five-star review said.\n\nMcDonald’s was thrust into the political spotlight Sunday when Trump served fries at a Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, location, even though the chain attempted to distance itself from the stunt. Vice President Kamala Harris says she briefly worked at the chain during the summer of 1983 when she was still a student at Howard University in Washington, a claim Trump refutes without evidence.\n\nYelp will flag and temporarily disable reviews on businesses that have received increased public attention. In 2023, there were 986 total alerts placed on business pages related to the business receiving public attention, the company said. It’s removed almost 50,000 reviews as a result of these alerts.\n\n“While we don’t take a stand one way or the other when it comes to this incident, we’ve temporarily disabled the posting of content to this page as we work to investigate whether the content you see here reflects actual consumer experiences rather than the recent events,” a notice on the page said Tuesday.\n\nYelp said the disabled reviews are temporary, and confirmed it disabled reviews Monday.\n\n“When we see the activity dramatically decrease or stop, our moderators will clean up the page so reviews describing only firsthand consumer experiences are reflected,” Noorie Malik, Yelp’s VP of User Operations, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nMost of McDonald’s locations are independently owned and operated, meaning that although franchise owners have to agree to certain guidelines, they’re more or less free to invite whomever they want to run the drive-through.\n\nOn Sunday, McDonald’s said in an internal memo to employees obtained by CNN that it did not invite Trump.\n\n“As we’ve seen, our brand has been a fixture of conversation this election cycle. While we’ve not sought this, it’s a testament to how much McDonald’s resonates with so many Americans,” the company said in its memo. “McDonald’s does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next President. We are not red or blue – we are golden.”\n\nThe company clarified in its memo that Derek Giacomantonio, the franchise’s owner and operator, was approached by local law enforcement about Trump’s desire to visit and Giacomantonio accepted.\n\n“He was proud to highlight how he and his team serve their local community and make delicious food, like our World-Famous French Fries,” the company said. “Upon learning of the former President’s request, we approached it through the lens of one of our core values: we open our doors to everyone.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

her lousy record","text":"Kamala Harris is running a campaign against herself.\n\nThe vice president is a left-wing Democrat with an unsalable record in office. \n\nSo candidate Harris pretends to be something else — a newcomer with a happy message and a bevy of Republican supporters.\n\nThe trick isn’t working, as recent polls tracing Donald Trump’s ascent demonstrate.\n\nIt’s almost as if nobody — independents, Republicans or Democrats — associates Dick Cheney with good vibes. \n\nYet Harris is out on the trail boasting of his support: That’s not joy, it’s desperation.\n\nHarris was counting on winning the election by surprise, replacing Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket before voters could stop to ask just what they were getting.\n\nShe put off doing major interviews as long as she could, for fear they’d lead to exactly what everyone saw in her Fox News appearance last week.\n\nThe vice president didn’t want to be asked about her record because it’s atrocious: Month-on-month inflation peaked above 9% midway through the Biden-Harris years.\n\nShe’s a border czar presiding over a broken border, while in foreign policy Harris and Biden have delivered only humiliation and horror from Afghanistan to Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nFour more years of the same isn’t a pitch voters will go for.\n\nInstead, Harris tries happy talk — but she’s not at all pleased when voters

hypocritical. \n\nHarris surrogates and media amplifiers can’t stop talking about fascism and the end of American democracy, even as they rebuke Trump for intemperate language.\n\nComparing Harris’ opponent to Hitler isn’t enough anymore: Anne Applebaum at The Atlantic now writes, “Trump Is Speaking Like Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini” — all at once!\n\nDemocrats have waged nonstop “lawfare” against the Republican nominee. \n\nYet Harris insists it’s Trump who wants to use government power against his opponents.\n\nTrump isn’t a soft-spoken campaigner, to say the least. \n\nBut his genius lies in combining galvanizing rhetoric with disarming humor.\n\nHe was in his element last weekend when he stopped by a Philadelphia-area McDonald’s to try his hand as a fry cook.\n\nTrump had a political point to make — he was teasing Harris about her claims to have worked for the fast-food giant when she was in college.\n\nBut that jab was secondary to the sheer merriment of having Trump don a cook’s apron and learn to scoop fries, as the restaurant’s regular employees looked on and smiled.\n\nThe scene spotlighted the kind of joy that’s in short supply inside Harris’s campaign.\n\nThe contrasting emotional resonances couldn’t be sharper — Trump and the golden arches of America’s most popular burger chain on one side, Harris and everything voters associate with Dick Cheney on the other.\n\nYet Harris has good reason to tout ties to yesterday’s Republicans — because she hardly wants to be identified with today’s Democrats, least of all with her record alongside Biden.\n\nHer only hope is to run as an outsider to her own administration.\n\nThe Republicans she’s using to weave the illusion that she’s something other than a typical liberal, however, are the farthest thing from outsiders: Indeed, that’s why they’re endorsing her — they’re insiders angry about Trump’s war on the political establishment.\n\nThe Cheneys feel closer to Harris than they do to the grassroots Republicans who booted Dick’s daughter Liz out of Congress.\n\nThe Harris campaign is the last redoubt for the old guard in both parties, Cheney Republicans and Biden-Harris Democrats alike.\n\nHarris likes to talk about “what is possible, unburdened by what has been.”\n\nBut she is nothing if not burdened by what she has been, and she’s looking to Republicans out of the past to save her from voters’ judgment about the present administration.\n\nShe wanted to run on vibes, but now they’re all bad — and Trump, after surviving two assassination attempts, is the more joyful campaigner.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review and editor-at-large of The American Conservative.","summary":"Kamala Harris' only hope is to run as an outsider to her

Now, across the United States, election officials are upping their security measures (as well as their pay rates) for the same reason. In Maricopa County, Arizona, the tabulation centre already has a tall security fence, built in response to the chaos of 2020 and 2022. This year, the centre will resemble a prison — the roof of the centre will be populated by snipers. There will be metal detectors and security at every entrance. Drones will circle like vultures overhead.\n\nMaricopa County recorder Stephen Richer (a Republican) has been subjected to repeated death threats for his stated conviction that the 2020 election was not stolen. This includes from Shelby Busch, who “joked” that Richer ought to be “lynched”. Busch is the chair of Arizona’s delegation to the Republican convention. Earlier this year, Tim Murphy wrote in Mother Jones that “Arizona shows what happens when a conspiracy takes over a party, and election denial becomes not just a tactic but its animating purpose”.\n\nRicher’s term will end at the beginning of next year after he lost July’s Republican primary to GOP challenger Justin Heap, a state representative backed by the far-right Freedom Caucus. In response, Richer posted: “Elections have winners and, sadly, losers. And in this one, it looks like I’m going to end up on the losing side of the column. But that’s the name of the game. Accept it. Move on.”\n\nMeanwhile, ProPublica reports that in Arizona, as well as other crucial swing states Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, far-right activists who have spread apocryphal election fraud claims about 2020 are recruiting poll workers.\n\nDon’t yet rejoice in his defeat, you men!\n\nAs with many of the things we learn about former US president Donald Trump from people who have worked with him, there was more than one element to find worrying. The confirmation came this week of a long-reported conversation between Trump and his then chief of staff John Kelly regarding Trump’s need for the “kind of generals Hitler had”.\n\nThe first, and most obvious response is the cold sweat realisation that, once again, a man with such thin skin and such an explicit admiration for despots may once again be the commander-in-chief of the world’s biggest army.\n\nThe second is the childlike grasp of history it betrays. Kelly has confirmed the exchange in conversation with The Atlantic‘s Jeffrey Goldberg:\n\n[Kelly] told me that when Trump raised the subject of ‘German generals’, Kelly responded by asking, ‘Do you mean Bismarck’s generals?’ He went on: ‘I mean, I knew he didn’t know who Bismarck was, or about the Franco-Prussian War. I said, Do you mean the kaiser’s generals? Surely you can’t mean Hitler’s generals? And he said, Yeah, yeah, Hitler’s generals. I explained to him that Rommel had to commit suicide after taking part in a plot against Hitler.’ Kelly told me Trump was not acquainted with Rommel.\n\nMadison for it\n\nIn the face of all this, the Democrats have a rock-solid plan: some of the cast of The West Wing, baby! What could possibly be better to convince the non-college-educated swing state voters that will decide this election that their material needs are at the heart of the party’s pitch than getting together the stars of liberal wish-fulfilment porn that went off the air nearly 20 years ago? Speaking at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin Bradley Whitford did NOT mince words, you guys!\n\nIf the Trump/Vance ticket is somehow able to withstand this, I know of a certain councillor from Indiana who might have a couple of thoughts on ol’ Donny Trump.\n\nWhitford was attempting the admirable aim of getting the vote out ahead of speeches by Kamala Harris’ VP nominee Tim Walz and former president Barack Obama. Harris, meanwhile, has been touring Pennsylvania with late-to-the-party never-Trumper Liz Cheney.\n\nIt’s getting close… who has their nose ahead?

Harris was also questioned about the possibility of pardoning Trump should he lose the presidential race.\n\nWhen questioned whether she would appoint Liz Cheney to her cabinet, with a smile, Harris responded: “I’ll keep you posted”.\n\nTrump has been criminally charged with trying to overturn the 2020 election – and refuses to admit he lost to President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the wake of a failed legal attempt to challenge the election outcome, supporters of Trump conducted a violent riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The mob attacked law enforcement officers in a bid to impede the certification process of the election.\n\nAt Harris’ rallies, some of her supporters chant “lock him up” – mirroring what Trump often said about his former Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nHarris often replies: “The courts will take care of that. We’ll take care of November.”\n\nAt a campaign stop Tuesday, president Joe Biden said “we’ve got to lock him up” – before quickly changing to “lock him out, that’s what I mean”.\n\nHe added: “No president has ever been like this guy. He’s a genuine threat to our democracy.”\n\nIn the interview, Harris also praised Biden on the way he handled foreign affairs and the economy and fixing “so much of what has been broken” due to “Donald Trump’s mismanagement”.\n\nThe vice president was also asked whether she had noticed any sign of mental decline in the president.\n\nHarris said: “Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced and capable in every way that anyone would want of their president.\n\n“It was a bad debate. People have bad debates.\n\n“Joe Biden was the one who was able to bring Nato together during a crisis, where for the first time in 70 years, Europe saw and has seen war.”\n\nHarris was also questioned on Trump’s economic advantage and why polling shows the Republican is more trusted on the economy.\n\nShe responded: “Well this is why I’m going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.\n\n“I’m going to continue being on the road.”\n\nMEDIA BLITZ\n\nHarris’ interview comes in the midst of a media blitz to make a last-minute appeal to voters.\n\nLast week, she sat down with Stephen Colbert for the Late Show to guzzle a beer and slam Trump for “gaslighting Americans.”\n\nAnd days earlier, she appeared on Alex Cooper’s podcast Call Her Daddy, despite the show’s racy history.\n\nThe U.S. Sun previously spoke with a political expert who analyzed Harris’ appearances and said he didn’t believe they would sway voters.\n\n“It’s not enough just to show up on these platforms,” Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, warned.\n\n“Voters care about substance, and what voters care about right now is: ‘Where do these candidates stand?’\n\n“And, what is their plan on affordability – namely housing, healthcare, food, and fuel?\n\n“Where do they stand, and what is their plan for border security?”\n\nHarris has struggled to distinguish her vision for America from President Joe Biden’s, but last month, she boldly said she offers “a new generation of leadership.”\n\n“My focus is very much on what we can do over the next 10, 20 years to catch up to the 21st century again.\n\n“Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other.”\n\nStill, Americans appear to be almost evenly divided between Harris and Trump as Election Day nears.","summary":"KAMALA Harris has swerved questions regarding running opponent Donald Trump and if&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/kamala-harris-avoids-answering-two-important-questions-during-interview-one-about-a-potential-presidential-pardon-for-donald-trump-if-he-is-defeated/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-dodges-two-key-questions-in-interview-–-including-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-23 00:08:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":260717676,"title":"CNN fact-checker says Walz's claim on Trump economy 'not true,' says manufacturing jobs rose under him","text":"CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale corrected Democratic Vice Presidential candidate and Minnesota Gov.

Everything from tequila to video game consoles would cost more. Trump’s tariffs would cost the average family nearly $4,000 a year and rising prices would accelerate inflation. \n\nTrump claims that other countries will pay for the tariffs, but consumers paid for nearly all of the tariffs he imposed in his first term through higher prices. \n\nAnd then we paid billions more to bail out the farmers who were ruined by the tariffs our trading partners imposed in retaliation. \n\nSo why is Trump so keen on taxing imports? \n\nBecause the Trump tariffs would create the greatest engine of corruption in history, an institutionalized kleptocracy where import-based business lives or dies by Trump’s favor. Elon Musk’s imported parts might be exempted while GM’s are not.\n\nCongress has given the president sweeping powers to impose tariffs, and critically, to waive those tariffs for a favored few. US imports totaled $3.8 trillion in 2023. The thought of a 34-time convicted felon wielding that kind of power is terrifying. Powerful interests at home and abroad want to save money and gain an edge over their competitors by dodging tariffs. Trump is just the man to make that happen, for a price. \n\nTrump’s business empire creates limitless opportunities for would-be tariff dodgers to convert cash into official acts. In all, Trump’s businesses raked in nearly $2 billion in revenue during his first term, including millions from the governments of China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. If emoluments won’t suffice, there’s always bribery. Trump is credibly accused of taking 200 pounds of cash worth $10 million from Egypt in exchange for a friendlier diplomatic posture towards the autocratic regime. \n\nTrump politicized tariff waivers in his first term. \n\nThe Brookings Institution found that “a bewildering array of politically favored importers won tariff relief” during that time. Bibles from China got a waiver because the religious right insisted, but textbooks are still taxed. Now the Trump Bible is made in China, too. Salmon and cod got waivers because powerful Republican senators threw their weight around. Chinese tiki torches got the nod for reasons that remain as murky as a bad fish farm. Governments including China, Russia and Argentina are suspected of granting Trump and his family trademarks worth millions of dollars in the hopes of securing more favorable trade relations. \n\nTechnically, the Commerce Department grants the waivers. These concessions are supposed to be based on the national interest, but the process is notoriously opaque and politicized at the best of times. \n\nIn a second Trump term, it would become completely corrupt. In the name of fighting an imaginary “Deep State,” Trump plans to purge career civil servants and replace them with maga hacks who will do his bidding. The Heritage Foundation, home of Project 2025, is already flooding federal agencies with Freedom of Information Requests to find out which civil servants aren’t Trumpy enough. Heritage shelled out $100,000 for Project Sovereignty 2025 to draw up a McCarthyite list of civil servants that Heritage President Kevin Roberts considers to be a “deep state of entrenched Leftist bureaucrats.” \n\nIf you wondered why JD Vance called on Trump to “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people,” there’s your answer. It’s the mid-level bureaucrats in every federal agency that stand in the way of turning the federal government into a Trump protection racket. \n\nTrump’s tariff plan would give him discretion to play favorites over trillions of dollars of trade. We know he’d follow through because he played favorites with tariffs in his first term. The second time around, he will vastly increase the amount of goods subject to tariffs and purge the civil service of anyone who might oppose his bid to reward his friends and punish his enemies.","summary":"You wouldn’t expect a presidential candidate to make a massive middle class tax hike the centerpiece of his economic platform, but that’s exactly what Donald Trump is doing. \n\nTrump has vowed to slap a 20 percent tax on all imports, a 60 percent tax on all Chinese imports and a 2,000 percent tax on imported cars. \n\nThese taxes are known as tariffs.

I spend more of my time on policy. What’s the policy we need that can really help both the world, foreign policy, and domestically?’, Dimon said via a spokesperson at the time.\n\nIn private, however, the 68-year-old has made it clear that he supports Vice President Harris.\n\nHe would also reportedly consider a role, perhaps Treasury secretary, in her administration.\n\nThe banker, who has an estimated net worth of around $2.4 billion, has allegedly told his associates that he considers Trump’s 2020 election denialism close to a disqualifying factor.\n\nMark Cuban warned Elon Musk about Donald Trump’s sense of loyalty following the Tesla CEO’s declaration that this could be America’s ‘last election’ if Trump loses. \n\nThe billionaires are feuding over Musk’s support of former President Donald Trump. Cuban, the former Dallas Mavericks owner, has thrown his weight behind Kamala Harris. \n\nMusk drew Cuban’s ire on Sunday by making the stark claim that Democrats are purposefully shipping enough illegal migrants into swing states to tip the majority in their favor.\n\n‘Very few Americans realize that, if Trump is NOT elected, this will be the last election,’ he wrote. ‘Far from being a threat to democracy, he is the only way to save it!’ \n\nCuban, who has known Trump for decades, cautioned Musk. \n\n‘Elon, there will come a time when you need something from Donald Trump. You will think you will have earned the right to ask and receive,’ Cuban wrote.\n\n‘You have been a loyal, faithful soldier for him. You have supported him politically with 10s of millions of dollars. Then, at the point you need him the most, you will find out what so many before you have learned, his loyalty is only to himself.’\n\nThe Shark Tank star has said he would be willing to do ‘whatever I can’ to get Harris over the finish line in his home state of Pennsylvania.\n\nMusk has claimed billionaires like Bill Gates are afraid of a Donald Trump win because it would lead to the release of the names of associates of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Tesla CEO, 50, made the unfounded claim in an interview with Tucker Carlson on the Musk-owned social media app X. \n\n‘I think part of why Kamala’s getting so much support is that if Trump wins, that Epstein client list is gonna become public,’ Musk said.\n\n‘And some of those billionaires behind Kamala are terrified of that outcome.’\n\nMusk named Microsoft founder Gates and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman as two of the billionaires who supposedly fear the release of Epstein’s client list.","summary":"Bill Gates has joined other mega-rich donors like Mark Cuban by pushing tens&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/bill-gates-donates-50-million-to-support-kamala-harris-in-the-presidential-election/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/23/00/91166371-13989523-image-a-15_1729638857894.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-22 23:59:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":260718994,"title":"The background on Trump's iPhone is what you may have expected","text":"A few pictures posted to social media shows Donald Trump's iPhone lock screen.

You know, the reveals on telly are great, but the reveals in real life are great…Yeah, it was emotional'\n'It was always emotional…And when they came in and they had that moment of, oh my god, this has happened to me.' \nThe revelation comes just hours after her daughter and her co-star's daughter insisted that the programme would not be made today. \nThe pair feel as if the show and their mothers would instantly be 'cancelled' because of how it. \nThey were known for their cutting comments to each others, namely about Susannah's 'chicken arms' or Trinny's 'flat chest'.\n\nThe TV star spoke with Nick Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett for the latest episode of their culinary-themed podcast \n\nStyle gurus Trinny, 60, and Susannah, 62, teamed up in the early 90s to write a fashion column for The Telegraph before carving out a long-lasting reputation as a TV duo (Pictured in the 90s)\n\nThe TV duo were known for their cutting comments to each others, namely about Susannah's 'chicken arms' or Trinny's 'flat chest' (Pictured in 2002)\n\nIn June, Trinny and Lyla arrived together for the V&A Summer Party 2024 to celebrate the upcoming Naomi: In Fashion exhibition \n\nJust one week before, Susannah and Esme attended West End play 2:22 A Ghost Story's afterparty at Sophie's Soho \n But making their own joint media appearance, Esme and Lyla joked that their mothers would likely be taken off air now for how they spoke to each other. \n'I think they would be cancelled if the show was made now,' Lyla told Tatler. \n'You can't really speak to people like that any more, and say things like, 'You're so ugly.' \nLyla, whose father is Danish businessman Sten Bertelsen, is studying communication and digital media at Madrid's IE University, while Esme did an art history degree at Bristol. \nAsked if they're fans of the show, they both replied simultaneously: 'I've never actually watched it.'\nBut they do recall some of their time on sets, as Esme said: 'I remember going to places like Poland or Sweden and doing the European tour things.\nTrinny WoodallNick GrimshawSusannah Constantine\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTrinny Woodall reveals what shocks her most now about noughties hit What Not To Wear after her daughter Lyla admitted she thinks her mother would be 'cancelled' today\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's father given heartbreaking news 'he could be waiting 10 days' before 31-year-old's body can be flown home\n\nAmanda Abbington hits back at Giovanni Pernice as she insists he is 'gaslighting' her following after revealing HIS side of the story in Mail+ interview\n\nBoy band singer shows off dramatically different look after impressive weight loss - as he heads to an early morning gym session \n\nSARAH VINE: This is the real harm that Amanda Abbington has done in her Kafkaesque pursuit of Strictly's Giovanni... and it betrays us all\n\nTrinny Woodall reveals the VERY shocking x-rated comment chat show king Michael Parkinson made to her about a star after interview\n\nLooking to manage your weight more effectively and feel fuller for longer?

Bob Casey has shifted the bulk of his TV advertising to a 30-second spot entitled ‘Independent’ that features a married couple comprising a Republican and Democrat explaining how he ‘bucked Biden to protect fracking and he sided with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China.’\n\nAnd in Wisconsin, Sen. Tammy Baldwin has made a similar move with an ad that emphasizes how she worked with Trump on ensuring U.S. iron and steel is used in infrastructure projects.\n\nBetween them, they spent $650,000 on those two ads in the four days up to Monday, according to an analysis of data collected by AdImpact which monitors election advertising.\n\nThe move is most distinct in Pennsylvania.\n\nFrom Monday, ‘Independent’ was the only advert Casey’s campaign was running in the Erie, Harrisburg, Johnstown and Pittsburgh areas, according to the analysis.\n\nYet in the deep blue Democratic areas of Wilkes-Barre and Philadelphia his campaign is running a different ad, entitled ‘Selling Out America,’ which attacks his opponent. \n\n‘It is like he is running two campaigns, which is not a stupid thing to do,’ said a person familiar with political ad buying.\n\n‘But it is also fair to say that in much of the state his closing message is a pro-Trump message.’ \n\nThe ad includes a 2017 headline linking the Democrat to Trump’s policies. ‘Casey supports Trump’s trade order,’ it says.\n\nThe race is finely poised. A slew of recent polls shows that Republican Dave McCormick has eaten into Casey’s lead.\n\nOn Monday, the Cook Political Report moved the race from ‘lean Democratic’ to ‘toss up.’\n\nAt the same time, Harris and Trump are running neck and neck in the contest for Pennsylvania’s 19 Electoral College votes, which could be the decisive prize in the battle for the White House.\n\nMcCormick said it showed Casey knew Harris was a bad candidate for Pennsylvania.\n\n‘Kamala Harris is a San Francisco liberal out of touch with Pennsylvania,’ he told Fox News.\n\n‘Ban fracking, defund the police, mandatory buybacks of guns, the list goes on and on in her own words. President trump is gaining real momentum.’\n\nBerwood Yost, director of the Center for Public Opinion Research at Franklin and Marshall College, said Casey’s strategy made sense in a state where economic concerns were front of voter minds and where Trump had overwhelming support in dozens of counties. \n\n‘If you’re trying to appeal to some of those voters and to stem your losses, one way to do that is to tout your own independence and your own record,’ he said. \n\n‘And I think that makes complete sense, particularly in Western PA which has moved rapidly and significantly away from Democrats.’ \n\nKate Smart, Casey campaign spokesperson, said: ‘Bob Casey always does what’s right for Pennsylvania, regardless of party. \n\n‘Whether it’s standing up to China or fighting corporate greed, he stands with Pennsylvanians and doesn’t care what any politician has to say about it.’\n\nMeanwhile a similar thing is happening in Wisconsin, where Sen. Tammy Baldwin has stepped up rotation of her ‘Made in America’ ad which balances working with Trump and with Biden.\n\n‘Tammy Baldwin got President Trump to sign her “Made in America ” bill, says a steelworker, before another says: ‘Then she got President Biden to make it permanent.’\n\nIt has edged out another ad, entitled ‘Problem,’ which attacks her opponent in the race. \n\n‘Made in America’ is running at 100 percent in several media markets, including Duluth and Minneapolis.\n\nAnd it has increased its rotation in Milwaukee from 18 percent to 26 percent, 22 percent to 30 percent in Green Bay, 16 percent to 22 percent in Wausau and La Crosse, and 19 percent to 23 percent in Madison.","summary":"Two Democratic senators facing reelection in battleground states are pouring hundreds of&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/democratic-senators-in-crucial-swing-states-spend-large-sums-on-advertisements-supporting-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Democratic-senators-in-key-swing-states-pour-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-22 23:57:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":260720520,"title":"There’s One Main Culprit if Donald Trump Wins","text":"The Electoral College. White racism. Black sexism. President Biden.\n\nShould Kamala Harris lose the presidential election next month, those will be among the more convenient excuses Democrats will offer for falling short in a race against a staggeringly flawed, widely detested opponent. There will also be whispers that she was not the strongest candidate in the first place — that the party would have done better to elevate a more natural political talent like Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.\n\nThere’s truth in all of it. But it lets off the hook the main culprit: the way in which leading liberal voices in government, academia and media practice politics today. Consider its main components.\n\nThe politics of condescension, typified by Barack Obama’s suggestion this month that Black men might be reluctant to vote for Harris because they “just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.” But perhaps those men are responding to something more mundane: Median weekly wages for full-time Black workers rose steeply during Donald Trump’s presidency and essentially stagnated under Biden, according to data from the St. Louis Fed. Why reach for the insulting explanation when a rational one will do?\n\nThe politics of name-calling, which happens every time Trump’s voters are told they are racists, misogynists, weird, phobic, low-information or, most recently, supporters of a fascist — and, by implication, fascists themselves. Aside from being gratuitous and self-defeating — what kind of voter is going to be won over by being called a name? — it’s also mostly wrong. Trump’s supporters overwhelmingly are people who think the Biden-Harris years have been bad for them and the country. Maybe liberals should try to engage the argument without belittling the person.","summary":"They should look at themselves and the way they practice politics.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/opinion/trump-kamala-harris-democrats.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/23/multimedia/22stephens-jlgm/22stephens-jlgm-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-22 23:54:47","author":"Bret Stephens","authors":["Bret Stephens"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.418},{"id":260717456,"title":"Rudy Giuliani ordered to turn over NYC apartment, 26 watches to Georgia election workers","text":"Rudy Giuliani must turn over sports memorabilia and other prized possessions to two Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him, including his New York City apartment, more than two dozen luxury watches and a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall, a judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan also said Giuliani does not have to give the election workers three New York Yankees World Series rings or his Florida condominium — for now — noting those assets are tied up in other litigation.\n\nThe property Giuliani must relinquish is expected to fetch several million dollars for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss. They won the $148 million judgment over Giuliani’s false ballot fraud claims against them related to the 2020 presidential election. They said Giuliani pushed Donald Trump’s lies about the election being stolen, which led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.\n\nUnder Tuesday's order, Giuliani must turn over within seven days his Manhattan apartment, estimated at more than $5 million, as well his interest in about $2 million that he says Trump's 2020 presidential campaign owes him for his services.\n\nAlso on the list of assets that must be given to Freeman and Moss are a 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL 500 previous owned by Bacall, a shirt and picture signed, respectively, by Yankees legends Joe DiMaggio and Reggie Jackson, a signed Yankee Stadium picture, a diamond ring, costume jewelry and 26 watches, including a Rolex, five Shinolas, two Bulovas and a Tiffany & Co.\n\nIn court documents filed earlier this year, Giuliani estimated the worth of the Mercedes at about $25,000, and the watches, World Series rings and costume jewelry at about $30,000. He said the value of his sports memorabilia was unknown.\n\nOne of those watches was given to Giuliani by his grandfather and he asked that he be allowed to keep it because of its sentimental value. But Liman rejected the request, saying Giuliani could have had it exempted if he proved it was worth less than $1,000 but he did not do so. The judge added, “However painful the circumstances, a party cannot claim that every family heirloom should be exempt.”\n\nLiman wrote that Giuliani's surrendering of the assets to Freeman and Moss would “ensure that the liquidation of the transferred assets is accomplished quickly and consistently by the Plaintiffs’ chosen counsel, maximizing the sale value of the unique and intangible items and therefore increasing the likelihood of satisfaction of the Plaintiffs’ judgment.”\n\nLawyers for Giuliani did not immediately return email messages on Tuesday.\n\nTo date, Giuliani has not paid Freeman and Moss anything.\n\n“We are proud that our clients will finally begin to receive some of the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani’s actions,” Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss, said in a statement. “This outcome should send a powerful message that there is a price to pay for those who choose to intentionally spread disinformation.”\n\nGiuliani had asked the judge to bar Freeman and Moss from selling any of his assets until after his appeal of the $148 million judgment is completed. Liman also turned down that request, saying Giuliani could have asked the federal court in Washington, D.C., where Freeman and Moss won their defamation case, to stay any asset sales pending his appeal, but did not.\n\n“The Court also does not doubt that certain of the items may have sentimental value to Defendant,” the judge wrote. “But that does not entitle Defendant to continued enjoyment of the assets to the detriment of the Plaintiffs to whom he owes approximately $150 million. It is, after all, the underlying policy of these New York statutes that ‘no man should be permitted to live at the same time in luxury and in debt.’”\n\nAs for the World Series rings, Giuliani's son, Andrew, filed court documents earlier this month saying he actually is the rightful owner. He said his father gave him four rings — one for each of the Yankees’ championships in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 — as gifts in 2018. Rudy Giuliani received the rings during his tenure as mayor of New York City. The younger Giuliani's claim is pending in federal court in Manhattan.\n\nFreeman and Moss also asked Liman to order Rudy Giuliani to turn over his condo in Palm Beach, Florida, estimated to be worth more than $3 million. But that property is tied up in other litigation, with Giuliani claiming it should be exempt because it is his primary residence. Freeman and Moss have a lien on the Florida property.\n\nLiman said he would take up the Florida condo at a hearing set for Oct. 28, and he barred Rudy Giuliani from selling the property or taking any action that would diminish its value in the meantime.\n\nAfter the $148 million verdict, Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, which froze attempts by Freeman and Moss to collect the award. But a judge in July threw out the case citing repeated “uncooperative conduct,” including a failure to comply with court orders and disclose sources of income.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Klein is the president of the university's College Republicans chapter, and Charkas is the president of its College Democrats chapter.In the battleground state of Pennsylvania, where former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck and neck, these two college seniors are putting participation over party.\"On Penn State's campus, and I imagine many others, there's not a very good relationship between people who are very partisan. We wanted to break that trend,\" Charkas said.About 41 million Gen Zers will be eligible to vote in this year's presidential election, eight million of them for the very first time, according to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.But turnout will be key. In 2022, only about 30% of 18-year-olds registered to vote, according to the U.S. Census. In both presidential elections and midterms since the 1960s, voter turnout among 18 to 24-year-olds has been far below any other age group. But today's youngest voters make up a quarter of the population — enough to tip the scales come November.\"It's all about turnout,\" said Stacy Rosenberg, a professor who teaches policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \"Young people need to remember that it doesn't matter how many social media posts they make, or how many protests that they attend. If they don't actually show up to vote, their voice won't be heard.\"According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, 66% of 18 to 24-year-olds associate with the Democratic Party, compared with 34% who align with the GOP. But some in this age group say issues like jobs, abortion and education drive them to the polls — not political parties. \"Younger voters often don't feel very positive about the future, and that's just the reality of being an adolescent,\" said Penn State senior Fi Montany, who's voting in her first presidential election.When asked whether politicians understand her generation, Montany said, \"Straight up, no. I think we are just so different as a generation. We know what matters to us. We're not tying it to just one candidate, critiquing a candidate while appreciating the things that they do.\"With the election now just weeks away, Klein and Charkas hope their partnership can set an example from their college campus all the way to Washington, D.C.\"We're all citizens first, and so I think we need to put that hat on rather than just being a Republican or a Democrat,\" Klein said.","summary":"In both presidential elections and midterms since the 1960s, voter turnout among 18 to 24-year-olds has been far below any other age group.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pennsylvania-college-students-seek-to-put-voter-participation-over-party/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/22/5a08b276-53a6-4a38-b7fe-4da2b9236db6/thumbnail/1200x630/aa21e6b05024db3e7d8bf95231f7f6c8/1729640846724.png?v=b241b87adbbb7f0a227ed35b96d0cefa","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3284322_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-22 23:49:50","author":"Nancy Chen,Samantha Wender","authors":["Nancy Chen","Samantha Wender"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":260716908,"title":"Man from Ashland County accused of bringing large ‘Trump’ sign to Capitol for use as a weapon by Jan. 6 rioters","text":"An Ashland County man was arrested Tuesday on charges that he brought a massive “Trump” sign to the U.S. Capitol and joined other rioters in using it as a weapon against police officers during a mob attack.\n\nJeffrey Newcomb, 41, of the village of Polk, apparently posted on social media that he brought the custom-made, metal-framed sign to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, “because bullets are expensive,” according to an FBI agent’s affidavit. The sign was approximately 8 feet tall and 10 feet wide, with wheels the size of a person’s head, the affidavit says.\n\nIn March 2023, a message posted on a Twitter account linked to Newcomb included photos of the sign in the crowd of Donald Trump supporters who gathered outside the Capitol on Jan. 6. In one photo, the account’s user obscured his face with an emoji.\n\n“Went to Jan 6th to peacefully protest in the loudest way possible: With a 13 ft by 10 ft signs on custom made aluminum wagon. I spent $700 on this. Keeping my identity a secret because bullets are expensive,” the post said.\n\nThe account on Twitter, now called X, has since been deleted.\n\nSeveral other Capitol riot defendants have been charged with using the large Trump sign as a battering ram to assault officers and breach police lines outside the Capitol.\n\nNewcomb was expected to make his initial court appearance on Tuesday in Ohio after his arrest in Polk. Court records didn’t immediately name an attorney representing him.\n\nNewcomb is charged in a criminal complaint with felony charges of assaulting police and interfering with law-enforcement officers during a civil disorder.\n\nVideos show Newcomb moving his large sign near Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6. Other rioters helped him carry the sign into the mob on the Capitol’s West Plaza.\n\n“Rioters cheered the sign’s arrival and many in the crowd helped pass the sign closer and closer to the police line,” the FBI agent wrote.\n\nNewcomb let go of the sign just before other rioters shoved it into a police line. But he pushed on the backs of other rioters who continued to push it toward police, the agent said.\n\n“As the police were struck by the sign, they easily could have been knocked over due to the frame’s sheer size, and the sharp edges and corners were readily capable of causing slicing or splitting injuries,” the agent wrote. “It ultimately took over a dozen officers to fully move the sign away from the line.”\n\nMore than 1,500 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Approximately 1,200 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials decided by judges and juries. And over 1,000 of the defendants have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving a term of imprisonment ranging from a few days to 22 years.","summary":"Jeffrey Newcomb, of the village of Polk, apparently posted on social media&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/man-from-ashland-county-accused-of-bringing-large-trump-sign-to-capitol-for-use-as-a-weapon-by-jan-6-rioters/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Ashland-County-man-charged-with-bringing-massive-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-22 23:47:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.488},{"id":260717532,"title":"Harris taping interviews, Trump holding roundtable and rally","text":"Harris taping interviews, Trump holding roundtable and rally\n With exactly two weeks until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris is in Washington, D.C., for multiple one-on-one interviews with media outlets.

Unlike most musicians, he’s a huge Donald Trump supporter, so they’re of course happy to have him. He’s even played at a CPAC event! Here he is with Jerry Falwell Jr., Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle in 2019.\n\nWe’d probably never have heard of the musical stylings of Zach Radcliff — we aren’t exactly in the demo. Except now he’s on our radar because he’s been charged with some truly horrific crimes.\n\nThe 29-year-old singer is also a youth pastor at Oakwood Church in Augusta Township, Michigan — at least he was. Not anymore. See, he was charged Sunday with multiple child sex crimes. Yeah…\n\nRadcliff was arraigned on two counts each of aggravated child sexually abusive activity and child sexually abusive activity, as well as six counts of using the internet to communicate with another to commit a crime. That last one is, as you may have guessed, about CSAM.\n\nMichigan State Police began investigating Radcliff just this month when they were made aware of allegations he had solicited child sexually abusive material from a minor. They searched his home and office, finding evidence of acts of child sexual abuse — of multiple victims.\n\nRadcliff worked as the music and youth director at Oakwood Church — kind of an inherited position as his father is the senior pastor. He allegedly used his position there to try to coerce minors into sexual activity. Per a charging document obtained by Law&Crime, the alleged victims were between the ages of 13 and 15. The crimes go all the way back to 2014, when Radcliff was just 19 years old. So he’s been at this a long time — presumably including when he wrote his conservative anthem I’ll Stand.\n\nHis father’s church first suspended him when made aware of the allegations. Later they fired him completely. In a statement Monday, they wrote:\n\n“We received some very disturbing news about our music and youth director, Zachary Radcliff who is also the son of our senior pastor, Frank Radcliff. We realized while talking to him that there was more to the situation than was being expressed. He was suspended with pay on October 3rd, pending further investigation.”\n\nIt sounds like he tried to talk his way out of it. We wonder if he called it a WITCH HUNT. The statement continued:\n\n“More information was given to us on Saturday, October 12th, at 4:00 in the afternoon. Pastoral staff met with our church that evening and Sunday morning. Zach was terminated from his job, without pay effective Saturday, October 12th.”\n\nThe church hinted there was more, writing:\n\n“The information that we received was shocking. We were told that Zachary had been soliciting inappropriate photos and possibly videos from teens. We have also heard other stories. This information has ripped our hearts apart.”\n\nSounds like they’ve heard even more details than have been made public by the police. They then defended the church, saying:\n\n“The safety and protection of the individuals in our church is what is paramount to us. We are devoted to doing what we can for the care of the victims of these crimes. Every one of our staff members and individuals working with our children, teens, and adults go through background checks. We do our level best to make sure all are protected.”\n\nReally? The pastor’s son went through a background check? How did that go? Well, we guess we know since they let him work there and allegedly try to sexually abuse children for several years.\n\nApropos of nothing, we’d just like to point out that Zach Radcliff is not a drag queen, nor a member of the LGBT community. Nope.\n\nAnother. Youth.

In a second ad by the Democratic Majority for Israel, Trump’s past associations with antisemites and neo-Nazis is put out in the open and questioned.\n\nThe RJC ad begins with three women seated at a deli. “Did you watch the news lately?” one asks. “Israel’s under attack … antisemitism like I never thought I would see.” A second woman notes that a friend’s son was spit on because he’s Jewish.\n\n“What about Kamala?” the third woman asks. “Oh, busy defending The Squad” is the answer, a reference to the progressive group of Congresswomen and friends Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, as well as former Rep. Cori Bush.\n\nOne of the women in the ad admits that she never liked Trump, but feels “safe” with him, while another adds, “I never voted Republican in my life, but I am voting Trump.”\n\nRegulars of the real-life deli where the video was shot have called out its owners for allowing the spot — or any political ad, for that matter — to be shot there. Hymie’s is well-known in Philadelphia, and owner/operator Lou Barson defended the decision to Philadelphia Magazine.\n\n“Only a person who eats at Hymie’s would know this was shot at Hymie’s,” Barson said. “This is not a statement that Hymie’s is endorsing Donald Trump. That is not the case. I would gladly let Kamala Harris film an ad here tomorrow.”\n\nThe RJC has spent a reported $15 million on ads across swing states.\n\nThe new ad echoed another the same PAC aired during the presidential debate in September. “Kamala Harris embraces and defends The Squad, even after Ilhan Omar made disgusting antisemitic comments,” the clip said. “Kamala Harris joined The Squad in sympathizing with antisemitic, anti-Israel protests.”\n\n“Kamala Harris is no ordinary Democrat. She stands with The Squad, not with us,” it continued.\n\nMeanwhile, the 3-minute ad by the DMI takes a different approach. “Let’s talk about Donald Trump and Israel. This is a guy with a long history of supporting antisemites, as long as they support him,” the other ad begins. That introduction is followed by a list of Trump’s offenses, including his defense of white nationalist protestors in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2018, as well as his robust support for those involved in the Capitol Insurrection in January 2021 — a group that included known antisemites.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee’s associations with open white supremacist Nick Fuentes and controversial rapper Kanye West — who tweeted in 2022 that he was about to go “def con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE” — are also examined, as well as his relationship with Charlie Kirk, the RNC speaker who has long been suspected of antisemitism.\n\n“What happens if Trump wins?” the ad asks. “He says he’s going to go much further than he did last time; blow up NATO, abandon Ukraine. He’s questioned defending Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.”\n\n“Should we as Jews really believe that this alliance with Israel holds a special place in Trump’s heart? What if the Israelis dump Bibi and elect someone more centrist?” the video continues. “What if the Saudis and the Qatari who are literally funding the Trump family want something that goes against Israel’s interest? Will Trump stand with Israel then?”","summary":"\"I never voted Republican in my life, but I am voting Trump,\" a woman in one political ad tells her friends\n\n\nThe post Dems Tie Trump to Antisemites, Republicans Tie Harris to the Squad in Dueling Ads From Jewish PACs | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/jewish-pacs-political-ads-harris-trump-antisemitism/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/trump-harris-ads.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-22 23:43:04","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.054},{"id":260717166,"title":"Court rejects appeal from leader of ‘Cowboys for Trump’ for involvement in January 6 events","text":"A federal court of appeals on Tuesday denied a prominent Jan. 6 defendant’s effort to overturn his misdemeanor trespass conviction.\n\nMarch 2022 saw the conviction of Couy Griffin, the individual behind the group “Cowboys for Trump” and a previous New Mexico county commissioner.

Trump’s brand is the guy you might not like or admire, but you know he won’t hold back and he’s never afraid to go there.\n\nPeople first took it as Trumpian exaggeration when he said on the debate stage, “She did things that nobody would ever think of. Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this.”\n\nBut Trump’s got the goods, and Harris served it up on a silver platter. In 2019, her first presidential campaign said she’d do exactly that in answer to an American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire.\n\nThe ad includes a clip of Harris herself at a National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund event pledging “surgery for prisoners — every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access.”\n\n“It’s hard to believe but it’s true. Even the liberal media was shocked,” the ad intones, running through confirmations from CNN, ABC, PBS and The New York Times. Even Politifact grudgingly rated the claim “Mostly True.”\n\nBetween the Trump campaign and an outside super PAC, this and similar ads ran over 60,000 times in the first two weeks of October, at a cost of more than $20 million.\n\nThe ads have been especially ubiquitous in college and pro football broadcasts and the baseball playoffs — a good way to reach voters (especially men) who don’t consume a ton of political news.\n\nDemocratic partisans have cried foul at Trump pressing a culture-war hot button when bigger issues like the economy, national security and the rule of law are at stake.\n\nBut that rings hollow when Harris and Tim Walz can’t say three words without talking about abortion, which has been the centerpiece of most Democratic ads this cycle.\n\nBoth parties know well that voters judge candidates by their values more than by their platforms, which often don’t survive past Election Day. And cultural issues are easy to understand and hard to conceal behind a mass of statistics and bill details.\n\nIn 1988, for example, Michael Dukakis ran on “competence, not ideology,” but George H.W. Bush focused on the Pledge of Allegiance and prison furloughs for violent criminals.\n\nIt’s not just a slogan\n\nBetween that and Dukakis giving a cold-fish answer when asked if he’d rethink the death penalty if his wife was raped, voters concluded that they didn’t care if Dukakis was competent or not — they didn’t like his values.\n\nMoreover, we live in an age when woke politics is often a distraction from the government doing its jobs: safe streets, secure borders, kids taught to read.\n\nThe ad’s closing graphic suggests that Trump has better priorities than this madness: “Trump: Lower Taxes, Bigger Paychecks for Workers.”\n\nAs elections analyst Dave Wasserman notes, the ad “plays into those undecided voters’ fear that Harris is too liberal.” Some versions of the ad label her “Crazy liberal Kamala.”\n\nA proposal like this shows voters that this isn’t just a slogan.

Lawmakers agreed not to table any amendments to speed up the final approval in the Council, where it already got the preliminary green light.\n\n“This is another historic moment,” said European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who welcomed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the hemicycle last week.\n\n“With this vote, we’re sending a very strong message that we’re using profits from Russian frozen assets for Ukraine, and Russia, as an aggressor, must and will pay for its destruction,” she added, as an unidentified man heckled from afar.\n\nNotably, the proposed loan gathered the support of several far-right lawmakers, who tend to oppose providing military and financial assistance to Ukraine. (The €35 billion will be undesignated, meaning Kyiv will spend it as it sees fit, including on weapons.)\n\nOver 20 MEPs of the far-right Patriots for Europe (PfE) voted in favour of the credit, while almost 40, including its president, Jordan Bardella, chose to abstain. Bardella was among the group leaders who met with Zelenskyy last week.\n\nOnly seven of the PfE’s 86 MEPs voted against the legal text.\n\nThe numbers represent a modest contrast compared to the resolution in support of Ukraine that the Patriots largely voted down in July.\n\nHowever, the Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN) group, the most radical, disruptive force to the right, reaffirmed their hostility and moved in unison against the loan.\n\nThe vast majority of the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, which is dominated by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy and Poland’s Law and Justice, endorsed the initiative, as they have done with other Ukraine-related files in the past.\n\nNo lawmakers from the the centrist factions, the European People’s Party (EPP), the Socialists & Democrats (S&D) and Renew Europe, voted against Tuesday’s text.\n\nOrbán’s latest veto\n\nThe Parliament’s widely-expected blessing paves the way for a rapid roll-out of the loan.\n\nOnce the Council gives its final approval, the European Commission will be allowed to raise the money on the market and begin disbursements to Kyiv in early 2025.\n\nBut some of the puzzle pieces are still missing.\n\nThe €35 billion credit is designed to be the EU’s share of a wider G7 initiative to provide Ukraine with a €45 billion loan ($50 billion) in immediate financial relief. The windfall profits of the Russian frozen assets will be leveraged to cover the gradual payments and interest rates, exempting Kyiv’s and the West’s coffers.\n\nUnder EU law, the sanctions on Russia have to be renewed every six months, which makes it possible for a single country to stop the move, unfreeze the assets and throw the G7 loan into disarray. Fearing a Hungarian veto, Washington demanded a longer renewal period to increase the stability and predictability of the untested scheme.\n\nBrussels then proposed renewing the sanctions on the frozen assets every three years (36 months) but Hungary said it would block any changes to the sanctions regime until Americans elect their next president on 5 November. (Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has said he would celebrate Donald Trump’s victory with “several bottles of champagne.”)\n\nDiplomats scoffed at Budapest’s argument, calling it counterproductive as the more the EU contributes to the G7 plan, the higher the risk for the common budget. \n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the US has indicated its readiness to shoulder €18 billion ($20 billion), even if Orbán keeps his veto in place. The concession could bring the EU’s share down from €35 billion to €18 billion, with both sides at equal parts.\n\nThe United Kingdom, Japan and Canada will put up the rest of the money. London has announced that it will contribute £2.26 billion (€2.7 billion, $3 billion), while Ottawa said it would contribute 5 billion Canadian dollars (€3.3 billion, $3.6 billion).\n\nFurther details on how much each ally will contribute are expected after G7 financial ministers meet in Washington later this week.","summary":"The proposed loan for Ukraine split the far-right Patriots for Europe (PfE) group, with some of its members voting in favour and others against.

The episodes, which usually feature lengthy conversations between Rogan and a guest, regularly run more than two and a half to three hours.Politico first reported on Tuesday that Trump was set to appear on the show, citing a person familiar with the matter. The outlet reported the episode was scheduled to tape on Friday at Rogan's studio in Austin, Texas. Several other outlets confirmed the panned appearance.Representatives for Trump and Rogan did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.Rogan has not endorsed a candidate in the 2024 election. After Rogan made positive comments about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. when he was still in the race, Trump wrote on Truth Social in August that Rogan would be \"BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring.\"In 2022, Rogan said he was not a Trump supporter \"in any way, shape, or form.\" He also said he turned down opportunities to have Trump on his show. \"I don't want to help him. I'm not interested in helping him,\" Rogan said at the time.On an episode of his show in September, Rogan said Trump was not a \"dictator\" as president despite what critics feared. He also said during Trump's presidency \"the economy really did well and he really did try to cut some of the bullshit down that's going on in this country.\" Though in reference to Trump's personality he added, \"We don't necessarily want that as the guy with his finger on the button.\"The Rogan interview would be Trump's latest appearance on a podcast that primarily caters to a specific block of potential voters who generally like him but don't necessarily show up to the polls: young men. In recent months Trump has also sat down with popular podcasters Lex Fridman, Theo Von, and Shawn Ryan.Though young voters generally appear to favor Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump polls better with young men. New York Times/Siena polls conducted in six swing states in August found young men, aged 18 to 29, supported Trump by 13 points. In contrast the polls found young women supported Harris by 38 points.However young people often have relatively low voter turnout, with an estimated 50% of potential voters aged 18 to 29 actually casting a vote in 2020, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. Meanwhile, men across age groups are less likely to vote than women.Alison Dagnes, a political scientist and professor in political media at Shippensburg University, said that lower voter turnout explains why Trump is going on all these male-centric podcasts: mobilization.\"He's doing 'Get out the vote,'\" Dagnes said, adding she thinks Trump sees young men as his bread-and-butter. \"He's not trying to get one more person to like him. He's trying to get the people who like him to get out, and that's why he's going on Joe Rogan.\"In contrast, Dagnes said Harris's recent media strategy appeared to be more focused on persuasion, or winning over voters who may not be sold on her. She pointed to the wider range of outlets Harris has appeared on, including \"The View,\" Alex Cooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast,\" Howard Stern, and Fox News.Harris was reportedly in talks to appear on Rogan's podcast, but nothing has been confirmed. Meanwhile, Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" said she also invited Trump to appear on her show, which overwhelmingly caters to young women.Dagnes said both candidates' media strategies this election cycle shows just how much the media landscape has changed, and she expects podcasts to continue to play a role in elections going forward.","summary":"Joe Rogan's interview with Donald Trump would be the former president's latest appearance on a podcast that attracts young men.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-joe-rogan-interview-podcast-young-male-voters-2024-10","image":"https://i.insider.com/67182a4f01ea6d83dee34e85?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-22 23:31:13","author":"Kelsey Vlamis","authors":["Kelsey Vlamis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":260716180,"title":"A$AP Rocky’s Gun Assault Trial Delayed to January","text":"A$AP Rocky’s criminal trial over charges he opened fire on his former friend A$AP Relli was pushed from mid-November to late January on Tuesday, shielding the musician’s previously announced headlining gig at Rolling Loud Thailand.\n\n A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge agreed to move the expected 10-day trial to Jan. 21, 2025, from its previously scheduled Nov. 12 start date after the rapper’s lawyer, Joe Tacopina, asked for the delay, citing the musician’s travel commitment, the Thanksgiving holiday and a pending issue with evidence. The delay was confirmed after Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec asked for a recess and returned to say Relli “tentatively” accepted the new date during a phone call.\n\n “Do you expect the mother of his children is going to be here?” Judge Mark S. Arnold asked Tacopina, referring to Rihanna. The judge already had ordered that Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, must attend jury selection and each day of the trial even though he’s out on bond and given his lawyers’ permission to appear on his behalf. Tacopina said he wasn’t sure if Rihanna, who shares two young sons with Mayers, would be making any courtroom cameos. “Can you find out if she’s going to attend every day, no days, some days?” the judge asked, apparently concerned about possible security measures.\n\n “I don’t know that at this point…I can almost guarantee you it’s not going to be every day,” Tacopina responded. He cited the couple’s children, ages two and one, as a potential barrier to her attendance. “If she wants to come, she’s welcome to come. If she can’t come, that’s fine,” Judge Arnold said.\n\n After the hearing, Tacopina said Mayers knew he might have to scrap his trip to Thailand, including the Nov. 22 Rolling Loud headlining spot, if the judge refused to change the trial date. “He’s eager to get to this trial as quickly as possible. Having this hanging over his head is not something he wants,” Tacopina told Rolling Stone as he left the courtroom. “If the judge said no, we would have been here on the 12th.” He said he was grateful the judge was “accommodating” to the “real-life circumstance” of his client’s profession.\n\n “I’m confident, knowing the evidence, that he will be vindicated,” Tacopina continued outside the courthouse. “He’s ready to face this head on, and he’ll be okay when this is all said and done.” The lawyer said any decision about Rihanna’s attendance was “not my call.”\n\n “It’s a family decision they have to make. She obviously is a very well-known, very important person. She also has two young children that I think she wants to shield from all this, and she takes care of,” he added. “Obviously she has a lot of professional obligations of her own. I can tell you she loves and supports him, that’s without question. I’ve seen that live and in color.” He said he appreciated Judge Arnold making it clear he would “accommodate” Rihanna’s possible attendance. “It was nice that he went out of his way to welcome her. It just shows the kind of person he is,” Tacopina said.\n\n Mayers, 36, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. If convicted as charged, he faces up to 24 years in prison. At a preliminary hearing last November, prosecutors showed video of the alleged Nov. 6, 2021 gun assault, claiming Mayers fired a weapon at the corner of Selma Ave. and Vista Del Mar Ave. in Hollywood after confronting Relli, born Terell Ephron, near a parking garage about a block away.\n\n Surveillance footage from the parking garage captured the start of the altercation, prosecutors said. It showed Mayers and Ephron involved in a physical struggle. According to prosecutors, separate grainy video shot by a different building’s security system a block away shows the moment Mayers allegedly discharged a weapon. The video is difficult to make out, a police witness acknowledged. There is no obvious muzzle flash and no sound, only figures appearing to scatter at the same time. Surveillance clips recovered from other nearby buildings captured loud noises and then a man identified by prosecutors as Mayers rounding a corner and slowing down to a walk. Prosecutors claim the loud cracks were the alleged shots.\n\n An LAPD detective testified last November that the video from the parking garage showed Mayers with a gun in his hands. Under cross examination, Det. Frank Flores testified that no weapons were ever recovered in the case. The detective said the video of the alleged shooting was inconclusive because “(There’s) nothing clear that shows it,” meaning the purported gunfire. The detective claimed that “collectively,” the videos tell a plausible story, but Tacopina pushed back. “I’m not asking for opinion,” Tacopina interrupted, asking again if the video showed a shooting. “Nothing definitively shows,” the detective answered.\n\n “The court agrees with the defense that you don’t see an actual shooting on the video. Later, in another section of video, you do hear two shots,” Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge M.L. Villar said last November as she found probable cause to send the case to trial. Judge Villar said she believed “tempers were heightened on both sides” during the incident. In addition to the video evidence, the judge said she considered the extensive testimony by Relli regarding the alleged shooting and his belief he was grazed by a bullet on his left hand. “In any event, Mr. Ephron does what appears to be a dance around the other individuals to avoid being shot. His testimony is that he was shot,” Judge Villar said.\n\n Tacopina – an aggressive defense lawyer known for representing high-profile clients including Meek Mill, YG, and Donald Trump – has suggested Relli perjured himself when he denied during his testimony that he asked for millions of dollars to make the criminal case disappear. “He swore under oath (that) no, he did not. That’s not going to bode well for him at trial,” Tacopina said last year.\n\n In his full day of testimony last November, Ephron claimed he was the victim of an armed ambush orchestrated by the Grammy-nominated “Praise The Lord” rapper. Ephron testified that he sent Mayers an embittered text on Oct. 28, 2021, days before the alleged shooting, because he believed Mayers had become “big-headed” and failed to deliver on a promise to pay funeral expenses for one of their friends. “You so fucking fake it’s sad,” the text shown to the judge read. Mayers never responded, he testified. (Under cross-examination, Ephron said he eventually learned Mayers paid for the entire funeral.)\n\n Ephron told the court he was the one who brought Mayers into the A$AP fold when they were high school students in New York. According to Ephron, Mayers reached out to him directly the night of the alleged assault and set up the face-to-face meeting. Ephron testified that Mayers pulled out a firearm during their initial confrontation and threatened, “I’ll kill you right now.” Ephron said he dared Mayers to follow through. “Shoot that shit. Why you brought a gun if you’re not going to use it? You don’t scare me,” Ephron allegedly told Mayers. He claimed Mayers eventually turned around and fired an initial shot that “grazed” his hand about a block away. He said Mayers fired two or three more times before fleeing the scene. He said he returned later that night and found two 9mm shell casings that he photographed and gave to police.\n\n Mayers also is fighting a lawsuit brought by Ephron alleging assault, battery, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. As first reported by Rolling Stone, the civil complaint filed in August 2022 unmasked Ephron as the alleged victim in the shooting investigation that led to Mayers’ arrest in April 2022.\n\n Tacopina previously told Rolling Stone that his client was the victim of a failed shakedown. “Rocky didn’t shoot him by any stretch,” Tacopina said, calling the assault allegation a “false scenario” at the heart of “a plain and blatant classic attempt at extortion.” The lawyer said Ephron had been badgering Mayers for money and initiated a physical altercation at the meeting in question.\n\n “He’s a failed associate — ex-associate — of Rocky’s, and he’s jealous,” Tacopina said of Ephron. “He was trying to get money from Rocky. He wanted Rocky to support him. He made it clear. There were repeated attempts where he tried to ask for money in lieu of not causing problems for Rocky. That’s what he said. We have all this memorialized in text messages and otherwise, so it’s an extortion.”\n\n Ephron’s former civil lawyers Jamal Tooson and Brian Hurwitz previously told Rolling Stone that the case against Mayers was “thoroughly investigated by both law enforcement and the Los Angeles District Attorney prior to the decision to not only arrest A$AP Rocky but charge him.” Ephron’s new lawyer on the civil case, Camille Vasquez, is the attorney who represented Johnny Depp in his defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard. Vasquez and Ephron went on to file a second civil complaint against Mayers that alleges he and Tacopina defamed Ephron with the extortion allegation.\n\n At the hearing in the criminal case Tuesday, Judge Arnold said he planned to instruct potential jurors that Mayers’ celebrity should not affect the trial. “I will talk about how no one is entitled to anything, or should be punished, for their status, whether they’re rich or poor or famous or not famous,” Judge Arnold said. “The law applies to everybody in the exact same way, so the fact that Mr. Mayers is a celebrity is not going to inure to his detriment, and it’s not going to inure to his detriment. He’s going to be treated like anybody else.”","summary":"A$AP Rocky’s criminal trial over charges he opened fire on his former friend A$AP Relli was pushed from mid-November to late January on Tuesday, shielding the musician’s previously announced headlining gig at Rolling Loud Thailand.

The former president sat on the show's white couch with what appeared to be a dark cloth underneath. The small detail ignited a flurry of reactions on X (formerly Twitter). Journalist Aaron Rupar, posted, \"Seeing folks tweeting that Trump was sitting on a towel during his Fox & Friends interview this morning. It's very funny but not true. It's his jacket. Here's a video showing it.\"\n\nThe explanation, however, was met with immediate pushback from skeptical netizens who argued otherwise. \"What's underneath him looks black while his jacket is blue though,\" noted an X user, @ArtCandee. Another individual, @JosephRBarbour, echoed, \"You are totally wrong. Look at the second segment clips. That is not his jacket.\"\n\n\"You be the judge...Was there a time gap between sitting down and the actual interview? Or did his jacket somehow slip lower?\" questioned @kutrinet. In response, @CollaroyDavid suggested, \"Might explain the length of his jacket - built-in protection. Nothing to be ashamed of. Have his shoes fallen off lately?\" Others were, however, more critical.\n\n\"Yep, it's one of those long jackets on Trump's oversized suits, worn to hide his fat body! Trump could also be using it to cover any embarrassing smells when sitting,\" posted @BeeBopping591. Meanwhile, @thejohnbronson focused on Trump's physical appearance. \"Interesting to look at their heights -- we have always known this idiot is not 6 feet 4 inches. Ainsley [Earhardt] is maybe 5 feet 8 inches. It seems Trump has been slouching big time lately. He's simply diminishing in all areas.\"\n\n\"It was a shit stain towel and everybody knows it. His diaper was full!!\" declared @itsmejimmyp, bluntly, while @jordanwags added, \"Haha, that is not his jacket! Unless he is truly that fat that his jacket is that big.\" \"Oh look!\" tweeted one observer, \"They need to put a towel down under Trump so that his...leakage doesn't stain the white sofa.\" Another echoed, \"Fox & Friends made Trump sit on a towel so he wouldn't poop on the couch.\"\n\nEarly footage of the interview shows Trump getting his microphone attached with nothing visible on the couch. When he sits down, his jacket is spread out in a way that could create the illusion of a separate dark cloth. However, later segments of the interview show what appears to be a wider, more square-shaped dark area that some argue doesn't match the cut of a typical suit jacket.\n\nFollowing the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner the previous evening, which ran late into the night, Trump appeared notably tired during the early morning broadcast, as per The List. At 78, Trump would be the oldest president ever to take office if elected in November. His medical records have been a source of ongoing controversy, with the candidate choosing to release a doctor's letter attesting to his good health rather than detailed test results.","summary":"During a recent interview, the former president sat on a white couch with what appeared to be a dark cloth underneath.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-sitting-on-a-supposed-black-towel-has-netizens-crying-something-stinks-his-diaper-was-full","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/721270/uploads/eed0d770-9067-11ef-8726-5536c2313581_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-22 23:30:20","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":260718566,"title":"'Will absolutely make sure his enemies pay': Trump has made 100+ direct threats during 2024 campaign","text":"When Sen.

In one recent interview, Trump said that if 'radical-left lunatics' disrupt the election, 'it should be very easily handled by — if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military.'\"\n\nThe NPR reporter continues, \"That statement, on Fox News, was not the first time Trump has expressed support for using government force against domestic political rivals. Since 2022, when he began preparing for the presidential campaign, Trump has issued more than 100 threats to investigate, prosecute, imprison or otherwise punish his perceived opponents, NPR has found.\"\n\nDreisbach cites a variety of threats made by Trump, from saying that Harris \"should be impeached and prosecuted\" during a rally in September to saying, on a June 30 post on Truth Social, that former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) is \"guilty of treason\" and should face \"televised military tribunals.\" At a rally in January, Trump called for New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Judge Arthur Engoron to be \"arrested and punished.\" \n\nREAD MORE: 'Endorsing a coup': 3 in 10 Republicans support 'patriot' violence to 'save our country'\n\nMoreover, Trump suggested that Gen.

Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, and The Lincoln Project's Fred Wellman have said the same thing.\n\nGrisham told NPR, \"I absolutely think he will follow up on those threats. I just know that once he's in office with no guardrails, no reason to worry about reelection, and only the most fervent, loyal people surrounding him, he will absolutely make sure his enemies pay for what he perceives to be their crimes.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'I'm out of here': Michael Cohen plans to avoid MAGA reprisal by going abroad if Trump wins","summary":"When Sen.
