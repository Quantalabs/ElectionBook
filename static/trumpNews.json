Lennon took to the platform after the Republican presidential nominee posted: ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT’ to Truth Social following the popstar’s official endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, declaring: ‘Hating on Taylor Swift is not a good look.’ Lennon, 48, said although he has never been a fan of Swift’s music, he acknowledges she is a ‘uniquely successful American.’ ‘A young woman who has done things in a way that no one has done before her. She is the kind of American that should be respected and in fact treasured,’ he wrote in the lengthy post. ‘We need more not less Taylor Swifts in our world. People who thrive continually and consistently are exactly the kind of person both parties should embrace,’ he urged. He then declared it is ‘not a good look’ for some ‘grumpy old dude’ to get angry at her. ‘A more “presidential” or gracious criticism might have been something like “She is a brilliant young woman. I have a lot of respect for what she has accomplished. I don’t believe she knows the reality of the party she is endorsing. I hope her fans are able to make up their own minds and understand the big difference between a talent in music and an understanding of politics or economics,”‘ he suggested. ‘Old man yells at moon is not a good look,’ he quipped, before saying he wasn’t endorsing either party in the November election. The next day, the late son of John Lennon returned to the platform to share had heard Swift’s 2014 hit Bad Blood – admitting he didn’t love it. ‘I can’t believe I forgot this one but I actually remember a Taylor song called Bad Blood (or something). I remember she rhymed “mad love” with “bad blood” and that kind of made me uncomfortable,’ he wrote in reference to the track. ‘This is only to say that it was not true I don’t know any songs,’ he clarified. ‘I know that one. I have nothing against her. I have a lot of respect for what she has accomplished. I certainly could never do what she does.’ Swift, 34, endorsed Harris and her vice-presidential candidate, Tim Walz, following the presidential debate on September 10. ‘I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,’ she wrote on an Instagram post. Swift signed her backing of Harris with ‘Childless Cat Lady,’ in reference to Trump’s running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, who said in a 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson that the U.S. is being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and ‘a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.’ The singer has a massive fanbase of Swifties and more than 283 million followers on Instagram. Her post endorsing Harris was liked more than nine million times in less than a day and could help drive support for Democrats. Previous posts from the star urging people to register to vote have been directly linked to an uptick in registrations as some of her biggest supporters closely monitor her every word. Trump responded to the endorsement saying he is ‘not a Taylor Swift fan.’ ‘I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time. She couldn’t… you couldn’t possibly endorse Biden. You look at Biden. You couldn’t possibly endorse him,’ he said on Fox & Friends the day after the presidential debate last week. He called Swift a ‘very liberal’ person and tried to brush off her backing Harris.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAlthough John Lennon&#8217;s son thinks Donald Trump should Shake It Off, he does admit he&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: John Lennon&#8217;s Son Opens Up About the Taylor Swift Lyric That Made Him Feel &#8216;Uncomfortable&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/john-lennons-son-opens-up-about-the-taylor-swift-lyric-that-made-him-feel-uncomfortable/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-John-Lennons-son-reveals-the-Taylor-Swift.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 00:16:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":256741420,"title":"US Fed cuts key lending rate by jumbo half percentage point","text":"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by half of a percentage point, the first cut in 4 1/2 years, in a major policy shift less than seven weeks away from the presidential election. After the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the central bank announced the decision to reduce the rate to the 4.75 to 5.0 percent range from its 23-year high, putting an end to its post-pandemic tightening cycle. FOMC members' new median economic projections showed that the federal funds rate would be cut to 4.4 percent at the end of this year -- a hint that the Fed could further lower the rate later this year. The rate reduction came as inflation has been getting closer to the Fed's target of 2 percent. Last month, annual consumer inflation fell to 2.5 percent. The latest median projections indicated that Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation may fall to 2.3 percent at the end of this year and 2.1 percent at the end of next year. During a press briefing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank has \"in fact begun the cutting cycle now\" while highlighting that the US economy is \"in a good shape.\" \"Our decision today is designed to keep it there. More specifically, the economy is growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and the labor market is still in solid shape. Our intention is really to maintain the strength that we currently see in the US economy,\" the chair said. \"We will do that by returning rates from their high-level ... We're going to move those down over time to a more normal level,\" he added. But he said \"no\" to a question of whether the central bank effectively declared a decisive victory over inflation. \"The goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis. We are close, but we are not really at 2 percent,\" he said. \"We are not saying mission accomplished or anything like that. But I have to say though we're encouraged by the progress that we have made.\" From March 2022 to July last year, the central bank raised the key rate 11 times under an aggressive campaign to cool inflation that hit a peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022. After the hikes, the Fed kept the rate steady eight consecutive times. This week's Fed rate cut put the gap between the key rates of South Korea and the United States at 1.5 percentage points. The timing of the rate cut has been anticipated by both consumers and businesses as it will lower their borrowing costs -- a reason why it has taken on political overtones during the election season. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump opposed a rate reduction close to the general election, saying in a Bloomberg News interview in May, \"It's something that they know they shouldn't be doing.\" But for his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, the rate cut could be a boost for her campaign given that the reduction signals that the fight against inflation has fared well. Mindful of the political discourse, Powell underlined that the Fed is not \"serving any politician\" but is working for \"all Americans.\" \"Countries that are democracies around the world ... all have what are called independent central banks, and the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors, maybe, people who are in office,\" he said. \"I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation. We do work to serve all Americans. We are not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing,\" Powell added. In a social media post, President Joe Biden commented on the rate reduction. \"We just reached an important moment: Inflation and interest rates are falling while the economy remains strong,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"The critics said it couldn't happen – but our policies are lowering costs and creating jobs.\" (Yonhap)","summary":"The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by half of a percentage point, the first cut in 4 1/2 years, in a major policy shift less than seven weeks away from the presidential election.

They’ve only hardened my resolve to use my time on Earth to make America great again for all Americans, to put America first,” said Trump, whose ear was grazed with a bullet at a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania. “It was the second one in eight weeks by a violent radical-left mobster,” the ex-president said. “This evil would-be assassin got within a few 100 yards of where I stood. But thankfully, our outstanding Secret Service agent, and they are outstanding, spotted the barrel of his rifle in the bushes. Can you believe that?” “The reason I’m here,” Trump told the fawning audience, was because “we are going to win New York.” The over-the-moon audience included a woman who flashed her bare breasts while jumping around in the stands — before she was escorted out by police. “That’s the first time in many, many years that a Republican can honestly say it, and we’re going to do it,” added Trump, who made a similar claim in 2020 before losing to then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden by more than 23 percentage points. “We have to do it. We do it, and the election nationwide is over. We take over the White House and we fix up our country,” the ex-president said to the crowd of New Yorkers and residents of nearby states. “I say to the people of New York: With crime at record levels, with terrorists and criminals pouring in and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote for Donald Trump! What the hell do you have to Lose?” he said. Of illegal immigrants in the Empire State, Trump said, “You got to get rid of these people. Give me a shot, you will have a safe, New York within three months… for every New Yorker being terrorized by this wave of migrant crime. November 5 will be your liberation day because you are living like hell.” The Post overheard crowd attendees saying Trump has to win the election but they fear Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, will somehow win in the end. Rally-goers included superfan Marlene Lowe, 48, of Harrison, NY, who came decked out in white cowboy boots, denim shorts and a T-shirt that said “Yes, I’m a Trump Girl – Get Over It!” “He’s hanging in there for us. It’s the least we can do for him. The man gets shot once, almost shot a second time, and he doesn’t miss a beat. Of course I wouldn’t miss an opportunity to see him up close in person. Maybe I can get him to sign my hat,” she said. Patrick Hill, 28, of Cherry Hill, NJ, said “he should have been dead twice, but here he is again. The man cannot be killed. Trump lives! Now let’s help him take this country back again and seal the border and undo the damage Biden wreaked on us over the past three-plus years.” Trump vowed not to hold a grudge against New York for its state officials prosecuting him in civil and criminal cases. “Despite all of the persecution I’ve endured from the corrupt judicial system in New York,” added Trump, who was convicted May 30 of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments, “I love the people of this state and I want to give back.” “I’m going to reduce your taxes, reduce your crime and reduce your levels of stress,” he went on. “The only thing that I will increase are your incomes and your love for your state will come roaring back.” The Republican boasted of polls released Wednesday afternoon by the Teamsters union showing that nearly 60% of the union’s members supported his candidacy against Harris. “I was honored to receive the endorsement of the rank and file membership of the Teamsters. I love the Teamsters,” said Trump. Typically, he said, “it’s automatic, they endorse the Democrats automatic — for many, many decades. But you know what? They looked at her, they said, ‘We’re not going there, I’m sorry.’ These are tough people.” Trump used the speech to bash Harris’ performance on issues including the US-Mexico border — while entertaining his audience, including admitting he hadn’t read his wife’s forthcoming new memoir “Melania” because he was “so busy” and that ” if she says bad things about me, I’ll call you all up and I’ll say, ‘don’t buy it.'” The 45th president also announced that he was preparing to visit Aurora, Colo., where Venezuelan gang members have intimidated residents, and Springfield, Ohio, which has been inundated by Haitian migrants, whom Trump incorrectly said have been eating cats and dogs. Trump, who is in a close race against Harris in national and swing-state polls, at one point cited a survey showing him up 5% and opened that “we should be 35 up, to be honest with you. Some people can’t break an old habit. That’s really what it is.” “God has now spared my life — it must have been God, thank you — not once but twice,” Trump said. “We’re gonna have the greatest win in history while we pull this one off. It will be legendary..”","summary":"UNIONDALE, N.Y. — Former President Donald Trump basked in the adulation of thousands of supporters on Long Island Wednesday night — insisting that recent attempts to kill him had “hardened my resolve&#8221; and predicting he would be the first Republican candidate to win New York state in 40 years. &#8220;These encounters with death have not...","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/18/us-news/trump-tells-boisterous-long-island-rally-he-will-win-new-york-after-assassination-plots-hardened-my-resolve/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/trump-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 00:13:00","author":"Diana Glebova,Reuven Fenton,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Glebova","Reuven Fenton","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":256741064,"title":"House refuses to pass short-term funding measure to prevent government shutdown","text":"The House rejected Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal that would have linked temporary government funding with a mandate for states to require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Lawmakers still need to pass a stopgap measure to prevent a partial government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 because work on the annual appropriations bills is not yet complete. The vote result was 220-202, with 14 Republicans and most Democrats voting against the bill. Johnson expressed disappointment and plans to explore an alternative approach to avoid a shutdown, though details are not yet available. “We’ll draw up another play and we’ll come up with a solution,” Johnson said. “I’m already talking to colleague about their many ideas. We have time to fix the situation and we’ll get right to it.” Johnson had pulled the bill from consideration last week because it lacked the votes to pass. He worked through the weekend to win support from fellow Republicans but was unable to overcome objections about spending levels from some members, while others said they don’t favor any continuing resolutions, insisting that Congress return to passing the dozen annual appropriations bills on time and one at a time. Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the measure. Requiring new voters to provide proof of citizenship has become a leading election-year priority for Republicans raising the specter of noncitizens voting in the U.S., even though it’s already illegal to do so and research has shown that such voting is rare. Opponents say that such a requirement would disenfranchise millions of Americans who do not have a birth certificate or passport readily available when they get a chance to register at their school, church or other venues when voter registration drives occur. But Johnson said it is a serious problem because even if a tiny percentage of noncitizens do vote, it could determine the outcome of an extremely close race. He noted that Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa won her seat back in 2020 by six votes. “It’s very, very serious stuff and that’s why we’re going to do the right thing,” Johnson said before the vote. “We’re going to responsibly fund the government and we’re going to stop noncitizens voting in elections.” Meanwhile, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump weighed in again just hours before the vote. seemingly encouraging House Republicans to let a partial government shutdown begin at the end of the month unless they get the proof of citizenship mandate, referred to in the House as the SAVE Act. “If Republicans don’t get the SAVE Act, and every ounce of it, they should not agree to a Continuing Resolution in any way, shape, or form,” Trump said on the social media platform Truth Social. House Democrats said the proof of citizenship mandate should not be part of a bill to keep the government funded and urged Johnson to work with them on a measure that can pass both chambers. “This is not going to become law,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif. “This is Republican theatrics that are meant to appease the most extreme members of their conference, to show them that they are working on something and that they’re continuing to support the former president of the United States in his bid to demonize immigrants.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has predicted Johnson’s effort was doomed to fail. “The only thing that will accomplish is make clear that he’s running into a dead end,” Schumer said. “We must have a bipartisan plan instead.” The legislation would fund agencies generally at current levels through March 28 while lawmakers work out their differences on a full-year spending agreement. Democrats, and some Republicans, are pushing for a shorter extension. A temporary fix would allow the current Congress to hammer out a final bill after the election and get it to Democratic President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. But Johnson and some of the more conservative members of his conference are pushing for a six-month extension in the hopes Trump will win and give them more leverage when crafting the full-year bill. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky declined to weigh in on how long to extend funding. He said Schumer and Johnson, ultimately, will have to work out a final agreement that can pass both chambers. “The one thing you cannot have is a government shutdown. It would be politically beyond stupid for us to do that right before the election because certainly we would get the blame,” McConnell said. Regardless of the vote outcome, Republican lawmakers sought to allay any concerns there would be a shutdown. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said if the bill failed, then another stopgap bill should be voted on that would allow lawmakers to come back to Washington after the election and finish the appropriations work. “The bottom line is we’re not shutting the government down,” Lawler said. But Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of engaging in a “shutdown effort.” “That’s not hyperbole,” Jeffries said. “It’s history. Because in the DNA of extreme MAGA Republicans has consistently been an effort to make extreme ransom demands of the American people, and if those extreme ransom demands are not met, shut down the government.” The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July. Some Republicans who view the issue as popular with their constituents have been pushing for another chance to show their support. Rep. Robert erholt, R-Ala., noted that his state’s secretary of state announced last month that 3,251 people who had been previously issued noncitizen identification numbers will have their voter registration status made inactive and flagged for possible removal from the voter rolls. Voting rights groups have since filed a lawsuit saying the policy illegally targeted naturalized citizens for removal from voting rolls. “These people should never have been allowed to register in the first place and this is exactly what the SAVE Act will prevent,” erholt said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe House rejected Speaker Mike Johnson&#8217;s proposal that would have linked temporary&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: House refuses to pass short-term funding measure to prevent government shutdown first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/house-refuses-to-pass-short-term-funding-measure-to-prevent-government-shutdown/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/House-rejects-temporary-funding-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 00:04:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.605},{"id":256741264,"title":"MAGA Fans at Vance Rally Boo Rate Cut That Will ‘Alleviate Inflation’","text":"A crowd assembled to hear Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance speak on Wednesday reacted strongly to a reporter’s question about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by half a percentage point, booing as the journalist pointed out that the move would take the strain off Americans struggling with rising prices. “Just on the Fed cutting—it’s a very Wall Street Journal-y question, but the Fed cut the interest rate today by a half a percentage point,” the reporter can be heard saying in footage of the Raleigh, North Carolina rally, “[that’s] going to alleviate inflation for a lot of people. And so if you have any reaction to that?” As the audience jeered, Vance replied, “Look, my reaction is… half a point is nothing compared to what American families have been dealing with for the last three years.” He smirked as the crowd whipsawed in the other direction, cheering. The Fed’s decision to lower interest rates by 50 basis points is its first such move since the early days of the pandemic, and comes after nearly two years of steady increases—11 times, for a total of 5.25 percentage points. An aggressive but widely expected move, the announcement is nevertheless a watershed moment for both the American economy and consumers on the ground, who should start to feel some financial strain taken off their wallets as the effects of the cut take hold. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to purchase goods, buy a house, or expand a business. They also inevitably lead to inflation as the market grows—hence the need for raising interest rates. But the pivot is an indicator of the central bank’s belief that the worst of inflation is over, as well as a stopgap measure for a slowing economy. It is unclear if more cuts are on the way, but Fed chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Wednesday that it was at least a possibility. “We’re going to take it meeting by meeting,” Powell said, according to The New York Times. “We made a good, strong start to this, and that is frankly a sign of our confidence, confidence that inflation is coming down.” Officials on both sides of the aisle used strikingly similar language in hailing the decision as a win, with Vice President Kamala Harris calling it “welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices” and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson as “welcome news for consumers.” Johnson tempered his reaction by challenging the Fed’s timing, calling it “suspect” that rates were slashed “right on the eve of an election.” Former President Donald Trump ran with that line of questioning during a Wednesday pitstop at a so-called “bitcoin bar” in New York City. “I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much, assuming they’re not just playing politics,” Trump said, referring to the central bank. “The economy would be very bad, or they’re playing politics, one or the other. But it was a big cut.”","summary":"Ronda Churchill/ReutersA crowd assembled to hear Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance speak on Wednesday reacted strongly to a reporter’s question about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by half a percentage point, booing as the journalist pointed out that the move would take the strain off Americans struggling with rising prices.\n\n“Just on the Fed cutting—it’s a very Wall Street Journal-y question, but the Fed cut the interest rate today by a half a percentage point,” the reporter can be heard saying in footage of the Raleigh, North Carolina rally, “[that’s] going to alleviate inflation for a lot of people.

The stolen non-public material had been acquired by the Iranian actors through cyber breaches. The hackers sent unsolicited emails to people connected to the Biden campaign in an effort to interfere with the 2024 election, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). According to a joint statement issued by the federal agencies, the emails “contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails.” While no responses from the recipients were reported, the federal agencies said Iranian hackers “have continued their efforts since June to send stolen, non-public material associated with former President Trump’s campaign to U.S. media organizations.” The FBI reiterated that these activities are part of Iran’s broader strategy to disrupt U.S. electoral processes and sow discord. Iran, along with Russia and China, is actively attempting to exacerbate societal divisions in the United States as the country approaches the November elections, the agencies said. “As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible,” the statement said. Authorities warned that foreign actors view the United States as vulnerable during elections and make efforts to undermine it. “Efforts by these, or other foreign actors, to undermine our democratic institutions are a direct threat to the U.S. and will not be tolerated,” the agencies said. The Trump campaign announced on Aug. 10 that Iranian hackers had stolen and leaked sensitive internal documents to media outlets including Politico, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. So far, none of the outlets have disclosed the contents. The Trump campaign issued a statement Wednesday urging Harris and Biden to clarify whether they used the hacked material. “This is further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election to help Kamala Harris and Joe Biden because they know President Trump will restore his tough sanctions and stand against their reign of terror,” said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign national press secretary. Morgan Finkelstein, a spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign, said the campaign has cooperated with law enforcement. “We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,” Finkelstein said.","summary":"The FBI and other agencies said the hackers also attempted to send the stolen material to U.S. media outlets.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/fbi-iranian-hackers-tried-to-pass-hacked-trump-campaign-information-to-team-biden-5726596","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/11/id5722267-GettyImages-2171266186-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:59:59","author":"Caden Pearson","authors":["Caden Pearson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.505},{"id":256740688,"title":"Iran hackers tried to interest Biden staff with stolen Trump campaign info, FBI says","text":"Iranian hackers sought to interest President Biden's campaign in information stolen from the rival campaign of former President Donald Trump, sending unsolicited emails to people connected to the Democratic president in an effort to interfere in the 2024 election, the FBI and other federal agencies said Wednesday.There's no evidence that any of the recipients responded, officials said, preventing the hacked information from surfacing in the final months of the closely contested election.The hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Mr. Biden's campaign before he dropped out.

So far, each has refused to reveal any details about what it received.Politico reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source —an AOL email account identified only as \"Robert\"— passed along what appeared to be a research dossier that the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate.A Microsoft threat intelligence report last month provided examples about the actions of Iranian groups seeking to influence the 2024 election.","summary":"Iranian hackers sought to interest President Biden's campaign in information stolen from the campaign of former President Donald Trump, the FBI and other federal agencies said.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-hackers-stolen-trump-campaign-info-biden-campaign-fbi-2024-election/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/18/1ccacdac-ec92-439c-ad92-9fff9915617f/thumbnail/1200x630/2cbea721eacc1a88a7a726f0c31cee2e/gettyimages-2171957012.jpg?v=1736e554a81339b452bb43c01c071a51","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3143680_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:50:23","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.519},{"id":256741266,"title":"Trump Hits NYC to Hand Out ‘Crypto Burgers’ as Swing State Polls Slump","text":"Former President Donald Trump made a bizarre appearance at a cryptocurrency-themed bar in New York City’s Greenwich Village on Wednesday, where he signed autographs and handed out what he dubbed as “crypto burgers.” “These suckers are good, too,” the former president said as he handed out burgers, in a strange moment captured during a Fox News live broadcast. “This is a crypto burger… actually you should name them—name them Bitcoin and a crypto,” Trump said. Trump was surrounded by a gaggle of reporters and a crew of crypto enthusiasts at PubKey, a small bar in a West Village basement less than a block away from New York University dorms. His youngest son, Barron, began classes down the street at NYU’s Stern School of Business earlier this month. The visit to his deep-blue hometown of New York City comes amid slumping swing-state polling for the former president. A new Quinnipiac poll released on Wednesday showed Harris widening her lead in the crucial states of Pennsylvania and Michigan by over five points. Other recent polling, including a more favorable NYT/Siena poll released last week, still shows the two candidates neck-and-neck in a number of key swing states. The bar reposted footage on social media of Trump fumbling with a device and scanning a QR code before declaring he became the first president or ex-president to ever make a transaction with Bitcoin. “I think it’s a great place, I just made the first transaction in Bitcoin,” Trump told the crowd of what he called “crypto maniacs” to cheers and rapturous applause. It was not immediately clear whose wallet Trump used for the transaction, or how much Bitcoin was exchanged. Bitcoin transactions are listed on a public ledger, but are anonymous unless the user reveals their wallet address. The former president, who once said that Bitcoin “seems like a scam,” has made a U-turn and gone all-in on cryptocurrency in recent months. Trump spoke at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, made an appearance on a cryptocurrency broadcast on Monday, and has been touting a new crypto venture launching with the help of his sons, Don Jr., Eric, and Barron. On Monday, he also bragged about his youngest son’s knowledge of cryptocurrency. “Barron’s a young guy, but he knows it. He talks about his wallet, he’s got four wallets or something.” Trump also told reporters at the bar he was bullish on winning the Empire State in November. “We’re here because we want to win New York, and I think that’s gonna happen,” the former president said. Trump has yet to carry the state of his birth in a presidential election, but still has made highly publicized campaign appearances in the Empire State in the past—including a well-attended rally in the Bronx earlier this year. He is set to speak to a large crowd at Nassau Coliseum on Long Island later on Wednesday night. Most polls taken in New York since Harris launched her campaign in July have the Democratic nominee winning the state by over 10 points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling aggregator.","summary":"Spencer PlattFormer President Donald Trump made a bizarre appearance at a cryptocurrency-themed bar in New York City’s Greenwich Village on Wednesday, where he signed autographs and handed out what he dubbed as “crypto burgers.”\n\n“These suckers are good, too,” the former president said as he handed out burgers, in a strange moment captured during a Fox News live broadcast. “This is a crypto burger… actually you should name them—name them Bitcoin and a crypto,” Trump said.\n\nTrump was surrounded by a gaggle of reporters and a crew of crypto enthusiasts at PubKey, a small bar in a West Village basement less than a block away from New York University dorms.

US Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris is polling two percentage points ahead of Republican nominee and ex-US President Donald Trump, according to the results of a survey by Fox News TV. According to the poll, 50% of its participants are ready to support Harris at the presidential election, with 48% of those polled supporting Trump. The vice president has improved her positions since mid-August when she was one percentage point behind Trump, polling 49% to 50%. The survey was held from September 13 through 16 among more than 1,100 respondents nationwide. The margin of error is three percentage points. The US presidential election is slated for November 5. Incumbent US President Joe Biden was supposed to represent the Democrats at the election but he decided to drop out of the race after mounting calls from his party following his poor performance in June in the debate with Trump who later became the Republican presidential nominee. Biden endorsed Harris to replace him.

Since then, Harris has been running for the Oval Office.Newsweek reached out to Biden's press team for comment about Biden's post-presidency plans via email on Wednesday.Earlier today, Harris spoke at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's Annual Leadership Conference in Washington D.C.A YouGov/The Economist poll released on August 28 found Harris has improved her lead among Hispanic voters over former President Donald Trump. The poll found that 56 percent of Hispanic registered voters prefer Harris, while 34 percent prefer Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.

But those words are rarely the actual message the former president delivers to his audience. The Republican National Committee has embraced early voting in 2024. Trump has promoted it in recordings the GOP played at its convention and in ads distributed around the country, as well as in copies of his prepared remarks at rallies. But live and on the trail, Trump’s tenor on the subject has remained inconsistent, often veering off remarks and instead sowing doubt in the legitimacy of the early voting process, confusing Republican voters — and potentially getting in the way of the party’s efforts to chase votes this fall. “They have early voting, late voting, everything is so ridiculous,” Trump said onstage in Palm Beach, Florida, in July. “We should have one-day voting, paper ballots, voter ID and certification of citizenship. And that’s what we’re striving for.” Meanwhile, the Trump-installed leaders of the RNC, chair Michael Whatley and co-chair Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, have crisscrossed the country on a “Protect the Vote” election integrity tour. A major component of their advocacy: promoting the importance of early voting. “The message from President Trump is very clear. It is great if you want to vote early,” Whatley said during a tour stop in Tampa, Florida, this summer. “It is great if you want to vote by mail,” he continued. The very same day, Trump gave a contradictory response when asked about early voting in an interview: “Anytime you have mail-in voting, you’re going to have fraud and some people don’t like me saying it, but I say it,” Trump said during a Fox News interview. In fact, state election officials have noted that voter fraud is rare, and states with mail balloting have numerous safeguards in place to prevent mail ballots from being misused. Trump doesn’t always dismiss early and mail voting in those terms. He voted early this month in his home state of Florida and posted a TikTok video encouraging people to vote early. He also occasionally straightly delivers a prepared remark that encourages early voting without caveating his skepticism of the practice. \"This election cycle, President Trump, the RNC, and our campaign have been clear to voters: Vote early,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, said in a statement. Still, the inconsistency of Trump’s early voting messaging has led many of his supporters toward cynicism and confusion around the topic. “I don’t think there should be early voting,” Bob Breneman, a Trump supporter from Pennsylvania, said in an interview. “I believe there should be picture voting and photograph voting to be honest with you. Because that would eliminate a lot of the cheating that goes on,” he said. Another Trump supporter, Susan Anderson from Nevada, said, “I think same-day voting is a good idea, because it keeps it more honest.” Then, when asked how she would be voting, Anderson responded, “We’d do whatever, and usually it’s early voting.” The RNC’s “Protect the Vote” tour has hit key battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia this summer, often bolstering early voting as an effective option to their Republican audience. “We have set up an effort to reach out — call it an early vote program nationwide,” Whatley said at one of the events. Despite the RNC’s efforts, the dozens of Trump supporters in key battleground states that NBC spoke with still echoed their party leader’s hesitancy. “I think we should just have day-of voting, paper ballots, is what I’m thinking,” said Trump supporter Troy Mattson. “That’s the only way to do it. We’ve got to go back to that.” Early voting is a method of casting a ballot that advocates say can increase the likelihood of voter turnout. In the United States, all 50 states and Washington, D.C., allow early ballots to be cast by mail or in person, with 35 states plus D.C. allowing early voting without requiring an excuse. But Trump has polarized an issue that once had more even support across the political spectrum and has long been deployed in Republican-leaning states. This year, just 37% of Republicans say people should have the option to vote early without giving a specific reason, according to May polling from the Pew Research Center. That sharply contrasts with 82% support from Democrats. While the Democratic number hasn’t budged in six years, Republicans support has dropped nearly 20 points in that time, according to Pew. In 2020, though Covid-19 had a big impact on voting for many, Biden voters were nearly twice as likely as Trump supporters to vote by mail, according to Pew’s studies.","summary":"At practically every Donald Trump rally, scripted words encouraging early voting get loaded into the teleprompter.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trumps-inconsistent-messaging-clashes-rncs-attempted-embrace-early-vot-rcna165972","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-05/220516-philadelphia-election-2020-ac-958p-418ec5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:43:03","author":"Jake Traylor","authors":["Jake Traylor"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":256740552,"title":"The African asylum seekers fighting for Israel in Gaza","text":"TheWeek The Week US Edition US UK SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week × Search Sign in View Profile Sign out The Explainer Talking Points The Week Recommends Newsletters Cartoons From the Magazine The Week Junior More Politics World News Business Health Science Food & Drink Travel Culture History Personal Finance Puzzles Photos All Categories Newsletter sign up Newsletter Home Defence under the radar The African asylum seekers fighting for Israel in Gaza Offer of permanent residency for military service condemned as unethical as Israel seeks to address shortage of soldiers Newsletter sign up Newsletter (Image credit: Illustration by Julia Wytrazek / Getty Images) By The Week Staff published 18 September 2024 Israel has been recruiting African asylum seekers to take part in military operations in Gaza in exchange for permanent residency, according to off-the-record briefings by Israeli defence officials. Recruitment is being conducted in an \"organised manner\" with the \"guidance of defence establishment legal advisers\", said an exclusive report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Military sources confirmed that the defence establishment has made use of asylum seekers in \"various operations\", said Middle East Eye. The \"manner in which the Israeli army deploys the asylum seekers is barred from publication\", Haaretz said, but to date \"no asylum seekers who contributed to the war effort have been granted official status\".

Sign up A way out of limbo Approximately 30,000 asylum seekers, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, currently reside in Israel, said France 24. Shira Abbo, director of public policy at Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, Israel's leading refugee advocacy organisation, said that fewer than 1% of asylum claims are ultimately approved. Many of those whose applications are still being processed have been granted \"temporary status\". While this provides asylum seekers with many of the rights afforded to Israeli citizens, it must be renewed periodically with the Interior Ministry and does not guarantee permanent status, leaving them in a legal limbo that can last for years. Some asylum seekers have already sought to voluntarily enlist in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said Haaretz, seeing it \"as the best way to integrate into Israel society\". The Hamas attacks on 7 October last year – in which three asylum seekers were among the 1,200 killed – set off a \"wave of volunteerism\" across Israel, said France 24. Asylum seekers \"desperate to solidify their legal status\" were among those offering their help with civil defence and agricultural work. One man, identified as A., told Haaretz how he had been approached in the first months of the war by someone claiming to be a police officer who said they \"were looking for special people to join the army\" to take part in a \"life-or-death war for Israel\". A., who ultimately declined the offer, was promised a salary similar to what he was earning in his current job, and documents from the State of Israel. Filling the ranks The recruitment practice has been \"met with criticism for creating a quid pro quo when asylum should be decided on the basis of merit\", said France 24. \"Asylum status is granted due to persecution, not as part of a deal,\" said Julia Grignon, from the Institute for Strategic Research. \"Enlisting in the military should never be a condition for obtaining refugee status.\" In an editorial, Haaretz said the practice was a \"despicable new low\" for the IDF and accused Israel of \"creating its own version of Russia's Wagner Group\", which has recruited prison inmates for dangerous military service in exchange for commuting their sentences. However, the defence establishment maintains that its actions are legal. In the past, the government has allowed the children of foreign workers to serve in the IDF in exchange for granting status to their immediate family members. The Interior Ministry has also explored the possibility of drafting the children of asylum seekers into the IDF if they have been educated in Israeli schools. This reflects the reality that Israel has a shortage of soldiers as it continues its operation in Gaza and faces the threat of a second front against Hezbollah in Lebanon. In June, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that ultra-Orthodox Jews, historically exempt from conscription, would now be required to serve. And the retirement age of army reservists has been temporarily extended to boost troop numbers. Explore More Israel Gaza Refugees Asylum Seekers Under The Radar To continue reading this article...

JD Vance, criticized the state of the U.S. economy Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point in a move Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said was meant to keep the economy in “good shape.” Trump made the comment during a visit to a cryptocurrency-themed bar in New York City. (Photo by ... [+] Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Trump told reporters during a visit to a New York City bar the rate cut “shows the economy is very bad, to cut [interest rates] by that much, assuming [the Fed] is not just playing politics”—though the Fed makes its decisions independent of lawmakers, and Trump chose Powell to lead the central bank. The former president also called the decision to lower rates by 50 basis points “a big cut.” Inflation remains above the Fed’s long-term benchmark of 2%, but declined to 2.5% last month—the lowest rate since early 2021. Vance was asked for his reaction on the rate cut during a rally in North Carolina, provoking boos from the crowd before he said a half-point reduction “is nothing compared to what American families have been dealing with for the last three years.” Powell said Wednesday during a press conference the economy “is growing at a solid pace,” adding the rate cut was made to keep the economy in “good shape.” Powell also mentioned the status of inflation during the conference, saying it “is coming down” while the labor market remains “in a strong place.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

And I think that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2%, so I think that is what enables us to take this strong move today,” Powell said during the press conference. Contra House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday the “timing” of the cut “is a little suspect,” before adding the decision is “welcome news for consumers.” Vice President Kamala Harris called the move “welcome news for Americans.” Key Background The Fed has not slashed rates since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The reduction brings the federal fund rates down between 4.75% and 5% after it remained between 5.25% and 5.5% since last year, after the Fed moved to aggressively hike rates to combat decades-high inflation. Trump suggested months ago the Fed could cut rates before the election, telling Bloomberg a pre-election rate cut is “something that they know they shouldn’t be doing.” However, the move to lower rates coincided with the cooling of inflation and a rise in unemployment (the Fed usually increases rates when inflation swells), though the 50 basis point cut was on the upper end of consensus estimates. Powell said the decision involved “a lot of discussion back and forth” but, despite one dissenting vote within the Fed, there was “broad support” for slashing rates 50 basis points.

Despite the urging of Trump, the Republican candidate in the November 5 presidential election, House Republicans were unable to muster enough votes to pass the package and send it on the Democratic-controlled Senate. With Democrats united in opposition, the bill failed by a vote of 202-220. House Speaker Mike Johnson now must decide whether to abandon the voting bill and pass a straightforward spending bill that would extend government funding into the new financial year that starts on October 1. Democrats in the House and the Senate say they are eager to pass a stopgap spending bill that would avert a disruptive shutdown that would furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers. The Republicans’ voting bill would require Americans to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote and require states to purge non-citizens from their registration lists. Trump has made illegal immigration a central issue in his re-election bid and has falsely claimed that Democrats are registering illegal immigrants to vote, the latest in a long line of lies about election fraud. House Republicans say their bill is needed to ensure that only American citizens vote. “It’s already illegal for a minor to purchase alcohol, yet we still card them. We still enforce the law,” said Republican congressman Aaron Bean.

During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump gave airtime to a far-right conspiracy theory that insisted Haitian immigrants who had recently settled in Springfield were eating local pets. That story, which filtered into the Trump campaign by way of running mate JD Vance, is an admitted fabrication. That hasn't stopped a deluge of bomb threats and other disruptions in the town since the rumor took hold in GOP circles. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Republican mayor Rob Rue worried about the \"strain\" that a Trump visit would bring to Springfield. “It would be an extreme strain on our resources,\" he shared, per NBC News. \"So it’d be fine with me if they decided not to make that visit.\" Rue's comments follow a similar sentiment from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. Over the weekend, the Republican governor countered Trump's claims about immigrants eating pets and lauded recent immigrants to Ohio. \"What we know is that Haitians who are in Springfield are legal. They came to Springfield to work. Ohio is on the move and Springfield has really made a great resurgence,\" he said, during an interview with ABC This Week. Both President Joe Biden and Harris have countered Trump's claims about Haitian immigrants and accused the former president of spreading dangerous rhetoric. “This has to stop, what he’s doing. It has to stop,” Biden said in a press conference at the White House last week.","summary":"Mayor Rob Rue worried that a Trump visit would strain the city after a week of threats brought on by Trump lies","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/09/18/fine-with-me-if-they-decided-not-visit-springfield-mayor-tells-stay-away-following-pet-lies/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/08/donald_trump_2165592768.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:31:40","author":"Alex Galbraith","authors":["Alex Galbraith"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":256739912,"title":"Trump security bolstered following apparent assassination attempt","text":"Trump security bolstered following apparent assassination attempt In the wake of the second assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the Secret Service said Trump is now receiving the highest level of protection offered by the agency, the same level as a sitting president.

Despite the urging of Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election, House Republicans were unable to muster enough votes to pass the package and send it on the Democratic-controlled Senate. With Democrats mostly united in opposition, the bill failed by a vote of 202-220, with 14 Republicans voting against and three Democrats in favor. House Speaker Mike Johnson said afterward that he would craft a new temporary spending bill that would keep the government running beyond Oct. 1, when current funding is due to expire. He did not provide details. “Now we go back to the playbook, draw up another play and we’ll come up with another solution,” Johnson said. “I’m already talking to colleagues.” Democrats in the House and the Senate say they are eager to pass a stopgap spending bill to avert a disruptive shutdown that would furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers. However, they opposed the version that Johnson brought to a vote today because it was paired with an unrelated voting bill that would require Americans to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote and require states to purge non-citizens from their registration lists. Johnson also has to contend with a contingent of Republicans who typically vote against stopgap funding bills. Trump has made illegal immigration a central issue in his re-election bid and has falsely claimed that Democrats are registering illegal immigrants to vote, the latest in a long line of lies about election fraud. House Republicans say their bill is needed to ensure that only American citizens vote. “It’s already illegal for a minor to purchase alcohol, yet we still card them. We still enforce the law,” said Republican Representative Aaron Bean. Senate Democrats have refused to consider the Republican voting bill, saying it would risk disenfranchising legitimate voters while doing nothing to bolster election security.

Instead, a statement on the couple’s Archewell Foundation website in honor of National Voter Registration Day on Tuesday relayed that its team has written “personalized letters encouraging unregistered voters to take a crucial step: registering to vote.” “Voting is not just a right; it’s a fundamental way to influence the fate of our communities,” the unsigned statement continues. “At The Archewell Foundation, we recognize that civic engagement, no matter one’s political party, is at the heart of a more just and equitable world. By participating in initiatives like this, we aim to amplify the message that every voice matters.” The website then supplies links to Vote Forward’s website and Vote.gov. “Together, let’s make sure every eligible voter is informed and empowered to participate in shaping America’s future,” its message concludes. In March, Trump told Nigel Farage in a GB News interview, when asked what he would do if allegations that Harry may have lied on his visa forms about his past drug use proved accurate: “We’ll have to see if they know something about the drugs, and if he lied they’ll have to take appropriate action.” Farage asked if “appropriate action” could mean “not staying in America,” to which Trump replied, according to a report on the outlet’s website, “Oh I don’t know. You’ll have to tell me. You just have to tell me. You would have thought they would have known this a long time ago.” In 2020, after they had moved to California following their exit from their senior royal family roles, Harry and Meghan did not endorse Joe Biden or Trump, but aroused Trump’s ire by making some pointed remarks about rejecting bigotry. “Every four years, we are told the same thing, that ‘This is the most important election of our lifetime.’ But this one is,” Meghan said. “When we vote, our values are put into action and our voices are heard. Your voice is a reminder that you matter. Because you do. And you deserve to be heard.” Harry, sitting beside his wife, added: “This election, I’m not going to be able to vote here in the U.S. But many of you may not know that I haven't been able to vote in the U.K. my entire life. As we approach this November, it’s vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation, and online negativity.” Their remarks also provoked a debate about how suitable it was for either of them to make political remarks of any kind. Famed feminist, and friend of Meghan, Gloria Steinem, told Access Hollywood that Meghan was cold-calling voters: “She came home to vote. The first thing we did, and why she came to see me, was we sat at the dining room table where I am right now and we cold-called voters... That was her initiative.” Trump responded to the video by saying of Meghan: “I’m not a fan of hers … I wish a lot of luck to Harry. He’s gonna need it.” There have been occasional rumors of Meghan’s own ambition for a political life—in 2023, after the death of California Senator Dianne Feinstein’s death that Meghan the Mail reported that Meghan “could throw her hat in the ring to serve out the remaining 13 months of Feinstein’s term.” (It didn’t happen.) Before his state visit to the U.K. in 2019, then-President Trump was asked what he thought of Meghan calling him “misogynistic” and “divisive” before she had married into the royal family. Trump told The Sun he had not known he wouldn’t be meeting Meghan on his visit (this was when she and Harry were still senior members of the Firm). “I didn’t know that… No, I hope she is OK. I didn’t know that, no,” Trump said. “So, what can I say? No, I didn’t know that she was nasty.” However, Trump added of Meghan becoming a royal family member, “I am sure she will do excellently. She will be very good.”","summary":"Andrew Kelly/ReutersPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have no plans to publicly endorse a presidential candidate at this time, the Daily Beast understands.\n\nThis echoes claims, first reported in the Telegraph, that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will remain “publicly neutral” in the forthcoming election—despite the couple tangling publicly with Donald Trump in the past, with the former president suggesting in March that Harry could be deported from the US over the drug use he divulged in his blockbuster memoir Spare.\n\nInstead, a statement on the couple’s Archewell Foundation website in honor of National Voter Registration Day on Tuesday relayed that its team has written “personalized letters encouraging unregistered voters to take a crucial step: registering to vote.”\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-reveal-their-2024-us-election-strategybut-not-their-candidate","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3257,w_5791,x_0,y_165/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1726697754/2022-12-07T003111Z_422056427_RC2O0Y9W6Y5X_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-ROYALS-HARRY-MEGHAN_pyketn","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:29:22","author":"Tim Teeman","authors":["Tim Teeman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":256739820,"title":"Psychologists explain the reasons behind Kamala Harris using different accents, following her recent use of a strange Spanish accent during a public appearance.","text":"Kamala Harris has raised eyebrows on the presidential campaign trail for using ‘fake accents’ that experts suggest could be a result of a confidence issue. Harris, who was born in California and spent some of her childhood in Canada, has been accused of putting on Midwestern, Southern and even French accents during depending on who her audience is. And just today, social media erupted after a video of the vice president appeared to speak with a Spanish twang while talking at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual Leadership Conference Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert, who owns a practice in New York, said there are two main reasons people alter their accents, which in psychology circles is known as ‘mirroring’ or the ‘chameleon effect.’ The latest ‘fake accent’ took Americans by surprise. Harris appeared to say ‘I love you back’ with a Spanish twang to a group of her supporters on Wednesday. Some do it out of empathy, so others find them trustworthy and to show they want to experience another person’s emotions. Others put on different accents to fit in because they feel like an outsider of a group and want to conform. Alpert told DailyMail.com that he thinks that is the case with Harris. ‘Using a fake accent could also be a result of feeling self-conscious around a particular group and feeling like she has to make changes to her baseline voice in order to be accepted – to some extent this a natural and normal way to handle people we might perceive as different than ourselves,’ Alpert said. ‘There’s a possibility she feels like she won’t fit in, so she overcompensates by taking this whole accent thing to the extreme. ‘I think there could be an element of Harris trying to gain acceptance across these different demographics. But again, I think it’s backfiring.’ As well as shaping her accent to suit certain groups, Harris has also been accused of shaping her policy stances to fit what is currently popular. In 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris endorsed the ‘defund the police’ movement in an interview with the hosts of the Ebro in the Morning show. This was a stark difference from when she ran for Attorney General of California in 2010, her ad production imitated the tense proficiency of a Law and Order episode. ‘Our justice system needs drastic repair,’ Harris said as she walked confidently with law enforcement officers, hair blowing in the wind as a helicopter buzzed overhead. She has also said that she would shut down Donald Trump’s border wall project and once called it a ‘medieval vanity project’ and a ‘waste of taxpayer.’ But in August, Harris has allegedly and suddenly vowed to sign a bill that would allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to continue building a wall along the southern border, according to a report. Harris was a major supporter of the Green New Deal in 2019, which call for public policy to address climate change, but this year she swore of off any prior assertion that she opposed fracking in a bid to win battleground Pennsylvania. While her shift in policies has come under fire over the years, her ‘fake accent’ has taken center stage in the last few months and some Americans have viewed it as superficial. ‘By altering her accent she might be perceived as inauthentic or manipulative and ultimately could undermine trust if the audience feels she is not genuine,’ said Alpert. ‘Authenticity is critical in building meaningful connections with the electorate and if people perceive the accent as disingenuous, it could damage Harris’s credibility. ‘In Harris’ attempt to connect with a specific group, there is a risk of alienating other audiences. ‘If her accent change is seen as pandering or insincere, it might alienate people who view it as a superficial attempt to fit in rather than a genuine expression of solidarity.’ Harris is not the only human to have put on a different speech, as many Americans have and some experts believe their is a social aspect to the chameleon effect – subconsciously replicating the physical actions of another human. Dr Nan Wise, a licensed psychotherapist who has appeared on The Today Show, said: ‘When you talk to children, you’re gonna sound different, right. ‘When you talk to old people, you’re gonna sound different. And even if you talk to people who are not native language speakers you automatically adjust.’ Dr Wise also noted that Harris’ strange accent is something ‘we humans do automatically kind of a matching and a mimicry, noting it is done unconsciously. ‘Human beings are very social animals, and some of this accommodation goes along with the way we’re wired to connect and to unintentionally mimic aspects of our social environments,’ she explained. However, a 2021 study led by the University of Pennsylvania found that code-switching is a thought-out behavior. Dr Wise also claimed that the accent makes Harris appear trustworthy, but Alpert suggested it could be doing the opposite. ‘By altering her accent she might be perceived as inauthentic or manipulative and ultimately could undermine trust if the audience feels she is not genuine,’ he said. ‘Authenticity is critical in building meaningful connections with the electorate and if people perceive the accent as disingenuous, it could damage Harris’s credibility.’ Harris put on the ‘fake accent’ during a press conference September 17 while speaking to in a discussion with the journalists at the National Association of Black Journalists. The code-switching, when a person alternates between languages in a conversation, is not a recent behavior for Harris as she adopted a languorous southern drawl during at a Georgia rally in July 2024. But years before in 2021, she was accused of slipping into a cod French accent while speaking to scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. The vice president is half Jamaican and half Indian, and spent her childhood in San Francisco and Canada. Danielle Wade, a licensed clinical social worker, wrote in MedicalNewsToday: ‘Some perceive it as a negative because it may reinforce stereotypes.’ But she noted that the behavior could be ‘a way of preserving one’s identity and culture.’ Harris is not the first presidential candidate to switch up their speech as Hilary Clinton came under fire for the same behavior during a 2015 campaign stop in Columbia, South Carolina. Clinton, who grew up in Chicago, put on a southern drawl during an event with minority women small-business owners. Dr Yalda Safai, a psychiatrist in New York City, said that Clinton has long tried to use fake accents to appear relatable, but ‘it just feel completely flat’ among American voters. On the other hand, Alpert explained how people respect political figures who are more true to themselves. ‘Bill Clinton, I thought, was masterful at that,’ he continued. ‘I thought he just resonated with whoever he was speaking to, from highly educated New Yorkers to poor people, he just he always seemed to be true to himself, and was widely accepted. ‘I think the same is true with Donald Trump. We’ve all heard the description, the Blue Collar billionaire. He just speaks his mind and is consistent across the different speeches and audiences.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris has raised eyebrows on the presidential campaign trail for using&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Psychologists explain the reasons behind Kamala Harris using different accents, following her recent use of a strange Spanish accent during a public appearance. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/psychologists-explain-the-reasons-behind-kamala-harris-using-different-accents-following-her-recent-use-of-a-strange-spanish-accent-during-a-public-appearance/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/18/18/89823131-0-image-m-13_1726679532805.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:27:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.045},{"id":256739542,"title":"Trump becomes first president to pay in Bitcoin: ‘Very easy’","text":"Former President Donald Trump made history as the first US president to ever pay in Bitcoin at PubKey, a NYC Bitcoin bar. “I just made the first transaction in Bitcoin,” the ex-prez declared to roars of approval from the crypto loving crowd.

Is that true?","text":"Former President Donald Trump regularly criticizes President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over what inflation is costing families, citing one figure in particular. At a Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13, Trump blamed Harris for causing “the worst inflation in American history, costing us and the typical family $28,000.” He also highlighted the $28,000 figure at recent rallies in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona. Under President Biden, year-over-year inflation — or the pace of price increases — peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the highest monthly figure in about 40 years, but it has since cooled considerably. In August, inflation hit a three-year low of 2.5%. Lower inflation means the rate of price increases has slowed, but not that prices themselves have decreased. CBS News’ price tracker shows the cost of everyday household expenses remain higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. Economists told CBS News that Trump’s $28,000 figure is largely correct. Citing the figure on its own, however, ignores the crucial context that inflation led to income growth, not just price hikes. Data indicates that over the last three and a half years, many Americans have seen a net positive increase in their finances. Where the $28,000 figure comes from The estimate that inflation has cost the typical American household $28,000 since Mr. Biden took office is consistent with an inflation tracker from Republicans on Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. The tracker is based on government data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis of state-level personal consumption expenditures — one measure of spending on goods and services. The study tracked monthly costs for the average American household in each state since January 2021. From that point through July 2024, the average cumulative increase in household costs among all 50 states and Washington, D.C., was $27,950, due to inflation. In an update for August 2024, the increase rose to around $29,000. Economists told CBS News the estimate for the total increase in household costs in the last three and a half years is likely in the correct range. Experts generally agree that household costs have increased since January 2021, although the precise number differs depending on the specific metrics used. Comparing price increases under Trump and Biden The Republicans on the Joint Economic Committee told CBS News they did not do a similar analysis of how household costs changed under Trump’s administration. Government data shows prices also grew under Trump, but by much less. The Consumer Price Index for all items increased by around 8% over Trump’s four years in office. By comparison, the total increase in consumer prices thus far under Biden is around 20%. Of course, the two faced markedly different economic circumstances during their time in the White House. While Trump’s administration enjoyed low inflation and healthy job growth for much of his time in office, the pandemic leveled the economy toward the end of his term. Early in the Biden administration, inflation reached modern highs as the economy recovered from employment and global supply chain disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many other countries around the world also saw high inflation due to the pandemic — in some cases far higher than the U.S. The Federal Reserve believes keeping inflation at a low, stable rate of around 2% year-over-year is best for a well functioning economy where people and businesses can plan financially. It’s typical for prices to grow throughout a presidential term. A reduction in prices, or deflation, is generally not thought of as desirable by economists, and price increases are considered a feature of a healthy economy. How incomes have fared under Biden Economists say price increases should be compared to income increases to fully understand how inflation is affecting people’s finances. Mark Zandi of the independent Moody’s Analytics told CBS News that due to inflation, the median American household spent $905 more in August 2024 to purchase the same goods and services than they did in August 2021. However, the median household made $1,073 more in August 2024 than it did three years ago. Cumulatively, the Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee told CBS News that their calculations show the average family earned $35,390 in additional wages and salaries between the start of Mr. Biden’s term and July 2024 — a figure that’s more than $7,000 greater than the total increase in household costs over that time period estimated by the committee’s Republicans. As of last year, Americans’ incomes had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census, in 2023, median household income rose a healthy 4%, to $80,610, on par with earnings in 2019 on an inflation-adjusted basis. Another way to measure the financial health of Americans is to look at government data on real disposable personal income, which reflects after-tax income adjusted for inflation. This income figure includes not only wages and salaries but also income from investments and government subsidies. Disposable personal income has been higher on average during Mr. Biden’s term than it was in December 2020, Trump’s last full month in office. According to Gary Burtless, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, real disposable personal income per person has been above $49,407 — where it was in December 2020 — for 30 of the 43 months of Mr. Biden’s term so far. “Given that Americans’ actual real incomes have increased over the course of the Biden administration, it’s a little hard to see the basis for claiming that ‘inflation under Biden has cost the typical U.S. family $28,000,'” Burtless said.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump regularly criticizes President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over what inflation is costing families, citing one figure in particular.  At a Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13, Trump blamed Harris for causing &#8220;the worst inflation in American history, costing us and the typical family $28,000.&#8221; He also highlighted the $28,000 &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump says inflation has cost households $28,000 under Biden and Harris.

It was also the largest lead for any presidential candidate since Biden held a 5-point advantage over Trump one year ago.The apparent polling boost, coming on the heels of what most viewed as a winning debate performance for Harris, appears to have been fueled in part by the Democrat achieving her largest-ever leads among millennial voters, white voters and men.The newest edition of the poll, conducted earlier this week, finds that 47 percent of male registered voters now support the vice president—a significant improvement from the 39 percent who backed her when she first entered the race.Harris has also gained 6 points of support from all white voters since Biden dropped out of the race, climbing from 36 percent in July to 42 percent in the newest poll.A larger boost for the Democrat came from millennials, with a 57 percent majority of voters age 30 to 44—a group mostly consisting of millennials—saying in the new poll that they prefer Harris, while only 45 percent backed her in July.Additionally, support for Harris has substantially improved among Black and Hispanic voters since July, with the vice president garnering support from 78 percent of Black registered voters and 60 percent of Hispanic registered voters in the latest poll.Only 44 percent of Hispanic voters and 63 percent of Black voters supported Harris in July. Hispanic support for Harris was at an all-time high in the new poll, while the vice president saw her highest figure of support among Black voters, 81 percent, in late August.Trump held advantages over Harris among voters age 45 and older in the new poll. However, the only demographic groups that showed majorities supporting the former president were white voters at 52 percent and voters 65 and older at 55 percent.The poll also showed that Harris received an overall 4 percent post-debate bump in support—the vice president and former president were tied at 45 percent just before meeting in Philadelphia on September 10.Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns via email on Wednesday.The new poll was conducted among 1,445 registered U.S. voters from September 15 to September 17, with a margin of error of 3.2 percent. Previous editions of the weekly poll each had margins of error of 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent among registered voters.An average of recent national polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight shows Harris leading Trump by 3.3 percentage points as of Wednesday evening, while an average from RealClearPolitics shows the vice president leading by 2 points.On the day of the debate, Harris was leading Trump by 2.5 points in the FiveThirtyEight average and 1.1 points in the RealClearPolitics average.","summary":"The vice president was handed her biggest lead over former President Donald Trump in a poll released on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-surging-three-key-groups-polls-show-1955988","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2474887/kamala-harris-three-key-groups-poll-boost.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:14:59","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":256739342,"title":"Iranian hackers tried but failed to interest Biden campaign in stolen Trump info, FBI says","text":"Iranian hackers sought to interest US President Joe Biden’s campaign in information stolen from rival Donald Trump’s campaign, sending unsolicited emails to people connected to the Democratic president in an effort to interfere in the 2024 election, the FBI and other federal agencies said on Wednesday. There is no evidence that any of the recipients responded, officials said, preventing the hacked information from surfacing in the final months of the closely contested election. The hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Biden’s campaign before he dropped out. The emails “contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former president Trump’s campaign as text in the emails”, according to a US government statement. The announcement is the latest effort to call out what officials say is Iran’s brazen, ongoing work to interfere in the 2024 election, including a hack-and-leak campaign that the FBI and other federal agencies linked last month to Tehran. The US Justice Department has been preparing charges in that breach, Associated Press has reported. The FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have said the Trump campaign hack and an attempted breach of the Biden-Harris campaign are part of an effort to undermine voters’ faith in the election and to stoke discord. The Trump campaign disclosed on August 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. At least three news outlets – Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post – were leaked confidential material from inside the Trump campaign.

In a statement, Morgan Finkelstein, a spokeswoman for Kamala Harris’ campaign, said the campaign has cooperated with law enforcement since learning that people associated with Biden’s team were among the recipients of the emails. “We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign; a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,” Finkelstein said.","summary":"Nobody on the US president’s team is known to have responded to the unsolicited emails offering the hacked material.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3279061/iranian-hackers-tried-failed-interest-biden-campaign-stolen-trump-info-fbi-says","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/19/f31c071b-8501-4af3-8418-11cddb0b7b05_3358ce1a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:13:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.653},{"id":256739420,"title":"Elon Musk boosts fake Trump rally bomb threat and false claims about the election","text":"Elon Musk is using his social media platform to promote misinformation about the U.S. presidential candidates in the lead up to the November election, amplifying false claims Wednesday about a Trump rally bomb threat and immigrants eating pets in Ohio. While Musk’s posting of provocative, incendiary content on X is nothing new, the speed with which he has promoted false claims in recent days is striking given the breadth of Musk’s digital reach, with his posts regularly finding their way atop users’ feeds. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App The most prominent of Musk’s conspiratorial posts came in the wake of an alleged second assassination attempt on former U.S. president Donald Trump, after which Musk wrote in a now-deleted X post that “no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.” After much backlash, Musk, who has pledged his support for Trump, ultimately deleted his post, stating that it was meant as a “joke.” During the same weekend, however, Musk also joined a chorus of conspiracy-minded X users circulating a hoax “affidavit” from a purported “whistleblower” that claimed last week’s ABC News debate was rigged to help Kamala Harris. ABC has since confirmed the typo-ridden document was fake. Then on Wednesday, Musk reshared a bogus claim that a bomb had been discovered near the site of a planned Trump rally in Long Island. Police said in a statement that “reports of explosives being found at the site are unfounded.” While Musk’s pithy reaction to the fake threat is still live on X, the initial post has since been deleted. Musk’s own post has been earmarked with a crowd-sourced “community notes” fact-check that makes clear the claim was false. Still, in the post’s first two and a half hours, it garnered 4.3 million views and was reshared 9,800 times. Also on Wednesday, Musk reshared a video falsely claiming the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, admitted in March that there had been reports of Haitian immigrants eating pets, captioning the post “Always Be Cheating News,” a clear knock on ABC’s moderators, who had fact-checked Trump’s false claims on the matter at the debate. The edited video instead showed a Springfield resident sharing that he had heard unconfirmed reports about domesticated animals being harmed. Both the city’s mayor and manager both state during the hearing they have seen no proof of such claims. Musk’s post, which boosted false claims about Haitian immigrants that have been promoted by Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, leading to dozens of bomb threats at schools and municipal buildings in the Ohio city, garnered more than 7.9 million views and 36,000 reshares. Top science and technology headlines, all in one place Hours later, Musk shared a map purporting to be from Nate Silver, the renowned statistician and FiveThirtyEight founder, projecting a 312-226 electoral college victory for Trump in November, saying the election was “trending well.” The map, however, was a fake. The real map from Silver’s newsletter platform, “Silver Bulletin,” published Wednesday shows several states in play, including Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Silver himself noted that “the race is really a tossup” in the post. Meanwhile, in simulations from FiveThirtyEight, which Silver parted ways with last year, Harris was forecast to win the election in 64 out of 100 simulations. X did not respond to a CNN request for comment Wednesday on Musk’s posts. Musk is far from the only figure spreading false information on the platform, though he is easily one of its biggest voices. Many of the bogus claims propelled by the billionaire in recent days were also buoyed by other major right-wing voices. Since acquiring Twitter in 2022, Musk has gutted the company’s moderation teams and altered its policies, allowing misinformation and hate speech to spread on the platform. Musk also reinstated the accounts of previously banned conspiracy theorists, created financial incentives to post viral content, and ended the legitimacy of verified badges. But the combination of Musk’s 198 million-strong following coupled with an algorithm boosting his posts has elevated false claims that would typically be confined to less visible corners of the internet. Though Musk has styled himself as a free-speech absolutist, his tendency to champion posts from fringe, right-wing voices while regularly attacking news organizations and journalists presents a major issue for voters seeking reliable information online during an already-turbulent election period.","summary":"Elon Musk is using his social media platform to promote misinformation about the U.S. presidential candidates in the lead up to the November election, amplifying false claims Wednesday about a Trump rally bomb threat and immigrants eating pets in Ohio.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/elon-musk-boosts-fake-trump-rally-bomb-threat-and-false-claims-about-the-election-1.7043513","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/9/18/elon-musk-posts-fake-news-1-7043527-1726700820280.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:13:00","author":"CNN","authors":["CNN"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":256739136,"title":"Brett Favre Uses Patrick Mahomes to Take Shot at Taylor Swift","text":"Former Green Bay Packers legend and Hall of Famer Brett Favre is not a fan of celebrities using their status to influence political opinions.

The next steps on government funding are uncertain. Lawmakers are not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that will fund federal agencies during the next fiscal year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure to prevent a partial shutdown when that budget year begins Oct. 1. The vote was 220-202. Now, Johnson will likely pursue a Plan B to avoid a partial shutdown, though he was not ready before the vote to share details of such a proposal. Johnson pulled the bill from consideration last week because it lacked the votes to pass. He worked through the weekend to win support from fellow Republicans but was unable to overcome objections about spending levels from some members, while others said they don’t favor any continuing resolutions, insisting that Congress return to passing the dozen annual appropriations bills on time and one at a time. Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the measure. Requiring new voters to provide proof of citizenship has become a leading election-year priority for Republicans raising the specter of noncitizens voting in the U.S., even though it’s already illegal to do so and research has shown that such voting is rare. Opponents also say that such a requirement would disenfranchise millions of Americans who do not have a birth certificate or passport readily available when they get a chance to register at their school, church or other venues when voter registration drives occur. But Johnson said it is a serious problem because even if a tiny percentage of noncitizens do vote, it could determine the outcome of an extremely close race. He noted that Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa won her seat back in 2020 by six votes. “It’s very, very serious stuff and that’s why we’re going to do the right thing,” Johnson said. “We’re going to responsibly fund the government and we’re going to stop noncitizens voting in elections.” Meanwhile, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump weighed in again just hours before the vote. seemingly encouraging House Republicans to let a partial government shutdown begin at the end of the month unless they get the proof of citizenship mandate, referred to in the House as the SAVE Act. “If Republicans don’t get the SAVE Act, and every ounce of it, they should not agree to a Continuing Resolution in any way, shape, or form,” Trump said on the social media platform Truth Social. House Democrats said the proof of citizenship mandate should not be part of the continuing resolution to keep the government funded and urged Johnson to work with them on a bill that can pass both chambers. “This is not going to become law,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif. “This is Republican theatrics that are meant to appease the most extreme members of their conference, to show them that they are working on something and that they’re continuing to support the former president of the United States in his bid to demonize immigrants.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Johnson’s effort was doomed to fail. “The only thing that will accomplish is make clear that he’s running into a dead end,” Schumer said. “We must have a bipartisan plan instead.” The legislation would fund agencies generally at current levels through March 28 while lawmakers work out their differences on a full-year spending agreement. Democrats, and some Republicans, are pushing for a shorter extension. A temporary fix would allow the current Congress to hammer out a final bill after the election and get it to Democratic President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature. But Johnson and some of the more conservative members of his conference are pushing for a six-month extension in the hopes that Trump will win the election and give them more leverage when crafting the full-year bill. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky declined to weigh in on how long to extend funding. He said Schumer and Johnson, ultimately, will have to work out a final agreement that can pass both chambers. “The one thing you cannot have is a government shutdown. It would be politically beyond stupid for us to do that right before the election because certainly, we would get the blame,” McConnell said. Regardless of the vote outcome, Republican lawmakers sought to allay any concerns there would be a shutdown at the end of the month. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said if the bill failed, then another stopgap bill should be voted on that would allow lawmakers to come back to Washington after the election and finish the appropriations work. “The bottom line is we’re not shutting the government down,” Lawler said. But Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of engaging in a “shutdown effort.” “That’s not hyperbole,” Jeffries said. “It’s history. Because in the DNA of extreme MAGA Republicans has consistently been an effort to make extreme ransom demands of the American people, and if those extreme ransom demands are not met, shut down the government.” The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July. Some Republicans who view the issue as popular with their constituents have been pushing for another chance to show their support for the measure. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., noted that his state’s secretary of state announced last month that 3,251 people who had been previously issued noncitizen identification numbers will have their voter registration status made inactive and flagged for possible removal from the voter rolls. Voting rights groups have since filed a lawsuit saying the policy illegally targeted naturalized citizens for removal from voting rolls. “These people should never have been allowed to register in the first place and this is exactly what the SAVE Act will prevent,” Aderholt said.","summary":"Lawmakers are not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that will fund federal agencies during the next fiscal year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure to prevent a partial shutdown.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/18/house-rejects-government-funding-bill-linked-to-proof-of-citizenship-for-new-voters/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Congress_Budget_68159_46f7e1.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:06:26","author":"Kevin Freking,KEVIN FREKING - Associated Press","authors":["Kevin Freking","KEVIN FREKING - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.502},{"id":256740812,"title":"China The Top Challenge In US History: Senior Diplomat","text":"China presents the top challenge to the United States in all of its history, surpassing the Cold War, a top US official said Wednesday, as he urged Europe to get tougher on Beijing.Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, a key architect of a 15-year push for the United States to reorient its foreign policy toward Asia, also urged greater US investment in advanced technology to compete better with China.\"There is a recognition that this is the most significant challenge in our history,\" Campbell told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\"Frankly, the Cold War pales in comparison to the multifaceted challenges that China presents,\" he said.\"It's not just a military challenge; it's across the board. It is in the Global South. It is in technology. We need to step up our game across the board.\"President Joe Biden's administration has been pressing China about technology exports to Russia that US officials say have allowed Moscow to ramp up military production for its war in Ukraine.\"The challenge is, we've got to get more support here on this,\" Campbell said of US sanctions on Chinese firms, an issue he said he has been raising on visits to Europe.Campbell said that most of Washington's European allies shared concerns on China's ties with Moscow but were still reeling from the \"huge shock\" of slashing energy imports from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.\"For many of these countries, doing business with China has been a big deal for 15 or 20 years,\" he said.Acting on China, after Russia, could feel like \"kind of a one-two punch. You can understand leaders in Europe have some anxieties.\"China argues that, unlike the United States, it is not providing weapons to either Russia or Ukraine, but Washington says Beijing is providing support that has military uses.Campbell's tough talk comes despite easing tensions between the United States and China under Biden, with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump more frequently speaking in Cold War terms about confronting Beijing.Biden and his political heir Kamala Harris have supported dialogue with China even as their administration presses ahead with tough measures including a sweeping ban on exports of advanced chips.Since a summit last year between Biden and President Xi Jinping in California, China has agreed to key US requests of restoring military communications and cracking down on ingredients in fentanyl, the drug behind a US overdose epidemic.Campbell contended that the Biden administration has strengthened the US position since taking over from Trump, in part by bolstering alliances. \"Four years ago, the general view globally was that China had eaten our lunch, that they were going to surpass us, economically and commercially, that we were in the midst of some sort of hurtling decline,\" he said. \"I do not think that is what the general belief is today.\"Meeting another key ask of the Biden administration, China freed an American pastor, David Lin, who had been detained since 2006, the State Department confirmed Sunday.The United States had raised the case of Lin and other detained Americans with China, including when Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of a meeting in Laos in July. The State Department considers two other US citizens, Kai Li and Mark Swidan, to be wrongfully detained by China, but activists say far more Americans are behind bars or prohibited from exiting. The mother of Swidan, detained over drug trafficking charges he denies, told a separate congressional hearing that Biden needs to engage with China on its proposals to free him.\"His case is a clear injustice, yet it continues to be ignored by those with the power to act,\" she said in a statement to the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.Peter Humphrey, who was detained with his wife in China from 2013 to 2015 and has since become a specialist on such cases, said a \"massive number\" of Americans cannot publicly raise their cases for fear of retribution by Beijing.He said he was held with 11 other men in a packed cell with no privacy or furniture, sleeping on the floor and eating from dog bowls pushed under the bars.He said he lost 22 pounds (10 kilos) while in detention, which he described as \"torture designed to crush the human spirit and force out a confession.\"","summary":"China presents the top challenge to the United States in all of its history, surpassing the Cold War, a top US official said Wednesday, as he urged Europe to get tougher on Beijing.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/china-top-challenge-us-history-senior-diplomat-1851724","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1860277/kurt-campbell-now-us-deputy-secretary-state-speaks-next-senior-south-korean-official-kim.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:06:17","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.145},{"id":256739140,"title":"Kamala Harris Takes Lead Over Trump in Fox News Poll","text":"A new Fox News national poll shows that Vice President Kamala Harris is beating former President Donald Trump by 2 percentage points.The survey shows a 3-point shift among registered voters in their feelings around the candidates in the 2024 presidential election since August.Last month, Trump had a 1-point advantage, but now Harris is ahead by 2 points. The Democratic candidate was polling at 50 percent of favorability in the Fox survey, while her opponent received 48 percent of the support.Trump supporters—72 percent—say they like his policies and record. Almost 20 percent say they \"simply dislike Harris.\"Harris' supporters are a bit more mixed, with 42 percent liking her policies and record, 24 percent liking her character, and 33 percent backing her because they dislike Trump.The new polling comes after multiple events that could have provided additional support to Harris. The Democratic National Convention was held in August. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the presidential race and shared his support for Trump, with Kennedy's name being removed from some of the ballots throughout the country. Harris has received endorsements from politicians like Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Representative Liz Cheney, as well as celebrities like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish.Trump also faced an apparent second assassination attempt.The biggest changes, according to the Fox polling, come from the independent and Hispanic voters.In August, independent voters favored Trump by 8 points. They now favor Harris by 12 points.Last month, Hispanic voters favored Trump by 6 points.

United States (US) Secret Service agents opened fire on Sunday afternoon on a man who was spotted pointing an AK-style rifle through a fence while hiding in the bushes as Trump golfed at his club in West Palm Beach. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) described it as an apparent attempted assassination on the GOP nominee. At a Pennsylvania rally in July, Trump was grazed in the ear by a bullet when a gunman was able to gain access to an unsecured roof, unleashing a hail of bullets that left one of Trump’s supporters dead and two others badly injured. While the Secret Service has grappled with how to keep Trump safe as he campaigns across the country, holding rallies that often draw thousands, less attention has focused on his protection when he is off the trail, often at his own clubs and properties. The fact that there are places along the perimeter of the property where golfers – including Trump – are visible to those standing behind the fence has long been known to law enforcement. While Trump was president, news photographers were often able to capture images of him on the greens by finding gaps in the shrubbery. While Trump’s plans to golf on Sunday were not part of any public schedule, on days he is not campaigning, he can often be found golfing at one of his courses. Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach, about a 10-minute drive from his Mar-a-Lago residence, is a favourite. One of three golf clubs he owns in Florida, it boasts 27 holes of championship golf, as well as event spaces. Trump often eats lunch and holds meetings in the clubhouse between rounds. Trump had just returned from a West Coast swing that included stops in Las Vegas and Utah, and had announced on social media that he would be delivering remarks on Monday from Mar-a-Lago about cryptocurrency as he launches a new crypto platform. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw noted at a briefing that because Trump is no longer in office, security protocols around the course had loosened. “He’s not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded. But because he’s not, his security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible,” he told reporters. Law enforcement officials praised the work of the agents assigned to protect Trump. One agent, tasked with jumping one hole ahead of the former president to scope out potential threats, managed to spot the gunman’s rifle barrel sticking out of the fence that surrounds the golf club and “immediately engaged that individual”, Bradshaw said. In an email to campaign staff on Sunday night, senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles credited the Secret Service for saving Trump, who has praised the agents in his own protective detail for their bravery as they rushed on stage to protect him in Butler, Pennsylvania. “President Trump and everyone accompanying him are safe thanks to the great work of the US Secret Service,” they wrote. Unlike other past presidents and typical VIPs who live in private residences with tall fences or in gated communities, Trump has his official residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. The club is open to dues-paying members, who mingle with the former president at meals and at events and can invite their own guests to the property. Many nights, Trump holds court on the club’s patio, playing DJ with his iPad. While president, he once plotted a response to a North Korean missile launch from the candlelit terrace, the meeting captured and posted on social media by a club member. The club is also a popular Palm Beach venue and hosts a constant stream of fundraisers, weddings and other events that sometimes see Trump drop by unannounced. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a social media post that the agency is working closely with the FBI, Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office and other law enforcement to investigate what happened. Trump will be briefed in person by Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr about the investigation, according to a person familiar with the plan who was not authorised to speak publicly. The incident sparked immediate finger-pointing and calls for answers on Capitol Hill. New York Representative Elise Stefanik, the House Republican Conference chair and a close ally of the former president, said she was grateful Trump was safe. “However, we must ask ourselves how an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again?” she asked in a statement. The leaders of the bipartisan task force that has been investigating the security failures in Pennsylvania said they were monitoring the situation and had requested a briefing from the Secret Service. “We are thankful that the former president was not harmed, but remain deeply concerned about political violence and condemn it in all of its forms,” said Representative Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania, and Representative Jason Crow, D-Colorado, in a joint statement. Meanwhile, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, one of Trump’s rivals in the GOP primary, said his state will conduct its own investigation. “The people deserve the truth about the would be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards of the former president and current GOP nominee,” he wrote in a social media post. Democratic Representative Ro Khanna echoed that message. “Two assassination attempts in 60 days on a former president and the Republican nominee is unacceptable,” he wrote. “The Secret Service must come to Congress tomorrow, tell us what resources are needed to expand the protective perimeter, and lets allocate it in a bipartisan vote the same day.” President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was “relieved” that Trump was unharmed and said “there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country”. He said he had directed his staff “to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former president’s continued safety”.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/two-too-many/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P24-B1_19092024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:05:40","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":256739058,"title":"House Defeats Mike Johnson’s Spending Bill as Government Shutdown Looms","text":"The House on Wednesday defeated a $1.6 trillion stopgap spending bill to extend current government funding into March and impose new proof-of-citizenship requirements on voter registration, as Republicans and Democrats alike rejected Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal to avert a shutdown at the end of the month.

Is that true?","text":"Former President Donald Trump regularly criticizes President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over what inflation is costing families, citing one figure in particular. At a Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13, Trump blamed Harris for causing \"the worst inflation in American history, costing us and the typical family $28,000.\" He also highlighted the $28,000 figure at recent rallies in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona.Under President Biden, year-over-year inflation — or the pace of price increases — peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the highest monthly figure in about 40 years, but it has since cooled considerably. In August, inflation hit a three-year low of 2.5%. Lower inflation means the rate of price increases has slowed, but not that prices themselves have decreased. CBS News' price tracker shows the cost of everyday household expenses remain higher compared to pre-pandemic levels.Economists told CBS News that Trump's $28,000 figure is largely correct. Citing the figure on its own, however, ignores the crucial context that inflation led to income growth, not just price hikes. Data indicates that over the last three and a half years, many Americans have seen a net positive increase in their finances.Where the $28,000 figure comes fromThe estimate that inflation has cost the typical American household $28,000 since Mr. Biden took office is consistent with an inflation tracker from Republicans on Congress' Joint Economic Committee. The tracker is based on government data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis of state-level personal consumption expenditures — one measure of spending on goods and services. The study tracked monthly costs for the average American household in each state since January 2021. From that point through July 2024, the average cumulative increase in household costs among all 50 states and Washington, D.C., was $27,950, due to inflation. In an update for August 2024, the increase rose to around $29,000.Economists told CBS News the estimate for the total increase in household costs in the last three and a half years is likely in the correct range. Experts generally agree that household costs have increased since January 2021, although the precise number differs depending on the specific metrics used. Comparing price increases under Trump and BidenThe Republicans on the Joint Economic Committee told CBS News they did not do a similar analysis of how household costs changed under Trump's administration.Government data shows prices also grew under Trump, but by much less. The Consumer Price Index for all items increased by around 8% over Trump's four years in office. By comparison, the total increase in consumer prices thus far under Biden is around 20%. Of course, the two faced markedly different economic circumstances during their time in the White House. While Trump's administration enjoyed low inflation and healthy job growth for much of his time in office, the pandemic leveled the economy toward the end of his term. Early in the Biden administration, inflation reached modern highs as the economy recovered from employment and global supply chain disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many other countries around the world also saw high inflation due to the pandemic — in some cases far higher than the U.S.The Federal Reserve believes keeping inflation at a low, stable rate of around 2% year-over-year is best for a well functioning economy where people and businesses can plan financially. It's typical for prices to grow throughout a presidential term. A reduction in prices, or deflation, is generally not thought of as desirable by economists, and price increases are considered a feature of a healthy economy. How incomes have fared under BidenEconomists say price increases should be compared to income increases to fully understand how inflation is affecting people's finances.Mark Zandi of the independent Moody's Analytics told CBS News that due to inflation, the median American household spent $905 more in August 2024 to purchase the same goods and services than they did in August 2021. However, the median household made $1,073 more in August 2024 than it did three years ago.Cumulatively, the Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee told CBS News that their calculations show the average family earned $35,390 in additional wages and salaries between the start of Mr. Biden's term and July 2024 — a figure that's more than $7,000 greater than the total increase in household costs over that time period estimated by the committee's Republicans.As of last year, Americans' incomes had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census, in 2023, median household income rose a healthy 4%, to $80,610, on par with earnings in 2019 on an inflation-adjusted basis. Another way to measure the financial health of Americans is to look at government data on real disposable personal income, which reflects after-tax income adjusted for inflation. This income figure includes not only wages and salaries but also income from investments and government subsidies. Disposable personal income has been higher on average during Mr. Biden's term than it was in December 2020, Trump's last full month in office. According to Gary Burtless, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, real disposable personal income per person has been above $49,407 — where it was in December 2020 — for 30 of the 43 months of Mr. Biden's term so far.\"Given that Americans' actual real incomes have increased over the course of the Biden administration, it's a little hard to see the basis for claiming that 'inflation under Biden has cost the typical U.S. family $28,000,'\" Burtless said.","summary":"Economists told CBS News the calculation is incomplete, since average household incomes have also risen over that time period.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-inflation-cost-households-28000-biden-harris-fact-check/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/30/28b7538d-d1e6-4469-a72a-b90b86de6cf6/thumbnail/1200x630/8b2f5fa9eeb54071a624f4a39c333d7e/gettyimages-2168336208.jpg?v=1736e554a81339b452bb43c01c071a51","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3186163_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:04:54","author":"Laura Doan","authors":["Laura Doan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.542},{"id":256741378,"title":"New poll: Republicans disagree with Trump and want him to debate again","text":"Last Thursday, Donald Trump ruled out a second presidential debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Republican voters disagree with him. A new Civiqs poll conducted for Daily Kos poll shows that a plurality of Republican voters (46%) think there should be another debate, while 42% think there shouldn’t. But that’s not the only aspect of the debate where Trump and his voters don’t quite see eye to eye. “Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris,” he insisted on his Truth Social platform. Those polls Trump was touting—like a web poll from the far-right outlet Newsmax—aren’t exactly high-quality polls. But Republicans aren't as enthusiastic about Trump's supposed win as he is. The new Civiqs poll finds that only 66% said Trump won, while 12% said Harris won. That’s a stark difference from Democratic voters' view of the debate: 94% think Harris won, and only 2% think she lost. Given how polarized America’s politics are, you wouldn’t expect a 28-percentage-point gulf between partisans saying their candidate won a debate. In other words, Democratic voters felt much better about their candidate’s debate performance than Republicans did about their candidate. Of course, Trump has experience in turning off even his most loyal supporters. A recent Wall Street Journal article found that people are indeed leaving Trump's rallies early, as Harris claimed and Trump disputed during the debate. And those early exits are likely due to how much time he spends rambling incoherently about things like “the late, great Hannibal Lecter” and how bitter he still is about losing the 2020 election. The New York Times found that at three recent rallies, his speeches averaged over an hour and a half, with folks dipping out the longer he rambled. “We thought it was our best debate ever—it was my best debate ever, I think, and it was very interesting,” Trump said in the media spin room following the Sept. 10 debate. If that’s the case, maybe Republicans don’t want another debate.","summary":"Last Thursday, Donald Trump ruled out a second presidential debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

And it’s pretty obvious that he, his running mate, JD Vance, and their campaign see longer-term utility in keeping this narrative going. In a speech Friday, Trump said, “I’m angry about illegal Haitian migrants taking over Springfield, Ohio,” even though the majority of the Haitians in Springfield are there legally. In an interview on Sunday, Vance left the impression that he was making things up to amplify the smear against Springfield’s Haitian community: “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.” What Trump is doing is important to the outcome of the election, and it’s not simply the usual race baiting aimed at charging up part of his base. He has failed for weeks to come up with an effective line of attack against Kamala Harris. But with Springfield, he has found a fear-driven argument that places the issue of immigration right into the town square of a Midwestern city in one of the most electorally important states, and it looks like he and Vance see this as a more potent argument than just talking about the Southern border: There’s reason to believe that they’re trying to stoke public anger and garner public support around immigration policies that Trump promoted in his first term and that he presumably hopes to act on in a second.","summary":"The Springfield fable is part of a crusade to throw immigrants out of the country.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/opinion/trump-haitians-immigration-springfield.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/18/multimedia/tfbg/tfbg-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:00:11","author":"Charles M.

Since tying the knot in 2022, the couple now share two children, Sterling and Patrick, and are excitedly expecting their third. \"Happy Birthday to one of the greatest humans ever, my husband, best friend and the best daddy ever! \" she gushed on Instagram. \"We are so grateful you are ours! We Love Youuuuuu.\" The Instagram tribute featured a series of adorable snaps showcasing the couple's blissful life with their young and expanding brood. Brittany went all out for the occasion, decking their home with an extravagant balloon display. Among the guests was none other than Taylor Swift, the pop icon dating Pat Mahomes' Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce, quashing any speculation of a feud. Last season saw Brittany and Swift often side by side as the Chiefs clinched consecutive Super Bowl victories. However, this season has seen a change, with the pair not spotted together at Chiefs games, including the recent nail-biting 26-25 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals at Arrowhead. The rumour mill spun into overdrive when Mahomes liked a policy picture of former President Donald Trump on Instagram, while Swift is known for her support of Vice President Kamala Harris, sparking talk of a potential rift. However, it's reported that Brittany is reconsidering her support for the ex-President after he expressed his dislike for Swift, following her endorsement. A source revealed to Mail Online: \"This deeply bothered Brittany because Taylor is like a sister to her and she has done absolutely nothing wrong. She didn't mention Trump in her post and is allowed to speak her mind.\" Swift was snapped at the event alongside fellow Chiefs WAGs Chariah Gordon and Sheawna Weathersby, who are partners of Chiefs stars, Mecole Hardman and Chris Jones. The trio took to the photo booth for some snaps, which were later posted on social media. Brittany Mahomes and Swift stand by their men as they aim for NFL history, a three-peat of Vince Lombardi trophies. A 2-0 start has set the pace for the Chiefs, who have already defeated two of their biggest rivals, the Baltimore Ravens, and the Bengals. Kelce's performance in 2024, and for much of 2023, hasn't been up to his usual standard, though. The tight end has only managed four catches and 39 receiving yards this year. He gained just five yards against the Bengals, marking his least productive game since Pat Mahomes became the Chiefs' starting quarterback. \"They're doing a great job of just kind of having two people for him,\" Mahomes commented on the Bengals' coverage of Kelce. \"Pretty much the entire game.\"","summary":"Brittany Mahomes has posted a touching message to her husband Patrick Mahomes on his 29th birthday, as the couple appeared to put rumors of a rift to bed","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/american-sports/mahomes-swift-rift-rumours-patrick-33696989","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/article33696986.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_nfl-sep-15-bengals-at-chiefs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 23:00:00","author":"Joshua Mbu","authors":["Joshua Mbu"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.574},{"id":256739416,"title":"First-of-its-kind facility hopes to launch Canada into rare earths market","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Bloc MPs will vote confidence in Liberal government next week: Blanchet The Conservatives' first shot at toppling the Liberal government is likely doomed to fail, after Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-François Blanchet told reporters his MPs will vote confidence in the government.

The powerful union decided to stay neutral in a presidential race for the first time in over a quarter-century - despite releasing internal polling of the union's rank-and-file membership showing majority support for Trump. And the populist former president and his campaign quickly spotlighted the strong support among union workers. \"It's a great honor. They're not going to endorse the Democrats. That's a big thing,\" Trump told reporters shortly after the Teamsters announcement, during a stop in New York City ahead of holding a rally on nearby Long Island. DAVID MARCUS: WHY TEAMSTERS MEMBERS THINK TRUMP, NOT HARRIS, IS THE REAL FRIEND OF THE WORKING MAN In a release titled \"Union Workers Support President Donald Trump,\" the campaign highlighted the former president's more than 25-point margin over the vice president in both on-line and phone survey's of Teamsters members. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued in a statement that \"the hardworking members of the Teamsters have been loud and clear — they want President Trump back in the White House! These hardworking men and women are the backbone of America and President Trump will strongly stand up for them when he’s back in the White House.\" The powerful union, which has over one million members in the U.S. and is deeply connected to working-class voters in the key Midwestern general election battlegrounds and in other swing states across the country, until now had endorsed the Democratic candidate for president in every election since 1980. And the Teamsters became the only one of the nation's top ten not to back Harris in the 2024 presidential showdown. Asked if the move by the Teamsters will impact the election, Trump said \"I think it will. Yeah, I think so. The Teamsters carry a lot of weight.\" Trump's support among Teamsters has surged since Harris replaced President Biden at the top of the Democratic Party's 2024 ticket two months ago, the union's data indicated. The union's polling prior to Biden dropping out showed the president was ahead of Trump among members, 44.3% to 36.3%. DNC APPARENTLY SNUBS TEAMSTERS PRESIDENT FOLLOWING HIS HISTORIC RNC SPEECH Biden made history as the first president to walk the picket lines with striking workers. In explaining the reasoning for declining to endorse a 2024 presidential candidate on Wednesday, the union said in a statement, \"The union’s extensive member polling showed no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump.\" Teamsters general president Sean O'Brien said that \"neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business.\" \"We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges,\" O’Brien added. O'Brien, speaking to reporters on Monday after the union’s executive board meeting with Harris [the board met earlier this year with Trump and separately with Biden], said that the polling of the rank and file members would be an important factor – but not the only factor in whether they would endorse – and if so – whom they would endorse. UNION LEADER'S PROVOCATIVE RNC SPEECH DRAWS IRE FROM SOME IN ORGANIZED LABOR O’Brien noted that any endorsement is \"going to come down to the rank and file members, the polling and also the discussion and deliberation of the general executive board.\"He also reiterated his criticism of Trump's recent comments in an interview with billionaire business mogul Elon Musk – when the former president praised the tech CEO for retaliating against striking workers by firing them – which is illegal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Asked if Trump's comments would impact the Teamsters endorsement, O'Brien said \"it plays into the decision.\" The Harris campaign, in a statement to Fox News after the move by the union not to back either major party presidential nominee, pointed to endorsements from \"many Teamsters locals and rank-and-file.\" \"While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labor for her entire career,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said. Hitt added that \"the Vice President’s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her - alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor. As the Vice President told the Teamsters on Monday, when she is elected president, she will look out for the Teamsters rank-and-file no matter what - because they always have been and always will be the people she fights for.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.","summary":"In an internal poll, rank-and-file members of the Teamsters preferred former President Trump over Vice President Harris by 44.3% to 36.3%.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-camp-touts-union-workers-support-after-teamsters-shock-announcement","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/931/523/GettyImages-2161594214-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 22:57:14","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":256740132,"title":"JD Vance boasts he’ll keep calling Springfield Haitians ‘illegal aliens’ even though he knows they aren’t","text":"JD Vance has suggested that he will continue to call Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio “illegal” aliens despite knowing that they’re here legally. During a campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina on Wednesday, Vance was asked by Politico what would happen to migrants in the country under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, such as many of those in Springfield, during a possible second Trump administration. The Republican vice presidential nominee was also asked how the administration would go about deporting migrants in the country legally. “The media loves to say that the Haitian migrants hundreds of thousands of them, by the way, 20,000 in Springfield, but hundreds of thousands of them all across the country, they are here legally,” Vance said. “And what they mean is that Kamala Harris used two separate programs, mass parole and temporary protective status ... to wave a wand and to say, ‘We're not going to deport those people here.’” He added: “Well, if Kamala Harris waves the wand illegally and says these people are now here legally, I'm still going to call them an illegal alien. And illegal action from Kamala Harris does not make an alien legal. That is not how this works.” Many of the Haitian migrants currently in the US came to the country under the Biden administration’s TPS and Humanitarian parole program, which allows migrants from Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Venezuela to come to the US legally if they have a sponsor and meet certain requirements. Some who are eligible can wait in the country as their permanent immigration status is ironed out. The city of Springfield states on its website that “YES, Haitian immigrants are here legally, under the Immigration Parole Program. Once here, immigrants are then eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Haiti is designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security for TPS. Current TPS is granted through February 3, 2026.” Several reports have now confirmed that an aide to Vance was told by a Springfield official previously this month that the claims about Haitian migrants stealing and eating domestic pets were baseless but that former President Donald Trump’s running mate went ahead and spread the claims anyway, according to the Wall Street Journal and ABC News. On September 9, city manager Bryan Heck told a Vance staffer in a call that the “claims were baseless.” But Vance chose not to remove a post on X that he shared that very same morning claiming that “reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” The following day, Trump made the same claim during the presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. The Vance campaign handed The Journal a police report to try to back up their claims, but the report turned out to have been based on a mistake. The woman who filed the report, Anna Kilgore, had lost her cat and believed her Haitian neighbors may be to blame. But her cat came back home unscathed several days later, and Kilgore apologized to her neighbors. She told ABC News that she believed that her neighbors could have been behind her cat’s disappearance because of rumors being spread on Facebook and TikTok. “I wish I could take it all back,” she told ABC News. Appearing on CNN over the weekend, Vance said he had to “create stories” to make the US media focus on immigration. “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast,” he said. He then claimed that the rumors come “from firsthand accounts from my constituents. I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it.” “I didn’t create 20,000 illegal migrants coming into Springfield thanks to Kamala Harris’s policies. Her policies did that,” he added on Sunday.","summary":"‘If Kamala Harris waves the wand illegally and says these people are now here legally, I’m still going to call them an illegal alien,’ Republican vice presidential hopeful says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-springfield-ohio-haiti-b2615294.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/18/22/SEI222219092.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ea5n7NP6-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-18 22:56:10","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":256738796,"title":"Trump to Hold New York Rally, First Since 2nd Assassination Attempt","text":"UNIONDALE, N.Y.—Former President Donald Trump will hold his first full rally since surviving a second apparent assassination attempt over the weekend. The rally will be held in Uniondale, New York a city on Republican-leaning Long Island in the deep-blue state of New York. Long Island is home to several highly competitive congressional districts that could determine control of the House in the next Congress. Ahead of the event, a large crowd had already assembled at the venue, the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which seats around 13,000 people. Most seats were filled. The failed plot was top of mind for attendees. William Diver, a 70-year-old from Farmingville, New York, called the attempted assassination “disgusting” and expressed hope that the federal government could find answers to the events that unfolded that day. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii has been charged with two federal gun crimes over the incident, with further charges expected as both federal and state authorities probe the case. Others questioned the adequacy of the Secret Service’s protective measures. The agency has been under intense scrutiny since the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, two months ago, which increased after the Florida incident. “It was terrible. It was horrible,” attendee Ariel Kohan said when asked about the recent attempt on Trump’s life. “The Secret Service has to step up and do a much better job. But, you know, like, thank God for that one secret service agent that saw the barrel of the gun sticking out of the shrub,” Kohan added, referencing the Secret Service agent who noticed a rifle sticking through the fence at the golf course and immediately began to open fire. Acting Service Service Director Ronald Rowe defended the agency’s measures at the golf course, calling them “effective.” President Joe Biden acknowledged that the agency “needs more help,” and suggested that Congress consider giving them more funding. Congressional leaders are mulling providing additional funds. Trump promised in that post that he would “get SALT back,” referencing the state and local tax (SALT) federal deduction that’s important to residents of high-tax states like New York and New Jersey. Under Trump’s 2017 tax legislation, SALT deductions were capped at $10,000 per filer. Some Republicans have pushed for getting rid of the deduction altogether, though New York Republicans are generally supportive of uncapping it. Polling shows that the state, despite Trump’s optimism, is likely to be won by Vice President Kamala Harris in November. But Republicans have seen a much stronger performance on Long Island, where the party controls three of the island’s four House seats—seats that could be crucial in ensuring a Republican-led House for Trump should he regain the White House. Earlier the same day, fears arose regarding a reported bomb threat near the area. The rally comes after the 1.3 million member Teamsters Union announced that it wouldn’t make an endorsement for president for the first time since 1966. Trump marketed the decision as a win for Republicans, calling it “a big thing” that the powerful union wasn’t endorsing Democrats.","summary":"Attendees at the Long Island rally shared their reactions to the gunman at the Trump Golf Course on Sunday.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-to-hold-new-york-rally-first-since-2nd-assassination-attempt-5726550","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/18/id5726271-GettyImages-2172740083-Donald-Trump-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 22:56:05","author":"Joseph Lord,Michael Washburn","authors":["Joseph Lord","Michael Washburn"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":256739412,"title":"Iranian hackers stole Trump information and sent it to Biden campaign","text":"Information from former President Donald Trump’s campaign was stolen by Iranian hackers and offered to President Joe Biden’s campaign (Picture: Getty Images) Iranian hackers sent information they stole from ex-President Donald Trump’s campaign and sent it to President Joe Biden’s team, the FBI said. The election interference attempt happened in late June or early July, before Biden ended his reelection bid, according to the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday. Hackers ‘sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails’, stated the three agencies jointly. There is no evidence that Biden’s staff responded to the unsolicited inquiries, the officials said. The news broke as Trump headed to a rally at Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York. His campaign quickly called on Biden and Harris to admit if they used any of the information. ‘This is further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election to help Kamala Harris and Joe Biden because they know President Trump will restore his tough sanctions and stand against their reign of terror,’ stated Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt. ‘Kamala and Biden must come clean on whether they used the hacked material given to them by the Iranians to hurt President Trump. ‘What did they know and when did they know it?’ The Harris campaign acknowledged that ‘a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt’. ‘We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign,’ Harris campaign national security spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein told CNN. ‘We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in US elections including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.’ Got a story?

Robert Hughes (MetroTalk, Fri) says landlords are leaving the market at a time of considerable demand for rental housing. He makes a case for the restoration of full tax relief on financing costs for their properties. He points out that previous governments have treated them as investors rather than businesses and denied tax relief for those costs largely on that basis. It is worth pointing out that governments have also treated commercial landlords as investors, yet they allow full tax relief for financing costs against rental profits for those landlords. Given the clamour for residential properties and the number of commercial properties lying empty, one wonders if it is time for a change of policy. Whether it would have the effect put forward by Mr Hughes I do not know but it has to be worth a try if for no other reason than to put an end to an inequitable situation. Paul Enticknap, Guildford MP Diane Abbott’s comment about her being treated as a ‘non-person’ by Sir Keir Starmer (Metro, Wed) is one of the reasons why the Labour Party will never again get my vote, under its present leader. The veteran MP said she was ‘frightened’ after businessman and Tory donor Frank Hester said looking at her ‘made you just want to hate all black women’ and that she ‘should be shot’. Ms Abbott said Sir Keir ‘never reached out to me’ in the aftermath of the comments earlier this year. And while she has been treated shamefully by the Labour Party she is not the only MP to have suffered this indignity. Several Labour MPs have had the whip suspended because of their so-called ‘left-wing’ views. Even former leader Jeremy Corbyn was booted out over his response to findings of antisemitism within the party. This purge of the left wing very much reminds me of the Senator Joseph McCarthy vicious hunt for ‘reds under the beds’ in 1950s America. For much of my life I voted Labour because I thought that they were a broad church and a political party that stood for diversity of opinion, tolerance and fairness. I no longer believe this to be the case under the leadership of Sir Keir Starmer.Al Charlton, via email Managing mental health I agree wholeheartedly with Andrew McLuskey (MetroTalk, Mon) that we need to grow our social care provision with revenue from wealth taxes as part of necessary reforms to the NHS. Another way we could save money would be to further merge mental health with the rest of the NHS. As far as I can see, mental health is only managed separately because it always has been, going back to the era of lunatic asylums. Many psychiatrists support combining mental and physical health care services – and it makes sense medically, given how much we are learning about the links between mental and physical health. By putting them both under one roof, we will have fewer managers, more frontline staff and a more efficient system. Given that a round of new hospitals are supposed to be on the way, now should be an ideal time to make this change. The only thing that’s stopping this from happening seems to be a lack of political imagination. Rob Slater, Norfolk New specs? At least PM can see why we must aid Ukraine To further respond to Owen (MetroTalk, Tue), who suggests ending British assistance to Ukraine as, in his words, it is a war that Russia cannot lose and is nothing to do with us. He says the £12.7billion we have pledged would be better spent in paying for the £1.to be 3billion saved by limiting the winter fuel allowance. This is a pernicious point of view and l suggest he looks up the history of appeasement to Hitler in the late 1930s – it didn’t end well. It is directly in ours and Europe’s interests to keep bleeding Russia, which is now a properly fascist state bent on restoring the Soviet empire/greater Russia, however long it takes. China is much the same. If we allow Ukraine to be conquered and violently erased as a nation then the Baltic states will be next and war with Nato will follow. Because we have nuclear weapons the war will not escalate into armageddon, a fact that grey-haired CND supporters might wish to consider, but it will still be pretty grim. Far better to aid the Ukranians who are bravely shedding their blood and ignore the siren calls of Donald Trump and the far right to negotiate a surrender. To his credit, Sir Keir Starmer sees this clearly – perhaps it is his expensive glasses that help.

(It’s been in business 179 years, even longer than The Atlantic.) As an aspiring nerd in my youth—I began college as a chemistry major—I read it regularly. In 2017, I contributed a short article to it about the public’s view of science, drawn from my book The Death of Expertise. But the magazine’s decision to break with tradition and endorse Kamala Harris—only the second such nod in the magazine’s history—is a mistake, as was its 2020 endorsement of Joe Biden, on multiple levels. I understand the frustration that probably led to this decision. Donald Trump is the most willfully ignorant man ever to hold the presidency. He does not understand even basic concepts of … well, almost anything. (Yesterday, he explained to a woman in Michigan that he would lower food prices by limiting food imports—in other words, by reducing the supply of food. Trump went to the Wharton School, where I assume “supply and demand” was part of the first-year curriculum.) He is insensate to anything that conflicts with his needs or beliefs, and briefing him on any topic is virtually impossible. When a scientific crisis—a pandemic—struck, Trump was worse than useless. He approved the government program to work with private industry to create vaccines, but he also flogged nutty theories about an unproven drug therapy and later undermined public confidence in the vaccines he’d helped bring to fruition. His stubborn stupidity literally cost American lives. It makes sense, then, that a magazine of science would feel the need to inform its readers about the dangers of such a man returning to public office. To be honest, almost any sensible magazine about anything probably wants to endorse his opponent, because of Trump’s baleful effects on just about every corner of American life. (Cat Fancy magazine-—now called Catster-—should be especially eager to write up a jeremiad about Trump and his running mate, J. D. Vance. But I digress.) Strange as it seems to say it, a magazine devoted to science should not take sides in a political contest. For one thing, it doesn’t need to endorse anyone: The readers of a magazine such as Scientific American are likely people who have a pretty good grasp of a variety of concepts, including causation, the scientific method, peer review, and probability. It’s something of an insult to these readers to explain to them that Trump has no idea what any of those words mean. They likely know this already. Now, I am aware that the science and engineering community has plenty of Trump voters in it. (I know some of them.) But one of the most distinctive qualities of Trump supporters is that they are not swayed by the appeals of intellectuals. They’re voting for reasons of their own, and they are not waiting for the editors of Scientific American to brainiac-splain why Trump is bad for knowledge. In fact, we have at least some evidence that scientists taking sides in politics can backfire. In 2021, a researcher asked a group that included both Biden and Trump supporters to look at two versions of the prestigious journal Nature—one with merely an informative page about the magazine, the other carrying an endorsement of Biden. Here is the utterly unsurprising result: In other words, readers who supported Biden shrugged; Trump supporters decided that Nature was taking sides and was therefore an unreliable source of scientific information. But even if Scientific American’s editors felt that the threat to science and knowledge was so dire that they had to endorse a candidate, they did it the worst way possible. They could have made a case for electing Harris as a matter of science acting in self-defense, because Trump, who chafes at any version of science that does not serve him, plans to destroy the relationship between expertise and government by obliterating the independence of the government’s scientific institutions. This is an obvious danger, especially when Trump is consorting with kooks such as Laura Loomer and has floated bringing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s crackpot circus into the government. Instead, the magazine gave a standard-issue left-liberal endorsement that focused on health care, reproductive rights, gun safety, climate policy, technology policy, and the economy. Although science and data play their role in debates around such issues, most of the policy choices they present are not specifically scientific questions: In the end, almost all political questions are about values—and how voters think about risks and rewards. Science cannot answer those questions; it can only tell us about the likely consequences of our choices. Also unhelpful is that some of the endorsement seemed to be drawn from the Harris campaign’s talking points, such as this section: An endorsement based on Harris’s tax proposals—which again, are policy choices—belongs in a newspaper or financial journal. It’s not a matter of science, any more than her views on abortions or guns or anything else are. I realize that my objections seem like I’m asking scientists to be morally neutral androids who have no feelings on important issues. Many decent people want to express their objections to Trump in the public square, regardless of their profession, and scientists are not required to be some cloistered monastic order. But policy choices are matters of judgment and belong in the realm of politics and democratic choice. If the point of a publication such as Scientific American is to increase respect for science and knowledge as part of creating a better society, then the magazine’s highly politicized endorsement of Harris does not serve that cause.

Two-hundred and six Democrats and 14 Republicans voted against the spending bill, which in addition to funding the government at current levels until March 28, 2025, would have mandated proof-of-citizenship nationwide when registering to vote. Just 199 Republicans and three Democratic renegades voted in favor of it. Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) voted present. House Democratic leaders whipped their caucus to cast the “no” votes, while some GOP lawmakers resistant to spending bills without cuts ultimately kept the bill from passing. The opposition came less than a month after members of the conservative Freedom Caucus pushed for the continuing resolution to authorize federal spending paired with the voter registration provisions, though several still voted the package down on the floor. Newly installed Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris (R-Md.) unsuccessfully tried to persuade members to back it earlier Wednesday. “We owe it to our constituents to pass legislation preventing illegal immigrants from voting in federal elections—an actual threat to our democracy,” Harris posted on X. “I urge my colleagues to protect the integrity of our elections and pass the CR/SAVE Act.” A senior House Republican aide who spoke with The Post accused the fiscal hardliners of “taking our leverage” on Democrats in government spending negotiations going forward — and eliminating the chances of the GOP-backed voter registration measure ever being taken up in the Senate. “We could’ve set up a shutdown fight that had a message,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a strong proponent of the continuing resolution, or CR, claiming that strengthening voter registration standards was an “80%+ issue.” “We had a chance to pressure the Uniparty (and a two-fer fight to avoid lame duck), but that’s (likely) not going to happen now,” he bemoaned. Hours before the vote, former President Donald Trump further scrambled plans by suggesting Republicans force a government shutdown if the voting bill, the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, didn’t pass both chambers of Congress. “If Republicans don’t get the SAVE Act, and every ounce of it, they should not agree to a Continuing Resolution in any way, shape, or form,” Trump, 78, posted on his Truth Social account. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday that the brinkmanship would end badly. “One thing you cannot have is a government shutdown. It would be politically beyond stupid for us to do that right before the election, because certainly we’d get the blame,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said. “It will be a Republican shutdown,” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) echoed in a floor speech Wednesday morning. Many federal employees are furloughed and not paid for the shutdown period, though some political appointees would be. Essential benefit programs like Social Security still remain active. It’s illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections, though hundreds have been caught doing so in recent years and thousands more have been found on state voter rolls. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have both championed the SAVE Act as a fix to an earlier federal voting law that was allowing voter registration forms to easily get into the hands of non-citizens receiving welfare benefits or applying for driver’s license. Johnson (R-La.) was forced last week to pull the stopgap and voting package from the floor ahead of a planned vote, postponing its consideration until his conference could reach a “consensus.” He maintained optimism ahead of a second try the following week, even as at least half a dozen House Republicans — including Greene, who threatened to oust Johnson earlier this year over a foreign aid funding bill — had made clear they would not support the legislation “Congress has an immediate obligation to do two very important things. We have to keep the government funded, and we need to make sure that our elections are secure,” he said on Fox News Wednesday morning. “We’re moving legislation today to have a continuing resolution to keep the government going for six months and to make sure that illegals cannot vote, noncitizens cannot vote in the upcoming election,” he added. “It’s a number one issue around the country.”","summary":"The House of Representatives voted down a six-month stopgap government funding bill paired with a GOP-backed voter registration measure on Wednesday amid bipartisan opposition — leaving lawmakers fewer than 12 days to avert a partial shutdown.

It was voted down 202 to 220, with two Republicans – Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky. – voting \"present.\" Several Republicans voted against House GOP leadership’s bill, a six-month extension of the current year’s federal funding levels coupled with a measure to require proof of citizenship in the voter registration process. The bill began hemorrhaging support soon after Johnson rolled it out during a conference call with House Republicans earlier this month – to the frustration of the majority of the House GOP. A significant number of Republicans object to a stop-gap spending patch called a continuing resolution (CR) on principle – believing it to be an unnecessary extension of government bloat. CLUB FOR GROWTH POURS $5M INTO TIGHT HOUSE RACES AS GOP BRACES FOR TOUGH ELECTION National security hawks expressed concern about the impact of a six-month funding extension on military readiness without added funds to keep up with rising costs. The discord has caused tensions to run high within the House GOP. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a vocal supporter of the bill and author of the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, said of fellow Republicans: \"I would dare any one of my colleagues who are against this plan, come forward with a better plan that we will actually be able to move, pass, and unite the Republican Party to go beat Democrats.\" \"Don’t predict failure and then be the reason why we fail – and that’s what some of my friends are doing, unfortunately,\" Roy said on Steve Bannon’s \"War Room\" program. Johnson allies have also pointed out that this plan would be a strong opening salvo in a negotiation with the Democrat-controlled Senate on government funding – the speaker himself has repeatedly said the SAVE Act is worth fighting for. JOHNSON UNVEILS TRUMP-BACKED HOUSE GOP PLAN TO AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, SETS UP BATTLE WITH SCHUMER Both Republican and Democratic leaders have conceded a CR is necessary to give congressional negotiators more time past the Oct. 1 deadline to hash out fiscal year 2025’s priorities. Democrats, however, have called for a \"clean\" CR free from conservative policy riders. And senior lawmakers in both parties argued that a CR through December is the best course of action to allow Congress to reevaluate after the election. Johnson has repeatedly insisted he had no \"plan B\" beyond Wednesday’s vote. He said as much to GOP lawmakers in a closed-door Wednesday morning meeting, two sources told Fox News Digital. MCCARTHY'S 'FINAL STRUGGLES' THREATEN TO HAUNT JOHNSON'S GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FIGHT But with his initial plan defeated, Johnson is now caught between two warring Republican factions – one that wants him to leverage a partial government shutdown, and one that is reluctantly conceding that the House GOP could be left with no choice but to pass a \"clean\" CR into December. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, who initially backed the six-month CR plus SAVE Act plan, more recently advocated for congressional Republicans to shut down the government if they did not get \"absolute assurances on election security.\" A majority of Republicans, however, are publicly and privately conceding that they would bear the brunt of public anger over a government shutdown weeks before Election Day.

As an incentive, Johnson sought to appease hardline conservatives who are generally against continuing resolutions of any length by attaching the GOP-led SAVE Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. However, that effort failed in a 202-220 vote as 14 Republicans joined nearly all Democrats in rejecting the spending package, falling short of the majority needed to advance the lower chamber. Johnson knew the bill was likely to fail well before it came to the floor as several of his GOP colleagues publicly opposed the package and he was forced to pull the vote last week. Because of his slim majority, Johnson can only afford to lose four GOP votes on any given piece of legislation — a margin that was far surpassed on the floor on Wednesday. However, the speaker was adamant to hold a vote, calling it crucial to tackle election integrity concerns ahead of the November contest. Johnson also framed it as a way to put Democrats on the record after nearly House Democrats voted against the SAVE Act when it passed the House earlier this year. “We’re going to give them another chance. We’re going to let them try to vote with us,” Johnson said ahead of the vote on Wednesday. But Democrats have slammed the proposal as “unserious and unacceptable,” accusing Republicans of holding the government hostage to advance their own agenda. “In order to avert a GOP-driven government shutdown that will hurt everyday Americans, Congress must pass a short-term continuing resolution that will permit us to complete the appropriations process during this calendar year and is free of partisan policy changes inspired by Trump’s Project 2025,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said in a statement earlier this month. “There is no other viable path forward that protects the health, safety and economic well-being of hardworking American taxpayers.” It’s not clear how congressional leaders will move forward with finalizing a spending deal, and lawmakers only have until midnight on Oct. 1 to pass some sort of agreement to avoid a shutdown. Making things more complicated, Johnson has refused to communicate any sort of backup plan. “No Plan B,” said Rep. Mario Diaz Balart (R-FL), a top appropriator in the House, after emerging from a closed-door meeting with the speaker on Tuesday. “The speaker has elected to call the play. He’s calling the play and I’m supporting his play there. He’s been very clear: There’s no Plan B. This is what he’s trying to get done.” That could place the power in the Senate’s hands, which could move forward with its own clean CR extending funding into mid-December. That could anger some hardline conservatives in the House, while other GOP lawmakers have acknowledged a short-term CR may be the only way to avoid a shutdown. “Plan B is always the only plan,” one House Republican told the Washington Examiner. But it also remains unclear whether Johnson will allow a shutdown to take effect if the SAVE Act isn’t attached to the final deal — something former President Donald Trump has pushed for. “President Trump and I have talked a lot about this. We talked a lot about it with our colleagues who are building consensus on the plan,” Johnson said. Trump reiterated his calls for a shutdown just hours before the vote, telling Republicans not to agree to a continuing resolution unless it has “every ounce of” the SAVE Act included. The former president urged lawmakers to ensure the election integrity bill is passed before November, claiming “Democrats are registering Illegal Voters by the TENS OF THOUSANDS as we speak.” “A Vote must happen BEFORE the Election, not AFTER the Election when it’s too late,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “BE SMART, REPUBLICANS, YOU’VE BEEN PUSHED AROUND LONG ENOUGH BY THE DEMOCRATS. DON’T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.” Congress has until the end of September to pass its annual budget before the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. If not, the government will enter a shutdown until some sort of spending deal has passed — a fate some House Republicans are looking to avoid ahead of the November elections, warning it could cost them their majority.","summary":"The House shot down a temporary spending deal that would extend government funding for the next six months, sending lawmakers back to square one with less than two weeks until a scheduled shutdown and lapse in federal funding.&#160; Lawmakers rejected House Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-LA) proposed continuing resolution that would extend current government spending levels [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3158556/house-rejects-plan-avert-government-shutdown/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mike-johnson-spending-deal-september-2024.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-18 22:48:35","author":"Cami Mondeaux","authors":["Cami Mondeaux"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":256738990,"title":"Majority of Americans support mass deportations, poll finds","text":"Majority of Americans support mass deportations, poll finds Former President Donald Trump has pledged to start mass deportations of undocumented immigrants if elected to another term, and a new Scripps News-Ipsos poll reveals that more than 54% of Americans support the move.
