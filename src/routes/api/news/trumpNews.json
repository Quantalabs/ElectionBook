As details have trickled out, a clearer picture of the would-be assassin has started to emerge. His background Crooks lived in Bethel Park, Pa., a midsize town of roughly 33,000 residents about 45 miles south of the Butler Farm Show grounds where the shooting took place. He worked in a local nursing home kitchen not far from his home, BBC reported. He graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022. Former classmates described him as a “relentlessly bullied” loner who loved playing video games and hunting. Ex-classmate Jason Kohler told KDKA that Crooks was so fond of the sport he would occasionally wear his hunting outfits to class. Another former classmate, Sarah D’Angelo, told The Wall Street Journal Sunday morning that Crooks had “few friends” and “didn’t have a full friend group,” saying she remembered him regularly playing video games on his laptop during homeroom period at school. Crooks did not appear in the 2022 Bethel Park High School Yearbook, though he can be seen in video accepting his diploma at his class’ graduation that year. TribLive reported Crooks was also the recipient of a $500 National Math and Science Initiative Star Award in his graduating year. Political affiliation A question of significant interest immediately following the assassination attempt was whether Crooks leaned Republican or Democratic in his political views. But the clues discovered so far paint a mixed picture. According to state voting records, Crooks was a registered Republican, though given his age he would have been too young to cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential election. However, Crooks made a $15 donation to the liberal ActBlue political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021 — the day of President Biden’s Inauguration Day, when he was 17 years old, The Intercept reported. When his body was found on the roof of a manufacturing plant over 130 yards away from Trump’s rally stage, he was found with an AR-style semi-automatic assault rifle and wearing a shirt for a popular gun-focused YouTube channel, Demolition Ranch, which has over 11 million subscribers. An ex-classmate who confirmed pictures of Crooks told The Post “He didn’t seem like, really weird or anything. I would have pegged him as a Republican.” Home life Police in Bethel Park were keeping both press and members of the public away from Crooks’ home, a modest brick ranch house on a leafy green, middle-class suburban street. His father, Matthew Crooks, reportedly said he is trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” as his son was identified as Trump’s attempted assassin. He wouldn’t provide details to reporters about his son, and wanted to “wait until I talk to law enforcement,” before speaking out on the horrific shooting, the elder Crooks told CNN on Saturday night. No information was immediately forthcoming about Crooks’ mother. A neighbor told The Post he saw an Allegheny County bomb squad preparing to enter the home shortly after 1 a.m. “I saw a post of his name and that he lived in Bethel Park, so I looked him up and he lives .3 miles away,” Dan Maloney, 30, said of the younger Crooks. “I went down there and spoke to the county bomb squad at 1:06 a.m. He said he was about to go into the house.I didn’t know the guy. No one in this neighborhood really talks to each other.” Asked about the shooting itself, Maloney said “It’s a tragedy. One person died, another is in the hospital. He went after a former president and likely the next president.”","summary":"Questions are swirling about Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman who tried to assassinate Donald Trump as he spoke onstage at a weekend campaign rally in Pennsylvania and was shot dead by Secret Service agents.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/us-news/what-we-know-about-thomas-matthew-crooks-gunman-who-tried-to-assassinate-trump-at-pa-rally/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85456778.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/au6ZXp9h-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:48:04","author":"Chris Nesi,Jack Morphet","authors":["Chris Nesi","Jack Morphet"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":251750542,"title":"Local officer encountered Trump rally gunman on roof moments before shooting but retreated: report","text":"A municipal police officer at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania encountered the shooter before the assassination attempt but retreated, according to The Washington Post.Butler County Sheriff Michael T.

The lakeside municipality in battleground Wisconsin finds itself in the eye of a political and security maelstrom following the spasm of violence that has shaken the 2024 campaign and prompted questions about the country's political polarization. Police were enforcing a buffer zone in the fenced-off blocks around Fiserv Forum, the sports arena where some 2,400 Republican delegates from around the country will gather, beginning Monday, to formalize Trump as the party's nominee for the third time since 2016. And President Joe Biden, Trump's election rival, said Sunday that following the shooting he has directed the Secret Service, the agency which protects US leaders, to \"review all security measures... for the Republican National Convention.\" Several residents told AFP Sunday that they or their neighbors were nervous and on heightened alert, and were calling for an easing of the political pressure cooker. \"Tensions are high on both sides, and I think we've got to tone down the rhetoric,\" said 60-year-old Trump supporter Martin Kutzler, who was walking in downtown Milwaukee wearing a T-shirt that depicts Trump as 1970s movie character The Godfather. \"Calling any American officeholder Hitler just throws gasoline on the rhetoric, and calling a current president Sleepy and Crooked is not advisable either,\" said Kutzler, who works for Amazon. He was referring to some of the ugly comparisons and nicknames that have been thrown around to describe Trump and Biden -- at times by the candidates themselves. Resident Becca, 25, was walking her dog with her mother along the Milwaukee River when she paused to ruminate over the \"kind of crazy\" preparations for the convention -- and the passions that are driving US voters. \"It is scary that people are this heated about an election,\" Becca, who declined to give her last name, told AFP, recalling the trauma from Saturday in Pennsylvania. \"And with everything going on, like we're a little nervous.\" she added. \"I hope that they don't take it and escalate it in certain ways.\" Lynn Quirk, who owns multiple college housing units in town, stood somberly watching the proceedings at a security checkpoint outside the convention arena. \"Everybody I talk to is just really super shocked,\" the 60-year-old Milwaukee native said. \"It's a crazy time.\" \"Talking with my neighbors yesterday, people are nervous,\" she added. \"Some people were going to come down here and look around. Now everybody's like, 'Yeah, no I don't need to come.'\" High metal fencing rings the perimeter area and police vessels patrol the river. An employee of a downtown food establishment conceded that merchants have been meeting and coordinating with the Secret Service. Security forces are believed to number in the thousands, including hundreds of police from states as far as California. \"Obviously, we're going to be more vigilant -- not that we weren't going to be vigilant before. But with yesterday's events, the security is going to be heightened obviously,\" said Captain Anthony Scott, one of 63 Indiana State Police officers joining the sprawling operation. But for some, like convention volunteer and self-described \"huge Republican\" Becky Hawkins, who grew up in Milwaukee, the crisis of the past 24 hours has bolstered their resolve. \"I feel pretty safe being here,\" said Hawkins, wearing a Milwaukee Brewers baseball shirt. As for the shooting? \"I'm not shocked, I'm just sad,\" she said. But \"it makes me want to be here even more.\" © 2024 AFP","summary":"Residents and volunteers were urging a lowering of tensions Sunday in Milwaukee as Republicans descend on the city for their national convention just a day after Donald Trump…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/pressure-cooker-milwaukee-braces-for-trump-convention","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/86/3c/d7c240a5eb3931c016616f59f3651197507f/863cd7c240a5eb3931c016616f59f3651197507f/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:34:52","author":"Japan Today Editor,Michael Mathes","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Michael Mathes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":251750958,"title":"Trump headed to Republican convention after surviving assassination attempt","text":"Donald Trump said he was headed on Sunday to Milwaukee where Republicans will formally nominate him for president later this week after he survived an assassination attempt that further inflamed an already bitter U.S. political divide. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said he had ordered a review of how a 20-year-old man carrying an AR-15-style rifle managed on Saturday to get close enough to shoot from a rooftop at Trump, who as a former president has lifetime protection by the U.S. Secret Service. Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania - one of the states expected to be most competitive in the Nov. 5 election - when shots rang out, hitting his right ear and streaking his face with blood. His campaign said he was doing well and appeared to have suffered no major injury besides a wound on his upper right ear. Trump is due to receive his party's formal nomination at the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Monday. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said on Fox News on Sunday that authorities are working together to safeguard the venue, where officials have spent months making security preparations. \"I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and The Republican National Convention, by two days, but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else. Therefore, I will be leaving for Milwaukee, as scheduled,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social site on Sunday. He said he would be leaving in the afternoon. The FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect in what it called an attempted assassination. He was a registered Republican, according to state voter records and had made a $15 donation to a Democratic political action committee at the age of 17. FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone. The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspect's social media accounts. Both Republicans and Democrats will be looking for evidence of Crooks' political affiliation as they seek to cast the rival party as representing extremism. \"There is no place in America for this kind of violence,\" Biden said at the White House. \"I urge everyone, everyone please don't make assumptions about his motive or affiliations.\" Trump and Biden are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including those by Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting whipsawed the discussion around the presidential campaign, which had recently focused on whether Biden, 81, should drop out following a disastrous June debate performance. The Biden campaign had been seeking to reset its message, depicting Trump as a danger to democracy for his continued false claims about election fraud but said on Saturday it was suspending its political advertising for now. Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect, the agency said, after he opened fire from the roof of a building about 150 yards (140 meters) from the stage where Trump was speaking. The gun - an AR-style 556 rifle - had been legally bought, the FBI officials said, adding that the FBI believed it had been purchased by the suspect's father. The officials said \"a suspicious device\" was found in the suspect's vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe. VICTIM WAS SHELTERING FAMILY Authorities identified a rally attendee who was shot and killed as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania, who Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told reporters was killed when he dove on top of his family to protect them from the hail of bullets. \"Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community,\" Shapiro said, adding, \"Political disagreements can never, ever be addressed through violence.\" Pennsylvania State Police on Sunday identified the two people wounded in the shooting, both of whom were listed in stable condition. They are 57-year-old David Dutch, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and 74-year-old James Copenhaver, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service in a statement denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected campaign requests for additional security. \"The assertion that a member of the former President’s security team requested additional security resources that the U.S. Secret Service or the Department of Homeland Security rebuffed is absolutely false,\" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. \"In fact, recently the U.S. Secret Service added protective resources and capabilities to the former President’s security detail.\" Residents of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, where the alleged shooter lived, expressed shock at the news on Sunday. \"It's a little crazy to think that somebody that did an assassination attempt is that close, but it just kind of shows the political dynamic that we're in right now with the craziness on each side,\" said Wes Morgan, 42, who added that he rides bikes with his children on the street where the alleged shooter lived. \"Bethel Park is a pretty blue-collar type of area. And to think that somebody was that close is a little insane.” While mass shootings at schools, nightclubs and other public places are a regular feature of American life, the attack was the first shooting of a U.S. president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan. In 2011, Democratic then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in an attack on a gathering of constituents in Arizona. Republican U.S. Representative Steve Scalise was also badly wounded in a politically motivated 2017 attack on a group of Republican representatives practicing for a charity baseball game. Giffords later founded a leading gun control organization, Scalise has remained a stalwart defender of gun rights. POLITICAL VIOLENCE Americans fear rising political violence, recent Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with two out of three respondents to a May survey saying they worried violence could follow the election. Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn his election defeat, fueled by his false claims that his loss was the result of widespread fraud. About 140 police officers were injured in the violence, four riot participants died that day, one police officer who responded died the following day and four responding officers later died by suicide. The shots appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said. Hours after the attack, the Oversight Committee in the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives summoned Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to testify at a hearing scheduled for July 22. Some of Trump's Republican allies said they believed the attack was politically motivated. \"It's one side that is going after Donald Trump in a way to demonize him personally,\" said Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican. \"The left seems to have targeted Donald Trump as a person.\" Trump began the year facing multiple legal worries, including four separate criminal prosecutions. He was found guilty in late May of trying to cover up hush money payments to a porn star. But the other three prosecutions he faces — including two for his attempts to overturn his defeat — have been ground to a halt by various factors, including a Supreme Court decision this month that found him to be partly immune to prosecution. Trump contends, without evidence, that all four prosecutions have been orchestrated by Biden to try to prevent him from returning to power. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Donald Trump said he was headed on Sunday to Milwaukee where Republicans will formally nominate him for president later this week after he survived an assassination attempt that…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-headed-to-republican-convention-after-surviving-assassination-attempt2","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/2b/3b/fcb22f411d82236f39faefa3440d6004ccb6/AP24196636361222/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:34:42","author":"Japan Today Editor,Nathan Layne","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Nathan Layne"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":251750744,"title":"State Police to increase presence in Mass. after Trump rally shooting","text":"Massachusetts State Police said it will immediately increase presence in “highly trafficked” areas of the Commonwealth after a shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. “There is no known connection or direct threat to Massachusetts at this time,” the agency said in a statement released Sunday.

Thomas Matthew Crooks, who lived with his parents in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park before he was shot dead by Secret Service snipers following his attempt on Trump’s life, “never outwardly spoke about his political views or how much he hated Trump or anything,” Sarah D’Angelo, who attended Bethel Park High School with Crooks, told The Wall Street Journal. She said Crooks had “a few friends,” but not “a whole friend group,” and recalled Crooks’ penchant for playing games on his laptop in homeroom. Two former classmates told The New York Times that they hadn’t noticed any obvious red flags that might have foretold future violence, with one telling the outlet he was stunned to hear authorities had named Crooks as the shooter. Crooks was “incredibly intelligent,” Zach Bradford, who was in American history and government classes with him, told the Times. His politics were “slightly right leaning,” according to Bradford. Bradford said some of Crooks’ fellow students gave him the occasional ribbing, and another said he “didn’t seem, like, really weird or anything.” “I would have pegged him as a Republican,” the classmate told the New York Post. Conversely, Jason Kolher, another Bethel Park HS graduate told KDKA that Crooks often wore hunting-style clothes to school and was bullied nonstop. Speaking to reporters Sunday on a telephone press briefing, FBI officials said they believe Crooks acted alone and that there was no indication that he was part of a larger conspiracy. The bureau, which said it is investigating the shooting as possible domestic terrorism, has not discovered any evidence that Crooks had mental health issues. He had never previously been under FBI investigation, and there are “currently no public safety concerns at present,” Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek, said. Investigators discovered a “rudimentary” explosive device in Crooks’ car, according to the FBI, and said it had been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, along with Crooks’ cellphone and the AR-15 assault-style rifle found next to his body after Secret Service snipers shot him dead. An unnamed federal law enforcement official told the Times that agents are seeking a warrant to search Crooks’ phone, which they hope will shed light on further clues, such as a possible motive. The official said a review of Crooks’ online activity has thus far not turned up anything unusual, and that Crooks liked to play online chess and was learning how to code. Investigators say they have not located any sort of manifesto left behind by Crooks, but that agents are digging into every possible aspect of the suspect’s online and real-world lives. A statement issued Sunday by Discord, a social media platform favored by gamers, said the company had homed in on a deleted account set up by Crooks, but that it had been “rarely utilized, has not been used in months, and we have found no evidence that it was used to plan this incident, promote violence or discuss his political views.” Crooks was a registered Republican, according to state registration records. City councilman Dan Grzybek, who represents the area where Crooks lived, said he met the family last year. Crooks’ father was a Libertarian, and his mother a Democrat, according to Grzybek, who told the Times this was “a fairly typical mix for the area.” In remarks on Sunday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said he has “directed the FBI, the ATF, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the [Justice] Department’s National Security Division to bring every available resource to bear on this investigation.” “I want to reiterate that the violence that we saw yesterday is an attack on our democracy itself,” Garland said. “The Justice Department has no tolerance for such violence. And as Americans, we must have no tolerance for it. This must stop.” While law enforcement continues to probe the situation, the Crooks family is also searching for their own answers.

Trump’s escape from death with courageous bravado comes as some Democratic heavyweights have called for President Biden, 81, to bow out of the presidential race because of mental and physical issues. “Functionally, the race is over,” Morris said on his WABC podcast. “[Trump] wins if he lives. … There’s nothing that can get into Trump’s path except a bullet. “As grizzly as it sounds, this assassination attempt didn’t succeed in killing Trump, but it probably succeeded in killing the Democratic Party’s chances this year,” Morris said. He said the top priority of Trump, 78, and his campaign team now is to take more precautions — such as speaking behind a protective shield — to protect the Republican nominee. The bounce for Trump and the Republicans during their nominating convention in Milwaukee this week could be 10 to 15 points in the polls, Morris predicted — a lead that would be all but impossible for the bickering Biden and Democrats to overcome. Voters are going to see the iconic image of a bloodied Trump with his fist in the air after getting shot in the ear, Morris said — likening it to the Marine Corps World War II Iwo Jima Memorial statue. “It was just amazing … This will go down in history,” Morris said of Trump’s actions immediately after the shooting. “It’s going to bolster him in the polling, obviously.

Secret Service snipers killed Crooks on Saturday after he fired multiple shots at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, from a nearby rooftop. As authorities seek to understand his motivations, here is what we know of the alleged gunman: 'Quiet' Crooks' former schoolmates described him as a \"quiet\" student who often came across as \"lonely,\" ABC News reported. But although he seemed \"socially reserved,\" a former schoolmate did not recall hearing him discuss politics or Trump, according to ABC. Trump, 78, was hit in the ear at the rally. A bystander was killed and two spectators critically injured in the worst act of US political violence in decades. Jason Kohler, who said he attended the same high school as Crooks, said the alleged shooter had often been bullied. \"He was quiet but he was just bullied. He was bullied so much,\" Kohler told reporters. He said Crooks had been made fun of for the way he dressed, noting that he would sometimes wear hunting outfits. No military ties Following the shooting, investigators found a \"suspicious device\" in Crooks' car, which was inspected by bomb technicians and is being analysed. They noted that explosive devices have been collected as evidence. Authorities are now in the process of searching Crooks' phone. Kevin Rojek, special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office, told reporters Sunday that the gun used in the shooting was an AR-style semiautomatic rifle which was purchased legally. Investigators believe the weapon used was purchased by Crooks' father, but it was unclear how he accessed the weapon. Rojek added that there were no indications so far of any mental health issues. Crooks also did not have military affiliations, according to Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder. The FBI told reporters that they are investigating the incident as an assassination attempt and also potential domestic terrorism act. Acted alone The shooter was believed to be working alone, according to the FBI, and officials said they have not identified an ideology associated with him. His political leanings were not instantly clear. News reports indicated he was a registered Republican, but also noted that he previously gave money to a Democratic-aligned progressive political action committee. While social media platform Discord said it had identified an account that appeared linked to the suspect, this was \"rarely utilized.\" A spokesperson added that \"we have found no evidence that it was used to plan this incident, promote violence, or discuss his political views.\" The suspect's father Matthew Crooks earlier told CNN that he was trying to establish \"what the hell is going on\" before speaking about his son.

Images showed the bloodied former president defiantly pumping his fist in the air after the shooting. Here is what we know so far: – What happened? Mr Trump was addressing a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. He was showing a chart of border crossing numbers when bangs started ringing out after 6.10pm local time. The former president could be seen grimacing and reaching with his right hand towards the side of his head, before blood appeared on his face. He quickly ducked as Secret Service agents rushed the stage to surround him. There were screams from audience members as the bangs continued. The crowd cheered as he got back up and pumped his fist before he was taken to his motorcade. Police evacuated the site shortly after Mr Trump left the stage. One rally attendee was killed and two other spectators were critically injured, authorities said. All were identified as men. The man who died has since been named as 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief. Pennsylvania governor Josh Sapiro said Mr Comperatore had died a “hero”, using his body as a shield to protect his wife and daughter from the bullets. The suspected gunman, who attacked from an “elevated position” outside the rally venue, was fatally shot. The FBI has taken over the investigation. – Is Mr Trump OK? Pictures showed blood on the former president’s right ear and part of his face. Writing on his Truth Social platform, Mr Trump said he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear”. Spokesman Steven Cheung said Mr Trump is “fine”, while the former president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, said his father “is in great spirits”. – What has Mr Trump said? Mr Trump took to his social media platform to thank the Secret Service and law enforcement. “Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured,” he added. “It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country.” Mr Trump said he knew “immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin”. He also said he will remain “resilient” and “defiant” in light of the attack, writing that “it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening”. “We will fear not, but instead remain resilient in our faith and defiant in the face of wickedness,” he continued. “Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand united, and show our true character as Americans, remaining strong and determined, and not allowing evil to win. “I truly love our country, and love you all, and look forward to speaking to our great nation this week from Wisconsin. DJT” – Where did Mr Trump go afterwards? He was checked out at a local medical facility before flying to New Jersey. The former president also confirmed he will travel to the Republican National Convention on Sunday as he originally planned, insisting people remain “defiant in the face of wickedness”. – Who is the suspected gunman? The FBI named 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the gunman. Officials added they believe he was acting alone. – What was his motivation? A motive has not yet been identified, but authorities are treating the shooting as an assassination attempt. – What has US President Joe Biden said? President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident and spoke to Mr Trump several hours after the shooting, the White House confirmed. He called the shooting “sick”, adding: “There’s no place in America for this type of violence.” In a later statement, he appealed for the country to “unite as one nation” and said he was ordering an independent security review of the lead-up to the attack. Mr Biden said: “An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation. Everything. It’s not who we are as a nation. It’s not America. And we cannot allow this to happen. “Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is more important than that right now.” – How have politicians in the UK reacted? Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: “I am appalled by the shocking scenes at President Trump’s rally, and we send him and his family our best wishes. “Political violence in any form has no place in our societies and my thoughts are with all the victims of this attack.” Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the Government “condemns all forms of political violence in the strongest terms”. Former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson said it is “a miracle that Donald Trump escaped an attempted assassination”. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, he added: “As we give thanks for his safety we are reminded once again of the tragic fragility of democracy in the face of violence and unreason. “Our thoughts are with the president and the Trump family.” Sadiq Khan said he was “shocked” at the news Donald Trump was shot at and that violence has “no place” in politics or society. The mayor told the PA news agency: “I was shocked when I heard about the attempt on President Trump’s life – he’s in my thoughts and prayers. “Unfortunately somebody lost their life – I’ve been thinking about them, people got injured. “There is no place for violence in politics or in mainstream society. “Donald Trump is standing to be the president, you may disagree with his policies but nobody should be turning that into violence – just thank God he’s survived. “We’re hoping the rest of the campaign is safe and the campaign doesn’t lead to any more violence.”","summary":"Images showed the bloodied former president defiantly pumping his fist in the air after shots were fired at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-jr-joe-biden-pennsylvania-keir-starmer-president-b1170586.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/07/14/09/13-ce278179f0644a6f8c25df8bafa1c7d9.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:22:50","author":"Ted Hennessey","authors":["Ted Hennessey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":251750984,"title":"After Trump shooting, the presidential race will change dramatically, and possibly violently","text":"In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign and raised fears of further political violence in the run-up to November's election. Trump's Republican allies painted him as a hero on Saturday, seizing on the image of him with his ear bloodied and fist raised, appearing to mouth the words \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" Whereas Trump has regularly used violent language with his followers, advisers and allies of the former president flipped the script on his Democratic opponent President Joe Biden, saying it was the demonization of the Republican presidential candidate that led to the assassination attempt. \"Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination,\" U.S. Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, a top candidate to be Trump's running mate, said on X. Biden moved quickly to try to defuse the situation, denouncing the attack as unacceptable political violence and pulling election ads attacking Trump. \"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick,\" Biden told reporters. The motivation of the shooter is not yet known. The suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was a registered Republican, according to state voter records. He previously made a $15 donation to a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians. In the short term, the attack will likely boost Trump's appearances in Milwaukee this week at the Republican National Convention as he accepts his party's presidential nomination, fortifying the sense of grievance and estrangement his supporters already feel toward the nation's political class. Within hours of the shooting, Trump's campaign sent out a text asking voters to contribute to the campaign. \"They're not after me, they're after you,\" the message read. Billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman also swiftly endorsed Trump. \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Musk said on X, the social media site he owns. Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump's campaign, said on X that \"for years and even today, leftist activists, Democrat donors and now even Joe Biden have made disgusting remarks and descriptions of shooting Donald Trump ... it's high time they be held accountable for it ... the best way is through the ballot box.\" LaCivita was apparently referring to recent remarks by Biden made in the context of asking his supporters to focus on beating Trump rather than his own performance. \"So, we're done talking about the debate, it's time to put Trump in a bullseye,\" said Biden, who has always condemned any political violence. POLITICAL ATTACKS The U.S. is grappling with the biggest and most sustained increase in political violence since the 1970s. Of 14 fatal political attacks since supporters of Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in which the perpetrator or suspect had a clear partisan leaning, 13 were right-wing assailants. One was on the left. Despite being a former president, Trump has campaigned as an outsider insurgent, complaining that he has long been targeted by the federal \"deep state\" and Biden's administration to prevent him from reclaiming power. He has typically employed violent, degrading and even apocalyptic rhetoric while doing so, warning of a \"bloodbath\" if he is not elected and saying immigrants in the United States illegally are \"poisoning the blood of our country\". Some Republicans were already agitated by his continued stoking of the fire. \"If the country wasn't a powder keg before, it is now,\" said Chip Felkel, a Republican operative in South Carolina who has opposed Trump. Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, said the shooting could benefit Trump politically because it feeds into his campaign narrative that the country is off-track. \"The attempted assassination creates sympathy for Trump,\" Bannon said. \"It also confirms the idea to voters that something is fundamentally wrong in this nation, which is an idea that drives support for him.\" Trump in May was found guilty of engaging in a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star, a conviction that did little to alter the race and suggested supporters of both sides remain entrenched in their positions. Biden has dealt with a debate within his own party over whether he should step down as the Democratic candidate because of concerns that he is no longer fit for the job. He says his doctors have told him he is in good shape. Trump has benefited in some polls from Biden's disastrous debate performance last month, but others show the race to be even. Many voters have already been alienated by both Biden and Trump. The chaos that surrounds the candidates may contribute to voters feeling that the nation's problems are unfixable and the gulf between the parties cannot be bridged. U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, a Republican who was shot by a gunman in 2017, told Fox News that violent election rhetoric needed to stop. \"All it takes is one person who is just unhinged to hear that and go out and act on it and think that's their signal to go take somebody out,\" he said. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign and raised fears of further political…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/analysis-after-trump-shooting-the-presidential-race-will-change-dramatically.-and-possibly-violently","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/ef/46/93b4407d07538417b6bd0071d503b4967854/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:22:04","author":"James Oliphant,Japan Today Editor","authors":["James Oliphant","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":251749796,"title":"Police Officer Found Trump Shooter on Roof Minutes Before Shooting: Report","text":"Before gunshots erupted at former President Donald Trump's campaign rally on Saturday, one police officer had confronted the now identified shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks on the roof of a nearby building, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to the Associated Press on Sunday.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was speaking at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening when he was shot on stage, with a bullet hitting the upper part of his right ear. The suspected gunman, now identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as 20-year-old Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was shot and killed by the Secret Service. A rally attendee, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore was also killed during the incident. Those injured, now identified as 57-year-old David Dutch of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are in stable condition.A spokesperson for Trump's campaign said on Saturday that the former president was \"fine\" and was \"being checked out at a local medical facility.\" Trump was released from the hospital later that night.The FBI has classified the shooting as an assassination attempt and is working as the lead agency on the investigation alongside the Secret Service and local law enforcement.Although Crooks' movements and motive leading up to the shooting are still under investigation, he was said to be positioned on top of a roof of a building nearby the rally with a rifle when he began shooting.According to the AP, who spoke to two law enforcement officials on condition of anonymity, rallygoers noticed a man climbing to the top of the roof of the nearby building and warned local law enforcement.This is when one local officer climbed to the roof and confronted Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder as Crooks quickly took a shot toward Trump who was speaking on stage and that's when the U.S. Secret Service counter-snipers shot him, the AP reported.Newsweek has reached out to the Pennsylvania State Police, the FBI, the Secret Service, and the Butler Police Department via email for comment.One rallygoer told the BBC that he noticed the shooter bear crawling on a building that was \"50-feet away from us.\" The rallygoer said he was trying to get the police and the Secret Services' attention before the shooting.\"We're standing there. We're pointing at the guy crawling up the roof...we could clearly see him with a rifle,\" he said.In response to the raised security questions, Pennsylvania State Police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens said at a late-night news conference on Saturday, which the Secret Service did not attend, \"It is incredibly difficult to have a venue open to the public, and to secure that against any possible threat, against a very determined attacker.\"While the investigation remains ongoing, Saturday's shooting has since sparked debate about the efficiency of the Secret Service and raised questions about the level of protection Trump and other presidential candidates receive. Some have even called for the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle in light of the incident as the Republican-led House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the shooting and asked Cheatle to testify on July 22.The shooting comes days before the Republican National Convention (RNC) kicks off in Milwaukee where Trump is poised to unveil his highly anticipated vice presidential pick, setting the stage for a rematch of the fiercely contested 2020 election against presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.The four-day convention is estimated to bring upward of 50,000 delegates, politicians, and official guests.In two Truth Social posts on Sunday, Trump confirmed he is still attending the convention, writing that while he initially planned to delay his arrival, he decided he \"cannot allow\" a potential assassin to force him to change his plans. He added that he'd be leaving for Milwaukee on Sunday afternoon as planned.Meanwhile, Biden announced that he directed the head of the Secret Service to \"review all security measures, all security measures, for the Republican National Convention.\"The president expressed gratitude to the agents who risked their lives for the protection of Trump in yesterday's shooting and expressed his condolences to Comperatore's family. Biden also emphasized that Trump \"already receives a heightened level of security,\" because he's a former president and the presumed Republican nominee.\"I've been consistent in my direction of the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability, and protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety,\" Biden said.","summary":"A officer climbed to the roof and confronted Thomas Matthew Crooks before Trump was shot on stage during a rally, according to the Associated Press on Sunday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/police-officer-found-trump-shooter-thomas-matthew-crooks-roof-minutes-before-shooting-report-1925027","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2427964/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:21:34","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":251750244,"title":"Biden campaign swaps Trump criticism for unity after shooting","text":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign quickly upended its strategy after an assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania, calling off verbal attacks on the former president to focus instead on a message of unity. Within hours of Saturday’s shooting, Biden’s campaign was pulling down television ads and suspending other political communications, including those that had highlighted Trump’s May felony conviction in New York state court relating to hush money paid to a porn star to avert a sex scandal before the 2016 U.S. election. “We must unite as one nation,” Biden said in White House remarks on Sunday, adding he would have an Oval Office address in the evening. Biden condemned political violence again, as he did on Saturday night, and asked Americans to “let the FBI do their job.” Rather than verbally attacking Trump in the coming days, the White House and the Biden campaign will draw on the president’s history of condemning all sorts of political violence including his sharp criticism of the “disorder” created by campus protests over the Israel-Gaza conflict, campaign officials said on condition of anonymity. Some Republicans have blamed Biden, without evidence, for inspiring the shooting by criticizing Trump. The 20-year-old shooter was a registered Republican whose motive is unknown. Biden’s advisers had hoped to tamp down recent calls from some of his fellow Democrats and others that he step aside and let another candidate represent the party in the Nov. 5 election, sharpening his focus on the dangers he has said Trump presents to U.S. democratic norms and reproductive rights as well as Trump’s false statements about winning the 2020 election. “This changes everything,” one campaign official said of the assassination attempt. “We’re still assessing. Making the case against Trump, drawing that split screen, will get much harder.” “The president is trying to lower the temperature,” the official added. CALLS TO STEP ASIDE The Biden campaign officials said they expect that the assassination attempt will lower the pressure from congressional Democrats for Biden, 81, to step aside in the race amid concerns about his fitness for office. Some Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate have publicly called upon Biden to drop out in the aftermath of his shaky performance in a June debate against Trump. “It’s over,” one White House source told Reuters about the attempt to push Biden out of the 2024 race. That may be overly optimistic, other Democratic sources said. The current wave of calls is over but is expected to resume once Biden inevitably stumbles again, they said. Biden’s planned trip on Monday to the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas – where he was expected to speak on the landmark Civil Rights Act that Johnson signed into law in the 1960s and criticize Trump’s attacks on immigrants and American diversity – has been postponed, the White House said. Biden’s plan to deliver a keynote speech at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) convention in Las Vegas on Tuesday on his administration’s commitment to racial justice and equity for all Americans is unchanged. Because the shooting happened in the election battleground state of Pennsylvania, which Biden won over Trump in 2020 by a narrow margin, the incident could be especially impactful, according to some political strategists, by increasing Republican turnout by voters sympathetic to Trump. “This doesn’t guarantee that Trump flips Pennsylvania,” Republican pollster Frank Luntz wrote on social media. “But the long and winding road for Joe Biden just became even longer and windier. Just as what happened to George Floyd had a lasting impact on tens of millions of Americans, the shooting of Donald Trump will be significantly consequential in a way the shooter never intended.” Floyd is the Black man who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020, a murder that prompted protests in many U.S. cities and abroad. Other Democratic candidates running this year are also rethinking their plans to focus on the dangers they have said Trump poses if elected. “The real question is whether in two weeks we can go back and declare Trump a threat to the country. That was our playbook, and it’s fair, but unclear how much of our spurs were taken off,” said a Democrat involved in a Senate campaign, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump, 78, is due to receive his party’s official nomination for president during the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee beginning on Monday.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden&#8217;s reelection campaign quickly upended its strategy after an assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania, calling off verbal attacks on the former president to focus instead on a message of unity.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/14/breaking-news/biden-campaign-swaps-trump-criticism-for-unity-after-shooting/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-14T155853Z_1704621333_RC2HK8AIG19O_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:21:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":251750844,"title":"Golden calls to drop ‘hyperbolic threats’ about democracy after Trump assassination attempt","text":"Democratic Rep. Jared Golden (MN) on Sunday called on the nation to cease making “hyperbolic threats” about the stakes of the 2024 election year one day after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Golden expressed deep concern about the current state of American political culture and its implications for the nation’s future after an attempted assassination on Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. He said the 2024 election between Trump and President Joe Biden should never be portrayed as a “no-holds-barred struggle between democracy or authoritarianism, or a battle against fascists or socialists intent on destroying America as we know it,” adding “these are dangerous lies.” “The result is an overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety about the future of our country, where the normal and tested tools of democracy no longer seem adequate to protect the common good. Inthis light, a rise of politically motivated violence in America is sadly unsurprising,” Golden added. Golden’s remarks are not the first time he has called on the nation to cool the temperature of political rhetoric. On July 2, he blasted Democratic colleagues’ “hand-wringing” following last month’s disastrous debate for Biden that has led numerous lawmakers to question whether the 81-year-old president has the mental fortitude to take on Trump in the Nov. 5 election. “I refuse to participate in a campaign to scare voters with the idea that Trump will end our democratic system,” Golden said earlier this month. Since the debate, Biden himself has taken to social media to label Trump as a “threat to our democracy,” according to a June 28 post on X, formerly known as Twitter. On July 5, Biden posted that Trump “could become the dictator that he promised to be on day one,” referencing Trump’s previous remarks where he quipped he wouldn’t be a dictator “other than day one.” On Saturday, hours after a gunman fired shots at the crowd in Butler and killed one attendee while also grazing Trump’s ear with a bullet, Biden briefly addressed the nation and said he was “grateful to hear” that Trump is “safe and doing well” and condemned political violence. “There is no place in America for this kind of violence,” Biden said Saturday. “It’s sick. It’s sick.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Biden addressed the nation for a second time on Sunday afternoon, where he announced he had ordered an independent investigation into the attempted shooting and the security measures surrounding the event.

Angus King, and Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree.","summary":"Democratic Rep.

Retired volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore was sitting behind the former president at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania yesterday when he was shot and killed by Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20. It’s believed bullets, fired from a rooftop 130 yards away, had been meant for Trump, who was left with an injury to the upper part of his right ear. Two other people were critically injured, before Crooks was shot dead by a secret service sniper. Members of the crowd tried to save Mr Comperatore’s life, but he died at the scene. His family said he had lost his life trying to shield his wife and daughter from the gunfire. In an emotional tribute, his daughter Allyson wrote on social media: ‘He died a real-life super hero.’ One of Mr Comperatore’s daughters said her father was a real-life super hero (Picture: Facebook) ‘They are not going to tell you how quickly he threw my mom and I to the ground. They are not going to tell you that he shielded my body from the bullet that came at us. ‘He loved his family. He truly loved us enough to take a bullet for us.’ Mr Comperatore’s sister, meanwhile, wrote on Facebook: ‘The PA Trump Rally claimed the life of my brother, Corey Comperatore. ‘The hatred for one man took the life of the one man we loved the most. He was a hero who shielded his daughters.’ ‘His wife and girls just lived through the unthinkable and unimaginable. My baby brother just turned 50 and had so much life left to experience.’ Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said Mr Comperatore, who had served at the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, was a self-proclaimed ‘girl dad’ and firefighter who died a hero. Mr Comperatore loved his family, Governor Josh Shapiro said (Picture: Facebook) ‘Corey went to church every Sunday for a loved his community,’ the governor said today. ‘And most especially Corey loves his family. Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community. ‘I asked Corey’s wife, if it would be okay for me to share that we spoke. She said yes. She also asked that I share with all of you that Corey died a hero.’ ‘This is a moment where all leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity,’ he continued. ‘For all leaders, we need to take down the temperature and rise above the hateful rhetoric that exists in search for a better brighter future for this nation.’ Randy Reamer, president of the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, called Mr Comperatore ‘a stand-up guy’ and ‘a true brother of the fire service’. He said he had been a life member, meaning he’d served for more than 20 years, and was chief of the company for about three years. The shooting started shortly after Republican presidential candidate Trump took to the stage at around 6pm.

Crooks, who graduated from high school in 2022, was a registered Republican. His home in Bethel Park has been searched by police today, with scores of officers and members of the press pictured outside. After the shooting, Trump posted on his Truth Social account, thanking the secret service and law enforcement for their rapid response. He added: ‘I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured ‘It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country.

The RNC is a political convention held every four years for party delegates to select their nominees for president and vice president. This year, the GOP has 2,429 delegates representing states and territories nationwide and they will vote for the nominees. A nominee for president needs to win 1,215 delegates. The RNC is poised to present more than just Trump as the GOP nominee – though that will be the culmination of the four-day event. In addition, the party will finalize its platform and heavyweights and celebrities will fire up the base, with more than 50,000 in attendance. Like the GOP, the Democratic Party will hold its own four-day national convention, but not until next month. Former United States President Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White at the UFC 290 event (Picture: Getty Images) When and where is it being held? The RNC will unfold from July 15 to 18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is a crucial battleground state that Trump won in 2016 but lost narrowly to President Joe Biden in 2020. While the main venue will be the Fiserv Forum, there will also be events at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center.

Each day of the RNC will have its own theme centered around Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. Monday’s theme is Make America Wealthy Again, Tuesday’s is Make America Safe Again, Wednesday’s is Make America Strong Again and Thursday’s is Make America Great Once Again. The theme for the welcoming party on Sunday was Red, White and Brew, as Milwaukee is the city that made beer famous. Breweries and pubs across the city are being used as meeting places for the RNC. More than 50,000 Republicans are set to attend the convention (Picture: Getty Images) When will Donald Trump accept the nomination? The main event of the RNV is when delegates vote on the party nominee. Trump is expected to formally accept the Republican Party’s nomination on the last day of the convention, on Thursday. The nominee traditionally gives an acceptance speech. Who could be his VP pick? Trump is reportedly set to reveal his vice presidential running mate, who will likely be there and address members of the party. Trump’s pick for vice president has generated much speculation. The shortlist reportedly includes North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Ohio Senator JD Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Trump’s pick is expected to also address the convention.

Secret Service snipers killed Crooks on Saturday after he fired multiple shots at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, from a nearby rooftop. As authorities seek to understand his motivations, here is what we know of the alleged gunman: 'Quiet' Crooks' former schoolmates described him as a \"quiet\" student who often came across as \"lonely,\" ABC News reported. But although he seemed \"socially reserved,\" a former schoolmate did not recall hearing him discuss politics or Trump, according to ABC. Trump, 78, was hit in the ear at the rally. A bystander was killed and two spectators critically injured in the worst act of US political violence in decades. Jason Kohler, who said he attended the same high school as Crooks, said the alleged shooter had often been bullied. \"He was quiet but he was just bullied. He was bullied so much,\" Kohler told reporters. He said Crooks had been made fun of for the way he dressed, noting that he would sometimes wear hunting outfits. No military ties Following the shooting, investigators found a \"suspicious device\" in Crooks' car, which was inspected by bomb technicians and is being analysed. They noted that explosive devices have been collected as evidence. Authorities are now in the process of searching Crooks' phone. Kevin Rojek, special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office, told reporters Sunday that the gun used in the shooting was an AR-style semiautomatic rifle which was purchased legally. Investigators believe the weapon used was purchased by Crooks' father, but it was unclear how he accessed the weapon. Rojek added that there were no indications so far of any mental health issues. Crooks also did not have military affiliations, according to Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder. The FBI told reporters that they are investigating the incident as an assassination attempt and also potential domestic terrorism act. Acted alone The shooter was believed to be working alone, according to the FBI, and officials said they have not identified an ideology associated with him. His political leanings were not instantly clear. News reports indicated he was a registered Republican, but also noted that he previously gave money to a Democratic-aligned progressive political action committee. While social media platform Discord said it had identified an account that appeared linked to the suspect, this was \"rarely utilized.\" A spokesperson added that \"we have found no evidence that it was used to plan this incident, promote violence, or discuss his political views.\" The suspect's father Matthew Crooks earlier told CNN that he was trying to establish \"what the hell is going on\" before speaking about his son.

Trump was shot in the ear during a rally in Pennsylvania, in an attack now being investigated as an assassination attempt. The attacker was shot dead and law enforcement officials said they had not yet identified a motive. “We do not believe that the attempt to eliminate and assassinate Trump was organised by the current authorities,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “But the atmosphere around candidate Trump … provoked what America is confronting today.” U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying there was no place for that kind of violence in America. Peskov said Russia condemned any violence in the course of the political struggle. His comments echoed those of some of Trump’s Republican allies, who immediately pinned the blame on Biden. “After numerous attempts to remove candidate Trump from the political arena – using first legal tools, the courts, prosecutors, attempts to politically discredit and compromise the candidate – it was obvious to all outside observers that his life was in danger,” Peskov said. He added that there were no plans for Putin to call Trump in light of the incident. World leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, rapidly condemned Saturday’s attack, expressing shock, denouncing political violence and wishing Trump a quick recovery. Russia’s foreign ministry used the shooting to urge Washington to stop funding Ukraine’s military and concentrate on improving domestic law enforcement instead. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, writing on Telegram, responded to remarks made by independent presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr following the shooting. “Dear Bobby and all those who vote in the United States to supply Zelenskiy with arms,” Zakharova said. “Wouldn’t it be better for this money to finance the American police and other services that are supposed to ensure law and order within the United States?” Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has brought Russia’s ties with the West to their lowest ebb since the height of the Cold War. Asked whether the Trump attack could affect the legitimacy of the United States’ upcoming election, Peskov said: “It is not for us to judge. We have not the slightest desire to interfere.

It would be his final heroic act, but firefighters in rural Butler County who knew Comperatore say they’re not surprised by the father’s selfless actions. “His two girls and his wife was everything,,” Kip Johnston, fire chief and 43-year veteran of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company, told the Post. “…Couldn’t ask for a better [firefighter].” Comperatore served as chief of the volunteer company for a couple years in the early 2000s before cutting back his role to focus on his family. He remained an active firefighter and member of his community until his tragic death at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds. “He was one of them guys you wanted to go into a fire with, cause you knew you were coming back out,” said fire company president Randy Reamer, a 15-year veteran. “Sh-t hit the fan, and you were coming back out with him.” Johnston and Reamer said Comperatore was always vocal about his conservative political views, but never antagonized those who did not agree. “You knew his [political] stance,” Reamer said. “If you accepted it, that’s fine. If you didn’t, that’s fine. He didn’t care.” Asked by The Post to name his “favorite Corey story,” Johnston quipped: “Can’t put that on record!” The chief said they shared many good times together. “Great leader, great family man, good friend,” Johnston said of Comperatore. The chief’s wife, Lee Johnston, was a teacher at nearby Buffalo Elementary School — which Comperatore’s two daughters attended during her employment. While she did not have the Comperatore girls in class, she spoke fondly of the entire family. “We’ve had a very close relationship, not only at the fire company, but outside of the fire company as well,” Mrs. Johnston said. “Their whole family is just very sweet people.” On Sunday, the American flag outside the firehouse was lowered to half-staff in Comperatore’s honor. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who also described Comperatore as a local hero, ordered flags in the state to be flown half staff in his honor.","summary":"Members of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company remember Corey Comperatore, the man shot at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania, as a hero who protected his family.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/us-news/firefighters-remember-corey-comperatore-chief-killed-at-pennsylvania-trump-rally/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-7un96a3qz-1720986280390.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1720971915&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mm9qjx5L-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:14:49","author":"Carson Swick","authors":["Carson Swick"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.104},{"id":251749662,"title":"Frat that went viral holding up American flag during Palestine protests to be RNC speakers","text":"Fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina who held up an American flag during a Gaza solidarity demonstration in the spring will speak at the RNC, according to Donald Trump’s campaign. “A group of students and fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill patriotically protected an American flag that had been disturbed by demonstrators during an anti-Israel protest on their campus,” the Trump campaign said on July 12. “The students gained national attention as videos of the protest showed them standing strong to protect the American flag, even as protestors antagonized them,” according the campaign continued. The campaign did not name specific fraternities or their members. The fraternity members are among a group of “everyday Americans” who were given a speaking role at the convention, which starts Monday in Milwaukee. The four-day RNC gathering will include two dozen “everyday American” speakers. The campaign said the RNC “will provide a platform and voice for the workers, veterans, and families left behind in Joe Biden’s America.” The fraternity brothers made national headlines on April 30 for holding up the American flag on a flagpole after protesters tried to remove it. Demonstrators had already taken down the flag once and successfully replaced it with a Palestinian flag, photos and videos of the event reveal. Chants of “USA!” then overwhelmed the crowd. The interim chancellor announced that the American flag “will stand here as long as I’m chancellor.” Police arrested more than 30 protesters at UNC-Chapel Hill that day. The school was one of dozens of colleges across the country that held student-led demonstrations over the ongoing war in the Middle East.","summary":"The unnamed fraternity members are among two dozen other ‘everyday American’ speakers who are slated to speak at the convention","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rnc-speakers-unc-frat-palestine-flag-b2579684.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/13/20/Screenshot-2024-07-13-at-3.16.49%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:14:40","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.069},{"id":251749694,"title":"RNC, Trump must go on with convention, just as Thatcher did when she narrowly escaped assassination attempt","text":"Sunday morning on NBC, former Biden White House Communications Director Jen Psaki, now a host on MSNBC, made an extraordinary and inflammatory demand. Looking ahead to the GOP Convention in Milwaukee that begins on Monday, she claimed that \"Unless the programming changes, the rhetoric and how the programming is set up is not actually calming the tone, or restoring civility.\" She then issued a veiled threat: \"We’ll see if that programming changes but if it stays the same, that is escalating it. It is not a civil approach to a convention.\" STEVE SCALISE: THE LEFT'S 'HYPER-CHARGED,' VIOLENT RHETORIC 'NEEDS TO STOP' First of all, what is she even talking about? The \"programming\" that Psaki seems to think is so unacceptably lacking in civility consists of four themes: ‘Make America Wealthy Again’, ‘Make America Safe Once Again’, ‘Make America Strong Once Again’, and on the final day, ‘Make America Great Once Again.’ How on earth is any of that \"escalating\" the situation she was commenting on -- the attempted assassination of President Trump? It is a preposterous thing for Psaki to have said. How does she know what \"the rhetoric\" will be? Is Psaki secretly writing the remarks of the Republican speakers? Let’s assume no bad faith on her part. But let’s also be clear what her ludicrous statements unintentionally reveal: the belief among partisan Democrats that any challenge to their political power is by definition beyond the bounds of reasonable opinion. WHAT DID HARD LEFT EXPECT, AFTER YEARS OF HATEFUL ANTI-TRUMP RHETORIC? In fact, contrary to what Jen Psaki demands, the correct--and moral-- response to the shocking scenes on Saturday would be for the GOP Convention to go ahead exactly as planned. And an eerie echo from history tells us why. On October 12th, 1984, a terror organization, the Irish Republican Army, tried to assassinate British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It happened during the Conservative Party convention (called the Party Conference) being held that year in Brighton, England. The terrorists planted a bomb in the Grand Hotel where Mrs. Thatcher, along with top Conservative Party officials, was staying. The bomb ripped through the hotel, killing five and injuring more than thirty. It obliterated the bathroom in Margaret Thatcher’s suite. She had been in that room just two minutes before the bomb went off. She had been working on her speech to the conference, took a bathroom break and then returned to her desk. Two minutes different, and she would have been killed, at the height of her powers and before her triumphant re-election for a third term in 1987. It was a miraculous escape. But that’s not the only parallel between Brighton 1984 and Butler 2024. TALE OF TWO CONVENTIONS: GOP UNITED BEHIND TRUMP WHILE DEMS IN DISARRAY Soon after the attack, with many of her closest colleagues still buried in the rubble of the destroyed hotel, Margaret Thatcher appeared on camera to insist that the conference would go ahead exactly as planned. She even insisted that a local store be opened an hour early so that conference attendees could make sure they had fresh clothes. Later that morning, just a few hours after the assassination attempt that so nearly took her life, the prime minister addressed the conference in the resolute style that was her hallmark: The attack \"was an attempt not only to disrupt and terminate our conference; it was an attempt to cripple Her Majesty’s democratically elected Government. That is the scale of the outrage in which we have all shared, and the fact that we are gathered here now, shocked but composed and determined, is a sign not only that this attack has failed, but that all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.\" The ‘Brighton Bomb’, as it became known, happened 40 years ago. But I remember it as if it was last week. Perhaps that’s because Brighton is my hometown. It’s a seaside resort on the south coast of England, where party conventions were held regularly. That year, I remember hearing the news of the bomb when I woke up. I remember walking down to the seafront, before school, seeing the destruction for myself. It felt utterly apocalyptic. I was 15-years-old and the scene made a huge impression. But the other thing that made such a huge impression was Mrs. Thatcher’s courage and leadership. Years later, I had the great honor of meeting her on a number of occasions when I worked for the Conservative Party. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION All this came to mind as I watched President Trump’s extraordinary reaction to the attempt to take his life on Saturday. Of course, Donald Trump and Margaret Thatcher are completely different in many ways. But as I have said before, including on my Fox News Channel show, \"The Next Revolution,\" Trump resembles Thatcher -- as well as President Reagan (also, of course, the victim of a dramatic assassination attempt) -- in one crucial way. These are leaders who truly changed the course of their country -- and history. They are giants among political pygmies. As we saw President Trump rise up to rally his supporters moments after being hit by an assassin’s bullet, in an image that will be one of the most iconic in American history, we can see why. And as we prepare for the GOP Convention in Milwaukee, and the election campaign ahead, let’s take our lead not from Jen Psaki but from Margaret Thatcher. She insisted that things must go forward exactly as planned. That is the best response to anyone, anywhere, who tries to disrupt our lives with terror and violence.

The about-face comes after the Biden campaign compared the former president to Adolf Hitler, and President Biden himself was quoted as saying it was “time to put Trump in a bullseye” with regards to the campaign messaging. Speaking to reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Del. on Sunday, President Biden said “there is no place in America for this kind of violence,” saying of shooting that nearly killed his opponent, “it’s sick. It’s sick.” The White House said Biden spoke to Trump Saturday evening, the president living up to his kinder, gentler messaging pledge that same day in a message of well-wishing for his opponent. “I’m grateful to hear that he’s safe and doing well. I’m praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information,” Biden wrote on X. “Jill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety,” Biden said reiterating that America has “no place” for the kind of horrendous violence witnessed in Butler, Pa. “We must unite as one nation to condemn it,” he said. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was “horrified” by what unfolded at the rally, where a bloodied Trump shook off his security detail to defiantly wave his fist at the crowd yelling “fight, fight, fight” before being whisked to safety. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed gratitude for the Secret Service for protecting the 2024 GOP standard bearer, while offering his “thoughts and prayers” for the former president. “Political violence of any kind is never acceptable,” he added. Soon after the shocking shooting, authorities identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, who was shot and killed by Secret Service agents seconds after he squeezed off 6-7 rounds, winging former President Trump’s ear and fatally striking Corey Comperatore, a local hero volunteer fire chief. In the aftermath of the shooting, Democrats have faced a surge criticism from Republican lawmakers over the steady ratcheting up their anti-Trump rhetoric.","summary":"The about-face comes after the Biden campaign compared the former president to Adolf Hitler, and President Biden himself was quoted as saying it was \"time to put Trump in a bullseye\" with regards to the campaign messaging.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/us-news/trump-shooting-prompts-democrats-to-dial-back-campaign-trail-attacks/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85459967.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VboBF0r8-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:13:40","author":"Chris Nesi","authors":["Chris Nesi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":251749740,"title":"Biden orders to take measures to ensure Trump’s safety","text":"NEW YORK, July 14. /TASS/.

The assassination attempt on Trump was staged at his campaign rally in Pennsylvania late on Saturday. The Republican was wounded. According to recent reports, he is safe, he received a minor injury - the bullet pierced his right ear. The shooting left one person killed and two injured.

Later in the post, former President Trump expressed love for the families of the other shooting victims, including a firefighter who died and two others who were injured. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,” he wrote in his post. Rep. Carlos Antonio Gimenez (R-Fla.) agreed with the sentiment, telling Fox News that the former president wasn’t gravely wounded or killed by “the grace of God,” while Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) said “divine intervention” and God’s “protective hand” foiled the assassination attempt. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote that it was God who “protected President Trump yesterday,” while he also told NBC News that he hopes politicians can tone down the political rhetoric following the assassination attempt. “Yesterday there were miracles, and I think the hand of God was there too,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told Fox News on Sunday, noting that he himself was shot and wounded during a congressional baseball team event in 2017. “You can just see one centimeter over and we’re having a very different conversation,” he wrote. Video of the incident shows the former president speaking at the rally and then turning his head slightly before he was struck in the right ear. Some Republicans, including Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, noted that the slight turning of his head may have saved his life and suggested divine intervention is at play. The shooting suspect has been identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks from the village of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about an hour from the rally, the FBI said Sunday. No motive has been revealed. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Sunday identified the slain victim as 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, who “dove on” his wife and daughters as the gunman opened fire at the rally. “These victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,” Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Colonel Christopher Paris said in a statement. “The Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.” Saturday’s incident marks the first assassination shooting attempt on a current or former president in several decades, the last time occurring in 1981 when then-President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in Washington, D.C., by a lone gunman. The incident likely will roil the current 2024 presidential race, while many top Democrats, including President Joe Biden, condemned the violence.","summary":"'God protected President Trump,' wrote vice presidential candidate Sen.

The twice-impeached convicted felon breezed through the GOP primary races, beating out competitors and amassing far greater than the required number of delegates he needed to secure the nomination. Now, from July 15 to 18, Republican lawmakers, delegates and other party figures will descend on the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to officially crown Trump the nominee and see the former president declare his chosen running mate. Here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming convention – such a hot ticket in Republican circles than even Melania Trump might turn up. The RNC has not yet released a detailed schedule of speakers but the convention has historically provided a moment for leading party figures and up-and-coming Republican lawmakers to get valuable airtime discussing some of the party’s biggest talking points. RNC co-chair Lara Trump has also promised a number of surprise celebrity guest speakers this time around. Among the famous faces expected to speak is model Amber Rose, former girlfriend of troubled rapper and one-time Trump ally Kanye West. Donald Trump Jr will address the crowd on Wednesday, just before vice presidential contender JD Vance – a piece of scheduling regarded as good news for the latter’s veep prospects. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will also be speaking (although it was originally reported that he would not), along with former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who initially said she was not invited to take the stage. Both went up against Trump for the party nomination, before bowing out of the race when they failed to secure primary wins. Sean O’Brien, leader of the powerful Teamsters union, will also take to the stage. He has reportedly also approached the Democratic Party about speaking at the DNC in August too. The GOP will reportedly make beer a key theme of its convention in tribute to the host city famous for its breweries. A “Red, White and Brew” party will be held at Henry Maier Festival Park on Sunday before the convention gets underway to welcome delegates, politicians, volunteers and members of the media. Republicans have meanwhile also announced daily themes for the convention tied to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Monday will be dedicated to events under the banner “Make America Wealthy Once Again,” Tuesday’s theme is “Make America Safe Again,” Wednesday’s is “Make America Strong Again” and Thursday’s is “Make America Great Once Again.” The agenda will include formal policy sessions, meetings of the individual state delegations and events sponsored by organizations promoting various conservative causes, from Moms for Liberty and the American Jewish Committee to the Heritage Foundation, whose controversial Project 2025 proposal has sparked uproar in recent weeks. There will also be film screenings, including the biopic Reagan starring Dennis Quaid,Theocracy of Terror: Murder, Oppression and the Rise of Iran’s Political Regime and Trump’s Rescue Mission: Saving America. An official watch party will be held each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub on 320 West Highland Avenue, across the street from the main venue, an arena normally home to the Milwaukee Bucks. Donald Trump will formally accept the nomination to be the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nominee on the final day of the convention: Thursday, July 18. He will then deliver a speech to the crowd of attendees, bringing the convention to a conclusion amid a deluge of patriotic red, white and blue balloons. To date, it is not clear when Trump will announce his running mate at the event. However, he is expected to announce it on July 15 and he and his deputy are expected to be together for a “Strength in Unity” event on Wednesday and a “Freedom First” event on Thursday so it will have to happen before then.","summary":"From July 15 to 18, Republican lawmakers, delegates and other party figures will descend on the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to officially crown Trump the nominee and see him announce his running mate","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rnc-schedule-2024-trump-b2579680.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/05/21/PROYECTO_2025_24844.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QEUf5to0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:11:57","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.344},{"id":251750814,"title":"FBI vows to crack the whip on Trump assassination bid","text":"US investigating agencies are scrambling for concrete answers on whether the suspect who attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump acted alone, what motivated the act of political violence, and how he obtained a semi-automatic rifle and materials for explosive devices.

Police were working on Sunday to learn more about Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, to determine what motivated him to open fire on the rally from a nearby rooftop, killing one spectator, before he was shot dead by the Secret Service. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Sunday it has not yet identified any threatening writing or social media posts from Crooks, who graduated from high school two years ago and had no past criminal cases against him, according to public court records. The FBI believes he acted alone. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said on social media the upper part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting. Two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. The man killed was Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area who Pennsylvania’s governor says died a “hero” by diving onto his family to protect them. Relatives of Crooks did not immediately respond to messages from Associated Press. His father, Matthew Crooks, told CNN late on Saturday that he was trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” but would not speak about his son until after he talked to police. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022. In a video of the school’s graduation ceremony posted online, Crooks can be seen crossing the stage to receive his diploma, appearing slight of build and wearing glasses. The school district said it will cooperate fully with investigators. In his senior year, Crooks was among several pupils given an award for maths and science, according to a Tribune-Review story at the time. Jason Kohler, who said he attended the same school but did not share any classes with Crooks, said Crooks was bullied at school and sat alone at lunch time. Other pupils mocked him for the way he dressed, such as hunting outfits, Kohler said. “He was bullied almost every day,” Kohler told reporters. “He was just an outcast, and you know how kids are nowadays.” Crooks worked at a nursing home as a dietary aid, a job that generally involves food preparation. Marcie Grimm, the administrator of Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation, said in a statement she was “shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement”. Grimm added that Crooks had a clean background check when he was hired. Crooks’ political leanings were not immediately clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave US$15 to a progressive political action committee on January 20, 2021, the day US President Joe Biden was sworn into office. Butler County district attorney Richard Goldinger told Associated Press on Sunday that Crooks had been previously unknown to investigators in his county and had not been on their radar. He said the investigation had so far not turned up any evidence that he had coordinated with anyone else in the region. A blockade had been set up on Sunday preventing traffic near Crooks’ house, which is in an enclave of modest brick houses in the hills outside blue-collar Pittsburgh and about an hour’s drive from the site of the Trump rally. Police cars were stationed at an intersection near the house and officers were seen walking through the neighbourhood. Bomb-making materials were found inside Crooks’ car near the Trump rally and at his home, according to two officials who were not authorised to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. A white Allegheny County Police truck identified as bomb squad pulled up to the home late on Sunday morning. Police recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene of the shooting, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. Investigators believe the weapon was bought by the father at least six months ago, two police officials said. One local police officer climbed to the roof and encountered Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder, and Crooks quickly took a shot towards Trump, and that is when Secret Service snipers shot him, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. A video posted to social media and geolocated by Associated Press shows Crooks wearing a grey T-shirt with a black American flag on the right arm lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds where Trump’s rally was held. The roof where Crooks lay was less than 150 metres from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 metres is a distance at which US Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M-16 rifle. Images of Crooks’ body reviewed by Associated Press show he appears to have been wearing a T-shirt from Demolition Ranch, a popular YouTube channel with more than 11.6 million subscribers that regularly posts videos that show creator Matt Carriker firing off handguns and assault rifles at targets that include human mannequins and vehicles. Carriker, who lives in Texas, did not respond to a phone message or email on Sunday, but posted a photo of Crooks’ bloody corpse wearing his brand’s T-shirt on social media with the comment “What the hell”.","summary":"Registered Republican Thomas Matthew Crooks, who worked at a nursing home, described as a loner who had been bullied at school.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3270429/what-we-know-about-20-year-old-man-who-tried-assassinate-donald-trump","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/15/23f55dc9-2b78-44e4-9027-3de1da6635e7_f7ebd3aa.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/12/WEB_Biden%20Trump%20new_v2.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:03:56","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":251749682,"title":"Secret Service in Crisis: Used Local Cops at Trump Rally","text":"It’s been the question on everyone’s mind since Donald Trump narrowly escaped death in an assassination attempt Saturday night: How, exactly, was a 20-year-old rifleman able to perch himself on a rooftop just 150 yards away from the former president during a rally? It turns out, the Secret Service’s over reliance on Pennsylvania cops may be partially to blame, with a report from The Washington Post revealing Sunday the agency punted the responsibility of surveying and securing some nearby structures to local officers. Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Secret Service, conceded that the agency relied on local law enforcement to fill in “significant parts of its typical array of specialized protective units,” the Post reported. Guglielmi said Trump’s security detail called on at least six members of Butler County’s tactical units for these jobs. That included the counter sniper teams that spotted and killed the shooter, Thomas Crooks, just moments after he fired a semiautomatic in Trump’s direction. Citing sources, the Associated Press reported that it was also a local officer who spotted Crooks on the roof before he opened fire, but that cop was unable to engage him because he was clinging to a ledge and trying to pull himself up. The report said the officer couldn’t draw his weapon and ultimately let go of the ledge after Crooks pointed his rifle at him. It’s not abnormal for the Secret Service to rely on local cops for additional security at events, but, with the agency now under a magnifying glass, many lawmakers—from both parties—are questioning whether the Secret Service should have had more of its own agents on the ground. Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) was among the lawmakers demanding answers from the Secret Service and calling for heads to roll inside the agency. The Secret Service was placed under official review on Sunday, and its director, Kimberly Cheatle, may soon find herself testifying on Capitol Hill to account for one of the worst disasters in her agency’s 159-year history. To put in perspective just how egregious it was that Crooks made it within 150 yards, or about 450 feet, from Trump—that’s roughly the distance U.S. Army recruits must hit a human-sized silhouette from in order to qualify for the M16 assault rifle in basic training. That suggests that even the newest of U.S. infantrymen likely could have landed the shot—especially considering the rifle used by Crooks is a semiautomatic civilian version of the the military M16. Kevin Rojek, the FBI Special Agent in Charge, said at the scene of the shooting that it was “surprising” the gunman was able to ever get a shot off at Trump—especially from so close. The Secret Service has not said how many agents it had at the Trump rally, but its staffing struggles have been well documented in recent years. Jason Chaffetz, who was chair of the House Oversight Committee in 2015 when it penned an investigative report on Secret Service security failures, has long called for the Secret Service to hire more agents. On Sunday, he said the Trump rally a “catastrophic failure” in security. He told the Post that his 2015 report called for significant changes to the Secret Service—specifically, beefing up its personnel count—that were never implemented. That inaction may have nearly cost Trump his life. “We did all these investigations and did an extensive report so this would never happen again,” he told the Post. “It’s as if they paid no attention to the bipartisan recommendations.”","summary":"Anna MoneymakerIt’s been the question on everyone’s mind since Donald Trump narrowly escaped death in an assassination attempt Saturday night: How, exactly, was a 20-year-old rifleman able to perch himself on a rooftop just 150 yards away from the former president during a rally?\n\nIt turns out, the Secret Service’s over reliance on Pennsylvania cops may be partially to blame, with a report from The Washington Post revealing Sunday the agency punted the responsibility of surveying and securing some nearby structures to local officers.\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Secret Service, conceded that the agency relied on local law enforcement to fill in “significant parts of its typical array of specialized protective units,” the Post reported.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-secret-services-reliance-on-local-cops-lead-to-trump-shooting","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_14/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1720986445/GettyImages-2161925705_bgluxy","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:00:40","author":"Josh Fiallo","authors":["Josh Fiallo"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":251748746,"title":"Australia news LIVE: PM calls for cooling of divisive debate post Trump shooting; Push for probe into CFMEU’s alleged criminal links","text":"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called on Australians to lower the temperature of public debate over divisive issues such as the war in Gaza as he expressed his horror at the attempt on the life of former US president Donald Trump.

Here’s what to look out for","text":"Donald Trump and the MAGA-fied Republican Party will take over the city of Milwaukee in Wisconsin this week as the GOP nominating convention takes place over four days. At the top of every delegate’s mind this week? Saturday’s surreal scene at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a gunman was killed by the Secret Service after attempting to assassinate the former president in a shooting that left one spectator dead and two others seriously injured. An already momentous event will now be underscored by a new layer of security, as the country reels from one of the most shocking outbursts of political violence in decades. Trump, having lost just one state in the months-long primary slog against Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and other opponents, is guaranteed to be his party’s nominee when it’s all said and done. The former president will then embark upon his third bid for the White House, now under the cloud of 34 felony convictions (with three other criminal prosecutions on the way). This week’s Republican National Convention will be informative not only for any drama that plays out on the convention floor, but also for what it says about the kind of general election campaign Trump will run over the 109 days between his acceptance of the nomination and the November election. Trump’s attempted assassination is likely to be a major topic of speakers and much talked about among attendees, which will include state and county-level Republicans from around the country. Here’s what to look out for. The main story on day one: Who will be Donald Trump’s running mate for the general election? Sources inside Trumpworld have told journalists for weeks that the contest is down to three men: Marco Rubio, JD Vance, and Doug Burgum. The latter, a governor from North Dakota who dropped out early on from the 2024 GOP primary, is thought to be losing favor while the two senators Vance and Rubio are still duking it out for Trump’s rose. The four-day convention will also be a glimpse into the kind of administration Trump hopes to lead come January 2025. His opponent, Joe Biden, is facing an unprecedented rebellion within his own party after a shocking debate performance at the end of June during which Biden stumbled over his words and repeatedly lost his train of thought, unable to effectively rebut Trump’s lies. Polling shows the incumbent president trailing in every swing state he won against Donald Trump in 2020. Thanks to current realities in the House and Senate, a Trump victory in November would likely be accompanied by respective Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Saturday’s shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, is sure to shake up the presidential race and have a profound effect on politics in America during an already divided time. The gunman, a 20-year-old whose motivations have not been identified, and his actions have already spawned a host of conspiracy theories as Republicans try to point fingers at Democrats for the violence. Even as Trump and other prominent Republicans stay away from the more outlandish conspiracies being spread in the wake of the shooting, one can expect misinformation and speculation to play a major role this week. That much was evident in the response from JD Vance, one of the finalists who may be announced at Trump’s running mate, on Saturday. “Today is not just some isolated incident,” Vance posted on Twitter. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Expect efforts by Republicans to shmooze voters in battleground states — particularly Wisconsin, which is hosting the RNC and is one of the swing states won by Biden in 2020 in his victory over Trump that year. The incumbent president won the state by just one percentage point last time around, and last Thursday, Biden’s campaign identified the state in a memo released to reporters as crucial once more to his path to victory this year. Trump, meanwhile, insulted Milwaukee as a “horrible” city at a campaign rally earlier this year — but one can assume that he and others will take a stab at smoothing things over during the convention. Trump has clearly noticed his sudden advantage, and held his fire for several days after his meetup with Biden in Atlanta. That pause quickly ended, however, with the former president asserting at a rally that Biden’s convicted-felon son Hunter was running the show at the White House. The president’s adult son has indeed been reportedly managing his father’s communication with friends and outside advisers and has sat in on meetings at the White House, according to multiple officials. With his opponent in apparent freefall, Trump has turned his attention to the RNC itself and tried to shield himself from the inevitable counter-punching from the Biden campaign and its allies. On Truth Social, the former president distanced himself from Project 2025, a blueprint for radically slimming down and transforming the federal government to fit a far-right conservative vision. Numerous figures in and around Trumpworld including Trump’s ex-aide John McEntee are connected to the project, which was crafted by a host of conservative groups led by the Heritage Foundation, a convention sponsor of the RNC. Just how much attention Project 2025 and its supporters receive at the convention will be a sign of how much Trumpworld plans to be alligned with the far-right agenda. The actions and rhetoric of anti-abortion groups will be particularly illuminating this coming week. There’s an argument playing out in the media over whether the Trump/RNC 2024 campaign platform takes a direct stance on a national abortion ban. The platform draft does not contain any language about support for passing legislation in Congress to ban or restrict the practice nationwide, but its inclusion of language supporting the fetal personhood argument — which posits that unborn fetuses have rights of due process under the Constitution — has led many Democrats to argue that the GOP is indicating its support instead for a total ban on abortion through the court system. Anti-abortion crusaders have been split over the party platform, with groups like Students for Life Action and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America applauding what remains in the platform. Others, like Mike Pence, have condemned it as not extreme enough on abortion. With Trump ascendant in the polls and his opponent facing unprecedented issues vexing his campaign, the relevance of the RNC will take on new weight as voters of all political stripes tune in to see what very well could be in store for American governance for the next four years.","summary":"Four-day convention will feature surprise celebrity speakers and a MAGA lovefest while Biden’s campaign experiences freefall","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rnc-what-to-know-b2578337.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/11/17/GettyImages-2161406050.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:51:53","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.298},{"id":251749926,"title":"Nikki Haley will attend RNC after Trump shooting","text":"July 14 (UPI) -- Nikki Haley, the last Republican to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, will now attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this week in the aftermath of the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. Haley, who was considered a moderate during her campaign, dropped her election bid earlier this year, stating at the time that she wasn't sure if she would support Trump as she seemingly reluctantly surrendered to his dominance over the GOP. When Haley released her 97 delegates and encouraged them to support Trump at the convention, a spokesperson revealed that the former ambassador was not invited. After Trump was shot at his rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend, sources who spoke to NPR confirmed she will now speak at the RNC. Others who reported the news include the Wall Street Journal and its sister publications: the New York Post and Fox News. \"This should horrify every freedom-loving American,\" Haley said on social media after the assassination attempt. \"Violence against presidential candidates must never be normalized.

A former fire chief attending the rally with family was killed, as was the gunman. Two other people were critically wounded. An AP analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos from the scene of the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. Here’s what’s known so far about the timeline of the shooting. 6:02 p.m. ET Trump takes the stage to the strains of “God Bless the U.S.A.” He waves at the cheering crowd and begins his regular rally speech, with spectators both in front of him and behind him on risers. Around 6:10 p.m. — After rally-goers notice a man climbing on the top of the roof of a nearby building, a local law enforcement officer climbs to the roof, according to two law enforcement officials. — A man identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks points his rifle at the officer, who retreats down the ladder, the officials said. — Crooks then quickly fires, according to the officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. — Trump is showing off border-crossing numbers when gunfire begins. — As the first pop rings out, Trump says, Oh,” and raises his hand to his right ear and looks at it, before quickly crouching to the ground behind his lectern. — Secret Service agents rush to the stage and pile atop the former president to shield him. — Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former fire chief attending the rally, is shot and killed. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Sunday that Comperatore used his body as a shield to protect his wife and daughter. — Secret Service counter snipers fire back and shoot Crooks. About 1 minute after the shots — Video shows Trump getting to his feet and reaching with his right hand toward his face, which was smeared with blood. — As Trump stands up, he pumps to the crowd with his right fist. — He appears to mouth the word “fight” twice to his crowd of supporters, prompting loud cheers and then chants of “USA. USA. USA.” About 2 minutes after the shots Trump turns back to the crowd and again raises a fist right before agents put him into a vehicle and he is taken to a local hospital. 6:50 p.m. Secret Service says “the former President is safe.” 8:42 p.m. Trump posts on his social media site that he was injured in the upper part of his right ear. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he said. About 12:10 a.m. Trump’s private jet lands at Newark Liberty International Airport. Video posted by an aide showed the former president deplaning, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents and heavily armed members of the agency’s counter assault team. It was an unusually visible show of force by his protective detail. Trump travels to his private golf club in nearby Bedminster, New Jersey, to spend the night. ___ Stengle contributed to this report from Dallas.

Tim Burchett (R-TN) has asked his fellow lawmakers to skip the 2024 Republican National Convention, stressing the need to focus on investigating former President Donald Trump’s assassination attempt. Trump was wounded in the ear when he was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, two days before the Republican Party’s convention on Monday. Burchett, however, wants his co-workers to not spend any time at his convention, as he wants to get to the bottom of what happened on Saturday and the failures of what allowed the attempted assassination to happen. “We need to get to Washington, to hell with the convention,” Burchett said. “We’ve got to find out what went on, make sure that it never happens again.” The Tennessee lawmaker added that “somebody really dropped the ball” when it was revealed that the shooter had been on a rooftop, questioning how the shooter was able to get to such a position. He also accused Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of being “a DEI initiative person” and contended that Trump almost getting assassinated was the result of hiring “the best players.” Burchett added that “God had his hand” on Trump when he was almost shot, and said he hoped the former president realized this. He added that anyone suggesting this attempted assassination was staged to raise support for Trump are “idiots.” The 2024 Republican National Convention will see multiple Republican lawmakers as speakers of the event, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (LA), Reps. Byron Donalds (FL), Elise Stefanik (NY), Matt Gaetz (FL), and Anna Paulina Luna (FL). Govs. Ron DeSantis (FL), Greg Abbott (TX), Doug Burgum (ND), Sarah Huckabee Sanders (AR), and Glenn Youngkin (VA) are also set to speak.

Members of Trump’s family speaking at the event include his two sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, the co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. Trump wrote on Sunday that he was initially going to delay his speech at the convention for two days, but decided against this because “I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling.”","summary":"Rep.

Both of their conditions have been upgraded from critical to stable, according to the Pennsylvania State Police.Newsweek emailed the Pennsylvania State Police for additional comments Sunday.The alleged gunman has been identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper at the scene. The incident is being investigated as an assassination attempt on Trump, who sustained a wound to his right ear in the shooting.Notably, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has spoken about the victim who died, providing a personal insight into the life lost. Shapiro revealed that the individual killed in the attack was Corey Comperatore of Sarver, Pennsylvania, a 50-year-old volunteer firefighter. Shapiro, who spoke with victim's family, shared that he died heroically while shielding his daughters from the gunfire.\"Corey died a hero. Corey dove on his family to protect them last night at this rally,\" Shapiro said. \"Corey was the very best of us.\" The governor described the victim as an avid supporter of the former president, emphasizing his dedication to his community and family. Comperatore previously served as the chief of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Department and is survived by a wife and two children.Jason Bubb, a gym owner who lives near Butler, Pennsylvania, launched a GoFundMe for Comperatore's daughter, Allyson. By early Sunday afternoon, it had raised over $420,000 out of a $7,000 goal.Also, in response to this tragedy, a GoFundMe page has been set up to support the other victims and their families. Initiated by Meredith O'Rourke, Trump's adviser and the national finance director of his 2024 presidential campaign, the fundraiser has already surpassed $2 million, shattering the fundraiser's goal of reaching $1 million.Trump addressed the situation on his Truth Social platform later Saturday night, expressing gratitude toward the United States Secret Service and law enforcement for their rapid response. He also extended his condolences to the victims' families.This incident occurs just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is set to be confirmed as the party's presidential nominee. The attack has raised serious questions about security measures at political rallies and the potential for violence in an increasingly polarized political climate.As the investigation continues, many aspects of the shooting remain unclear. The motive of the gunman, how he managed to bypass security measures, and whether there were any warning signs are all questions that investigators will be grappling with in the coming weeks.","summary":"On Sunday, law enforcement released the names of the two men who were injured during Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/surviving-trump-rally-victims-everything-we-know-pennsylvania-1925000","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2427948/butler-pennsylvania-crowd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:47:26","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.014}]}
