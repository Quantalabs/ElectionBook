The lakeside municipality in battleground Wisconsin finds itself in the eye of a political and security maelstrom following the spasm of violence that has shaken the 2024 campaign and prompted questions about the country's political polarization. Police were enforcing a buffer zone in the fenced-off blocks around Fiserv Forum, the sports arena where some 2,400 Republican delegates from around the country will gather, beginning Monday, to formalize Trump as the party's nominee for the third time since 2016. And President Joe Biden, Trump's election rival, said Sunday that following the shooting he has directed the Secret Service, the agency which protects US leaders, to \"review all security measures... for the Republican National Convention.\" Several residents told AFP Sunday that they or their neighbors were nervous and on heightened alert, and were calling for an easing of the political pressure cooker. \"Tensions are high on both sides, and I think we've got to tone down the rhetoric,\" said 60-year-old Trump supporter Martin Kutzler, who was walking in downtown Milwaukee wearing a T-shirt that depicts Trump as 1970s movie character The Godfather. \"Calling any American officeholder Hitler just throws gasoline on the rhetoric, and calling a current president Sleepy and Crooked is not advisable either,\" said Kutzler, who works for Amazon. He was referring to some of the ugly comparisons and nicknames that have been thrown around to describe Trump and Biden -- at times by the candidates themselves. Resident Becca, 25, was walking her dog with her mother along the Milwaukee River when she paused to ruminate over the \"kind of crazy\" preparations for the convention -- and the passions that are driving US voters. \"It is scary that people are this heated about an election,\" Becca, who declined to give her last name, told AFP, recalling the trauma from Saturday in Pennsylvania. \"And with everything going on, like we're a little nervous.\" she added. \"I hope that they don't take it and escalate it in certain ways.\" Lynn Quirk, who owns multiple college housing units in town, stood somberly watching the proceedings at a security checkpoint outside the convention arena. \"Everybody I talk to is just really super shocked,\" the 60-year-old Milwaukee native said. \"It's a crazy time.\" \"Talking with my neighbors yesterday, people are nervous,\" she added. \"Some people were going to come down here and look around. Now everybody's like, 'Yeah, no I don't need to come.'\" High metal fencing rings the perimeter area and police vessels patrol the river. An employee of a downtown food establishment conceded that merchants have been meeting and coordinating with the Secret Service. Security forces are believed to number in the thousands, including hundreds of police from states as far as California. \"Obviously, we're going to be more vigilant -- not that we weren't going to be vigilant before. But with yesterday's events, the security is going to be heightened obviously,\" said Captain Anthony Scott, one of 63 Indiana State Police officers joining the sprawling operation. But for some, like convention volunteer and self-described \"huge Republican\" Becky Hawkins, who grew up in Milwaukee, the crisis of the past 24 hours has bolstered their resolve. \"I feel pretty safe being here,\" said Hawkins, wearing a Milwaukee Brewers baseball shirt. As for the shooting? \"I'm not shocked, I'm just sad,\" she said. But \"it makes me want to be here even more.\" © 2024 AFP","summary":"Residents and volunteers were urging a lowering of tensions Sunday in Milwaukee as Republicans descend on the city for their national convention just a day after Donald Trump…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/pressure-cooker-milwaukee-braces-for-trump-convention","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/86/3c/d7c240a5eb3931c016616f59f3651197507f/863cd7c240a5eb3931c016616f59f3651197507f/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:34:52","author":"Japan Today Editor,Michael Mathes","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Michael Mathes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":251750958,"title":"Trump headed to Republican convention after surviving assassination attempt","text":"Donald Trump said he was headed on Sunday to Milwaukee where Republicans will formally nominate him for president later this week after he survived an assassination attempt that further inflamed an already bitter U.S. political divide. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said he had ordered a review of how a 20-year-old man carrying an AR-15-style rifle managed on Saturday to get close enough to shoot from a rooftop at Trump, who as a former president has lifetime protection by the U.S. Secret Service. Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania - one of the states expected to be most competitive in the Nov. 5 election - when shots rang out, hitting his right ear and streaking his face with blood. His campaign said he was doing well and appeared to have suffered no major injury besides a wound on his upper right ear. Trump is due to receive his party's formal nomination at the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Monday. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said on Fox News on Sunday that authorities are working together to safeguard the venue, where officials have spent months making security preparations. \"I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and The Republican National Convention, by two days, but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else. Therefore, I will be leaving for Milwaukee, as scheduled,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social site on Sunday. He said he would be leaving in the afternoon. The FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect in what it called an attempted assassination. He was a registered Republican, according to state voter records and had made a $15 donation to a Democratic political action committee at the age of 17. FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone. The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspect's social media accounts. Both Republicans and Democrats will be looking for evidence of Crooks' political affiliation as they seek to cast the rival party as representing extremism. \"There is no place in America for this kind of violence,\" Biden said at the White House. \"I urge everyone, everyone please don't make assumptions about his motive or affiliations.\" Trump and Biden are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including those by Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting whipsawed the discussion around the presidential campaign, which had recently focused on whether Biden, 81, should drop out following a disastrous June debate performance. The Biden campaign had been seeking to reset its message, depicting Trump as a danger to democracy for his continued false claims about election fraud but said on Saturday it was suspending its political advertising for now. Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect, the agency said, after he opened fire from the roof of a building about 150 yards (140 meters) from the stage where Trump was speaking. The gun - an AR-style 556 rifle - had been legally bought, the FBI officials said, adding that the FBI believed it had been purchased by the suspect's father. The officials said \"a suspicious device\" was found in the suspect's vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe. VICTIM WAS SHELTERING FAMILY Authorities identified a rally attendee who was shot and killed as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania, who Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told reporters was killed when he dove on top of his family to protect them from the hail of bullets. \"Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community,\" Shapiro said, adding, \"Political disagreements can never, ever be addressed through violence.\" Pennsylvania State Police on Sunday identified the two people wounded in the shooting, both of whom were listed in stable condition. They are 57-year-old David Dutch, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and 74-year-old James Copenhaver, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service in a statement denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected campaign requests for additional security. \"The assertion that a member of the former President’s security team requested additional security resources that the U.S. Secret Service or the Department of Homeland Security rebuffed is absolutely false,\" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. \"In fact, recently the U.S. Secret Service added protective resources and capabilities to the former President’s security detail.\" Residents of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, where the alleged shooter lived, expressed shock at the news on Sunday. \"It's a little crazy to think that somebody that did an assassination attempt is that close, but it just kind of shows the political dynamic that we're in right now with the craziness on each side,\" said Wes Morgan, 42, who added that he rides bikes with his children on the street where the alleged shooter lived. \"Bethel Park is a pretty blue-collar type of area. And to think that somebody was that close is a little insane.” While mass shootings at schools, nightclubs and other public places are a regular feature of American life, the attack was the first shooting of a U.S. president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan. In 2011, Democratic then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in an attack on a gathering of constituents in Arizona. Republican U.S. Representative Steve Scalise was also badly wounded in a politically motivated 2017 attack on a group of Republican representatives practicing for a charity baseball game. Giffords later founded a leading gun control organization, Scalise has remained a stalwart defender of gun rights. POLITICAL VIOLENCE Americans fear rising political violence, recent Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with two out of three respondents to a May survey saying they worried violence could follow the election. Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn his election defeat, fueled by his false claims that his loss was the result of widespread fraud. About 140 police officers were injured in the violence, four riot participants died that day, one police officer who responded died the following day and four responding officers later died by suicide. The shots appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said. Hours after the attack, the Oversight Committee in the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives summoned Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to testify at a hearing scheduled for July 22. Some of Trump's Republican allies said they believed the attack was politically motivated. \"It's one side that is going after Donald Trump in a way to demonize him personally,\" said Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican. \"The left seems to have targeted Donald Trump as a person.\" Trump began the year facing multiple legal worries, including four separate criminal prosecutions. He was found guilty in late May of trying to cover up hush money payments to a porn star. But the other three prosecutions he faces — including two for his attempts to overturn his defeat — have been ground to a halt by various factors, including a Supreme Court decision this month that found him to be partly immune to prosecution. Trump contends, without evidence, that all four prosecutions have been orchestrated by Biden to try to prevent him from returning to power. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Donald Trump said he was headed on Sunday to Milwaukee where Republicans will formally nominate him for president later this week after he survived an assassination attempt that…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-headed-to-republican-convention-after-surviving-assassination-attempt2","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/2b/3b/fcb22f411d82236f39faefa3440d6004ccb6/AP24196636361222/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:34:42","author":"Japan Today Editor,Nathan Layne","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Nathan Layne"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":251750540,"title":"50% of Americans believe political violence is a 'very big problem' in the US after Trump rally shooting","text":"One thing is clear after shots were fired at former President Donald Trump during his Saturday rally in Pennsylvania: Americans are freaked out.In a YouGov poll taken after the shooting, 50% of adults said that political violence is \"a very big problem\" in the US.

Images showed the bloodied former president defiantly pumping his fist in the air after the shooting. Here is what we know so far: – What happened? Mr Trump was addressing a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. He was showing a chart of border crossing numbers when bangs started ringing out after 6.10pm local time. The former president could be seen grimacing and reaching with his right hand towards the side of his head, before blood appeared on his face. He quickly ducked as Secret Service agents rushed the stage to surround him. There were screams from audience members as the bangs continued. The crowd cheered as he got back up and pumped his fist before he was taken to his motorcade. Police evacuated the site shortly after Mr Trump left the stage. One rally attendee was killed and two other spectators were critically injured, authorities said. All were identified as men. The man who died has since been named as 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief. Pennsylvania governor Josh Sapiro said Mr Comperatore had died a “hero”, using his body as a shield to protect his wife and daughter from the bullets. The suspected gunman, who attacked from an “elevated position” outside the rally venue, was fatally shot. The FBI has taken over the investigation. – Is Mr Trump OK? Pictures showed blood on the former president’s right ear and part of his face. Writing on his Truth Social platform, Mr Trump said he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear”. Spokesman Steven Cheung said Mr Trump is “fine”, while the former president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, said his father “is in great spirits”. – What has Mr Trump said? Mr Trump took to his social media platform to thank the Secret Service and law enforcement. “Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured,” he added. “It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country.” Mr Trump said he knew “immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin”. He also said he will remain “resilient” and “defiant” in light of the attack, writing that “it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening”. “We will fear not, but instead remain resilient in our faith and defiant in the face of wickedness,” he continued. “Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand united, and show our true character as Americans, remaining strong and determined, and not allowing evil to win. “I truly love our country, and love you all, and look forward to speaking to our great nation this week from Wisconsin. DJT” – Where did Mr Trump go afterwards? He was checked out at a local medical facility before flying to New Jersey. The former president also confirmed he will travel to the Republican National Convention on Sunday as he originally planned, insisting people remain “defiant in the face of wickedness”. – Who is the suspected gunman? The FBI named 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the gunman. Officials added they believe he was acting alone. – What was his motivation? A motive has not yet been identified, but authorities are treating the shooting as an assassination attempt. – What has US President Joe Biden said? President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident and spoke to Mr Trump several hours after the shooting, the White House confirmed. He called the shooting “sick”, adding: “There’s no place in America for this type of violence.” In a later statement, he appealed for the country to “unite as one nation” and said he was ordering an independent security review of the lead-up to the attack. Mr Biden said: “An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation. Everything. It’s not who we are as a nation. It’s not America. And we cannot allow this to happen. “Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is more important than that right now.” – How have politicians in the UK reacted? Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: “I am appalled by the shocking scenes at President Trump’s rally, and we send him and his family our best wishes. “Political violence in any form has no place in our societies and my thoughts are with all the victims of this attack.” Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the Government “condemns all forms of political violence in the strongest terms”. Former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson said it is “a miracle that Donald Trump escaped an attempted assassination”. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, he added: “As we give thanks for his safety we are reminded once again of the tragic fragility of democracy in the face of violence and unreason. “Our thoughts are with the president and the Trump family.” Sadiq Khan said he was “shocked” at the news Donald Trump was shot at and that violence has “no place” in politics or society. The mayor told the PA news agency: “I was shocked when I heard about the attempt on President Trump’s life – he’s in my thoughts and prayers. “Unfortunately somebody lost their life – I’ve been thinking about them, people got injured. “There is no place for violence in politics or in mainstream society. “Donald Trump is standing to be the president, you may disagree with his policies but nobody should be turning that into violence – just thank God he’s survived. “We’re hoping the rest of the campaign is safe and the campaign doesn’t lead to any more violence.”","summary":"Images showed the bloodied former president defiantly pumping his fist in the air after shots were fired at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-jr-joe-biden-pennsylvania-keir-starmer-president-b1170586.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/07/14/09/13-ce278179f0644a6f8c25df8bafa1c7d9.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:22:50","author":"Ted Hennessey","authors":["Ted Hennessey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":251750984,"title":"After Trump shooting, the presidential race will change dramatically, and possibly violently","text":"In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign and raised fears of further political violence in the run-up to November's election. Trump's Republican allies painted him as a hero on Saturday, seizing on the image of him with his ear bloodied and fist raised, appearing to mouth the words \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" Whereas Trump has regularly used violent language with his followers, advisers and allies of the former president flipped the script on his Democratic opponent President Joe Biden, saying it was the demonization of the Republican presidential candidate that led to the assassination attempt. \"Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination,\" U.S. Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, a top candidate to be Trump's running mate, said on X. Biden moved quickly to try to defuse the situation, denouncing the attack as unacceptable political violence and pulling election ads attacking Trump. \"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick,\" Biden told reporters. The motivation of the shooter is not yet known. The suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was a registered Republican, according to state voter records. He previously made a $15 donation to a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians. In the short term, the attack will likely boost Trump's appearances in Milwaukee this week at the Republican National Convention as he accepts his party's presidential nomination, fortifying the sense of grievance and estrangement his supporters already feel toward the nation's political class. Within hours of the shooting, Trump's campaign sent out a text asking voters to contribute to the campaign. \"They're not after me, they're after you,\" the message read. Billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman also swiftly endorsed Trump. \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Musk said on X, the social media site he owns. Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump's campaign, said on X that \"for years and even today, leftist activists, Democrat donors and now even Joe Biden have made disgusting remarks and descriptions of shooting Donald Trump ... it's high time they be held accountable for it ... the best way is through the ballot box.\" LaCivita was apparently referring to recent remarks by Biden made in the context of asking his supporters to focus on beating Trump rather than his own performance. \"So, we're done talking about the debate, it's time to put Trump in a bullseye,\" said Biden, who has always condemned any political violence. POLITICAL ATTACKS The U.S. is grappling with the biggest and most sustained increase in political violence since the 1970s. Of 14 fatal political attacks since supporters of Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in which the perpetrator or suspect had a clear partisan leaning, 13 were right-wing assailants. One was on the left. Despite being a former president, Trump has campaigned as an outsider insurgent, complaining that he has long been targeted by the federal \"deep state\" and Biden's administration to prevent him from reclaiming power. He has typically employed violent, degrading and even apocalyptic rhetoric while doing so, warning of a \"bloodbath\" if he is not elected and saying immigrants in the United States illegally are \"poisoning the blood of our country\". Some Republicans were already agitated by his continued stoking of the fire. \"If the country wasn't a powder keg before, it is now,\" said Chip Felkel, a Republican operative in South Carolina who has opposed Trump. Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, said the shooting could benefit Trump politically because it feeds into his campaign narrative that the country is off-track. \"The attempted assassination creates sympathy for Trump,\" Bannon said. \"It also confirms the idea to voters that something is fundamentally wrong in this nation, which is an idea that drives support for him.\" Trump in May was found guilty of engaging in a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star, a conviction that did little to alter the race and suggested supporters of both sides remain entrenched in their positions. Biden has dealt with a debate within his own party over whether he should step down as the Democratic candidate because of concerns that he is no longer fit for the job. He says his doctors have told him he is in good shape. Trump has benefited in some polls from Biden's disastrous debate performance last month, but others show the race to be even. Many voters have already been alienated by both Biden and Trump. The chaos that surrounds the candidates may contribute to voters feeling that the nation's problems are unfixable and the gulf between the parties cannot be bridged. U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, a Republican who was shot by a gunman in 2017, told Fox News that violent election rhetoric needed to stop. \"All it takes is one person who is just unhinged to hear that and go out and act on it and think that's their signal to go take somebody out,\" he said. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign and raised fears of further political…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/analysis-after-trump-shooting-the-presidential-race-will-change-dramatically.-and-possibly-violently","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/ef/46/93b4407d07538417b6bd0071d503b4967854/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:22:04","author":"James Oliphant,Japan Today Editor","authors":["James Oliphant","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":251749796,"title":"Police Officer Found Trump Shooter on Roof Minutes Before Shooting: Report","text":"Before gunshots erupted at former President Donald Trump's campaign rally on Saturday, one police officer had confronted the now identified shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks on the roof of a nearby building, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to the Associated Press on Sunday.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was speaking at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening when he was shot on stage, with a bullet hitting the upper part of his right ear. The suspected gunman, now identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as 20-year-old Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was shot and killed by the Secret Service. A rally attendee, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore was also killed during the incident. Those injured, now identified as 57-year-old David Dutch of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are in stable condition.A spokesperson for Trump's campaign said on Saturday that the former president was \"fine\" and was \"being checked out at a local medical facility.\" Trump was released from the hospital later that night.The FBI has classified the shooting as an assassination attempt and is working as the lead agency on the investigation alongside the Secret Service and local law enforcement.Although Crooks' movements and motive leading up to the shooting are still under investigation, he was said to be positioned on top of a roof of a building nearby the rally with a rifle when he began shooting.According to the AP, who spoke to two law enforcement officials on condition of anonymity, rallygoers noticed a man climbing to the top of the roof of the nearby building and warned local law enforcement.This is when one local officer climbed to the roof and confronted Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder as Crooks quickly took a shot toward Trump who was speaking on stage and that's when the U.S. Secret Service counter-snipers shot him, the AP reported.Newsweek has reached out to the Pennsylvania State Police, the FBI, the Secret Service, and the Butler Police Department via email for comment.One rallygoer told the BBC that he noticed the shooter bear crawling on a building that was \"50-feet away from us.\" The rallygoer said he was trying to get the police and the Secret Services' attention before the shooting.\"We're standing there. We're pointing at the guy crawling up the roof...we could clearly see him with a rifle,\" he said.In response to the raised security questions, Pennsylvania State Police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens said at a late-night news conference on Saturday, which the Secret Service did not attend, \"It is incredibly difficult to have a venue open to the public, and to secure that against any possible threat, against a very determined attacker.\"While the investigation remains ongoing, Saturday's shooting has since sparked debate about the efficiency of the Secret Service and raised questions about the level of protection Trump and other presidential candidates receive. Some have even called for the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle in light of the incident as the Republican-led House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the shooting and asked Cheatle to testify on July 22.The shooting comes days before the Republican National Convention (RNC) kicks off in Milwaukee where Trump is poised to unveil his highly anticipated vice presidential pick, setting the stage for a rematch of the fiercely contested 2020 election against presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.The four-day convention is estimated to bring upward of 50,000 delegates, politicians, and official guests.In two Truth Social posts on Sunday, Trump confirmed he is still attending the convention, writing that while he initially planned to delay his arrival, he decided he \"cannot allow\" a potential assassin to force him to change his plans. He added that he'd be leaving for Milwaukee on Sunday afternoon as planned.Meanwhile, Biden announced that he directed the head of the Secret Service to \"review all security measures, all security measures, for the Republican National Convention.\"The president expressed gratitude to the agents who risked their lives for the protection of Trump in yesterday's shooting and expressed his condolences to Comperatore's family. Biden also emphasized that Trump \"already receives a heightened level of security,\" because he's a former president and the presumed Republican nominee.\"I've been consistent in my direction of the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability, and protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety,\" Biden said.","summary":"A officer climbed to the roof and confronted Thomas Matthew Crooks before Trump was shot on stage during a rally, according to the Associated Press on Sunday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/police-officer-found-trump-shooter-thomas-matthew-crooks-roof-minutes-before-shooting-report-1925027","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2427964/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:21:34","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":251750244,"title":"Biden campaign swaps Trump criticism for unity after shooting","text":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign quickly upended its strategy after an assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania, calling off verbal attacks on the former president to focus instead on a message of unity. Within hours of Saturday’s shooting, Biden’s campaign was pulling down television ads and suspending other political communications, including those that had highlighted Trump’s May felony conviction in New York state court relating to hush money paid to a porn star to avert a sex scandal before the 2016 U.S. election. “We must unite as one nation,” Biden said in White House remarks on Sunday, adding he would have an Oval Office address in the evening. Biden condemned political violence again, as he did on Saturday night, and asked Americans to “let the FBI do their job.” Rather than verbally attacking Trump in the coming days, the White House and the Biden campaign will draw on the president’s history of condemning all sorts of political violence including his sharp criticism of the “disorder” created by campus protests over the Israel-Gaza conflict, campaign officials said on condition of anonymity. Some Republicans have blamed Biden, without evidence, for inspiring the shooting by criticizing Trump. The 20-year-old shooter was a registered Republican whose motive is unknown. Biden’s advisers had hoped to tamp down recent calls from some of his fellow Democrats and others that he step aside and let another candidate represent the party in the Nov. 5 election, sharpening his focus on the dangers he has said Trump presents to U.S. democratic norms and reproductive rights as well as Trump’s false statements about winning the 2020 election. “This changes everything,” one campaign official said of the assassination attempt. “We’re still assessing. Making the case against Trump, drawing that split screen, will get much harder.” “The president is trying to lower the temperature,” the official added. CALLS TO STEP ASIDE The Biden campaign officials said they expect that the assassination attempt will lower the pressure from congressional Democrats for Biden, 81, to step aside in the race amid concerns about his fitness for office. Some Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate have publicly called upon Biden to drop out in the aftermath of his shaky performance in a June debate against Trump. “It’s over,” one White House source told Reuters about the attempt to push Biden out of the 2024 race. That may be overly optimistic, other Democratic sources said. The current wave of calls is over but is expected to resume once Biden inevitably stumbles again, they said. Biden’s planned trip on Monday to the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas – where he was expected to speak on the landmark Civil Rights Act that Johnson signed into law in the 1960s and criticize Trump’s attacks on immigrants and American diversity – has been postponed, the White House said. Biden’s plan to deliver a keynote speech at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) convention in Las Vegas on Tuesday on his administration’s commitment to racial justice and equity for all Americans is unchanged. Because the shooting happened in the election battleground state of Pennsylvania, which Biden won over Trump in 2020 by a narrow margin, the incident could be especially impactful, according to some political strategists, by increasing Republican turnout by voters sympathetic to Trump. “This doesn’t guarantee that Trump flips Pennsylvania,” Republican pollster Frank Luntz wrote on social media. “But the long and winding road for Joe Biden just became even longer and windier. Just as what happened to George Floyd had a lasting impact on tens of millions of Americans, the shooting of Donald Trump will be significantly consequential in a way the shooter never intended.” Floyd is the Black man who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020, a murder that prompted protests in many U.S. cities and abroad. Other Democratic candidates running this year are also rethinking their plans to focus on the dangers they have said Trump poses if elected. “The real question is whether in two weeks we can go back and declare Trump a threat to the country. That was our playbook, and it’s fair, but unclear how much of our spurs were taken off,” said a Democrat involved in a Senate campaign, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump, 78, is due to receive his party’s official nomination for president during the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee beginning on Monday.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden&#8217;s reelection campaign quickly upended its strategy after an assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania, calling off verbal attacks on the former president to focus instead on a message of unity.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/14/breaking-news/biden-campaign-swaps-trump-criticism-for-unity-after-shooting/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-14T155853Z_1704621333_RC2HK8AIG19O_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:21:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":251750844,"title":"Golden calls to drop ‘hyperbolic threats’ about democracy after Trump assassination attempt","text":"Democratic Rep. Jared Golden (MN) on Sunday called on the nation to cease making “hyperbolic threats” about the stakes of the 2024 election year one day after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Golden expressed deep concern about the current state of American political culture and its implications for the nation’s future after an attempted assassination on Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. He said the 2024 election between Trump and President Joe Biden should never be portrayed as a “no-holds-barred struggle between democracy or authoritarianism, or a battle against fascists or socialists intent on destroying America as we know it,” adding “these are dangerous lies.” “The result is an overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety about the future of our country, where the normal and tested tools of democracy no longer seem adequate to protect the common good. Inthis light, a rise of politically motivated violence in America is sadly unsurprising,” Golden added. Golden’s remarks are not the first time he has called on the nation to cool the temperature of political rhetoric. On July 2, he blasted Democratic colleagues’ “hand-wringing” following last month’s disastrous debate for Biden that has led numerous lawmakers to question whether the 81-year-old president has the mental fortitude to take on Trump in the Nov. 5 election. “I refuse to participate in a campaign to scare voters with the idea that Trump will end our democratic system,” Golden said earlier this month. Since the debate, Biden himself has taken to social media to label Trump as a “threat to our democracy,” according to a June 28 post on X, formerly known as Twitter. On July 5, Biden posted that Trump “could become the dictator that he promised to be on day one,” referencing Trump’s previous remarks where he quipped he wouldn’t be a dictator “other than day one.” On Saturday, hours after a gunman fired shots at the crowd in Butler and killed one attendee while also grazing Trump’s ear with a bullet, Biden briefly addressed the nation and said he was “grateful to hear” that Trump is “safe and doing well” and condemned political violence. “There is no place in America for this kind of violence,” Biden said Saturday. “It’s sick. It’s sick.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Biden addressed the nation for a second time on Sunday afternoon, where he announced he had ordered an independent investigation into the attempted shooting and the security measures surrounding the event.

Angus King, and Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree.","summary":"Democratic Rep.

Retired volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore was sitting behind the former president at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania yesterday when he was shot and killed by Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20. It’s believed bullets, fired from a rooftop 130 yards away, had been meant for Trump, who was left with an injury to the upper part of his right ear. Two other people were critically injured, before Crooks was shot dead by a secret service sniper. Members of the crowd tried to save Mr Comperatore’s life, but he died at the scene. His family said he had lost his life trying to shield his wife and daughter from the gunfire. In an emotional tribute, his daughter Allyson wrote on social media: ‘He died a real-life super hero.’ One of Mr Comperatore’s daughters said her father was a real-life super hero (Picture: Facebook) ‘They are not going to tell you how quickly he threw my mom and I to the ground. They are not going to tell you that he shielded my body from the bullet that came at us. ‘He loved his family. He truly loved us enough to take a bullet for us.’ Mr Comperatore’s sister, meanwhile, wrote on Facebook: ‘The PA Trump Rally claimed the life of my brother, Corey Comperatore. ‘The hatred for one man took the life of the one man we loved the most. He was a hero who shielded his daughters.’ ‘His wife and girls just lived through the unthinkable and unimaginable. My baby brother just turned 50 and had so much life left to experience.’ Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said Mr Comperatore, who had served at the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, was a self-proclaimed ‘girl dad’ and firefighter who died a hero. Mr Comperatore loved his family, Governor Josh Shapiro said (Picture: Facebook) ‘Corey went to church every Sunday for a loved his community,’ the governor said today. ‘And most especially Corey loves his family. Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community. ‘I asked Corey’s wife, if it would be okay for me to share that we spoke. She said yes. She also asked that I share with all of you that Corey died a hero.’ ‘This is a moment where all leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity,’ he continued. ‘For all leaders, we need to take down the temperature and rise above the hateful rhetoric that exists in search for a better brighter future for this nation.’ Randy Reamer, president of the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, called Mr Comperatore ‘a stand-up guy’ and ‘a true brother of the fire service’. He said he had been a life member, meaning he’d served for more than 20 years, and was chief of the company for about three years. The shooting started shortly after Republican presidential candidate Trump took to the stage at around 6pm. Trump pumps his fist as he’s rushed off stage by U.S. Secret Service agents (Picture: AP/Evan Vucci) Several bangs could be heard, before Trump bent down, then came up and briefly pumped his fist at the crowd and shouted ‘fight, fight, fight’ as secret service agents rushed him off stage and into a motorcade. Crooks, who graduated from high school in 2022, was a registered Republican. His home in Bethel Park has been searched by police today, with scores of officers and members of the press pictured outside. After the shooting, Trump posted on his Truth Social account, thanking the secret service and law enforcement for their rapid response. He added: ‘I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured ‘It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country. He added: ‘I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.

Let the FBI do their job and their partner agencies do their job,’ he said. ‘There is no place in America for this kind of violence or any violence for that matter. An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for … as a nation – everything,’ Biden added. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

But the same can’t be said for President Joe Biden and the Democrats. “Trump’s voters are energized, Biden’s voters are demoralized,” Luntz wrote. “In recent months, President Trump has benefited from more passionate and engaged followers than the Biden campaign, but the shooting will turn that intensity gap into a chasm.” That translates to a differential in voter turnout that’s worth at least 1%-2%, he estimated. While that seems small, it can be enough to tip the election, especially as a handful of closely divided swing states will determine the winner. And because the shooting happened in the swing state of Pennsylvania, the participation impact will be most felt most significantly there, he added. Even before the shooting, Biden’s election hopes had been dwindling after a disastrous debate performance last month. Some analysts have said his only plausible path to victory is if all the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin stay in his column. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign is pausing its messaging to supporters and pulling TV ads in the aftermath of the shooting. But the Republican National Convention will go on as planned starting this week, with Trump scheduled to appear. When Democrats eventually fully re-engage their campaigning activities, Luntz sees an intensity gap there as well. “It’s hard to imagine either Biden or any of the potential Democratic candidates delivering full-throated crowd-pleasing attacks on the former President now, taking away most of their ability to play the Trump card by labeling him a ‘threat to democracy’ when he just survived a real threat to democracy,” he said. “The 2024 presidential election is now Trump’s to lose.” Ian Bremmer, president of political risk research and consulting firm Eurasia Group, also said the shooting means Trump is more likely to win the election. In a video posted to X on Saturday, he said the image of Trump raising his fist in the air with blood streaked across his face while Secret Service agents carry him to safety will contrast dramatically with Biden, who looked old and frail during the debate. But he also warned about the prospect of more violence, noting that the shooting came as the country was already deeply polarized. “This is the worst sort of event that can happen in that environment, and I deeply worry that this presages much more political violence and social instability to come,” Bremmer said.","summary":"\"In recent months, President Trump has benefited from more passionate and engaged followers than the Biden campaign, but the shooting will turn that intensity gap into a chasm.\"","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/14/presidential-election-forecast-donald-trump-vs-joe-biden-voter-turnout-assassination-attempt-frank-luntz/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2161922807-e1720988104650.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:17:19","author":"Jason Ma","authors":["Jason Ma"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":251749506,"title":"Donald Trump is still attending a major Republican event this week – why it’s critical to his campaign","text":"Former President Donald Trump is seen in attendance during the UFC 299 event at Kaseya Center on March 9, 2024 (Picture: Getty Images) Ex-President Donald Trump is poised to attend a major Republican event this week days after being injured and surviving an assassination attempt.

The RNC is a political convention held every four years for party delegates to select their nominees for president and vice president. This year, the GOP has 2,429 delegates representing states and territories nationwide and they will vote for the nominees. A nominee for president needs to win 1,215 delegates. The RNC is poised to present more than just Trump as the GOP nominee – though that will be the culmination of the four-day event. In addition, the party will finalize its platform and heavyweights and celebrities will fire up the base, with more than 50,000 in attendance. Like the GOP, the Democratic Party will hold its own four-day national convention, but not until next month. Former United States President Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White at the UFC 290 event (Picture: Getty Images) When and where is it being held? The RNC will unfold from July 15 to 18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is a crucial battleground state that Trump won in 2016 but lost narrowly to President Joe Biden in 2020. While the main venue will be the Fiserv Forum, there will also be events at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center.

Each day of the RNC will have its own theme centered around Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. Monday’s theme is Make America Wealthy Again, Tuesday’s is Make America Safe Again, Wednesday’s is Make America Strong Again and Thursday’s is Make America Great Once Again. The theme for the welcoming party on Sunday was Red, White and Brew, as Milwaukee is the city that made beer famous. Breweries and pubs across the city are being used as meeting places for the RNC. More than 50,000 Republicans are set to attend the convention (Picture: Getty Images) When will Donald Trump accept the nomination? The main event of the RNV is when delegates vote on the party nominee. Trump is expected to formally accept the Republican Party’s nomination on the last day of the convention, on Thursday. The nominee traditionally gives an acceptance speech. Who could be his VP pick? Trump is reportedly set to reveal his vice presidential running mate, who will likely be there and address members of the party. Trump’s pick for vice president has generated much speculation. The shortlist reportedly includes North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Ohio Senator JD Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Trump’s pick is expected to also address the convention.

Trump was shot in the ear during a rally in Pennsylvania, in an attack now being investigated as an assassination attempt. The attacker was shot dead and law enforcement officials said they had not yet identified a motive. “We do not believe that the attempt to eliminate and assassinate Trump was organised by the current authorities,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “But the atmosphere around candidate Trump … provoked what America is confronting today.” U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying there was no place for that kind of violence in America. Peskov said Russia condemned any violence in the course of the political struggle. His comments echoed those of some of Trump’s Republican allies, who immediately pinned the blame on Biden. “After numerous attempts to remove candidate Trump from the political arena – using first legal tools, the courts, prosecutors, attempts to politically discredit and compromise the candidate – it was obvious to all outside observers that his life was in danger,” Peskov said. He added that there were no plans for Putin to call Trump in light of the incident. World leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, rapidly condemned Saturday’s attack, expressing shock, denouncing political violence and wishing Trump a quick recovery. Russia’s foreign ministry used the shooting to urge Washington to stop funding Ukraine’s military and concentrate on improving domestic law enforcement instead. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, writing on Telegram, responded to remarks made by independent presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr following the shooting. “Dear Bobby and all those who vote in the United States to supply Zelenskiy with arms,” Zakharova said. “Wouldn’t it be better for this money to finance the American police and other services that are supposed to ensure law and order within the United States?” Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has brought Russia’s ties with the West to their lowest ebb since the height of the Cold War.

Later in the post, former President Trump expressed love for the families of the other shooting victims, including a firefighter who died and two others who were injured. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,” he wrote in his post. Rep. Carlos Antonio Gimenez (R-Fla.) agreed with the sentiment, telling Fox News that the former president wasn’t gravely wounded or killed by “the grace of God,” while Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) said “divine intervention” and God’s “protective hand” foiled the assassination attempt. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wrote that it was God who “protected President Trump yesterday,” while he also told NBC News that he hopes politicians can tone down the political rhetoric following the assassination attempt. “Yesterday there were miracles, and I think the hand of God was there too,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told Fox News on Sunday, noting that he himself was shot and wounded during a congressional baseball team event in 2017. “You can just see one centimeter over and we’re having a very different conversation,” he wrote. Video of the incident shows the former president speaking at the rally and then turning his head slightly before he was struck in the right ear. Some Republicans, including Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, noted that the slight turning of his head may have saved his life and suggested divine intervention is at play. The shooting suspect has been identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks from the village of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about an hour from the rally, the FBI said Sunday. No motive has been revealed. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Sunday identified the slain victim as 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, who “dove on” his wife and daughters as the gunman opened fire at the rally. “These victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,” Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Colonel Christopher Paris said in a statement. “The Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.” Saturday’s incident marks the first assassination shooting attempt on a current or former president in several decades, the last time occurring in 1981 when then-President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded in Washington, D.C., by a lone gunman. The incident likely will roil the current 2024 presidential race, while many top Democrats, including President Joe Biden, condemned the violence.","summary":"'God protected President Trump,' wrote vice presidential candidate Sen.

FBI Director Christopher Wray on Sunday said that the top investigative agencies' authorities \"will leave no stone unturned\" and are \"committed the full force\" in their investigation.The US investigative agency chief called the shooting an “attack on democracy and democratic process\" of the world's oldest democracy. “An attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate can only be described as absolutely despicable and will not be tolerated in this country,” Wray said.The firearm used in the attempted assassination, identified as an AR-style 556 rifle, was legally purchased. Authorities believe the semi-automatic weapon was acquired by the shooter's father, though they are uncertain about how the shooter accessed it or whether he took it without his father’s knowledge.“These are facts that we'll flesh out as we conduct interviews,” Kevin Rojek, special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh Field Office was quoted as saying. The FBI said it is also investigating the Trump rally shooting as an attempted assassination and also an act of \"domestic terrorism\".The gunman was not previously known to the FBI and is believed to have acted alone. Authorities have not yet identified any specific motive or made a case for any \"threatening\" or incriminating content on social media.During their investigation, the FBI located and safely defused a suspicious device, and they have received over 2,000 tips related to the incident.

The officer reportedly retreated from the rooftop after Crooks pointed his firearm at the unidentified officer. Moments later, Crooks took shots at Trump, and he was injured after being grazed on his ear. A rally attendee, Corey Comperatore, was also killed during the shooting.

Scrutiny into the Secret Services’s and law enforcement’s security at the Pennsylvania rally is increasing amid concerns that the gunman was able to access the rooftop under 150 yards from Trump’s podium. Ex-Secret Service agent Dan Bongino said Sunday morning that he believed the agency’s director should be fired for the alarming security breach. “[Secret Service agents] are trained out to 1,000 yards in the Secret Service with the counter-sniper team.

Police were working on Sunday to learn more about Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, to determine what motivated him to open fire on the rally from a nearby rooftop, killing one spectator, before he was shot dead by the Secret Service. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Sunday it has not yet identified any threatening writing or social media posts from Crooks, who graduated from high school two years ago and had no past criminal cases against him, according to public court records. The FBI believes he acted alone. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said on social media the upper part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting. Two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. The man killed was Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area who Pennsylvania’s governor says died a “hero” by diving onto his family to protect them. Relatives of Crooks did not immediately respond to messages from Associated Press. His father, Matthew Crooks, told CNN late on Saturday that he was trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” but would not speak about his son until after he talked to police. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022. In a video of the school’s graduation ceremony posted online, Crooks can be seen crossing the stage to receive his diploma, appearing slight of build and wearing glasses. The school district said it will cooperate fully with investigators. In his senior year, Crooks was among several pupils given an award for maths and science, according to a Tribune-Review story at the time. Jason Kohler, who said he attended the same school but did not share any classes with Crooks, said Crooks was bullied at school and sat alone at lunch time. Other pupils mocked him for the way he dressed, such as hunting outfits, Kohler said. “He was bullied almost every day,” Kohler told reporters. “He was just an outcast, and you know how kids are nowadays.” Crooks worked at a nursing home as a dietary aid, a job that generally involves food preparation. Marcie Grimm, the administrator of Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation, said in a statement she was “shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement”. Grimm added that Crooks had a clean background check when he was hired. Crooks’ political leanings were not immediately clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave US$15 to a progressive political action committee on January 20, 2021, the day US President Joe Biden was sworn into office. Butler County district attorney Richard Goldinger told Associated Press on Sunday that Crooks had been previously unknown to investigators in his county and had not been on their radar. He said the investigation had so far not turned up any evidence that he had coordinated with anyone else in the region. A blockade had been set up on Sunday preventing traffic near Crooks’ house, which is in an enclave of modest brick houses in the hills outside blue-collar Pittsburgh and about an hour’s drive from the site of the Trump rally. Police cars were stationed at an intersection near the house and officers were seen walking through the neighbourhood. Bomb-making materials were found inside Crooks’ car near the Trump rally and at his home, according to two officials who were not authorised to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. A white Allegheny County Police truck identified as bomb squad pulled up to the home late on Sunday morning. Police recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene of the shooting, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. Investigators believe the weapon was bought by the father at least six months ago, two police officials said. One local police officer climbed to the roof and encountered Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder, and Crooks quickly took a shot towards Trump, and that is when Secret Service snipers shot him, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. A video posted to social media and geolocated by Associated Press shows Crooks wearing a grey T-shirt with a black American flag on the right arm lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds where Trump’s rally was held. The roof where Crooks lay was less than 150 metres from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 metres is a distance at which US Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M-16 rifle. Images of Crooks’ body reviewed by Associated Press show he appears to have been wearing a T-shirt from Demolition Ranch, a popular YouTube channel with more than 11.6 million subscribers that regularly posts videos that show creator Matt Carriker firing off handguns and assault rifles at targets that include human mannequins and vehicles. Carriker, who lives in Texas, did not respond to a phone message or email on Sunday, but posted a photo of Crooks’ bloody corpse wearing his brand’s T-shirt on social media with the comment “What the hell”.","summary":"Registered Republican Thomas Matthew Crooks, who worked at a nursing home, described as a loner who had been bullied at school.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3270429/what-we-know-about-20-year-old-man-who-tried-assassinate-donald-trump","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/15/23f55dc9-2b78-44e4-9027-3de1da6635e7_f7ebd3aa.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/12/WEB_Biden%20Trump%20new_v2.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:03:56","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":251749232,"title":"Trump pushes forward with RNC plans after ‘potential assassin’ fails: ‘Unite America’","text":"Former President Donald Trump on Sunday posted on social media to “UNITE AMERICA” and confirmed he would travel to the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin as regularly scheduled later that day.

Here’s what to look out for","text":"Donald Trump and the MAGA-fied Republican Party will take over the city of Milwaukee in Wisconsin this week as the GOP nominating convention takes place over four days. At the top of every delegate’s mind this week? Saturday’s surreal scene at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a gunman was killed by the Secret Service after attempting to assassinate the former president in a shooting that left one spectator dead and two others seriously injured. An already momentous event will now be underscored by a new layer of security, as the country reels from one of the most shocking outbursts of political violence in decades. Trump, having lost just one state in the months-long primary slog against Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and other opponents, is guaranteed to be his party’s nominee when it’s all said and done. The former president will then embark upon his third bid for the White House, now under the cloud of 34 felony convictions (with three other criminal prosecutions on the way). This week’s Republican National Convention will be informative not only for any drama that plays out on the convention floor, but also for what it says about the kind of general election campaign Trump will run over the 109 days between his acceptance of the nomination and the November election. Trump’s attempted assassination is likely to be a major topic of speakers and much talked about among attendees, which will include state and county-level Republicans from around the country. Here’s what to look out for. The main story on day one: Who will be Donald Trump’s running mate for the general election? Sources inside Trumpworld have told journalists for weeks that the contest is down to three men: Marco Rubio, JD Vance, and Doug Burgum. The latter, a governor from North Dakota who dropped out early on from the 2024 GOP primary, is thought to be losing favor while the two senators Vance and Rubio are still duking it out for Trump’s rose. The four-day convention will also be a glimpse into the kind of administration Trump hopes to lead come January 2025. His opponent, Joe Biden, is facing an unprecedented rebellion within his own party after a shocking debate performance at the end of June during which Biden stumbled over his words and repeatedly lost his train of thought, unable to effectively rebut Trump’s lies. Polling shows the incumbent president trailing in every swing state he won against Donald Trump in 2020. Thanks to current realities in the House and Senate, a Trump victory in November would likely be accompanied by respective Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Saturday’s shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, is sure to shake up the presidential race and have a profound effect on politics in America during an already divided time. The gunman, a 20-year-old whose motivations have not been identified, and his actions have already spawned a host of conspiracy theories as Republicans try to point fingers at Democrats for the violence. Even as Trump and other prominent Republicans stay away from the more outlandish conspiracies being spread in the wake of the shooting, one can expect misinformation and speculation to play a major role this week. That much was evident in the response from JD Vance, one of the finalists who may be announced at Trump’s running mate, on Saturday. “Today is not just some isolated incident,” Vance posted on Twitter. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Expect efforts by Republicans to shmooze voters in battleground states — particularly Wisconsin, which is hosting the RNC and is one of the swing states won by Biden in 2020 in his victory over Trump that year. The incumbent president won the state by just one percentage point last time around, and last Thursday, Biden’s campaign identified the state in a memo released to reporters as crucial once more to his path to victory this year. Trump, meanwhile, insulted Milwaukee as a “horrible” city at a campaign rally earlier this year — but one can assume that he and others will take a stab at smoothing things over during the convention. Trump has clearly noticed his sudden advantage, and held his fire for several days after his meetup with Biden in Atlanta. That pause quickly ended, however, with the former president asserting at a rally that Biden’s convicted-felon son Hunter was running the show at the White House. The president’s adult son has indeed been reportedly managing his father’s communication with friends and outside advisers and has sat in on meetings at the White House, according to multiple officials. With his opponent in apparent freefall, Trump has turned his attention to the RNC itself and tried to shield himself from the inevitable counter-punching from the Biden campaign and its allies. On Truth Social, the former president distanced himself from Project 2025, a blueprint for radically slimming down and transforming the federal government to fit a far-right conservative vision. Numerous figures in and around Trumpworld including Trump’s ex-aide John McEntee are connected to the project, which was crafted by a host of conservative groups led by the Heritage Foundation, a convention sponsor of the RNC. Just how much attention Project 2025 and its supporters receive at the convention will be a sign of how much Trumpworld plans to be alligned with the far-right agenda. The actions and rhetoric of anti-abortion groups will be particularly illuminating this coming week. There’s an argument playing out in the media over whether the Trump/RNC 2024 campaign platform takes a direct stance on a national abortion ban. The platform draft does not contain any language about support for passing legislation in Congress to ban or restrict the practice nationwide, but its inclusion of language supporting the fetal personhood argument — which posits that unborn fetuses have rights of due process under the Constitution — has led many Democrats to argue that the GOP is indicating its support instead for a total ban on abortion through the court system. Anti-abortion crusaders have been split over the party platform, with groups like Students for Life Action and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America applauding what remains in the platform. Others, like Mike Pence, have condemned it as not extreme enough on abortion. With Trump ascendant in the polls and his opponent facing unprecedented issues vexing his campaign, the relevance of the RNC will take on new weight as voters of all political stripes tune in to see what very well could be in store for American governance for the next four years.","summary":"Four-day convention will feature surprise celebrity speakers and a MAGA lovefest while Biden’s campaign experiences freefall","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rnc-what-to-know-b2578337.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/11/17/GettyImages-2161406050.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:51:53","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.298},{"id":251749072,"title":"Former fire chief who died at Trump rally used his body to shield family from gunfire","text":"BUFFALO TOWNSHIP, Pennsylvania (AP) — The former fire chief who was killed at a Pennsylvania rally for Donald Trump spent his final moments diving in front of his family to protect them from gunfire that rang out Saturday during an assassination attempt against the former president. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro confirmed Sunday that Corey Comperatore, 50, had died a “hero,” using his body as a shield to protect both his wife and daughter from the bullets. “His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them,” Shapiro said. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden extended their “deepest condolences” to Comperatore’s family. “He was a father. He was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired and he lost his life, God love him. We’re also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured,” Biden said. At least two other people were injured during the attempt to kill Trump at Saturday’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Those two have been identified as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. Both were listed in stable condition as of Sunday. Separately, Texas U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson said in a statement Sunday that his nephew was injured but “thankfully his injury was not serious.” “My family was sitting in the front, near where the President was speaking,” Jackson said. “They heard shots ringing out — my nephew then realized he had blood on his neck and something had grazed and cut his neck. He was treated by the providers in the medical tent.” The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter, who attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue. The former president was showing off a chart of border-crossing numbers when at least five shots were fired. Trump was seen holding his ear and got down on the ground. Agents quickly created a shield around him. When he stood, his face bloodied, he pumped his fist to cheering supporters Randy Reamer, president of the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, called Comperatore “a stand-up guy” and “a true brother of the fire service.” He said Comperatore served as chief of the company for about three years but was also a life member, meaning he had served for more than 20 years. “Just a great all-around guy, always willing to help someone out,” Reamer said of Comperatore. “He definitely stood up for what he believed in, never backed down to anyone. … He was a really good guy.” A crew was power-washing the front of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company on Sunday with plans to install memorial drapery to honor the slain former chief. Assistant Chief Ricky Heasley of Sarver, who knew Comperatore for more than a decade, remembered him as very outgoing and full of life. “He never had a bad word,” Heasley said. And in the front yard of the Comperatores’ two-story home in Butler County, a small memorial of a U.S. flag and small bunches of flowers had sprung up.

Trump’s motorcade was spotted leaving the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster en route to Newark Liberty International Airport shortly after 4 p.m., according to ABC7’s Kemberly Richardson. Throughout the day on Sunday, a rotating group of 10 to 50 devoted Trump fans wielding campaign flags gathered down the street from the golf club to offer him their support. Local resident Louis Damore, 61, told The Post that he was using his one day off from running his air conditioning business to show his support for the Republican frontrunner. “I’m here to support my superhero. Donald Trump is my superhero,” Damore gushed. “How this could happen is beyond belief,” he added, referring to the chaotic scene that erupted when a gunman opened fire at Trump’s rally in Butler, Penn., grazing the former president’s ear and killing one attendee. “We should have answers by tomorrow morning as to why this guy was up on the roof,” Damore said of the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks. The 20-year-old was shot dead by the Secret Service on the roof of a manufacturing plant 130 yards from the rally site. He was found with an AR-style rifle, and explosives were later located in his car. Damore said that he believed Trump’s near-miss was an act of divine intervention. “My take, it was God last night that did this. 100%. The guy should be dead,” he told The Post. “And what would we be talking about right now, God forbid, if that did happen? Civil war? I believe so,” he continued, adding that he believes the US is “losing civilization” due to political divides. “So what I took out of this is God was at the podium last night with Mr. Trump. Saved his life. If he [had not] turned his head, his head would have been somewhere else okay?” Damore insisted. Earlier on Sunday, a senior aide for Trump’s campaign confirmed that the real estate mogul turned to reference the jumbotron just as Crooks opened fire. At least one expert has gone on the record saying that the split-second move likely saved Trump’s life. Speaking from the side of the road, Damore lamented that there were not more people showing their support for Trump after Saturday night’s ordeal. “I can’t believe there ain’t more people out here supporting this guy,” he said. “I know it’s hot out today, but they’re driving by, they’re blowing their horns and support. But what this man is doing for my family, my grandchildren, this is the least I can do.” The passersby have been mostly friendly, Damore said of the drivers passing through the intersection. “I saw a handful of middle fingers,” he noted. Trump arrived at the golf club early Sunday morning, after his private plane touched down in Newark. Shortly after 2 p.m., the former president announced that he would leave for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee at 3:30. “Based on yesterday’s terrible events, I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin…by two days, but have just decided that I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else,” he shared on Truth Social. President Joe Biden – who faced off with Trump during a disastrous debate last month – urged the public not to make “assumptions” about the motivation behind the assassination attempt during a media conference Sunday afternoon. Biden will also deliver a rare Oval Office address at 8 p.m..","summary":"Local resident Louis Damore told The Post that he was using his one day off from work to support Trump.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/us-news/trump-leaves-bedminster-as-fans-praise-him-as-superhero/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/superhero-85463633.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kx46ov9Q-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:45:39","author":"Kevin Sheehan,Olivia Land","authors":["Kevin Sheehan","Olivia Land"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.729},{"id":251750524,"title":"Joe Biden Calls for “Unity” After Trump Assassination Attempt","text":"President Joe Biden, speaking Sunday to the nation from the Roosevelt Room in the White House, said, “There is no place in America for this kind of violence.” Adding, “Unity is the most elusive goal of all. But nothing is as important as that right now.” Biden said he's been briefed by relevant agencies and that he instructed the Secret Service to do everything in their power to keep Trump safe, that he will review security measures for this week’s Republican National Convention, and that his administration will be conducting an independent review of what happened yesterday and will release that information to the public. “We must unite as one nation to demonstrate who we are,” President Biden said. By Sunday morning, congressional and local political leaders took to social media and television talk shows to share in their remorse for the life lost at Trump’s rally, to express support for the former president, and condemn political violence. Many echoed yesterday’s calls to turn down the heat on political rhetoric. At this highly fractured moment in America, unity has, in fact, proved elusive. Even before the suspected shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was identified, and as investigators still have yet to establish a motive, some Trump allies began placing blame on Democratic leaders, like Biden, and the news media. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” wrote Ohio Senator and Trump VP contender JD Vance on X. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Another VP contender, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, accused “Democrats and their allies in the media” of having “recklessly stoked fears, calling President Trump and other conservatives threats to democracy.” Florida Senator Rick Scott wrote, “This isn’t some unfortunate incident. This was an assassination attempt by a madman inspired by the rhetoric of the radical left.” George Representative Mike Collins of Georgia wrote that Biden should be charged with “inciting an assassination,” while Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, also of Georgia, wrote, “The Democrats and the media are to blame for every drop of blood spilled today.” News outlets have covered the potential threat Trump poses to democracy and the unprecedented circumstances surrounding his candidacy. The former president was convicted of 34 felonies for falsifying documents to cover up a hush money payment and a House committee found that he incited a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 to stop the certification of the 2020 election. He currently faces state and federal charges related to election subversion. And if elected, Trump has vowed to be a “dictator” on Day 1. During a Sunday interview on NBC News’ Weekend Today, House Speaker Mike Johnson said “we can’t go on like this as a society” and announced plans for Congress to do a “full investigation of the tragedy yesterday to determine where there were lapses in security.” Johnson, too, cast blame on media. “There’s no figure in American history, at least in the modern era, maybe since Lincoln, who has been so vilified and really persecuted by the media, Hollywood elites, political figures, even a legal system,” he said. “When the message goes out constantly that the election of Donald Trump would be a threat to democracy, and that the Republic would end, it heats up the environment.” When asked by Meet the Press’ Kristen Welker about what he would like to see to try to prevent something like this from happening again, Representative Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania, who attended the rally, said, “Look, there’s plenty of blame to go around. Now on the same note, I will say that I was listening to Mike Johnson a little bit earlier, he had stated how this president just gets vilified.” “From Fascism, to Hitler, to dictator,” Meuser continued, “so I can easily point that out, but I’m willing to state at the same time, we all need to take responsibility to cool things down. To say what we mean, but don’t say it mean. To not get personal. To have dialogue, rather than attacks.” NBC’s Dasha Burns, who was reporting live from the Pennsylvania rally, shared that in the moments following the shooting, after she was reunited with her crew, “some people in the crowd started to come to the risers, they started to get heated with the press.” “This crowd gathered near the media,” she continued, “and started blaming the press for what had just happened—some screaming at journalists and getting pretty aggressive. Just over six minutes into his speech began, witnesses heard the sound of cracking shots, one after the other, as Trump reached for his ear and ducked behind the podium— where he was quickly surrounded by Secret Service agents. He emerged with blood on the right side of his face. Before exiting the stage, Trump raised a fist to the crowd—some of whom raised one in return—and seemed to shout the word “Fight.” On Truth Social, Trump wrote that a bullet had “pierced the upper part of my right ear,” saying, “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots.” The shooting suspect, Crooks, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was a registered Republican, his mother was a Democrat, and his father a Libertarian, according to voter-registration records and Dan Grzybek, who represents the area Crooks lived in on the county council. Crooks had used ActBlue to donate $15 to a liberal group called the Progressive Turnout Project in January 2021, according to campaign finance records. The Times reported that the AR-type semiautomatic rifle found next to Crooks’s body was “purchased by a family member, possibly his father, according to an official briefed on the investigation.” Appearing to graduate from high school just two years ago, Crooks reportedly has an incredibly low online social media presence, according to NBC investigative reporter Tom Winter, who also noted that other online forums, like chatrooms, were still being sifted through. New pieces of information regarding the assassination attempt are continuing to be released as local and federal lawmakers, as well as newsrooms across the country, continue to investigate the shooting. “Former F.B.I. officials said the bureau’s behavioral analysis unit would try to build out a profile of the gunman to understand his motivations and why he decided to carry out the attempted assassination. The F.B.I., which is running the investigation, will cast a wide net, interviewing friends and family members and scouring the internet for clues he might have left online or in a journal,” the Times’ writes. “This remains an active and ongoing investigation,” the FBI said in a statement early Sunday. In a statement immediately following the shooting, Biden called the violence “sick. Later on, the two leading presidential candidates shared a reportedly “short and respectful” phone call, according to the White House. Biden’s campaign announced that it would pause “outbound communications,” attempting to take down television ads, a campaign official said. The Democratic National Committee similarly paused both television and billboard ads against Trump. Previously, attempts to ban firearms from the convention sites, where items like tennis balls and gas masks are prohibited, have failed due to concerns over violating state laws or riling up Trump’s base. As Axios noted last month, “Guns will be allowed within walking distance of the Republican National Convention,” but not within the event’s inner security perimeter. When asked whether there might be changes to guns being allowed in some areas near the convention site, Chief Jeffrey Norman of the Milwaukee police said, “We’re going to see whether there are going to be the opportunities in regards to dealing with that particular challenge,” in an interview with WISN-TV. In a joint statement released by the Trump campaign and the RNC on Saturday night after the shooting, the teams said that Trump “looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States.”","summary":"The president’s message comes as prominent Republicans have cast blame on Democrats and the media for the shooting—and as investigators have yet to establish the 20-year-old suspected gunman’s motive.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/joe-biden-calls-for-unity-after-trump-assassination-attempt","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/669406d7099c4438dc6eb4f4/16:9/w_5392,h_3033,c_limit/2161925534","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:39:40","author":"Katie Herchenroeder","authors":["Katie Herchenroeder"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":251748586,"title":"Biden calls for not making assumptions about motives of gunman who shot at Trump","text":"WASHINGTON, July 14. /TASS/. US President Joe Biden has called for refraining from jumping at conclusions about the motives of the gunman who made an assassination attempt at former President Donald Trump. \"We don’t yet have any information about the motive of the shooter.

The assassination attempt on Trump was staged at his campaign rally in Pennsylvania late on Saturday. The Republican was wounded. According to recent reports, he is safe, he received a minor injury - the bullet pierced his right ear. The shooting left one person killed and two injured. The shooter was killed by officers of the US Secret Service, which is responsible, in particular, for protecting the top officials of the state. The FBI are investigating the shooting at Trump’s rally as a possible domestic terrorism attack and assassination.","summary":"\"I’ve instructed that this investigation be thorough and swift,\" the US President stressed","url":"https://tass.com/world/1816889","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:37:42","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":251748028,"title":"Donald Trump shooting: Gun was primed to fire by violence endemic to US politics","text":"The shots that rang out over the agricultural show grounds in Butler, Pennsylvania did not come from nowhere. They came from a gun that has been primed to fire for years. If he were given to self-reflection, Donald Trump might even be asking some difficult questions of himself about how America has reached this dismal pass. But he isn’t, of course. Instead, heading into the Republican convention starting on Monday in Milwaukee, he emerges from the attempted assassination as a divinely ordained not-quite martyr who survived to tell the tale and “make America great again”. “Thank you to everyone for your thoughts and prayers yesterday, as it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening,” the former and would-be future president wrote on his Truth Social platform. More than his words, it is the imagery of the shooting that will be seared onto the collective memory, set to be republished and rebroadcast incessantly by his supporters and sympathetic media between now and November 5, and beyond. One in particular evoked the US Marines retaking Iwo Jima in a climactic World War Two battle - the Stars and Stripes billowing behind a fist-pumping Mr Trump as he was hustled off the stage by his Secret Service bodyguards, blood streaming from his ear. At a stroke, he went a long way towards neutralising Democratic attacks on his historic conviction in a criminal trial and their portrayal of him as a clear and present threat to democracy. Any Democrat who can rise above the fray might be able to move the debate on. President Joe Biden spoke to Mr Trump and appealed to eradicate the “sick” violence seen in Pennsylvania. But, faltering and ageing almost visibly before our eyes, he is not that Democrat. Instead, with the Democrats suspending their campaign attacks, it is the pro-Trump “Maga” partisans who have swamped the airwaves over the past 48 hours since Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at the rally in Butler. The 20-year-old from a nearby Pittsburgh suburb was killed at the scene by Secret Service sharpshooters. One attendee at the rally also died, and two others were left critically wounded. But violence is endemic to politics in the United States and if anything, it is a surprise that attacks on politicians have not been more frequent given the super-charged tension that has choked the atmosphere for years. The stench of hypocrisy in the air has also been getting thicker. Even as they condemn such spasms, politicians have been doing everything to stoke that tension. It drives up their base, encourages donations, and translates into votes. Even as he appealed on all sides to “turn the temperature down in this country”, House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson singled out for blame the media, President Biden and “Hollywood elites” . Mr Trump is expected to name his vice presidential pick possibly as early as tonight at the Republican convention, where he can be expected an even bigger hero’s welcome than normal. One of the frontrunners, Ohio Senator JD Vance, did his chances no harm by saying the attack was “not just some isolated incident”. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination,” he tweeted. And yet, that rhetoric also didn’t come from nowhere. It was in response to Mr Trump’s own incendiary attacks and actions down the years, starting with the untruth that Barack Obama was lying about his birthplace and therefore ineligible to stand when he was elected America’s first black president in 2008. When former Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband Paul suffered a vicious beating by a hammer-wielding madman, Mr Trump joked about it in front of a jeering crowd. He was just as derisive when a plot by Far-right extremists to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and overthrow her state government was exposed. The same toxic stew of Far-right conspiracy theories, lent credence by Mr Trump and his acolytes, gave rise to a mass shooting just over two years ago in Buffalo, New York, when 10 African-Americans were shot and murdered by a white supremacist firing the same model of AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that was used at the Trump rally. Above all, the Republican encouraged a baying mob to march on Capitol Hill after his election defeat four years ago, and has ever since maintained the fiction that the election was stolen by Mr Biden. Any defeat in November will be a product of the same “deep state” forces, Mr Trump insists. So yes, Crooks fired the gun. But it was locked and loaded for a long time before the attack on a balmy evening in rural Pennsylvania this weekend.","summary":"Super-charged tension in US politics has made violence endemic","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/us-politics/donald-trump-shooting-violence-us-politics-b1170640.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/07/14/18/13-c1d27d61de2e457d975b47a815696406.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:37:17","author":"Jitendra Joshi","authors":["Jitendra Joshi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":251749626,"title":"How the attempt on Donald Trump's life could impact the U.S. presidential election","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories DEVELOPING DEVELOPING | Man killed at Trump rally was former fire chief who 'dove on his family to protect them' On the heels of an attempt to kill him, former U.S. President Donald Trump called Sunday for unity and resilience as shocked leaders across the political divide recoiled from the shooting that left him wounded but 'fine.'

The FBI on Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The gunman, who was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an “elevated position outside of the rally venue,” the agency said. An Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos taken at the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows Crooks’ body lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where Trump’s rally was held. A different image shows Crooks is wearing a gray T-shirt with a black American flag on the right arm and has a bloody wound to his head. The roof was less than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The AR-style rifle, like that of the gunman at the Trump rally, is the semiautomatic civilian version of the military M16. President Joe Biden said Sunday he’s directed an independent review of the national security at the rally. Biden said he has also directed the U.S. Secret Service to review all security measures for the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday in Milwaukee. Biden urged Americans not to make assumptions about the motive of the shooter. He said investigators are working swiftly to investigate the attack. “Unity is the most elusive goal of all,” he said, but “nothing is more important than that right now.” Calls for an investigation came from all sides. Rep. Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, sent a letter to Mayorkas on Sunday raising questions about the shooting and demanding information about the former president’s Secret Service protection. “The seriousness of this security failure and chilling moment in our nation’s history cannot be understated,” Green wrote. The Secret Service did not have a speaker at a news conference Saturday night where FBI and Pennsylvania State Police officials briefed reporters on the shooting investigation. FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was “surprising” that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. Members of the Secret Service’s counter-sniper team and counterassault team were at the rally, according to two law enforcement officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss details of the investigation. The heavily armed counterassault team, whose Secret Service code name is “Hawkeye,” is responsible for eliminating threats so that other agents can shield and take away the person they are protecting. The counter-sniper team, known by the code name “Hercules,” uses long-range binoculars and is equipped with sniper rifles to deal with long-range threats. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to investigate the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates and their campaign events is one of the department’s “most vital priorities,” he said. “We condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms and commend the Secret Service for their swift action today,” Mayorkas said. “We are engaged with President Biden, former President Trump and their campaigns, and are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.“ Green also noted reports that the Secret Service had rebuffed requests from the Trump campaign for additional security. A spokesman for the Secret Service, Anthony Guglielmi, said on X Sunday that those allegations were “absolutely false” and that they had added resources and technology as the campaign’s travel increased. Green said he would be talking with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Sunday. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and called on Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Comer said his committee will send a formal invitation soon. “Political violence in all forms is un-American and unacceptable. There are many questions and Americans demand answers,” Comer said in a statement. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating “security failures” at the rally. “The federal government must constantly learn from security failures in order to avoid repeating them, especially when those failures have implications for the nation,” Torres said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, posted on X that he and his staff are in contact with security planning coordinators ahead of the Republican National Convention set to begin Monday in Milwaukee. “We cannot be a country that accepts political violence of any kind — that is not who we are as Americans,” Evers said. The FBI said it will lead the investigation into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department “will bring every available resource to bear to this investigation.” “My heart is with the former President, those injured, and the family of the spectator killed in this horrific attack,” Garland said in a statement. “We will not tolerate violence of any kind, and violence like this is an attack on our democracy.” Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"The U.S. Secret Service is investigating how a gunman armed with an AR-style rifle was able to get close enough to shoot and injure former President Donald Trump at his rally in Pennsylvania\n\n\nThe post The Secret Service is investigating how a gunman who shot and injured Trump was able to get so close appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2024/07/14/the-secret-service-is-investigating-how-a-gunman-who-shot-and-injured-trump-was-able-to-get-so-close/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Trump_27454-669434a530cb6-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:30:49","author":"Associated Press,Secret Service","authors":["Associated Press","Secret Service"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":251749624,"title":"Within minutes after Trump shooting, misinformation started flying. 'Everyone is just speculating'","text":"WASHINGTON - Within minutes of the gunfire, the attempted assassination of former U.S. President Donald Trump spawned a vast sea of claims — some outlandish, others contradictory — reflecting the frightening uncertainties of the moment as well as America's fevered, polarized political climate. The cloudburst of speculation and conjecture as Americans turned to the internet for news about the shooting is the latest sign of how social media has emerged as a dominant source of information — and misinformation — for many, and a contributor to the distrust and turbulence now driving American politics. Mentions of Trump on social media soared up to 17 times the average daily amount in the hours after the shooting, according to PeakMetrics, a cyber firm that tracks online narratives. Many of those mentions were expressions of sympathy for Trump or calls for unity. But many others made unfounded, fantastical claims. “We saw things like ‘The Chinese were behind it,’ or ‘ Antifa was behind it,’ or ‘the Biden administration did it.' We also saw a claim that the RNC was behind it,’” said Paul Bartel, senior intelligence analyst at PeakMetrics. “Everyone is just speculating. No one really knows what's going on. They go online to try to figure it out.” Here's a look at the claims that surfaced online following the shooting: Claims of an inside job or false flag are unsubstantiated Many of the more specious claims that surfaced immediately after the shooting sought to blame Trump or his Democratic opponent, President Joe Biden, for the attack. Some voices on the left quickly proclaimed the shooting to be a false flag concocted by Trump, while some Trump supporters suggested the Secret Service intentionally failed to protect Trump on the White House’s orders. The Secret Service on Sunday pushed back on claims circulating on social media that Trump's campaign had asked for greater security before Saturday's rally and was told no. “This is absolutely false,” agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote Sunday on X. “In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.” Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories Videos of the shooting were quickly dissected in partisan echo chambers and Trump supporters and detractors looked for evidence to support their beliefs. Videos showing Secret Service agents moving audience members away from Trump before the shooting were offered as evidence that it was an inside job. Images of Trump's defiantly raised fist were used to make the opposite claim — that the whole event was staged by Trump. “How did the USSS allow him to stop and pose for a photo opp if there was real danger??” wrote one user, using the abbreviation for the U.S. Secret Service. Social media bots helped amplify the false claims on platforms including Facebook, Instagram, X and TikTok, according to an analysis by the Israeli tech firm Cyabra, which found that a full 45% of the accounts using hashtags like #fakeassassination and #stagedshooting were inauthentic. An image created using artificial intelligence — depicting a smiling Trump moments after the shooting — was also making the rounds, Cyabra found. Moments like this are 'cannon fodder' for extremists Conspiracy theories quickly emerged online that misidentified the suspected shooter, blamed other people without evidence and espoused hate speech, including virulent antisemitism. “Moments like this are cannon fodder for extremists online, because typically they will react with great confidence to whatever has happened without any real evidence” said Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “People will fall into spirals and will advance their own ideologies and their own conclusions.” Before authorities identified the suspect, photos of two different people circulated widely online falsely identifying them as the shooter. In all the speculation and conjecture, others were trying to exploit the event financially. On X on Sunday morning, an account named Proud Patriots urged Trump supporters to purchase their assassination-attempt themed merchandise. “First they jail him, now they try to end him,” reads the ad for the commemorative Trump Assassination Attempt Trading Card. “Stand Strong & Show Your Support!” Republicans cast blame on Biden After the shooting, some Republicans blamed Biden for the shooting, arguing sustained criticisms of Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.” Ware said that comment from Biden was “violent rhetoric” that is “raising the stakes,” especially when combined with Biden’s existential words about the election. But he said it was important not to make conclusions about the shooter’s motive until we know more information. Biden's remarks were part of a broader approach to turn scrutiny on Trump, with no explicit call to violence. Trump's own incendiary words have been criticized in the past for encouraging violence. His lies about the 2020 election and his call for supporters to “fight like hell” preceded the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, which led to his second impeachment on charges of incitement of insurrection. Trump also mocked the hammer attack that left 80-year-old Paul Pelosi, the husband of the former House speaker, with a fractured skull. Surveys find that Americans overwhelmingly reject violence as a way to settle political differences, but overheated rhetoric from candidates and social media can motivate a small minority of people to act, said Sean Westwood, a political scientist who directs the Polarization Research Lab at Dartmouth College. Westwood said he worries that Saturday's shooting could spur others to consider violence as a tactic. “There is a real risk that this spirals,” he said. “Even if someone doesn’t personally support violence, if they think the other side does, and they witness an attempted political assassination, there is a real risk that this could lead to escalation.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

As the Secret Service defends its security protocol at the Pennsylvania rally where a shooter opened fire on Trump, Dan Bongino is calling for Director Kimberly Cheatle to step down. Bongino served in the Secret Service for 12 years. The podcast host responded to a statement the agency put out following the assassination attempt claiming it had “added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.” The former Secret Service agent slammed the agency’s refusal to own responsibility for the security breach. “This is the best technology we have’? Really? To let a sniper 150 yards away from the potential next president shoot a piece of his ear off?” Bongino told Fox News. “Kimberly Cheatle has failed Donald Trump, and honestly failed Joe Biden too” Questions are mounting over how the shooter was able to gain access to a rooftop 150 yards from the president’s podium on Saturday evening. Witnesses say they tried to warn the Secret Service detail and police officers present at the event for minutes before Thomas Matthew Crooks pulled the trigger. Bongino expressed surprise that Secret Service counter snipers failed to kill Crooks before he opened fire on the president. “We’re trained out to 1,000 yards in the Secret Service with the counter-sniper team. How did they miss someone at most one-fifth of the way there? It doesn’t make any sense.

President Biden said he would address the nation from the Oval Office later in the day, a step only taken at times of grave crisis, after his 78-year-old predecessor was hit in the ear at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is more important than that right now,\" Biden said in brief remarks from the White House, flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and his homeland security chief. The 81-year-old Democrat said he had a \"short but good conversation\" on Saturday with Trump, his political nemesis whom he regularly brands as a threat to democracy. Biden said the motives of the shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, remained unknown and urged people not to make assumptions about his \"afflations.\" A day after being rushed from the stage by Secret Service agents with blood streaked across his face, Trump made a similar call. \"In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United,\" Trump said in a statement on his Truth Social network, adding that Americans should not allow \"Evil to win.\" The tycoon added that it was \"God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening\" and that he would \"FEAR NOT.\" Trump's wife Melania called the shooter a \"monster.\" Security failure? Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he fired multiple shots at the rally from a nearby rooftop. A bystander was killed and two spectators critically injured in the worst act of US political violence in decades. Biden said he had ordered a full review of security at the rally, as well as at this week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee where Trump will be crowned the party's presidential nominee. Biden also praised the victim, named as Corey Comperatore, saying the victim \"was protecting his family from the bullets.\" Questions are swirling about the motive of shooter Crooks, whose body was seen in television images on a low roof of a building, near a weapon understood to have been an AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle. Investigators had found explosive material in his car parked near the scene, US media said, while the FBI also searched his house. The shooter, reportedly a registered Republican, was believed to be working alone. His father Matthew Crooks told CNN that he was trying to establish \"what the hell is going on.\" The shocking incident also drew criticism of security at the rally, particularly about how a presidential candidate could be targeted by a gunman around 150 meters away despite a huge Secret Service detail. US Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi rejected \"absolutely false\" claims that it had refused additional protection for Trump ahead of the rally. Shock waves The attempt on Trump's life sent shock waves around the world, but the effects on a tight US presidential race in a deeply divided country are uncertain. Trump's family has already been promoting images of the president raising a defiant fist to the crowd after the shooting. Trump said that he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear\" and heard a \"whizzing sound.\" His narrow escape has sparked conspiracy theories and finger-pointing by Republicans. Possible Trump vice presidential pick J.D. Vance claimed Biden's campaign \"rhetoric\" had \"led directly\" to the attack. US politics have become increasingly hostile, with Trump building his image around inflammatory verbal assaults, and many Democrats expressing fury and disgust at Trump's rise. World leaders expressed outrage over the assassination attempt, with UN chief Antonio Guterres saying he condemned it \"unequivocally.\" The United States has a history of political violence. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 while President Ronald Reagan was shot but survived an assassination attempt in 1981.

Mentally, I’m fine. But … This has got to stop. This has absolutely got to stop,” Kelly, who represents Butler County, toldThe Hill on Sunday. Trump was grazed by a bullet just minutes into his evening rally, sending shockwaves through the nation at a time of deep division in American politics. The shooter, identified by federal authorities as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, killed one person in the crowd, while two others were critically injured, before he was “neutralized” by Secret Service agents. Kelly said neither he nor his wife, grandchildren, and other relatives who went to the rally were harmed. It’s high-time for a “deep dive into what happened to America,” the Pennsylvania Republican continued. “This is certainly not the America that I grew up in, and that my parents had gone through the Great Depression, World War II to make sure we had a future. But that’s what we are right now, as we are right now, like a third-world country.” “It’s not the United States of America anymore. It’s the divided states of America — and too radical,” he added. Kelly insisted that all Americans — regardless of their political views — need to take a hard look at their increasingly divisive rhetoric. “The reality of it all is you have to be responsible for what it is you say, and I think we need to start taking personal responsibility for that,” Kelly said. “It’s not any one party, it’s not any one group of people.” Unlike other members of his party, some of whom jumped to blame President Joe Biden in the immediate aftermath of the violence, Kelly said it was “too early to start pointing fingers.” At his press conference on Sunday afternoon, President Joe Biden similarly warned: “Don’t make assumptions about [the shooter’s] motives and affiliations.” The assassination attempt came two days before Trump was scheduled to attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he is expected to be named the GOP nominee for president. Meanwhile, former Secret Service agents are questioning the current agency’s handling of the shooting. The House Oversight Committee chair announced that his panel was launching a probe into the incident. The motive for the massacre as well as how a rifle-toting man was able to get within such close proximity to a former president is being investigated by authorities. The shooting is being investigated as an attempted assassination and act of domestic terror, the FBI said on Sunday. “The question is, ‘Why did this young man decide that on that day he had to kill a candidate for the presidency?’” Kelly said “I don’t know that the Secret Service could have done anything about any type of law enforcement to do that. That starts in the hearts and minds of men and women.” “It’s time for the whole country — the whole country — to wake up,” Kelly told The Hill. “This has gotten to the point that that’s just no longer tolerable.”","summary":"‘It’s not the United States of America anymore.

Law enforcement officials were working Sunday to learn more about Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, to determine what motivated him to open fire on the rally from a nearby rooftop, killing one spectator, before he was shot dead by the Secret Service. The FBI said Sunday it has not yet identified any threatening writing or social media posts from Crooks, who graduated from high school two years ago and had no past criminal cases against him, according to public court records. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said on social media the upper part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting. Two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. The man killed was Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area who Pennsylvania’s governor says died a “hero” by diving onto his family to protect them. Relatives of Crooks didn’t immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press. His father, Matthew Crooks, told CNN late Saturday that he was trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” but wouldn’t speak about his son until after he talked to law enforcement. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022. In a video of the school’s graduation ceremony posted online, Crooks can be seen crossing the stage to receive his diploma, appearing slight of build and wearing glasses. The school district said it will cooperate fully with investigators. His senior year, Crooks was among several students given an award for math and science, according to a Tribune-Review story at the time. Jason Kohler, who said he attended the same high school but did not share any classes with Crooks, said Crooks was bullied at school and sat alone at lunch time. Other students mocked him for the way he dressed, such as hunting outfits, Kohler said. “He was bullied almost every day,” Kohler told reporters. “He was just a outcast, and you know how kids are nowadays.” Crooks worked at a nursing home as a dietary aid, a job that generally involves food preparation. In a statement provided Sunday to USA TODAY, Marcie Grimm, the administrator of Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation, said she was “shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement.” Grimm added that Crooks had a clean background check when he was hired. Crooks’ political leanings were not immediately clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $15 to a progressive political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021, the day President Joe Biden was sworn into office. Butler County district attorney Richard Goldinger told AP on Sunday that Crooks had been previously unknown to investigators in his county and had not been on their radar. He said the investigation had so far not turned up any evidence that he had coordinated with anyone else in the region. A blockade had been set up Sunday preventing traffic near Crooks’ house, which is in an enclave of modest brick houses in the hills outside blue-collar Pittsburgh and about an hour’s drive from the site of the Trump rally. Police cars were stationed at an intersection near the house and officers were seen walking through the neighborhood. Bomb-making materials were found inside Crooks’ vehicle near the Trump rally and at his home, according to two officials who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. A white Allegheny County Police truck identified as bomb squad pulled up to the home late Sunday morning. Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene of the shooting, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. Investigators believe the weapon was bought by the father at least six months ago, two law enforcement officials told AP. The officials said federal agents were still working to understand when and how Thomas Crooks obtained the gun. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. An AP analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos from the scene of the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by AP shows Crooks wearing a gray t-shirt with a black American flag on the right arm lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds where Trump’s rally was held. The roof where Crooks lay was less than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M-16 rifle. Images of Crooks’ body reviewed by AP shows he appears to have been wearing a T-shirt from Demolition Ranch, a popular YouTube channel with more than 11.6 million subscribers that regularly posts videos that show creator Matt Carriker firing off handguns and assault rifles at targets that include human mannequins and vehicles. Carriker, who lives in Texas, did not respond to a phone message or email on Sunday, but posted a photo of Crooks’ bloody corpse wearing his brand’s T-shirt on social media with the comment “What the hell.” Associated Press journalists Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Julie Smyth and Joshua Bickel in Bethel Park, Michael R. Sisak in New York, Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring Maryland, Mike Balsamo in Chicago and Colleen Long in Washington contributed.","summary":"The 20-year-old nursing-home employee from suburban Pittsburgh who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump was a registered Republican who packed explosives in the vehicle he drove to the campaign rally an hour from his home\n\n\nThe post What we know about the 20-year-old man who tried to assassinate Donald Trump appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2024/07/14/what-we-know-about-the-20-year-old-man-who-tried-to-assassinate-donald-trump/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/YQ2HMTRRVQE6NMRFFCY4V54OQE-669431b3bbda6-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 20:18:02","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":251749280,"title":"Biden makes another brief statement about 'assassination attempt' against Trump","text":"For the second time in less than 24 hours, President Joe Biden has made a statement about the deadly shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania that nearly killed former President Donald Trump. At around 2 p.m. on Sunday, Biden — flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and HHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas — addressed the nation regarding the recent shooting. He insisted that the \"assassination attempt\" against Trump \"is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation — everything.\" Biden insisted that he has continued to authorize 'every resource capability and protective measure necessary' to ensure Trump's safety as part of 'the heightened level of security' to which Trump is already entitled as a former president and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in 2024. As he did at about 8 p.m. the night before, Biden called for American unity. \"Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is [more] important than that right now,\" he said. \"We'll debate; we'll disagree. It's not — that's not going to change,\" Biden continued. \"But it's gonna — we're gonna not lose sight of the fact [of] who we are as Americans.\" As part of his call for unity, Biden claimed he spoke with Trump on Saturday night, just a few hours after the shooting. Biden described their conversation as \"short but good.\" Biden extended his prayers and well-wishes to Trump, his family, and all the injured, as well as the family of the rally attendee who was killed, later identified as Corey Comperatore. Biden characterized Comperatore as a devoted family man who died honorably. \"He was protecting his family from the bullets [that were] being fired,\" Biden said. \"He lost his life. God love him.\" In the hours following the shooting, some noted that in recent months, high-ranking congressional Democrats have attempted to strip Trump of his Secret Service protections as part of the larger lawfare campaign against him — a lawfare campaign reportedly initiated in part by AG Garland, who was standing beside Biden during his speech about the attack on Trump's life. Perhaps to address these criticisms, Biden insisted that he has continued to authorize \"every resource capability and protective measure necessary\" to ensure Trump's safety as part of \"the heightened level of security\" to which Trump is already entitled as a former president and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in 2024. Biden also said he has been kept apprised of the security fortifications already in the works ahead of the Republican National Convention, set to begin on Monday. Finally, Biden cautioned against making \"assumptions\" about the dead suspect, later identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks. \"I urge everyone, everyone: Please, don't make assumptions about his motive or affiliations,\" Biden said. \"Let the FBI do their job and their partner agencies do their job.\" In all, the president spoke for just over three minutes and did not take any questions. He did indicate that he would make further remarks again sometime on Sunday evening, this time from the Oval Office. The entire speech can be seen in the video below. Biden's remarks begin around the 4:35 mark. Like Blaze News? Bypass the censors, sign up for our newsletters, and get stories like this direct to your inbox.

Photographs capturing the aftermath of the attack are already indelibly imprinted on the American consciousness, both for their dramatic content and for their appearance at a critical time in an increasingly polarized political climate for the United States. \"That will be in history books forever,\" said Matthew Lebo, a specialist in U.S. politics and chair of the political science department at Western University in London, Ont. Rhetoric has become increasingly antagonistic in recent decades, he said, culminating in the attempted assassination of Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Video showing Trump touching his ear, then dropping to the ground and being covered by Secret Service agents, has played on a loop across news stations in the United States since the shooting. Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories The FBI early Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa. He was fatally shot by Secret Service agents at the scene. One person attending the rally was killed and two others were critically injured. The shooting, which is the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since an attack on Ronald Reagan in 1981, could be a watershed moment as the political environment in the United States becomes increasingly divisive. \"It’s a sign of fraying democracy,” Lebo said. National surveys on support for political violence in the U.S. have shown a rising tide on both the right and the left, said Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in international security affairs. He has been conducting the surveys since Spring 2021. The most recent survey from June 24 shows 10 per cent of the American public supported the use of violence to prevent Trump from becoming president. Seven per cent supported the use of force to restore Trump to the presidency. Pape said that shows there are volatile wings of the the polarized public that could act out in dangerous ways. “We have to understand that left on its own and without a tremendous extraordinary effort, we are likely to see spirals of violence, escalations of violence, as we head into this election season,” he said. Much of the American public has long been deeply divided about issues that will shape the future of the country. One major problem is how the U.S. will tackle immigration, Pape said, with some Americans wanting it to stop completely and others seeking to embrace it. He said divisions are so drastic that it’s become a “structural problem that's going to lead to lots and lots of anger.\" The rage isn’t connected to any single party. There’s been a rise in threats against both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. Political polarization is also increasing globally. Pape said he briefed the Canadian government about a year ago on the outcomes of his research. He’s also consulted with other governments and policing agencies around the world. His research shows real cause for concern, but Pape said it is not hopeless. Political leaders at all levels must reach out to their supporters to tell them violence is immoral and illegal. \"The anger should go into voting and not violence,” he said. Trump called Sunday for unity and resilience. Joe Biden, who is running against Trump as the presumptive Democratic nominee, said Saturday that “there’s no place in America for this type of violence. He repeated those remarks in a Sunday address to the nation, in which he also called for unity and ordered an independent security review of the leadup to the attack on Trump. Shocked leaders across the political divide largely called for calm, saying violence is never the answer. It’s unclear how the incident will influence voters or campaigns ahead of the November presidential election, Lebo said. The Democrats are likely to lay low this week – but, Lebo said, it was always the plan as they are usually quiet during the Republican National Convention. This year's event is set to take place in Milwaukee starting Monday. Lebo said he has seen some political actors within the parties using the shooting to further galvanize voters’ anger towards their side. “When the political parties use that to further polarization ... I find that particularly dangerous,” he said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 14, 2024.

(AP) — On the heels of an attempt to kill him, former President Donald Trump called Sunday for unity and resilience as shocked leaders across the political divide recoiled from the shooting that left him wounded but “fine.” A former fire chief attending the rally with family was killed, as was the gunman. Two other people were also critically wounded. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee said the upper part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting. His aides said he was in “great spirits” and doing well. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote on his social media site. “Much bleeding took place.” In a subsequent social post Sunday, Trump said “it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening.\" “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,” his post said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Sunday identified the rallygoer who was killed as Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area, and said he “died a hero.” “His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them,” Shapiro said. He declined to discuss the condition of two others who were wounded. The FBI identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, which is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the scene of the shooting. An FBI official said investigators had not yet determined a motive. Secret Service agents fatally shot Crooks. The gunman attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue at a farm show in Butler, the agency said. Not long before shots rang out, rallygoers noticed a man climbing to the roof of a nearby building and warned local police, according to two law enforcement officials. One local police officer climbed to the roof and encountered Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder, and Crooks quickly took a shot toward Trump, and that’s when Secret Service snipers shot him, said the officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. The officials also told AP that bomb-making materials were found inside Crooks' vehicle, and bomb-making materials were found at his home. Officials described the devices as “rudimentary.” Investigators believe the weapon Crooks used was purchased by his father at least six months ago, the law enforcement officials said. Federal agents were still working to understand when and how his son obtained the gun and to gather additional information about Crooks, according to the officials. On Sunday, the FBI said they believe Crooks acted alone and that he was not previously on the bureau’s radar. The agency is combing through his social media feeds and the shooter’s weapons but so far has not found any threatening writing or social media posts, officials said. The shooting is being investigated as an attempted assassination and an act of domestic terrorism, the FBI said. Crooks’ political leanings were not immediately clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $15 to a progressive political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021, the day President Joe Biden was sworn in to office. Authorities told reporters that Crooks was not carrying identification so they were using DNA and other methods to confirm his identity. Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation. The attack was the most serious attempt to kill a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election. And it could alter the tenor and security posture at the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday in Milwaukee. Trump said he will travel to Milwaukee for the GOP convention on Sunday afternoon, and organizers have said the convention will proceed as planned. Trump flew to New Jersey after visiting a local Pennsylvania hospital, landing shortly after midnight at Newark Liberty International Airport. Video posted by an aide showed the former president leaving his private jet flanked by Secret Service agents and heavily armed members of the agency’s counterassault team, an unusually visible show of force by his protective detail. Biden, who is running against Trump, said the two men had a “short but good” conversation Saturday night. Biden cut short a weekend at his beach home in Rehobeth Beach, Delaware, to return to Washington, where he said during an address Sunday afternoon that “there is no place in America for this kind of violence.” “We cannot allow this to happen,\" Biden said, adding that he ordered an independent review of security at the rally. Biden said he would speak again Sunday night from the Oval Office. Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.” Officials said the counterassault team killed the shooter. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other Secret Service agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection. An AP analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos from the scene of the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows the body of a person lying motionless on the roof of a building at AGR International, a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds where Trump’s rally was held. The roof where the person lay was less than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a scaled human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M-16 rifle. The AR-15, like the shooter at the Trump rally had, is the semi-automatic civilian version of the military M-16. The range from which Crooks fired and his clothing led to early speculation that the shooter had military experience. However, all the branches of the military searched their records Sunday and said in response to a query by the AP that they had no records of him serving. Asked at a news conference whether law enforcement did not know the shooter was on the roof until he began firing, Kevin Rojek, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office, responded that “that is our assessment at this time.” “It is surprising” that the gunman was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him, he added. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said officials were engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns and “taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.” Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the gunfire began after 6:10 p.m. As the first pop rang out, Trump said “Oh” and raised his hand to his right ear and looked at it, before quickly crouching to the ground behind his lectern. The people in the stands behind him also crouched as screams rang through the crowd. Someone could be heard near the microphone saying, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents rushed to the stage. They piled atop the former president to shield him with their bodies as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat. Afterward, voices were heard saying, “Shooter’s down” several times, before someone asked, “Are we good to move?” and “Are we clear?” Then someone ordered, “Let’s move.” Trump could be heard on the video saying at least twice, “Let me get my shoes,” with another voice heard saying, “I’ve got you, sir.” Trump got to his feet moments later and could be seen reaching with his right hand toward his face, which was streaked with blood. He then pumped his fist in the air and appeared to mouth the word “fight” twice to his crowd of supporters, prompting loud cheers and then chants of “USA. USA. USA.” His motorcade left the venue moments later. Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. In a statement Sunday, former first lady Melania Trump said that when she saw her husband wounded, “I realized my life, and Barron’s life, were on the brink of devastating change,” referring to their son. She said she was grateful to Secret Service agents and other law enforcement officers, and offered her “sincerest sympathy” to the families of the other victims. When the firing began, “everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew. Everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump's right on stage. As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. Eventually, first responders were able to carry the wounded person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. Reporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring. When it was clear the situation had been contained and Trump would not return to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. Police soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get “out now. This is a live crime scene.” The perils of campaigning took on a new urgency after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump’s. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008. Presidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security, and Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate. Republican Rep. Mike Kelly, who represents the area where the shooting occurred, attended the rally with his wife and grandchildren and was just behind Trump when he was wounded. Kelly said he was “in a state of bewilderment of how and what has happened to the United States of America.” “I just wish people — tone it down,” he said. “Quit trying to find, to blame somebody. The blame lies somewhere in the psyche of America.” ___ Colvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington. Tucker reported from Westport, Connecticut.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro confirmed Sunday that Corey Comperatore, 50, had died a “hero,\" using his body as a shield to protect both his wife and daughter from the bullets. “His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them,” Shapiro said. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden extended their “deepest condolences” to Comperatore's family. “He was a father. He was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired and he lost his life, God love him. We’re also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured,\" Biden said. At least two other people were injured during the attempt to kill Trump at Saturday's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Those two have been identified as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. Both were listed in stable condition as of Sunday. The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter, who attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue. The former president was showing off a chart of border-crossing numbers when at least five shots were fired. Trump was seen holding his ear and got down on the ground. Agents quickly created a shield around him. When he stood, his face bloodied, he pumped his fist to cheering supporters Randy Reamer, president of the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, called Comperatore “a stand-up guy” and “a true brother of the fire service.” He said Comperatore served as chief of the company for about three years but was also a life member, meaning he had served for more than 20 years. “Just a great all-around guy, always willing to help someone out,” Reamer said of Comperatore. “He definitely stood up for what he believed in, never backed down to anyone. … He was a really good guy.” A crew was power-washing the front of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company on Sunday with plans to install memorial drapery to honor the slain former chief. Assistant Chief Ricky Heasley of Sarver, who knew him for more than a decade, remembered him as very outgoing and full of life. “He never had a bad word,” Heasley said. A GoFundMe launched to support Comperatore’s family had already surpassed more than $180,000 in donations as of Sunday.","summary":"The former fire chief who was killed at a Pennsylvania rally for Donald Trump spent his final moments diving in front of his family to protect them from gunfire that rang out Saturday during an assassination attempt against the former president.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has expressed his sorrow for the victims, and has also expressed his gratitude for Trump’s safety, writing on X that the former president showed “tremendous grace and courage under literal fire.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also issued his own statement regarding Trump’s failed assassination, calling the attempt at Trump’s life both “an attack on America” and “an attack on democracy.” “On behalf of myself, my family, the government and people of Israel, we wish President Trump a speedy recovery, continued good health, and continued strength,” Netanyahu said in a video posted to X. “Biden tells us to trust the bureaucracy to investigate the assassin’s motive.

Speaking from the Roosevelt Room at the White House, the president said the FBI is still conducting its investigation, which is still in its early stages, and urged people not to make assumptions. “We don’t yet have any information about the motive of the shooter. We know who he is. I urge everyone, everyone, please don’t make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,” the president said. “I’ve instructed that this investigation be thorough and swift, and the investigators will have every resource they need to get this done.” Authorities earlier identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the deceased shooter. The assailant shot multiple times from an elevated position near the rally site, according to the Secret Service, before he was killed by Secret Service agents. President Biden said the assassination attempt was “contrary to everything we stand for as a nation.” “It’s not who we are as a nation, it’s not America, and we cannot allow this to happen,” he said, while calling for unity. The president also directed the Secret Service to review all security measures for the Republican National Convention, which begins on July 15 in Milwaukee. The former president is due to be nominated as Republican presidential candidate on Thursday. President Biden said he will make further remarks during a speech tonight from the Oval Office. The president has postponed his trip to Austin, Texas, on Monday where he was scheduled to deliver remarks for the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. In addition, Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her planned campaign trip to South Florida on Sunday. President Biden said that he spoke with his predecessor last night after the incident, describing the call as “a short, but good conversation.” “I’m sincerely grateful that he’s doing well and recovering,” he said. The president also offered his condolences to the family of the man who was killed. According to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Mr. Comperatore was killed while diving on his family to protect them. “He was a father, he was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired,” the president said. “We must unite as one nation to demonstrate who we are,” he added.

Retired fire chief Corey Comperatore has meanwhile been identified as the man killed when a gunman opened fire from a rooftop near Mr Trump's campaign rally. His family said he died while shielding his daughters from the gunfire at the event, in Pennsylvania on Saturday afternoon, local time. Two other attendees remain critically injured. Mr Trump was shot in the ear and rushed offstage with blood on his face, but his campaign quickly assured the public he was fine. The former president has since used social media to thank wellwishers, saying: \"It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening.\" \"We will fear not, but instead remain resilient in our faith and defiant in the face of wickedness,\" Mr Trump wrote. FBI investigators are continuing to look into the background of Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who they've identified as the \"subject involved\". Explosives were found in Crooks's car, and suspected explosives were found at his home, multiple US media outlets are reporting, citing law enforcement sources. Authorities said Crooks climbed onto a nearby rooftop and shot at the former president from outside the venue, in Butler, about 50 kilometres north of Pittsburgh. Witnesses later said they tried to warn police of a gunman on the roof. Loading... An AR-style rifle, a type of gun commonly used in mass shooting in the US, was recovered from the scene, sources told AP. Voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican. But he had also made a $US15 donation to a Democrat-supporting political action committee in 2021, according to a Federal Election Commission filing. Mr Trump's wife, Melania Trump, described him as a \"monster who recognised my husband as an inhuman political machine\". \"America, the fabric of our gentle nation is tattered,\" she said in a statement. \"But our courage and common sense must ascend and bring us back together as one.\" Mr Comperatore's family has paid tribute to the man they say died a hero. \"His wife and girls just lived through the unthinkable and unimaginable,\" sister Dawn Comperatore Schafer posted to Facebook. \"My baby brother just turned 50 and had so much life left to experience.\" Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, described Mr Comperatore as a \"girl dad\" who loved his community and attended church every Sunday. He said he'd been excited to attend the rally as an avid Trump supporter. \"This is a moment where all leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity,\" Mr Shapiro told a press conference. \"All leaders need to take down the temperature and rise above the hateful rhetoric that exists and search for a better, brighter future for this nation.\" US President Joe Biden said he and Vice-President Kamala Harris had been again briefed by the Homeland Security team. He said the shooter's motive remained unknown. \"I urge everyone, everyone, please don't make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,\" Mr Biden said. \"Let the FBI do their job, and their partner agencies do their job.\" The president echoed earlier calls for unity. \"Unity. We’ll debate and we’ll disagree, that’s not going to change. But we’ll not lose sight of who we are as Americans.\" He said he would give a longer address from the Oval Office at 8pm, local time (10am AEST). The shooting happened as Republicans from across the country were preparing to gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the party's national convention. The convention, which begins on Monday, local time, will go ahead as planned. Mr Trump is scheduled to address it on Thursday. His yet-to-be-named running mate is also due to speak at the convention during the week.","summary":"Former president Donald Trump uses social media to thank wellwishers, saying: \"It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening.\" ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-15/trump-assassination-attempt-pennsylvania-reaction/104097080","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8a64f705461ffc107c878be0f9f46065?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=999&cropW=1776&xPos=0&yPos=93&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 19:38:37","author":"Brad Ryan","authors":["Brad Ryan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":251746350,"title":"How Trump's Assassination Attempt May Change Republican National Convention","text":"In the aftermath of Saturday evening's assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Republican National Convention (RNC), set to begin tomorrow, is facing potential changes.The RNC, scheduled to run from Monday, July 15 through Thursday, July 18, is expected to host upwards of 50,000 guests, including delegates who will nominate Trump as the GOP's presidential candidate. This will be Trump's third nomination, following his 2016, 2020, and 2024 campaign runs.The former president was shot on stage during his rally on Saturday evening, with a bullet hitting the upper part of his right ear. Two rally attendees were critically injured, and one spectator, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore, died. The 20-year-old shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, is deceased after being neutralized by security.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has classified the shooting as an assassination attempt. The FBI is the lead agency on the investigation, working alongside the Secret Service and local law enforcement.Trump Will Attend the RNCTrump's top 2024 campaign strategists, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, have confirmed in a memo to staffers that the former president is set to accept the official nomination at the RNC, which will \"continue as planned.\" They called him \"the brave and fearless leader of our Party.\"In two Truth Social posts on Sunday, Trump confirmed his attendance at the RNC, writing that while he initially planned to delay his arrival due to the shooting, he decided he \"cannot allow\" a potential assassin to force him to change his plans. Trump added that he'd be leaving for Milwaukee Sunday afternoon as planned.He is still expected to announce his running mate at the convention.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign spokesperson for comment via email on Sunday.Tone and Security Measures Likely to ChangeWhile the convention \"won't change structurally\" in terms of the political announcements and nominations, the overall tone of the convention will be different, reporter Garrett Haake said on NBC News' Meet the Press on Sunday.After speaking with senior officials organizing the event, Haake said, \"The events of last night will change the tone and tenure of this convention, we will see more emotional resonance.\"He also noted that it's likely there will be more rhetoric along the lines of Senator Lindsey Graham's \"allusions to Trump as a Teddy Roosevelt-like figure.\" On Sunday morning, the South Carolina Republican senator appeared on Meet the Press and said that Trump is \"the toughest guy, I think, I ever met. He's the modern version of Teddy Roosevelt.\"On TODAY on Sunday, NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard said \"this is not the normal aura around a convention, typically it's a celebratory event.\" He added that the reception for thousands of delegates last night was cancelled in light of the incident.Brian Schimming, Wisconsin Republican Party chair, told local news station WISN-TV that he doesn't foresee \"massive changes\" to the convention.Newsweek has sent an email to Schimming for comment Sunday afternoon.Security will be a top issue at the convention and last night's shooting is likely to enhance measures.In a Sunday afternoon address to the nation, President Joe Biden said he ordered the head of the Secret Service to \"review all security measures, all security measures, for the Republican National Convention.\"On Sunday morning, RNC chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Sunday host Shannon Bream, \"In terms of the physical sense of the arena set, the security is here, and we feel very comfortable that we're working with the Secret Service; we're working with 40 different law enforcement agencies in terms of what that security is going to look like.\"Newsweek reached out to the Milwaukee Police Department and the RNC for comment via email on Sunday.The event is not open to the public, only politicians, delegates, and pre-approved, official guests are allowed inside.Hillyard, currently in Milwaukee, reported that the Secret Service initiated a security sweep of the surrounding blocks last night, \"effectively creating a lockdown situation that began at sunrise this morning.\"Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday: \"My staff and I are in contact with those coordinating security planning for the RNC and will continue to be in close communication as we learn more about this situation.\"As of Sunday afternoon, it is unknown how the schedule of talks at the RNC may change. The RNC has not posted any official statements of changes.There's speculation, however, that political violence will be a topic of many of the convention's speeches.\"I want to make sure that we have a safe convention for everybody,\" Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said on Sunday on WKOW 27's Capital City Sunday. He added that this means supporting the RNC attendees and those who are protesting against the RNC.The Coalition to March on the RNC is still set to take place on Monday at 12 p.m. CST.","summary":"In the wake of an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the upcoming RNC in Milwaukee may see some changes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-trumps-assassination-attempt-may-change-republican-national-convention-1924974","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2427895/rnc-wisconsin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 19:37:32","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.088},{"id":251746352,"title":"We Have to Love Our Country More Than Our Right to Be Offended | Opinion","text":"America has always been a nation of sharp divides and passionate politics. When you live in a country as large and diverse as ours, bright dividing political lines are inevitable. Your leadership matters. The stakes are always high. But we as a nation have been playing a very dangerous game for a long time, and it almost led to the assassination of a leading presidential candidate. That game is dehumanization.At some point, our political debates were no longer about issues, policies and competing visions for the country. They became exercises in demonization. The politics of personal destruction went from being a rarity to commonplace. Why would anyone be surprised at an attempt on former President Trump's life when he's been compared to Hitler and demonized as a \"threat to democracy\" for nearly a decade? Think about it. Trump and his supporters have been attacked as threats to the very fabric of our nation. It was only a matter of time before someone believed that rhetoric.We have lost the art of being able to disagree without demonizing one another. Our political default is to go into the gutter. And political leaders on both sides of the aisle have been perpetrators and victims of it. When you call your political opponent Hitler or accuse someone of committing genocide (as some on the far Left do with the tasteless \"Genocide Joe\" attack on President Biden), you go down a road that eventually only leads to one outcome.We cannot allow political differences, even passionate ones, to strip away our sense of humanity. When politics matters more than the people, you've lost the point. Politics is not supposed to be about the pursuit of power for power's sake. It should be about serving the people, and asking for power because you believe that your vision is in the best interest of the country.By Divine Providence, America averted disaster yesterday. This nation was centimeters away from completely falling apart. Had the attempt on former President Trump's life been successful, it would've served for millions of people—rightly or wrongly—as an unmistakable data point that the battle at the ballot box was no longer sufficient. And then what? No matter who you support in this election, does any of us really want to see a country where half of its citizens lose faith in this entire experiment? Where would we go from there?My friend and political commentator Kira Davis often says that it's hard for the country to unite because \"nobody wants to give up their right to be offended.\" The Right has plenty of examples of hateful rhetoric directed towards them by the Left and vice versa. But at some point we all have to ask ourselves, what do we love more—this country or our right to be offended?Everyone shares some of the blame in this. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, progressives, the media, everyone. We as a collective have forgotten that people matter more than politics. Donald Trump is not just a billionaire or the former president. He's a human being, with a wife and a family.Dehumanization is so dangerous because it serves as a conscience blocker. It allows people to do heinous things without remorse because the volume of their ideology is so loud that it drowns out the conviction of the still, small voice inside of you. When you dehumanize people, this is the natural outcome.After 9/11, this country came together. We remembered that what unites us is far more important than what divides us. And that lasted, for a little while. Eventually those feelings went away and we stopped looking at each other as fellow Americans. We started looking at each other as mortal enemies again. The assassination attempt on former President Trump is another incident that has shaken the nation. People are talking once again about the need to unify and turn the temperature down. Do we mean it? Or will this feeling also fade away as time goes on?As a proud American who is also the descendent of slaves, I often say that we may have come here on different ships, but we are all now in the same boat. The success or failure of this American experiment will have a profound impact on all of our lives. We have another chance to get it right. Do it before it's too late. Disagree passionately, but stop the dehumanization.Darvio Morrow is CEO of the FCB Radio Network and co-host of The Outlaws Radio Show.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"As a proud American who is also the descendent of slaves, I often say that we may have come here on different ships, but we are all now in the same boat.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/we-have-love-our-country-more-our-right-offended-opinion-1925019","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2427941/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 19:36:14","author":"Darvio Morrow","authors":["Darvio Morrow"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":251746400,"title":"BJP Accuses Rahul of Encouraging Violence Against Modi","text":"New Delhi: The BJP on Sunday accused Rahul Gandhi of encouraging violence against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as it targeted the Leader of the Opposition following the assassination attempt on former US president Donald Trump.These are insincere words, BJP’s IT department head Amit Malviya said of Gandhi’s condemnation of the attack on Trump.He said on X, “Third Time Fail Rahul Gandhi has often encouraged and justified violence against Prime Minister Modi, who he has lost election to, several times now. How can India ever forget how Punjab Police, then under the Congress, deliberately compromised PM’s security, when his convoy was left stranded on a flyover.”Malviya, who posted some past comments of the Congress leader, added that Gandhi has used similar rhetoric against Modi, such as calling him a “dictator”, that Trump’s critics like Democrat leader and US President Joe Biden have.Following the assassination attempt, many of Trump’s supporters have alleged that his demonisation by his rivals has created an atmosphere of hate against him.Malviya said Trump’s critics have made the argument that democracy is in danger from him, and likened this to India’s opposition’s “Constitution is in danger” pitch against Modi.Indian democracy survived the global Left’s assault and Modi is back for a third term, Malviya said.He said, “Caste, like race in America, was weaponised to drive a wedge in Indian society. Demonising opponents and calling them dictator is also not a coincidence. In fact, the global money bag, with dangerous ideas, used the term for the first time to describe democratically elected powerful world leaders, who he couldn't control.”But Gandhi, who sought foreign intervention in India's elections, failed to deliver, he alleged.","summary":"","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/bjp-accuses-rahul-of-encouraging-violence-against-modi-1810324","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/07/14/1824068-amitmalviya.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 19:34:38","author":"PTI","authors":["PTI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.315}]}
