Some outlets, however, failed the test miserably. Take these headlines, for example, in the immediate aftermath: CNN: “Secret Service Rushes Trump Off Stage After He Falls at Rally” Associated Press: “Donald Trump Has Been Escorted Off The Stage During A Rally After Loud Noises Ring Out In The Crowd” The New York Times: “Trump Hurt, But Safe, After A Shooting” Forbes: “Will Surviving Gunfire Be Donald Trump’s Next Appeal To Black Voters?” Politico: “In wake of the rally shooting, GOP officials have been quick to blame Democrats for demonizing Trump” There’s more, but you get the idea. Needless to say, it was abundantly clear that Trump had been shot once he was brought to his feet by Secret Service agents about one minute after being hit. Shots could be heard before he crouched down to take cover. His visibly injured ear had splashed bright red blood across his face that was clear to see, even at a distance. Yet we had CNN initially reporting he had fallen? How about the Times and Politico calling this “a shooting” instead of an assassination attempt? How about Forbes wondering, just hours after the attack, if it would make Trump more appealing to black voters? And Politico, scolding Republicans for seizing and pouncing on Democrats, angry that they and their allies in the media have referred to Trump as Hitler for eight years? Margaret Brennan of CBS News, the former home of Walter Cronkite, even managed to victim-blame Trump for nearly getting killed, after reading a statement from the former president thanking the Secret Service and describing what had happened. “I did notice there was no call for lowering the temperature, condemning all political violence, and really trying to signal to his supporters as well, not to retaliate or to have any kind of escalation here,” was Brennan’s immediate reaction. There are no words. It somehow got worse over on ABC News Sunday morning during a conversation between George Stephanopoulos and Martha Raddatz, who fancy themselves as serious journalists. “President Trump and his supporters have contributed to this violent rhetoric as well,” Stephanopoulos, Bill Clinton’s former attack dog, argued. “Absolutely, George,” Raddatz concurred. “And let’s remember Jan. 6,” she added. Many of us will recall forever the iconic moment when a bloodied Trump, surrounded by his Secret Service detail, pumped his fist at the crowd and urged them to “Fight. Fight. Fight.” It was emblematic of Trump’s toughness and determination and defiance, even after taking a bullet to the ear just one minute earlier. But on CNN, this was seen as a big no-no, even as the horrific scene was unfolding. “That’s not the message that we want to being sending right now,” CNN’s Jamie Gangel chided the wounded candidate. “We want to tamp it down.” Yes: The network that has endlessly attacked Trump as a racist, fascist demagogue seeking to destroy democracy was lecturing him just seconds after he was a millimeter away from being murdered. For these outlets, there’s no coming back from this. Their rhetoric has been building for years without any accountability. Media figures’ most hyperbolic and personal and dishonest attacks on Trump have not only cost them no consequences, but have probably brought them raises and promotions with each new contract. As for President Biden and his speechwriters, they have helped foment this deadly environment. Here’s what the president said on July 8: “We’re done talking about the debate, it’s time to put Trump in a bullseye.” Follow The Post’s latest stories on the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump: Trump says he ‘felt the bullet ripping through my skin’ in first statement since assassination attempt Donald Trump urges the nation to not let ‘evil win’ and ‘fear not’ after shooting Gunman behind attempted assassination on Trump had head blown off by Secret Service, sources say; rally-goer killed Trump shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was loner ‘relentlessly’ bullied in high school: classmate How Trump’s split-second head turn may have saved his life from assassin’s bullet Ex-volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore ID’d as Trump sniper victim, shielded his daughter from assassin’s bullets Search for Trump shooter’s motive delayed by explosives found in home and car: sources Keep up to date on updates with the Post’s live blog on the assassination attempt on Trump Last year, Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) expressed a similar sentiment when he spoke to Jen Paski on MSNBC. “That man [Trump] cannot see public office again,” Goldman said. “He has to be eliminated.” Psaki — Biden’s former press secretary — offered no pushback. Any questions? A former president, likely to be the next president, was shot on Saturday. It’s a miracle he survived the attempt. What won’t survive is any last shred of credibility many in our media ever had.

But the trades were expected to take deeper hold, with Trump galvanizing supporters and drawing sympathy by exhibiting defiant resilience after being shot in the ear on stage at a Pennsylvania rally. The dollar — which would gain if loose fiscal policy kept bond yields elevated — started to move higher against most peers early in Asia trading, with the Mexico peso leading the slide, weakening 0.3%. Bitcoin rose above $60,000, potentially reflecting Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, while futures on the S&P 500 Index for September rose 0.1% at 06:05 p.m. in New York. “For us, the news does reinforce that Trump’s the frontrunner,” said Mark McCormick, global head of foreign-exchange and emerging-market strategy at Toronto Dominion Bank. “We remain US dollar bulls for the second half and early 2025.” The one caveat to all this is that the emergence of political violence may deepen concern about instability in the US and push investors into haven assets, potentially overshadowing some of the market positioning that has already taken place in the run-up to the election. While future contracts on 10-year Treasury notes for September showed declines in early Asia trading, US government bonds tend to rally when investors seek temporary safety, so that may distort the Trump trade in the Treasuries market, which hinges on wagering that the yield curve will steepen as long-term bonds underperform on anticipation that Trump’s fiscal and trade policies will fan inflation pressures. Moreover, some investors may want to book early gains or be wary of getting deeper into an already crowded position. “Political risk is binary and hard to hedge, and uncertainty was high as it is with the close nature of the race,” said Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Investment Management. “This adds to volatility. I think it further increases the chance of a Republican sweep,” she said, adding that “could put steepening pressure on the curve.” While traders generally don’t expect Trump’s assassination attempt to derail the stock-market trajectory in the long run, a pick-up in near-term price swings is likely. The market has already been contending with speculation that valuations have become too stretched, given the boom in artificial-intelligence stocks and the risks posed by elevated interest rates and political uncertainty. But investors have also been anticipating that bank, health-care and oil-industry stocks would benefit from a Trump victory. “The attack will boost volatility,” said David Mazza, CEO at Roundhill Investments, predicting investors could seek temporary safety in defensive stocks like mega-cap companies. He said it “also adds support for stocks that do well in a steepening yield curve, especially financials.” The early reaction echoes what was seen after the first presidential debate in late June, when Biden’s weak performance was seen as fueling Trump’s election odds. The dollar advanced during that event, and investors soon began embracing a wager that involves buying shorter-maturity notes and selling longer-term ones — known as a steepener trade. That trade has been paying off, with the 30-year Treasury yields jumping to nearly 5 basis points below 2-year ones from around 37 basis points below ahead of the debate. “If the market sense that Trump’s chances to win are higher than they were on Friday – then we would expect the back end of the bond market to sell off in the manner we saw in the immediate aftermath of the debate,” Michael Purves, CEO and founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, wrote in an email. While bond traders have been pricing in at least two interest-rate reductions in 2024, a major boost in Trump’s election odds could push the Federal Reserve toward staying on hold for longer, according to Purves. “Trump’s stated policies are (at least now) more inflationary than Biden’s,” he wrote, “and we think the Fed will want to accumulate as much dry power as possible.”","summary":"Investors have also been anticipating that bank, health-care and oil-industry stocks would benefit from a Trump victory.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/14/donald-trump-stock-market-trade-dollar-bonds-bitcoin-republican-election-sweep/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2161632822-e1720999203965.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 23:31:37","author":"Bloomberg,Elena Popina,Sydney Maki","authors":["Bloomberg","Elena Popina","Sydney Maki"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":251758774,"title":"WATCH LIVE: Biden addresses nation after apparent assassination attempt on Trump","text":"President Joe Biden is speaking to the nation after presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was shot during one of his rallies on Saturday.

Speaking with the Herald Sunday, former New York City and Boston Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said that the apparent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump could have pushed political tempers high enough to boil over into the streets of American cities, and that it’s only luck that spared the 45th President and the U.S. itself from a massive security failure and potential doom. “There was a significant security failure at this event. Mr. Trump and the country both dodged a fatal bullet. If, God forbid, he had been killed, there would have been absolute chaos,” Bratton said. Trump, who according to his own social media postings is doing well after he was apparently struck in the ear by a rifle round fired by the deceased 20-year-old would-be assassin, is already under heightened Secret Service protection, Bratton said. It’s a wonder then, the former law enforcement official said, that the roof from which the shooter is said to have fired his shots was not occupied by a member of the Secret Service or a local law enforcement officer. “I think its becoming very clear that security for this event was deficient. The fact there was a near-successful attempt on the former president’s life, it’s going to raise all kinds of questions going forward,” he said. In the meantime, there is going to be a “fog of confusion” surrounding Saturday’s shooting, which will only resolve through the course of an investigation, Bratton said. “The first story is never the last story,” he said. Even the best laid security plans are fallible, Bratton said, and the Secret Service deserves praise for how quickly they neutralized the danger to the former President, but they’ll still need to answer for their lapse leading up to the event, he said. It’s possible a threat, or “signal” from the shooting suspect was missed by some law enforcement agency somewhere, Bratton said. “It was a great response after the fact — but how did it get to the fact?” Bratton said. President Joe Biden, speaking from the White House alongside Attorney General Merrick Garland, said that the FBI will lead the investigation into the shooting and that the Secret Service has been instructed to consider additional precautions around the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday. The President asked the public not to rush to assumptions and to let law enforcement officials do their work. “We don’t yet have any information about the motive of the shooter. We know who he is. I urge everyone — everyone, please, don’t make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,” he said. “I’ve instructed that this investigation be thorough and swift. And the investigators will have every resource they need to get this done.” Biden, who said he spoke with Trump by phone shortly after the shooting, also said he’s ordered an “independent review” of what occurred Saturday, and promised to release the results of the inquiry to the public. In a statement Sunday, the FBI said that “this remains an active and ongoing investigation, and anyone with information that may assist with the investigation is encouraged to submit photos or videos online at fbi.gov/butler or call 1-800-CALL-FBI.” Law enforcement officials have already received thousands of tips, and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said that online rhetoric has “ticked up” since the shooting. The Bureau has identified Bethel Park, Pennsylvania resident Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, “as the subject involved in the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump on July 13, in Butler, Pennsylvania.” Early indications are that the shooter acted alone, according to the FBI. U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, called the shooting an “unthinkable” and “unfathomable” sort of “security failure.” “How is it that someone could get on a roof with a superior position, with a weapon, and attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump?” he asked. Bratton said that if he were advising the former President on matters of security he would be encouraged to stop holding outdoor events for now. “Open events are a nightmare, they are a nightmare to try and secure,” he said. Part of the problem with security on Saturday may be attributed to staffing at the agency tasked with protecting Presidents and former Presidents, Bratton said. With both Trump and Biden campaigning across the country in the lead up to November’s general election, the Secret Service is undoubtedly “spread a little thin,” he said, and that means they have to rely more and more on local law enforcement, who may not have the staffing or funding to secure a national security level event. People should view this event as a “wake up call,” the former police commissioner said. “This is a tragic event. It reminds people just how divided a country we are and the lengths that some people will go to vent their anger, their frustration, their hostility. The idea that a 20-year-old man would attempt to assassinate a potential future president reflects where we are,” Bratton said. “Let’s all take a step back and try to calm down,” he said.","summary":"“There was a significant security failure at this event.

That’s when it hit like really hard. That’s when you felt it,” she said. “That’s when you were like, ‘Oh, my God, this could have ended up totally different way,’ right? That’s what blew me away more than anything.” White said she watched officials carry the dead body off the scene, saying, “I did see that limp leg in the in the denim jeans, and that’s something I can’t scrub from my mind in my head.” Wadzita said that he didn’t know whether there were one or multiple shooters and that officers kept telling rallygoers to get down and stay down. There was confusion when Trump got back up, he said, because everyone got back up, but they were told to get down again. It’s not lost on Wadzita that had the shooter fired from a different angle, they could have been hit. “We would have been in the firing zone, and that’s just, like, you feel disconnected from that for a little bit,” he said. Yesterday’s was White’s 32nd Trump rally, and she said that despite what transpired, she’ll be back. “You bet I will,” she said. “It’s not anything different than walking across the street, you know, you could get hit by a car, right? But if you’re doing something you love and you like to do, place you want to be, something happens, it happens.” But she’s still in disbelief: “I can’t believe somebody did this. I can’t believe somebody would try to take out a president, a former president, of the United States. Whether it’s Joe Biden or Trump, I don’t think it’s right.” Both Wadzita and White ultimately hope good comes from the bad and that the assassination attempt will bring Americans together. “It’s all about the ballot. It’s all about doing your voting,” White said. “Never violence, always in peace.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRenee White and Tim Wadzita were sitting &#8220;dead center&#8221; right behind Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FBI looking into domestic terrorism in possible assassination plot first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/fbi-looking-into-domestic-terrorism-in-possible-assassination-plot/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-07/240713-donald-trump-rally-violence-5-se-757p-4dedf7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 23:25:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.508},{"id":251758234,"title":"Trump fundraises off assassination attempt as Biden suspends campaign ads in aftermath of rally shooting","text":"Donald Trump’s campaign has begun soliciting donations in the wake of his attempted assassination even as Joe Biden’s campaign halted all TV ads while the nation reels from the attack at a rally in rural Pennsylvania. One day after a bullet grazed Trump’s ear in the shooting that left one spectator dead, his campaign sent at least two text message-based fundraising appeals which contain links to WinRed, the GOP-affiliated fundraising platform run by the ex-president’s allies. The page contains an image of Trump raising his fist while wearing one of his signature campaign hats, an American flag flying above. It appears deliberately meant to echo the now-famous photograph, of the bloodied ex-president striking a defiant pose as he was rushed off by his Secret Service detail, taken by Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci moments after the shooting. The Independent reviewed two separate texts sent out by the Trump campaign using its texting “short code,” 88022. One of the messages read: “From Trump: FEAR NOT ... It is more important than ever that we stand UNITED,” while the other bore the message “NEVER SURRENDER.” Both contained links to Trump’s WinRed page. A third text, sent at 5.24pm (Eastern Time) on Sunday, repeated the “fear not” message and reported that Trump would be speaking as planned at the Republican National Convention this week. It also included a link to the same campaign fundraising page. At the same time, the Biden re-election effort has “paused all outbound communications” in the aftermath of the shooting, and is “working to pull down our television ads as quickly as possible,” a campaign official told Reuters. Trump was shot at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old who lived in the Pittsburgh suburbs. He squeezed off a number of rounds from an AR-15 assault-style rifle that authorities say was purchased legally by his father, a licensed behavioral counselor. However, investigators said they were not yet sure if Crooks’ dad knew he had taken the gun, or if he took it without permission. Crooks, who was not attending the Trump rally, posted up on a nearby rooftop, which was just outside the secure perimeter set up by the Secret Service. Still, the building was “within the area of vulnerabilities, so a lot of questions remain unanswered,” former Secret Service Special Agent Jonathan Wackrow told The Independent. One of the rounds grazed Trump’s right ear; the former president was not seriously injured. Still, the rally descended into chaos as terrified attendees hit the deck and a bloodied Trump was hustled offstage by his Secret Service detail. Secret Service snipers quickly “neutralized” Crooks, whose body could be seen on bystander video, lying prone on the roof from which he fired at least eight shots. Crooks was dressed in gray camouflage and had explosives in his car, according to the FBI, which is heading up the investigation. Trump was taken to a local medical center and quickly released, then flew to New Jersey in advance of the RNC, which kicks off in Milwaukee on Monday. The shooting was emblamatic of “a security breakdown from start to finish,” former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker said in an appearance on Fox News. Moments after being shot, Trump pumped his fist to the crowd and mouthed the words, “Fight! Fight! Fight!” This, Swecker argued, never should have happened. “[H]e should have been off that stage, in that car, and out of there in seconds,” he said. “And it was a lifetime. If there had been a second shooter, they would have taken him out… it was almost a kill-shot as it was… So this breaks every rule of the Secret Service’s protocol, and just executive protection in general.” One rally attendee was killed in the shooting, and two others suffered critical injuries, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. A day after the violent episode, retired FBI Supervisory Special Agent Dennis Franks told The Independent he was still trying to wrap his head around what went down at the rally. “How did this happen? How did they let it happen?” he asked. “It’s usually something [the Secret Service] has under control.”","summary":"‘NEVER SURRENDER’ reads one Trump campaign emails sent to potential donors a day after the former president was shot in the ear","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-assassination-attempt-shooting-biden-b2579703.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/14/18/13-c1d27d61de2e457d975b47a815696406.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ALMufbsP-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 23:15:05","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.015},{"id":251758074,"title":"Shawn Steel: What to expect at the Republican National Convention","text":"Donald J. Trump’s triumph over a cowardly assassination attempt has inspired the country. The Republican National Convention is no longer a political event. Rather, it is a moment for national unity in the face of despicable violence. Republicans kickoff the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on July 15th more energized and enthusiastic than at any political convention in American history. Never before in American history has a former President entered a political convention with a literal target on his back. Republicans are rallying behind our strong and brave once and future Commander-in-Chief. In the face of direct imminent danger, President Donald J. Trump stood tall and demanded that America, “Fight. Fight. Fight.” Republicans are excited, united, and ready for President Trump’s historic comeback victory in November. Here’s what to expect from the 2024 Republican National Convention: 1. Trademark Trump High-Energy & Showstopper Acceptance Speech No one can silence President Trump. Not even a deranged leftist assassin. Donald J. Trump will bring his trademark high-energy to the Fiserv Forum and deliver a showstopper acceptance speech Thursday night. He’s an exceptional, natural speaker who thrives from the energy and enthusiasm of a friendly crowd. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley and Co-Chair Lara Trump also made the savvy decision to enlist Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, known for rallying a large crowd, as Trump’s warmup act. 2. Republicans Energized, Enthusiastic and United In contrast to the divided Democrats, there’s no division within the Grand Ole Party. This is Trump’s convention through and through. The RNC Platform Committee overwhelmingly approved an updated and more concise party platform that focuses on the singular mission of “Making America Great Again.” Republican delegates of every ideological persuasion understand that the party’s trimmed-down platform is the most effective way to highlight the core failures of the Biden-Harris administration. 3. Building Suspense with Trump’s Vice Presidential Pick President Trump knows how to build suspense, and he’s done so again with the mystery surrounding his Vice-Presidential pick. In recent interviews, President Trump has teased that his Veep selection could come at any time, including as late as Wednesday night, when the Vice Presidential nominee is slated to address delegates. Whether he picks Ohio Senator J.D. Vance; North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, or another surprise candidate, expect RNC delegates to be salivating for the VP debate against Vice President Kamala Harris scheduled for Lafayette College. 4. Spotlight on 5 Key States: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona Before Biden’s implosion, the 2024 Biden-Trump rematch was projected to come down to 71 electoral votes in five key states: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. Biden won each of these five states in 2020 by less than 3 percent of the vote. President Trump can return to the White House by adding any three of these five states to his electoral coalition. The Trump campaign is focusing on these five battleground states and, under Chris LaCivita’s leadership, has deployed its top operatives to ensure the most effective ground operation capable of a historic Get Out The Vote campaign. Expect state delegations from these states to receive prominent placement and attention in Milwaukee. 5. Economy, Crime & Immigration It’s about the economy. It’s about crime. It’s about the border. The convention will spotlight the tragic human suffering caused by the dangerous policies of President Joe Biden from family members of those killed by violent gang members that have entered the country illegally through our southern border.

Oh, it’ll still stick to planned nightly themes: Make America Wealthy (Mon.) /Safe (Tues.) / Strong (Weds.) / Great (Thu.) Once Again — but the tone will be more restrained and sober, with calls for national unity and political sanity far more pronounced. Expect to hear a lot of echoes of former First Lady Melania Trump’s heartfelt letter Sunday morning about the “monster” who saw “my husband as an inhuman political machine.” And: “Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy, and political games are inferior to love. Our personal, structural, and life commitment — until death — is at serious risk. Political concepts are simple when compared to us, human beings.” More: “Ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realize this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships again.” All the planned speakers are reworking their remarks, and note that Trump’s last GOP rival standing, Nikki Haley, was added to the list on Sunday. The convention will still feature plenty of tough talk, but it was already going to focus on policy — because that’s the center of Trump’s case to replace President Joe Biden. It’s Biden’s economic policies that have working Americans losing ground, his party’s approach to crime that’s produced carnage in our cities, his foreign policies that have wars ablaze in Europe and the Middle East and threatening in the Pacific. Trump’s own speech Thursday night was already going to be different from his past convention addresses: His time in “exile” has left him more sober and disciplined — more focused on getting his core message out to all Americans, not just his core fans and Republican-leaners. That focus was clearly on display in the Trump-Biden debate — and Biden’s disastrous performance there was already pushing the race firmly Trump’s way, whether or not Democrats dump Joe. America knows the Democratic elite (including any Biden replacement) colluded to cover up Biden’s mental decline, and the former president is looking at a potential Electoral College landslide and possible Republican gains in the House and Senate that will make it far easier to deliver on the Trump agenda. Getting there already meant a convention and a campaign appealing to reluctant swing voters. The fact that the Democrats’ scorched-earth “dictator” rhetoric has now inspired a would-be assassin only increases the stakes. Follow The Post’s latest stories on the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump: Trump says he ‘felt the bullet ripping through my skin’ in first statement since assassination attempt Donald Trump urges the nation to not let ‘evil win’ and ‘fear not’ after shooting Gunman behind attempted assassination on Trump had head blown off by Secret Service, sources say; rally-goer killed Trump shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was loner ‘relentlessly’ bullied in high school: classmate How Trump’s split-second head turn may have saved his life from assassin’s bullet Ex-volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore ID’d as Trump sniper victim, shielded his daughter from assassin’s bullets Search for Trump shooter’s motive delayed by explosives found in home and car: sources Keep up to date on updates with the Post’s live blog on the assassination attempt on Trump And of course leaves voters wanting milder rhetoric on both sides of the aisle. Fact is, we’re no longer sure what Democrats will have to say at their convention next month, unless they spend the whole time switching their nominee. The Biden campaign is already taking down its old ads, and will have to retool everything: Ruthlessly, and insincerely, demonizing their opponent just doesn’t play very well now. Let us emphasize the “insincerely” there: Dems’ leaders have never acted like they believe Trump and his MAGA movement pose an existential threat to the Republic. They’ve routinely intervened in GOP primaries to push the “Trumpiest” candidates, figuring it makes it more likely a Democrat will wind up winning and accepting the obvious fact that it would help Trump’s movement grow. All the “Hitler” fearmongering was a cynical ploy because they can’t win on the issues. That’s why they’ve recently seized on the Heritage Foundation’s (year-old!) Project 2025 as Trump’s “real” agenda, utterly ignoring the actual Republican platform and what Trump himself is saying. And never mind that their entire approach — from the lawfare that aims to jail Trump or at least bankrupt him, to rigging the Democratic primaries to produce a Biden coronation while concealing his decline, to all the conspiring to oust Biden now that the nation’s seen his true state — is itself profoundly anti-democratic. So much so, again, that it inspired an assassin (actually, a third one, following the mass shooter who nearly killed Rep. Steve Scalise and two others and the poor soul who turned back outside the home of Justice Brett Kavanaugh). Biden is reacting to Saturday by calling for “national unity.” We welcome the change of attitude, but: If he meant it, he’d start by apologizing for his September 2022 “Dark Brandon” speech that declared, “Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.” If you want national unity, reject the cynical dividers.","summary":"Donald Trump announced Sunday that he won’t be delaying his trip to Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention, having “decided that I cannot allow a ‘shooter,’ or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/opinion/the-gop-convention-just-took-a-huge-turn-and-dems-have-nothing-to-say/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Election_2024_RNC_Reax_47002-342b2-e1720998258755.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 23:08:11","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":251757428,"title":"Trump’s courage stands out, Dem strategist’s vile reaction and more commentary","text":"Conservative: Trump’s Courage Stands Out “The United States can’t be led by a coward or by someone who looks like one under fire,” argues The American Conservative’s Daniel McCarthy, so Donald Trump’s raised firt bare minutes after getting shot was “what a leader had to do in that situation”: “Morale is a nation’s blood. Trump refused to let the assassin shed it, even as his own wounds bled.” RFK Jr. rapidly “called for peace and prayer for Trump,” and Bernie Sanders soon did much the same. “The exception to this rapid response was President Biden, who put out an anodyne comment at 7:58 p.m. He then gave a press conference in which he declined to say whether this was an attempted assassination.” That is: “At a time when the country needed reassurance from figures of authority,” Biden “was conspicuous only by his absence. He might as well have been off reading My Pet Goat.” Reporter: Dem Strategist’s Vile Reaction “The top political adviser to Democratic mega-donor Reid Hoffman suggested that the attack on Donald Trump could have been ‘staged,’ ” reports Semafor’s Kadia Goba. Hoffman last week publicly wished he had made Trump “an actual martyr,” Goba notes; then Saturday night adviser Dmitri Mehlhorn, in an email he now regrets, said “one possibility — which feels horrific and alien and absurd in America, but is quite common globally — is that this ‘shooting’ was encouraged and maybe even staged so Trump could get the photos and benefit from the backlash.” He admitted it could be “some crazy anti-Trumper,” but wrote that the false-flag op “is a classic Putin play and given the facts seems more plausible. From the right: Joe’s Age Isn’t Dems’ Big Problem If Democrats think Joe Biden’s decline is their only or even biggest problem, they’re “as confused” as he is, snarks The Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley A. Strassel. They’re avoiding “any discussion of the root problem” — that their “sharp move to the left” is “deeply unpopular with the electorate.” Even the contenders to replace Biden are “unrepentant progressives, promising to double down” on Dems’ far-left agenda. “Biden’s age is a problem,” but “not the cause of striking demographic shifts — under way for years — that show the working class, including minority voters, fleeing the party. Progressive policies will be on the ballot this fall as much as any one person’s name.” If Dems care about their future, they’d be “having that debate.” Eye on Albany: NY Health-Care Pay-to-Play New York health-care capital grants have “been used to build new facilities and renovate old ones,” but some “have been used not for anything new, but for paying off old loans,” grumbles the Empire Center’s Bill Hammond. E.g., the Health Department allocated “$25 million in grants to finance a pair of medical office buildings being developed by Crystal Run Healthcare, a company tied to $400,000 in contributions to [Andrew] Cuomo’s campaign.” Yet “the buildings were already under construction before the grants were awarded.” Two more grants went to groups tied to “Somos Community Care, whose leaders have made millions in campaign contributions” to Cuomo and Gov. Hochul. Liberal: Biden Just Doesn’t Get It “Never underestimate the destructive power of a stubborn old narcissist with something to prove,” snarks Mark Leibovich at The Atlantic. “President Joe Biden, 81, is acting like one of history’s most negligent and pigheaded leaders at a crucial moment, and right now, we are all pedestrians.” “The spectacle has been endlessly depressing, unless you’re Donald Trump or want him back in the White House — in which case you’re relishing this slowly unfolding, self-owning, party-destroying wreck.” The “Republican National Convention is shaping up to be a week-long Mardi Gras of MAGA in Milwaukee.” “Clearly the White House has no serious answer for people’s widespread and legitimate doubts about the president’s capacity to serve, let alone for another four-year term.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“The top political adviser to Democratic mega-donor Reid Hoffman suggested that the attack on Donald Trump could have been ‘staged,’ ” reports Semafor’s Kadia Goba.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/opinion/trumps-courage-stands-out-dem-strategists-vile-reaction-and-more-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-ihx3z0h8v-1720997504597.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1720983183&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 22:55:56","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.391},{"id":251757980,"title":"It is Too Late To Replace Joe Biden","text":"By Kalyani Shankar U.S. President Joe Biden’s underwhelming performance in the 2024 presidential debate last week raised concerns due to his apparent fatigue, forgetfulness, and confusion. This has caused uncertainty among supporters despite Biden’s attempts to reassure them in the post-debate period. Even last week, during a speech in Madison, Wisconsin, he initially said he would “beat Donald Trump again in 2020” before correcting himself to “2024,” which added to the uncertainty. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, Biden has defended himself about three things. First, his support stayed pretty much the same after the debate. Secondly, most party voters want him to continue. The last point is that other options are not better. President Biden has demonstrated resilience in the face of pressure to step down. He confidently declared at a rally in Madison that he would run and win again, which cheered his supporters and reassured some doubters within the party. President Biden’s improved performance in his public appearances post-debate has the potential to significantly reshape his chances in the upcoming election and the prospects of the Democratic Party. This shift in dynamics could bring a sense of hope and anticipation to the party. Next month, the Democratic Party will nominate President Biden as its 2024 Presidential candidate in a virtual convention. This event will officially confirm Biden’s candidacy and establish the party’s campaign strategy. If Biden stays in the race, it will be tough for any other candidate to win the Democratic nomination. This is because the party rules give Biden a big advantage. These rules include specific guidelines for delegate allocation and influence. of super delegates. If Biden were to resign, who would take his place? With only four months before the 2024 election, finding the right person takes a lot of work. This shows how serious the situation is. Kamala Harris, the current Vice President and Joe Biden’s running mate, is the top contender for the upcoming presidential election. Many believe that she has the advantage. However, her lack of popularity could be a significant challenge, as 49% of Americans disapprove of her according to polling averages. Republicans hope Harris will become the Democratic presidential nominee, believing it will benefit Trump’s campaign. The Trump campaign has launched an ad with the slogan: “This November, vote Republican. Stop Kamala.” A recent poll by Reuters/Ipsos showed that Michelle Obama could win against Trump in November. However, Michelle has repeatedly said she does not aspire to be President, so it’s doubtful she will run. Several names are being floated to replace President Biden. This includes at least six governors: Gavin Newsom from California, Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, Josh Shapiro from Pennsylvania, J. B. Pritzker from Illinois, and Ro Khanna, a representative from California. Each of these potential candidates has their strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Gavin Newsom is the favourite. Their potential to run for office would have different effects on the Democratic Party and the upcoming election. After the debate, polls from CNN, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal showed that Biden is six points behind Trump in the country. Biden is also trailing in the most crucial states he won in 2020 elections.. Furthermore, other states he won—Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Virginia—now seem uncertain. In 2020, four months before the election, Biden was 9 points ahead in the polls. However, he eventually won the election with 51.25% of the popular vote, compared to Trump’s 46.8%. This data suggests Biden may face a more challenging race in 2024 than 2020. When asked whether he could run the country for another term, he told ABC in a recent interview. “I believe so; I wouldn’t be running ‘ if I didn’t think I did. Look, I’m running’ again because I believe I understand best what has to be done to take this nation to a completely new level. We’re on our way.” Polls reveal that voters are more concerned about whether the 81-year-old President could manage another four years in the White House than his 78-year-old rival.. Biden needs to be more competent to win in November. Biden was confident when he said, “If the Lord Almighty came down and said, ‘Joe, get out of the race,’ I’d get out of the race,” but added, “The Lord Almighty’s not coming down.” So, it is up to God Almighty to go down and ask him to keep out of the race. Trump quietly observes Biden’s challenging position. India has had a good rapport with both Trump and Biden. There is also bipartisan support. Therefore, it is unlikely that their South Asia and India policies will change, given the growing economic influence of India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also has a good rapport with both of them. Biden is facing challenges as he moves toward November. 5. Trump has raised a lot of money and still has support from his party despite some court decisions going against him. Both candidates are trying to harm each other’s reputation. Elections are unpredictable, especially with four months to go. Anything can happen.

In the weeks prior, all eyes were on Joe Biden and his severe mental and physical decline, with many high-level Democrats desperately trying to organize a way to force him out of the race. Yet, after the attempt on Trump’s life, the rush to replace Biden as the Democratic Party nominee has essentially ended, and not for the reason one might think. According to NBC News, the replacement campaign has lost steam not because Democrats think the president can seize a moment of unity, but because they think the race is now over. Why the Replace Biden campaign likely came to an end last night: they no longer believe it even matters. pic.twitter.com/vgaRGG4Bbj— John Ekdahl (@JohnEkdahl) July 14, 2024 “The presidential contest ended last night,” said a veteran Democratic consultant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment of his own party’s standing less than four months before the election.“Now it’s time to focus on keeping the Senate and trying to pick up the House,” he said. “The only positive thing to come out of last night for Democrats is we are no longer talking about Joe Biden’s age today.”A Biden campaign spokesperson did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment on how the attempted assassination of Trump might affect the dynamics of their rematch. A White House spokesperson declined to comment. Is the presidential campaign truly over? Being a natural cynic about politics means I’ll never believe that before all the votes are tallied. Still, it’s very telling that Democrats are throwing their hands up and retreating to rear fortifications. Perhaps they don’t want to waste the career of anyone on their bench, but the bigger question is what this means for the money. Reports of fundraising drying up for Biden have been prevalent since his disastrous debate performance. If that situation gets even worse, it could starve the president’s campaign regardless of whatever path to victory might exist on paper. SEE: Major Dem Donors Freeze $90 Million in Donations to Biden On the other hand, I’m not sure the idea of trying to keep the Senate and retake the House is much of a backup plan. The Senate map is brutal for Democrats, and unlike 2022, the list of candidates in various swing states is strong with few exceptions. As odd as it may sound, trying to help Biden pull off a miracle by infusing his campaign with cash may be the best of a lot of bad options. What’s certain, though, is that Democrats are in a bad spot. If they try to push too hard going forward against Trump and Republicans with more “threat to democracy” nonsense, they could further alienate swing voters. If they lay low, then they risk losing any initiative that might be for the taking. I guess that’s one of the downsides of having an ideological ally try to murder your political opponent. Here’s the Democrats’ biggest problem, though. Whether the race ended or not on Saturday evening, they were already deep in the hole before that. This isn’t a case of one event sinking them. It’s a case of an avalanche of events, including Biden being exposed as senile, piling on. That makes any possible comeback all the more unlikely. Of course, the normal disclaimer applies. This is politics, and anything can happen.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWith Donald Trump having narrowly escaped death at the hands of a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Democratic campaign to replace Joe Biden has concluded, but not for the reasons you may expect first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-democratic-campaign-to-replace-joe-biden-has-concluded-but-not-for-the-reasons-you-may-expect/","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/195/4572e2d9-e771-4577-afea-7b2b22670f05.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 22:54:17","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.695},{"id":251758616,"title":"Secret Service investigates how gunman got so close to Trump as Biden orders independent review","text":"The FBI on Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The gunman, who officials said was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an “elevated position outside of the rally venue,” the agency said. An Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos taken at the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows Crooks’ body lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where Trump’s rally was held. A different image shows Crooks wearing a gray T-shirt with a black American flag on the right arm, with a bloody wound to his head. The roof was fewer than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The AR-style rifle, like that of the gunman at the Trump rally, is the semiautomatic civilian version of the military M16. President Joe Biden said Sunday he has directed an independent review of the security at the rally. Biden said he also directed the U.S. Secret Service to review all security measures for the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday in Milwaukee. Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, the Secret Service’s coordinator for the convention, told reporters later the agency was satisfied with what she called its comprehensive planning for the Republican convention. Biden urged Americans not to make assumptions about the motive of the shooter. He said investigators are working swiftly to investigate the attack. “Unity is the most elusive goal of all,” he said, but “nothing is more important than that right now.” Calls for an investigation came from all sides. Rep. Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday raising questions about the shooting and demanding information about the former president’s Secret Service protection. “The seriousness of this security failure and chilling moment in our nation’s history cannot be understated,” Green wrote. The Secret Service did not have a speaker at a news conference Saturday night where FBI and Pennsylvania State Police officials briefed reporters on the shooting investigation. FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was “surprising” that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. Members of the Secret Service’s counter-sniper team and counterassault team were at the rally, according to two law enforcement officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss details of the investigation. The heavily armed counterassault team, whose Secret Service code name is “Hawkeye,” is responsible for eliminating threats so that other agents can shield and take away the person they are protecting. The counter-sniper team, known by the code name “Hercules,” uses long-range binoculars and is equipped with sniper rifles to deal with long-range threats. Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to investigate the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates and their campaign events is one of the department’s “most vital priorities,” he said. “We condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms and commend the Secret Service for their swift action today,” Mayorkas said. “We are engaged with President Biden, former President Trump and their campaigns, and are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.“ Green also noted reports that the Secret Service had rebuffed requests from the Trump campaign for additional security. A spokesman for the Secret Service, Anthony Guglielmi, said on X Sunday that those allegations were “absolutely false” and that they had added resources and technology as the campaign’s travel increased. Green said he would be talking with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Sunday. Former top Secret Service agents told The AP that Crooks should never have been allowed to gain access to the roof, and the agency will have to figure out how that happened. They said such a lapse could have been caused by officers neglecting their posts or a flaw in the event’s security plan. The agency is “going to have to go through the security plan and interview a number of people from the director on down” to figure out what went wrong, said Stephen Colo, who retired in 2003 as an assistant director after a 27-year career in the service. Colo said presidential candidates and former presidents don’t typically get the same level of protection as the sitting president. In fact, Colo said he was surprised that the agency had staffed the event with a counter-sniper team. Such a valuable resource — there are not many of those highly trained agents — is usually reserved for the president. Candidates don’t usually get such teams. Timothy McCarthy, a former agent who retired from the agency in 1994, said the Secret Service “better be doing a deep dive into what happened there and doing whatever it takes to figure it out” because the gunman should not have been able to occupy such a vantage point. “How did that person get up on that building?” said McCarthy, 75, who in 1981 took a bullet when President Ronald Reagan was shot outside the Washington Hilton Hotel. “How did that happen? I mean, that’s the key to the entire thing. And what measures were put in place to prevent it?” James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and called on Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Comer said his committee will send a formal invitation soon. “Political violence in all forms is un-American and unacceptable. There are many questions and Americans demand answers,” Comer said in a statement. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating “security failures” at the rally. “The federal government must constantly learn from security failures in order to avoid repeating them, especially when those failures have implications for the nation,” Torres said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, posted on X that he and his staff are in contact with security planning coordinators ahead of the Republican National Convention set to begin Monday in Milwaukee. “We cannot be a country that accepts political violence of any kind — that is not who we are as Americans,” Evers said. The FBI said it will lead the investigation into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department “will bring every available resource to bear to this investigation.” “My heart is with the former President, those injured, and the family of the spectator killed in this horrific attack,” Garland said in a statement. “We will not tolerate violence of any kind, and violence like this is an attack on our democracy.”","summary":"The roof where the shooter was found was fewer than 164 yards from where Trump was speaking.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/14/secret-service-investigation-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-gunman-joe-biden-independent-review/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24196010527454-e1720996382731.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 22:47:40","author":"Michael Biesecker,Michael Kunzelman,Rebecca Santana,The Associated Press","authors":["Michael Biesecker","Michael Kunzelman","Rebecca Santana","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":251758464,"title":"Wisconsin Gov.

The gunman, a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, injured Trump and killed a rally attendee from a rooftop perch around 150 yards (140 m) from the stage where the former president was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, officials said. Trump, 78, who like other former presidents has lifetime protection by the Secret Service, was swarmed by agents who then rushed him away. Agents killed the shooter, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, and an AR-15-style semiautomatic was recovered near his body, officials said. Trump says a bullet hit his upper right ear but that he is otherwise doing well and would travel to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he will receive his party’s presidential nomination. Mike Johnson, speaker of the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, said panels in the chamber will call officials from the Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI for hearings. “The American people deserve to know the truth,” Johnson said. The House oversight panel called Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to testify on July 22. The Secret Service, tasked with protecting current and former presidents, is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The department’s Office of the Inspector General is responsible for conducting oversight of Secret Service operations. A spokesman for the inspector general’s office did not respond to questions about whether it would launch its own inquiry. The FBI said in a statement following the shooting that it would be the lead federal law enforcement agency in the investigation into the shooting. In a statement, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency had “added protective resources (and) technology (and) capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.” Guglielmi denied accusations that the agency had rebuffed requests for more security resources from Trump’s team. In televised remarks, Biden, 81, said that Trump, as a former president who is the Republicans’ nominee for president in the Nov. 5 election, already receives a heightened level of security. “I’ve been consistent in my direction of the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety,” Biden, a Democrat, said. He said he had “directed an independent review of the national security at yesterday’s rally to assess exactly what happened,” the results of which will be shared with the public. On Sunday, Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres said that he and Republican Congressman Mike Lawler are planning to introduce a bill that would call for enhanced security for all presidential candidates. ‘FULL RIFLE KIT’ Paul Eckloff, a former Secret Service agent who retired in 2020, said agents would have surveyed all the rooftops with a line of sight ahead of time. “This person either concealed themselves until they became a threat, or were not a threat until they revealed their weapons,” said Eckloff. In the moments after Trump was injured, the former president was quickly surrounded by Secret Service personnel who formed a human shield, while heavily armed agents in body armor and toting rifles also took to the stage and appeared to scan the area for threats. Trump was whisked by the agents to a black SUV, and taken to a local hospital, according to the campaign. Trump supporters blasted the Secret Service as having failed to protect the former president. Billionaire Elon Musk called for the agency’s leadership to resign. “How was a sniper with a full rifle kit allowed to bear crawl onto the closest roof to a presidential nominee,” asked conservative activist Jack Posobiec on social media. “There will be an intensive review” of the incident and “there’s going to be a massive realignment,” said Joseph LaSorsa, a former Secret Service agent who served on the presidential detail. “This cannot happen.” SECURING TRUMP RALLIES During most of Trump’s campaign stops, local police aid the Secret Service in securing the venue. Agents from other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, such as the Transportation Security Administration, occasionally help. Many Trump rallies feature thousands of audience members, take place in the open air and last for hours. Before the event, agents scan the venue for bombs or other threats, and Trump invariably arrives in a fortified motorcade.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump called for unity and resilience Sunday after an attempt on his life added fresh uncertainty to an already tumultuous presidential campaign and raised sharp questions about how a gunman was able to open fire from a rooftop near a Pennsylvania campaign rally. A full day after the shooting, the gunman’s motive was still a mystery, and investigators said they believe he acted alone before being fatally shot by Secret Service agents. President Joe Biden ordered an independent security review of the attack, which killed a bystander and critically wounded two others. The FBI was investigating the shooting as a potential act of domestic terrorism. The attack shook the firmament of the American political system, causing a reassessment and a detente — at least temporarily — of the heated 2024 presidential campaign that has grown increasingly vicious. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said the upper part of his right ear was pierced by a bullet. His aides said he was in “great spirits” and doing well, and he headed to Milwaukee to the Republican National Convention that begins Monday. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote on his social media site. “Much bleeding took place.” In a subsequent social post Sunday, Trump said: “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.” The rallygoer who was killed was identified as Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area, according to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who added that Comperatore “died a hero.” “His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them,” Shapiro said. The two other bystanders who were wounded were listed in stable condition. Biden spoke briefly with Trump and was to address the nation Sunday evening. The president said the country would continue to debate and disagree, but stressed: “We must unite as one nation to demonstrate who we are.” FBI investigates shooting as possible domestic terrorism The FBI identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, which is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the scene of the shooting. The gunman had his father’s AR-style rifle and was perched atop a nearby roof when some rallygoers pointed him out to local law enforcement, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal probe. A local law enforcement officer climbed to the roof and found Crooks, who pointed the rifle at the officer. The officer then retreated down the ladder, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That’s when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, the officials said. Questions abounded about how the gunman could have gotten so close in the first place. Kevin Rojek, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office, said “it is surprising” that the gunman was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him. Bomb-making materials were found inside both Crooks’ vehicle and at his home. The FBI described the devices as “rudimentary.” His motive remained unclear. Crooks wasn’t on the FBI’s radar, and he was believed to have acted alone. Investigators combed through his social media feeds and his home but found no immediate threatening writing or posts. His family was cooperating. Crooks’ relatives did not return multiple messages seeking comment from the AP. Crooks’ political leanings were also not clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $15 to a progressive political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021, the day President Joe Biden was sworn in as president. The absence of a clear ideological motive added to the deepening questions about the shooting, denying the public any swift or tidy conclusions about the shocking crime. Biden urged Americans to stay patient. “I urge everyone — everyone, please, don’t make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,” he said. Most serious assassination attempt since 1981 The attack was the most serious attempt to kill a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election. FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said agents have seen increasingly violent rhetoric online since the rally, along with people posing online as the dead shooter. “We’re also focused on the continuing efforts — which were already substantial, given that they’re national security special events — to conventions in Chicago, in Milwaukee,” he said. Biden on Sunday ordered a security review of operations for the Republican National Convention, which is proceeding as planned. The Secret Service said it was “confident” in the security plan for the RNC, and no additional changes were planned. Biden, who is running against Trump, said the two men had a “short but good” conversation Saturday night. Biden returned to Washington from his Delaware beach home where he met with leaders in the Situation Room about the attack. He said during an address Sunday afternoon that “there is no place in America for this kind of violence.” “We cannot allow this to happen,” Biden said. Yet many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. It’s not clear yet whether Biden will be forced to recalibrate a campaign that’s largely focused on Trump as a threat to democracy. It is a situation the U.S. has not seen since Teddy Roosevelt was shot a month before the election in 1912 while campaigning to regain the White House as a third-party candidate. A rally disrupted by gunfire Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the gunfire began after 6:10 p.m. Saturday. As the first pop rang out, Trump said “Oh” and raised his hand to his right ear and looked at it, before quickly crouching to the ground behind his lectern. The people in the stands behind him also crouched as screams rang through the crowd. Someone could be heard near the microphone saying, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents rushed to the stage. They piled atop the former president to shield him with their bodies as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat. Afterward, voices were heard saying, “Shooter’s down” several times, before someone asked, “Are we good to move?” and “Are we clear?” Then someone ordered, “Let’s move.” Trump got to his feet moments later and could be seen reaching with his right hand toward his face, which was streaked with blood. He then pumped his fist in the air and appeared to mouth the word “fight” twice to his crowd of supporters, prompting loud cheers and then chants of “USA. USA. USA.” His motorcade left the venue moments later. Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. Witnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover When the firing began, “everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew. Everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump’s right on stage. As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. Eventually, first responders were able to carry the wounded person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. Reporters at the rally heard five or six shots, and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring. When it was clear the situation had been contained and Trump would not return to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. Police soon told everyone to leave the venue, and Secret Service agents described the site as “a live crime scene.” Republican Rep. Mike Kelly, who represents the area where the shooting occurred, attended the rally with his wife and grandchildren and was just behind Trump when he was wounded. Kelly said he was “in a state of bewilderment of how and what has happened to the United States of America.” “I just wish people — tone it down,” he said. “Quit trying to find, to blame somebody. The blame lies somewhere in the psyche of America.” ___ Colvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington. Tucker reported from Westport, Connecticut.

How Badly Injured Was Donald Trump? A bullet \"pierced\" the top of Trump’s right ear, he said late Saturday, and photos showed the top of his ear bloodied with streaks of blood on the right side of his face. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi was quick to confirm the former president was “safe” after the shooting. Trump was taken to Butler Memorial Hospital for evaluation and was released before flying to New Jersey overnight. Donald Trump Jr. shortly after the shooting said his father was \"doing fine.\" Trump's former White House doctor, Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, flew to New Jersey on Sunday morning and told The New York Times that Trump “wasn’t the least bit flustered.” Who Was Thomas Matthew Crooks, The Apparent Shooter? Crooks, 20, was a registered Republican with no criminal history, according to The New York Times. He graduated from Bethel Park High School, about an hour from the rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, in 2022 and worked as a dietary aid for a local nursing and rehabilitation center. No motive has been identified by law enforcement officials, and President Joe Biden on Sunday asked the public to “not make assumptions.” The FBI on Sunday said Crooks is believed to have acted alone, and is treating the matter as a potential case of domestic terrorism. Who Was Corey Comperatore, The Man Killed At The Trump Rally? Comperatore, a father and husband, was shot and killed at Trump's rally Sunday. He was a 50-year-old former volunteer fire chief and father of two daughters whose family said he died while shielding his wife and daughter from the gunfire. Dawn Comperatore Schafer, Comperatore's sister, told The New York Times his family found out about his death through the news. He was remembered as a \"family man\" who loved to fish and was hailed by Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, as \"the very best of us.\" What Do We Know About The Others Injured At The Rally? The two people who were seriously injured were in critical but stable condition as of Sunday afternoon. They were identified by local police as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania. They are being treated at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. Jackson tweeted Saturday that his nephew was among those with minor injuries and told Fox News a bullet grazed his nephew’s neck at the rally. Jackson said his nephew is doing well. How Could The Trump Shooting Have Happened? The Secret Service shot Crooks on top of a manufacturing plant north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where the rally was held. The roof was fewer than 200 yards from where Trump was speaking, the Associated Press reported, and calls for an investigation into how a gunman could have gotten so close have been echoed from both sides. The Secret Service has not commented on the circumstances of the shooting other than to say it is investigating the incident. Anthony Guglielmi, spokesperson for the Secret Service, said the agency added \"protective resources, technology and capabilities\" to the Trump campaign ahead of the shooting. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has been called to testify before the House Oversight Committee on July 22. The Secret Service has an operating budget of $3 billion. What False Information Has Been Spreading Online? Videos were posted on TikTok, X, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms Sunday of a person falsely claiming to be the Trump shooting suspect and speculating on his motives, which Biden on Sunday said are still unclear. BBC Verify, which combats misinformation online, has said the man in the videos and photos is not the shooter. Other false posts, including one said to be written by a Secret Service agent who was ordered not to fire on Crooks, have also been circulating since the shooting. There is no evidence an actual Secret Service agent penned the post. Conspiracy theories and other unverified claims spread quickly in the wake of Trump's assassinaton attempt, including those blaming the so-called deep state for the attack. What Has Trump Said About The Shooting? Trump took to Truth Social on Saturday night and again Sunday morning to thank the Secret Service for its response and express condolences to the victims and the family of the man killed. He called on his supporters to \"remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness\" and confirmed he would be appearing and speaking as scheduled at this week's Republican National Convention. His latest post, which went up at around 3 p.m., said \"UNITE AMERICA!\" What Has Biden Said About The Shooting? The president first addressed the nation Saturday night, calling the attack “sick” and saying, “There's no place in America for this kind of violence.” He echoed those comments in a short speech from the White House on Sunday afternoon in which he said “there is no place in America for this kind of violence or any violence for that matter. An assassination attempt is against everything we stand for as a nation… We cannot allow this to happen.” Biden ordered an independent review of the shooting to determine how it was possible for a lone gunman to fire shots at a presidential candidate. He said the results of that investigation will be released to the public. Biden will speak again from the Oval Office at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday. What Does The Trump Assassination Attempt Mean For The Republican National Convention? The convention, set to start Monday in Wisconsin, is expected to proceed as scheduled. Trump on Sunday said he’d considered delaying his trip to Milwaukee by two days but ultimately stuck to the original schedule and left at 3:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. Trump is expected to formally accept the Republican nomination for president at the convention and announce his vice presidential pick. Other speakers for the convention include former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr., South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance, Rubio, Scott and Burgum are considered the top contenders for Trump’s running mate pick. Biden said he’s directed the head of the Secret Service to review “all security measures” for the convention. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for mid August.

Three people familiar with plans for the event, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that convention programming is moving forward as originally intended. “Our boss is leading the way,” said one Trump campaign official. “He set the tone, which is ‘Let’s get back to it and go win.’” In downtown Milwaukee ahead of the convention’s Monday start, former Speaker Newt Gingrich told POLITICO the convention will be “much more emotional,” and that attendees will be “much more passionate about Trump.” “Everyone I’ve talked to who’s talked to him said he’s doing great. He’s amazing,” Gingrich said. “He’s bounced back, and he’ll be here.” The rally Saturday left Trump wounded by a bullet but also seemed to give him an outward sense of defiance. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the president raised his fist in the air in an now iconic photo that his party and allies are sharing, and through social media posts and appeals to donors, Trump has repeated the message of resilience. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,” Trump said in a post to his social media platform, Truth Social, Sunday morning. “UNITE AMERICA!” he also posted Sunday. Those who spoke to Trump relayed publicly that he appeared in good health, both mentally and physically. Biden described his phone call with Trump as a “good, short and respectful” call during Sunday afternoon remarks from the White House. Throughout his campaign, Trump has aimed to project strength as he seeks to distinguish himself from Biden, who was facing intense pressure to step down and install a younger candidate as the nominee immediately before the attack. The willingness to project strength was also reflected in a campaign text blasted out to supporters from the Trump campaign: “I will NEVER SURRENDER,” his political team blasted off in a fundraising appeal. Trump also said on Truth Social that he would not allow the apparent assassination attempt to delay his trip to Wisconsin for the Republican National Convention, and that he would depart for the Badger State at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday. “He sounds like a person who is ready to go, very strong, unwavering,” Priebus, who also spoke with Trump Sunday afternoon, said during an interview with ABC News. Joe Kernen, the conservative co-host of Squawk Box on CNBC, said in a social media post that he spoke on Sunday afternoon with Trump, who asked him to pass along that he’s “doing great” and “gratified” by all the support he’s received from Republicans and Democrats. He said Trump told him he has a “little problem” with his injured ear “but was glad he turned his head at the last minute.” Repeatedly, Trump has also lauded the MAGA supporters in Pennsylvania who cheered his survival on as he pumped his fist into the air, blood streaming down his face, seconds after surviving the attack on his life. “‘Did you see the people in the audience?’” Jones, the Fox News host, recounted the former president asking him over the phone. “Typically when shots are fired, there would be a stampede. But, he said, ‘Did you hear them stand firm with me? Stand firm with the country?”","summary":"“He sounds like a person who is ready to go, very strong, unwavering,” said his former chief of staff.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/14/trump-responds-shooting-defiance-00168176","image":"https://static.politico.com/76/4c/74b2318546699fdd52cd1567bbae/trump-hush-money-77988.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 22:27:15","author":"Jason Beeferman,Natalie Allison","authors":["Jason Beeferman","Natalie Allison"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"eu","sentiment":0.175},{"id":251757164,"title":"Is Trump Hitler or not?","text":"During a political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump was injured in an assassination attempt that left at least one audience member dead and others critically injured. Trump was seen raising his fist in defiance as he was escorted from the stage amid the chaos, blood dripping from his right ear after he came within just a few inches of joining the list of murdered political figures in U.S. history. While prayers, shock, and outrage exploded across the country, figures on the Left rushed to condemn the attack. Democrat after Democrat released statements rejecting political violence and celebrating Trump’s survival. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) thanked God that Trump was safe, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) denounced the “horrific incident” as “absolutely unacceptable,” and two hours after the attack President Joe Biden eventually described the act as “sick,” saying that there is “no place in America for this kind of violence.” This is a weird way to talk about a man who is no different than Adolf Hitler, at least according to Democrats. Do they truly believe we are stupid enough to forget their rhetoric after Trump had the audacity to beat Hillary Clinton? Biden, the Democratic Party, and the legacy media have spent years spewing endless propaganda with one goal: to smear Trump and anyone who dares to consider voting for him as Nazis, white supremacists, fascists, deplorables, and even villains from the pages of The Handmaid’s Tale. And while they squeeze out incessant crocodile tears over the nonexistent incitement of violence by Republicans, Democrats have leveraged violent speech in pursuit of power. Specifically, they have painted Trump as a 21st century version of Hitler to win votes. And the media happily played along. “The reich stuff — what does Trump really have in common with Hitler?” the Guardian asked in June. “Trump’s Hitler Fascination Is An Ominous Echo of the 1930s,” Bloomberg warned in April. And just a week ago, a New Republic cover featured Trump adorned with a Hitler mustache under the headline “American Fascism.” But if Trump truly is the reincarnation of one of the most infamous genocidal maniacs in human history, as Democrats have warned for years, why are they suddenly upset that someone failed to protect us from Hitler 2.0? Either they are pro-Hitler, which opens its own can of worms, or it turns out that Trump is not Hitler and they’ve been lying for years for cheap political gain and are only now facing the embarrassing and deadly reality that words can have consequences. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Neither of these options is good. The gaslighting must end. The hypocrisy must end. The violent rhetoric must end. As for Biden and his team of degenerates, they must explain either why they are sending Hitler their best wishes or why they spent years labeling Trump as the face of American fascism that must be stopped by any means necessary.

Battered by doubts about his mental fitness and pressure to step aside, Biden fought back on Friday with an energetic speech in Detroit vowing to “shine a spotlight” on Trump — an argument he planned to drive home until Election Day in November. About 24 hours later, and just under 200 miles away, shots rang out at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the chilling apex of an era in American politics defined by radicalized views and heated rhetoric. But Biden’s beleaguered campaign is now limited in how it can push forward. The outburst of political violence stymies his efforts to argue his case. It also undercuts a core premise of his presidency — that he would restore decency and normalcy to national politics. Instead, the president will hope that a unifying message in a time of crisis can resonate with voters. Biden announced that he would deliver a rare Oval Office address on trying to bring the nation together at 8 p.m. local time. “There’s no place in America for this kind of violence,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is as important than that right now.” The intense focus on the attempted assassination does offer Biden a reprieve from the conversation that had dominated headlines for weeks: whether he should withdraw after his disastrous debate. One Democratic donor, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that they previously believed the party would be best served by replacing Biden, but there’s no way that could happen now without contributing to a sense of chaos. The shooting — and Trump’s iconic, bloodied, fist-pumping response — seems certain to rally voters and donors behind the Republican candidate. Business leaders Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, who previously resisted endorsing the former president, came out with public statements backing Trump within minutes of his being struck. It will be days or weeks before public opinion surveys are released assessing the aftermath. But former President Ronald Reagan saw a substantial increase in support when he was shot and wounded in 1981. Many presidential historians say that attack cemented his status in the conservative movement. By contrast, Biden must balance how to push forward without seeming insensitive. The president expressed sympathy for Trump on Sunday while vowing a “thorough and swift” federal investigation, a Secret Service probe into its security measures and an independent review of the shooting that he pledged to release to the American people. The president urged people not to “make assumptions” about the gunman’s “motives or his affiliations,” imploring the public to “Let the FBI do their job, and their partner agencies do their job.” With Election Day less than four months away, Biden badly needs to reverse his standing. Figures on both sides of the aisle have called for leaders to rise above the political fray and attempt to heal national divisions. The shooting confirmed the fears of half of swing-state voters, who said in a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May that they were worried about violence surrounding the election. Already, the president’s campaign said it would pause messaging and television ads. Biden postponed a Monday speech in Austin to mark the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. His campaign canceled a Monday event counter-programming the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Vice President Kamala Harris delayed political travel originally scheduled for Tuesday in Florida, according to a campaign official. The White House has not said if Biden will continue with prime-time interviews this week with NBC News and BET, or travel to Las Vegas to address Black and Latino advocacy groups. Republican criticism While law enforcement officials, and Trump himself, have not ascribed a motive to the shooter, some Republicans have already made unsubstantiated claims blaming Biden for motivating the would-be assassin. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, a possible Trump running mate, posted on X. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Supporters of the president pointed to his call for unity after the shooting. Biden also said he had a short call with Trump. Still, the failed assassination attempt shifts the dynamics of the race in Trump’s favor. It’s a remarkable twist of fate for Trump, who has glorified violence throughout his political career, from encouraging rally attendees in 2016 to “knock the crap” out of protesters to telling supporters to “fight like hell” on Jan. 6, 2021 just before they stormed the US Capitol. “Biden’s inevitable ritual condemnation of political violence today (when it comes) will be insufficient and irrelevant,” posted Vivek Ramaswamy, who ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primaries. Defiant images Republican pollster Frank Luntz said the shooting guarantees “every Trump voter will actually vote,” while Biden won’t be able to count on that certainty. The biggest effect is likely to be in battleground Pennsylvania — a must-win for Biden — because that is where the shooting occurred, he said. “The long and winding road for Joe Biden just became even longer and windier,” Luntz posted on X. “The shooting of Donald Trump will be significantly consequential in a way the shooter never intended.” With Trump dominating the national conversation, there’s little Biden can do in the near term to push his anti-Trump message, mend Democratic divisions and shift the dynamics of the race in a way that reassures skeptics. “This has got to help Donald Trump, at least for a while, with independents,” said Matthew Wilson, a Southern Methodist University political science professor. “Those images showing a defiant Donald Trump with blood on his face and his fist in the air are better advertising than anything money can buy.” Others urged caution in overstating the impact of the moment. They pointed to a minimal shift in polls after other seismic events, including Biden’s debate catastrophe and Trump’s conviction in the New York hush money trial. Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive stalwart, expressed confidence in Biden’s chances as long as he focuses on his plans for a second term to bolster the social safety net, slash drug prices and expand workers’ rights. “If he continues to talk about that, I think he gets reelected,” Sanders said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” With assistance from Bill Allison, Alicia Diaz, Jenny Leonard and Julie Fine. ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Corey Comperatore’s quick decision to use his body as a shield against the bullets flying toward his wife and daughter rang true to the close friends and neighbors who loved and respected the proud 50-year-old Trump supporter, noting that the Butler County resident was a “man of conviction.” “He’s a literal hero. He shoved his family out of the way, and he got killed for them,” said Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for the last eight years. “He’s a hero that I was happy to have as a neighbor.” Comperatore died Saturday during an attempt to kill Trump at Saturday’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. At least two other people were injured: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. Both were listed in stable condition as of Sunday. As support for Comeratore’s family began to pour in from across the country, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden also extended their “deepest condolences.” “He was a father. He was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired and he lost his life, God love him,” said Biden, who added he was praying for the full recovery of the wounded. Separately, Texas U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson said in a statement Sunday that his nephew was injured but “thankfully his injury was not serious.” “My family was sitting in the front, near where the President was speaking,” Jackson said. “They heard shots ringing out — my nephew then realized he had blood on his neck and something had grazed and cut his neck. He was treated by the providers in the medical tent.” The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter, who attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue. The former president was showing off a chart of border-crossing numbers when at least five shots were fired. Trump was seen holding his ear and got down on the ground. Agents quickly huddled in a shield around him. When he stood, his face bloodied, he pumped his fist to cheering supporters as he was whisked off stage by Secret Service agents. Trump later extended his condolences to Comperatore’s family. Randy Reamer, president of the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, called Comperatore “a stand-up guy” and “a true brother of the fire service.” He said Comperatore served as chief of the company for about three years but was also a life member, meaning he had served for more than 20 years. “Just a great all-around guy, always willing to help someone out,” Reamer said of Comperatore. “He definitely stood up for what he believed in, never backed down to anyone. … He was a really good guy.” A crew was power-washing the front of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company on Sunday with plans to install memorial drapery to honor the slain former chief. Assistant Chief Ricky Heasley of Sarver, who knew Comperatore for more than a decade, remembered him as very outgoing and full of life. “He never had a bad word,” Heasley said. And in the front yard of the Comperatores’ two-story home in Butler County, a small memorial had sprung up of a U.S. flag and small bunches of flowers. For Morehouse, Comperatore’s death was an emotional blow — but it also has inspired political action. Morehouse says he plans on casting a ballot for the first time in his life come November and he plans on checking Trump’s name. “As soon as I heard what happened and then learned that it was to Corey, I went upstairs as soon as I got home and I registered to vote,” Morehouse said. “This is the first time I’ve ever voted and I think it will be in his memory.” A GoFundMe launched to support Comperatore’s family had already surpassed more than $480,000 in donations as of Sunday. ___ Todt reported from Philadelphia and Kruesi from Nashville, Tennessee.

Mr Trump has already vowed to remain \"defiant in the face of wickedness\" and an investigation is underway. Here’s what we know so far. What happened at the Trump rally? The former president was delivering a campaign speech in the small town of Butler, Pennsylvania shortly after 6pm local time. A live video feed showed Mr Trump suddenly clutching his ear and members of the crowd screaming as a volley of shots rang out. Members of the audience had spotted the suspected shooter lying in a prone position on a rooftop in the car park north of the stage. Photos showed the presidential candidate raising his fist in the air, his face and ear bloodied, as members of the Secret Service surrounded him and escorted him off-stage. Analysis by the New York Times has suggested the shooter fired eight shots. Was anyone else injured? Mr Trump said in a post on Truth Social, his social platform, that the bullet \"pierced the upper part of my right ear\". The Secret Service said he was \"safe\" and that its personnel had killed the shooter during the incident. One audience member, volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore, was killed. The 50-year-old died shielding his family as the bullets rang out, according to officials and Pennsylvania state governor Josh Shapiro. \"The PA Trump rally claimed the life of my brother, Corey Comperatore,\" Mr Comperatore's sister wrote on social media. Mr Shapiro said Mr Comperatore was \"an avid supporter of the former president\". \"Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community and most especially Corey loves his family,\" Mr Shapiro said. Two others were hospitalised in critical condition. Pennsylvania State Police have since announced those injured victims are stable. Who was the shooter? Authorities have identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks as the shooter. Crooks lived in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about an hour's drive from the rally, and was a registered Republican. When he was 17 he made a $US15 donation to a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians. FBI officials said they believed he was acting alone and used an AR-style rifle purchased legally to carry out the assassination attempt. Dan Gryzbek, who represents the county council in Crooks's former neighbourhood, told the New York Times his mother was a Democrat and his father a Libertarian. Crooks had been working as a dietary aide at a rehabilitation centre in the area. The FBI has not identified a motive and said in a statement \"an active and ongoing investigation\" was underway. Residents of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania expressed shock at the news. \"It's a little crazy to think that somebody that did an assassination attempt is that close, but it just kind of shows the political dynamic that we're in right now with the craziness on each side,\" Wes Morgan, 42, told Reuters. \"Bethel Park is a pretty blue-collar type of area. And to think that somebody was that close is a little insane.\" How has Joe Biden reacted to the shooting? US President Joe Biden said he had spoken to Mr Trump following the incident and was \"sincerely grateful that he is doing well and recovering\". In televised remarks, Mr Biden said Mr Trump, as a former president who is the Republicans' presumptive nominee for president in the November 5 election, already received a heightened level of security. \"I've been consistent in my direction of the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety,\" he said. He said he had \"directed an independent review of the national security at yesterday's rally to assess exactly what happened\", the results of which will be shared with the public. According to Mr Biden, he has ordered the FBI to make their investigation thorough and swift. \"I urge everyone, everyone please, don't make assumptions about his motives or affiliations. Let the FBI do their job and their partner agencies do their job,\" he said. \"Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is more important than that right now — unity. What happens now? An investigation into the incident and the shooter's motivation is expected to take months. Mr Trump is now headed to Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention, where he is set to receive the official Republican nomination for president. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley told Fox News authorities were working together to safeguard the venue, where officials have spent months making security preparations. \"I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and The Republican National Convention, by two days,\" Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"But have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else. \"Therefore, I will be leaving for Milwaukee, as scheduled.\" The incident has also put the Secret Service under intense scrutiny. Mike Johnson, speaker of the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives, said panels in the chamber would call officials from the Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI for hearings. \"The American people deserve to know the truth,\" Mr Johnson said. Loading... A spokesman for the inspector-general's office did not respond to questions about whether it would launch its own inquiry. In a statement, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency had \"added protective resources\", \"technology\" and \"capabilities\". He also denied accusations the agency had rebuffed requests for more security resources from Mr Trump's team.

It is a peculiar choice for CONMEBOL, who suspended a handful of coaches earlier in the tournament -- including Argentina's Lionel Scaloni -- for delaying their teams' return to the pitch for the second half. The extended halftime break has not been welcomed by Colombia coach Nestor Lorenzo, who thinks it could hamper the players' rhythm in one of the biggest matches of their careers. \"When the rules change suddenly for both teams, when the pitch is bad for both sides or when the time to rest between halves is the same for both teams, I can't tell you if it's good or bad or who has an advantage,\" Lorenzo said in his pre-match comments on Saturday. \"I don't understand it to be honest. \"I think the halftime for the final should be 15 minutes because those are the rules.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump called for unity and resilience Sunday after an attempt on his life added fresh uncertainty to an already tumultuous presidential campaign and raised sharp questions about how a gunman was able to open fire from a rooftop near a Pennsylvania campaign rally. A full day after the shooting, the gunman’s motive was still a mystery, and investigators said they believe he acted alone. President Joe Biden ordered an independent security review of the attack, which left one bystander dead and two others critically wounded. The FBI was investigating the shooting as a potential act of domestic terrorism. The attack shook the firmament of the American political system, causing a reassessment and a detente — at least temporarily — of the heated 2024 presidential campaign that has grown increasingly vicious. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said the upper part of his right ear was pierced by a bullet. His aides said he was in “great spirits” and doing well, and he headed to Milwaukee to the Republican National Convention that begins Monday. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote on his social media site. “Much bleeding took place.” In a subsequent social post Sunday, Trump said: “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.” The rallygoer who was killed was identified as Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief from the area, according to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who added that Comperatore “died a hero.” “His wife shared with me that he dove on his family to protect them,” Shapiro said. He declined to discuss the condition of two others who were wounded. Biden, meanwhile, spoke briefly with Trump and was to address the nation Sunday evening. The president said the country would continue to debate and disagree, but stressed: “We must unite as one nation to demonstrate who we are.” FBI investigates shooting as possible domestic terrorism The FBI identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, which is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the scene of the shooting. The gunman had his father’s AR-style rifle and was perched atop a nearby roof when some rallygoers pointed him out to local law enforcement, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal probe. A local law enforcement officer climbed to the roof and found Crooks, who pointed the rifle at the officer. The officer then retreated down the ladder, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That’s when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, the officials said. Questions abounded about how the gunman could have gotten so close in the first place. Kevin Rojek, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office, said “it is surprising” that the gunman was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him. Bomb-making materials were found inside both Crooks’ vehicle and at his home. FBI described the devices as “rudimentary.” His motive remained unclear. Crooks wasn’t on the FBI’s radar, and he was believed to have acted alone. Investigators are combing through his social media feeds and his home, but so far have not found any threatening writing or posts. His family is cooperating. Crooks’ political leanings were also not clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $15 to a progressive political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021, the day President Joe Biden was sworn in as president. The absence of a clear ideological motive added to the deepening questions about the shooting, denying the public any swift or tidy conclusions about the shocking crime. Biden urged Americans to stay patient. “I urge everyone — everyone, please, don’t make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,” he said. Most serious assassination attempt since 1981 The attack was the most serious attempt to kill a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election. FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said agents are seeing increasingly violent rhetoric online since the rally and have seen people posing online as the shooter, who is dead. “We’re also focused on the continuing efforts — which were already substantial, given that they’re national security special events — to conventions in Chicago, in Milwaukee,” he said. Biden on Sunday ordered a security review of operations for the Republican National Convention, which is proceeding as planned. The Secret Service said they were “confident” in the security plan for the RNC, and no additional changes were planned. Trump flew to New Jersey after visiting a local Pennsylvania hospital, landing shortly after midnight in Newark. Video posted by an aide showed the former president leaving his private jet flanked by Secret Service agents and heavily armed members of the agency’s counterassault team, an unusually visible show of force by his protective detail. Biden, who is running against Trump, said the two men had a “short but good” conversation Saturday night. Biden returned to Washington from his Delaware beach home where he met with leaders in the Situation Room about the attack. He said during an address Sunday afternoon that “there is no place in America for this kind of violence.” “We cannot allow this to happen,” Biden said. Yet many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.” A person familiar with those remarks said the president was trying to make the point that Trump had gotten away with a light public schedule after last month’s debate while the president himself faced intense scrutiny from many even within his own party. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss private conversations. In the donor call, Biden said: “I have one job and that’s to beat Donald Trump … I’m absolutely certain I’m the best person to be able to do that.” Biden continued then: “So, we’re done talking about the debate. It’s time to put Trump in the bullseye. He’s gotten away with doing nothing for the last 10 days except ride around in his golf cart, bragging about scores he didn’t score … Anyway I won’t get into his golf game.” But it’s not clear yet whether Biden will be forced to recalibrate a campaign that’s largely focused on Trump as a threat to democracy. It is a situation the U.S. has not seen since Teddy Roosevelt was shot a month before the election in 1912 while campaigning trying to regain the White House as a third-party candidate. A rally disrupted by gunfire Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the gunfire began after 6:10 p.m. As the first pop rang out, Trump said “Oh” and raised his hand to his right ear and looked at it, before quickly crouching to the ground behind his lectern. The people in the stands behind him also crouched as screams rang through the crowd. Someone could be heard near the microphone saying, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents rushed to the stage. They piled atop the former president to shield him with their bodies as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat. Afterward, voices were heard saying, “Shooter’s down” several times, before someone asked, “Are we good to move?” and “Are we clear?” Then someone ordered, “Let’s move.” Trump got to his feet moments later and could be seen reaching with his right hand toward his face, which was streaked with blood. He then pumped his fist in the air and appeared to mouth the word “fight” twice to his crowd of supporters, prompting loud cheers and then chants of “USA. USA. USA.” His motorcade left the venue moments later. Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. In a statement Sunday, former first lady Melania Trump said that when she saw her husband wounded, “I realized my life, and Barron’s life, were on the brink of devastating change,” referring to their son. She said she was grateful to Secret Service agents and other law enforcement officers, and offered her “sincerest sympathy” to the families of the other victims. Witnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover When the firing began, “everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew. Everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump’s right on stage. As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. Eventually, first responders were able to carry the wounded person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. Reporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring. When it was clear the situation had been contained and Trump would not return to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. Police soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get “out now. This is a live crime scene.” Political violence again shakes America The perils of campaigning took on a new urgency after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump’s. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008. Presidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security, and Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate. The sniper teams who fired on the shooter, for example, do not usually travel with former presidents. Republican Rep. Mike Kelly, who represents the area where the shooting occurred, attended the rally with his wife and grandchildren and was just behind Trump when he was wounded. Kelly said he was “in a state of bewilderment of how and what has happened to the United States of America.” “I just wish people — tone it down,” he said. “Quit trying to find, to blame somebody. The blame lies somewhere in the psyche of America.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The FBI on Sunday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. The gunman, who officials said was killed by Secret Service personnel, fired multiple shots at the stage from an “elevated position outside of the rally venue,” the agency said. An Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos taken at the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking. A video posted to social media and geolocated by the AP shows Crooks’ body lying motionless on the roof of a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where Trump’s rally was held. A different image shows Crooks wearing a gray T-shirt with a black American flag on the right arm, with a bloody wound to his head. The roof was fewer than 150 meters (164 yards) from where Trump was speaking, a distance from which a decent marksman could reasonably hit a human-sized target. For reference, 150 meters is a distance at which U.S. Army recruits must hit a human-sized silhouette to qualify with the M16 assault rifle in basic training. The AR-style rifle, like that of the gunman at the Trump rally, is the semiautomatic civilian version of the military M16. President Joe Biden said Sunday he has directed an independent review of the security at the rally. Biden said he also directed the U.S. Secret Service to review all security measures for the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday in Milwaukee. Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, the Secret Service’s coordinator for the convention, told reporters later the agency was satisfied with what she called its comprehensive planning for the Republican convention. Biden urged Americans not to make assumptions about the motive of the shooter. He said investigators are working swiftly to investigate the attack. “Unity is the most elusive goal of all,” he said, but “nothing is more important than that right now.” Calls for an investigation came from all sides. Rep. Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday raising questions about the shooting and demanding information about the former president’s Secret Service protection. “The seriousness of this security failure and chilling moment in our nation’s history cannot be understated,” Green wrote. The Secret Service did not have a speaker at a news conference Saturday night where FBI and Pennsylvania State Police officials briefed reporters on the shooting investigation. FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was “surprising” that the gunman was able to fire at the stage before he was killed. Members of the Secret Service’s counter-sniper team and counterassault team were at the rally, according to two law enforcement officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss details of the investigation. The heavily armed counterassault team, whose Secret Service code name is “Hawkeye,” is responsible for eliminating threats so that other agents can shield and take away the person they are protecting. The counter-sniper team, known by the code name “Hercules,” uses long-range binoculars and is equipped with sniper rifles to deal with long-range threats. Mayorkas said his department and the Secret Service are working with law enforcement to investigate the shooting. Maintaining the security of presidential candidates and their campaign events is one of the department’s “most vital priorities,” he said. “We condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms and commend the Secret Service for their swift action today,” Mayorkas said. “We are engaged with President Biden, former President Trump and their campaigns, and are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.“ Green also noted reports that the Secret Service had rebuffed requests from the Trump campaign for additional security. A spokesman for the Secret Service, Anthony Guglielmi, said on X Sunday that those allegations were “absolutely false” and that they had added resources and technology as the campaign’s travel increased. Green said he would be talking with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Sunday. Former top Secret Service agents told The AP that Crooks should never have been allowed to gain access to the roof, and the agency will have to figure out how that happened. They said such a lapse could have been caused by officers neglecting their posts or a flaw in the event’s security plan. The agency is “going to have to go through the security plan and interview a number of people from the director on down” to figure out what went wrong, said Stephen Colo, who retired in 2003 as an assistant director after a 27-year career in the service. Colo said presidential candidates and former presidents don’t typically get the same level of protection as the sitting president. In fact, Colo said he was surprised that the agency had staffed the event with a counter-sniper team. Such a valuable resource — there are not many of those highly trained agents — is usually reserved for the president. Candidates don’t usually get such teams. Timothy McCarthy, a former agent who retired from the agency in 1994, said the Secret Service “better be doing a deep dive into what happened there and doing whatever it takes to figure it out” because the gunman should not have been able to occupy such a vantage point. “How did that person get up on that building?” said McCarthy, 75, who in 1981 took a bullet when President Ronald Reagan was shot outside the Washington Hilton Hotel. “How did that happen? I mean, that’s the key to the entire thing. And what measures were put in place to prevent it?” James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who is the House Oversight Committee chairman, said he contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and called on Cheatle to appear for a hearing. Comer said his committee will send a formal invitation soon. “Political violence in all forms is un-American and unacceptable. There are many questions and Americans demand answers,” Comer said in a statement. U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called for investigating “security failures” at the rally. “The federal government must constantly learn from security failures in order to avoid repeating them, especially when those failures have implications for the nation,” Torres said. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, posted on X that he and his staff are in contact with security planning coordinators ahead of the Republican National Convention set to begin Monday in Milwaukee. “We cannot be a country that accepts political violence of any kind — that is not who we are as Americans,” Evers said. The FBI said it will lead the investigation into the shooting, working with the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department “will bring every available resource to bear to this investigation.” “My heart is with the former President, those injured, and the family of the spectator killed in this horrific attack,” Garland said in a statement. “We will not tolerate violence of any kind, and violence like this is an attack on our democracy.” ___ Associated Press writers Del Quentin Wilber, Colleen Long and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.

We just must pray that no housebound aging Democrat effs it up. (Me, I added that.) Donald: “Look, my ear will be fine. I’m told it’s salvageable. It’s good. Doctors in the hospital, which is where they took me, checked. They’ve said it’s not dead. The hearing’s still OK. However, there is a possibility you just might notice it could have a very slightly different look when you face me.” He laughed, then: “Who knows, it maybe could end up in a somewhat different shape.” Donald Trump.

A spokesperson for Trump's campaign said on Saturday that the former president was \"fine\" and was \"being checked out at a local medical facility.\" Trump was released from the hospital later that night.The suspected gunman, now identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot and killed by the Secret Service. A rally attendee, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore was also killed during the incident. Those injured, now identified as 57-year-old David Dutch of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are currently in stable condition.The FBI has classified the shooting as an assassination attempt and is working as the lead agency on the investigation alongside the Secret Service and local law enforcement.According to the FBI, Crooks fired his gun from an elevated position outside the rally venue. Witnesses reported seeing a man climbing to the roof of a nearby building and warned local police before the shooting occurred. According to a report from the Associated Press on Sunday, a local police officer encountered Crooks on the roof, but retreated when Crooks pointed his rifle at him. Shortly after, Crooks fired toward Trump, prompting Secret Service snipers to shoot him. The AP spoke to two law enforcement officials on condition of anonymity.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) conducted an urgent trace on the firearm recovered at the scene. Law enforcement sources indicate the weapon was likely purchased by Crooks' father at least six months ago, though investigators are still working to determine when and how Crooks obtained possession of the gun.Newsweek has contacted the FBI and ATF via email on Sunday for further comment.Meanwhile, bomb-making materials were discovered in Crooks' vehicle and at his home, with officials describing these devices as \"rudimentary.\" The Bethel Park Police Department evacuated neighboring residences and closed off the area around Crooks' home as a precautionary measure earlier on Sunday.On Sunday during a press conference with reporters, the FBI stated that it has not yet determined a motive for the shooting. It believes Crooks acted alone and was not previously on the bureau's radar. Investigators are combing through his social media feeds, but have not found any threatening writing or social media posts thus far.Crooks' background presents a complex picture. He was a registered Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports show he made a small donation to a progressive political action committee (PAC) in January 2021.The shooter's family is cooperating with federal investigators, which could prove crucial in understanding Crooks' background, motivations, and recent activities.The FBI is treating this as an attempted assassination of a former president and an act of domestic terrorism. They are exploring all possible motives, including political extremism, and investigating whether Crooks had any connections to extremist groups.As the investigation continues, the FBI has promised regular updates to the public and has emphasized that while it is working diligently to uncover all aspects of the case, the process may take time due to the complexity of the evidence and the high-profile nature of the target.As the Republican National Convention (RNC) begins on Monday, security concerns have taken center stage. The GOP leadership has announced that additional safety measures will be implemented for the duration of the convention, working closely with federal and local law enforcement agencies.President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of security measures at the rally, highlighting the need for Americans to stand united against political violence.The assassination attempt has reignited debates about gun control and the tone of political discourse in the United States.

There have been years of calls for “structural reforms” as China aims to advance into high-quality growth. Looking back, what do you think have been the hits and misses in terms of economic reform? I initially was very excited about the significant number of reforms that came out of the third plenum of the 18th Central Committee in November 2013. It was President Xi Jinping’s first real major effort to formulate policies and reforms that we thought would lead to major structural shifts in the Chinese economy. Now, nearly 11 years later, I would have to say that while the Chinese economy has progressed on many fronts, the implementation of those reforms has been disappointing. I think the critique that was raised by former Premier Wen Jiabao in March of 2007 – when he warned that the Chinese economy, while strong on the surface, was “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable” – those issues remain unresolved. In particular, I think failure of the third plenum of November 2013 was more on the structure of the demand side – the incredibly low level of household consumption as a share of GDP. That has not been addressed and that remains an enduring problem for China’s structural reform imperatives. What, then, do you think have been meaningful structural changes? There has been a lot of effort made to address structural issues in China since 2013, there is no question about that. China has continued to grow, although of course, the growth rate is now considerably slower than it was in the 31 years from 1980 to 2011. But I think the biggest change in my view, over that period, has been the recognition that the focus needs to shift, and in many respects has shifted from the quantity to the quality of growth. There comes a point, as I think Xi indicated in a recent article in the party journal Qiushi, that when the expansion of quality reaches a certain stage, that it is critically important to focus on quality. The quality of growth I think is best addressed, as Xi has put it, through boosting total factor productivity (TFP). That is a big challenge for China because TFP has now been declining for about a decade. It is critically important that it be reversed in China and return to a phase of increasing TFP as was evident in the first decade of this century. TFP growth was very strong starting in 2000, coinciding with the aftermath of China’s accession to the World Trade Organization. Reading from the Penn World Table, from 2000 to 2010, the average growth rate was 4.6 per cent. It was spectacular. And then from 2011 to 2019, a nine-year period, TFP declined by 1.4 per cent on average. What are your expectations for the coming third plenum? In looking at sort of the early indications of where the third plenum of 2024 is headed, and I tried to read the party journal Qiushi as much as I can, the focus seems much more on the supply side than on the demand side. I don’t minimise the importance of focusing on the supply side, especially the high quality development that Xi continues to emphasise through new productive forces. He indicates in his own statements and supporting articles that the emphasis is very much aimed at boosting total factor productivity, which is important. So I’m not critical of that. But what is missing is an equal focus on the demand side, especially internal private consumption, where the share of GDP remains below 40 per cent. I think this is a serious challenge that was not taken up in the third plenum of 2013, and I hope it would be given much more focus in next month’s third plenum. You refer to TFP a lot when discussing China’s economy. Can you explain why that is a significant metric? First of all, it’s the broadest measure of improved efficiency in any economy – China, the US, Europe, Japan. It is the output that is produced in excess of the contributions made by increased employment and increased investment. It reflects the magic of innovation, technological change, the emergence of new industries, the power of entrepreneurial spirit – all of which combine to create economic output beyond that which can be accounted for just by increasing the factors of production: land, labour and capital. So, it’s a very important and broad measure of the magic of economic growth and development. TFP is particularly important now for China, because of the demographic pressures that have led to a contraction in the working-age population that began in 2015, and is projected by most demographers to continue through the end of this century. That is an outgrowth of the population distortion traceable largely to the “one-child” family planning policy, which has now been disbanded. But it will take a long time for increased birth rates – assuming they do occur, which has not yet been the case – to change that demographic picture around. So when an economy is experiencing a declining population among its working age cohort, the only way that it can really boost or support strong economic growth is by increasing productivity. When the workforce is declining, productivity growth is absolutely critical for getting more out of the economy. We learned that painfully in watching the three last decades of economic growth in Japan, where their working-age population peaked in the 1990s as Japanese TFP growth was stagnating. And so the failure of Japan to offset the weak population by increased TFP was a critical structural impediment to economic growth. While China is not Japan for many reasons, it is facing a similar challenge with a declining working age population and weak TFP. There is a certain urgency here to facing up to that. How does China’s TFP reflect the challenges faced by the Chinese economy? What we’ve seen in recent years is a shift in the mix of industries in China, away from private sector companies, back to state-owned enterprises. Historically, state-owned enterprises have much lower productivity growth than the privately owned enterprises. If this trend, which has been evident in the last several years, continues, then China risks shifting the structure of its economy to its low-productivity growth sector. That would really complicate President Xi’s objectives to boost overall TFP. The final thing I will say about this is that the private sector, over the past three years, has been under increased regulatory scrutiny, especially the internet platform companies. Historically, these are the highest productivity growth segments of the Chinese economy. So that clearly needs to be addressed if China is to put in place reforms that unleash or unshackle the “animal spirit” of high productivity growth from private enterprises. So, I’m pleased that there is focus on TFP but it’s almost urgent, trying to deliver reforms that are aligned with a resumption of strong TFP growth, especially in the current climate of an ageing and shrinking working age population. At the moment, land reform, power system reform, corporate governance, technological self-reliance, and tax reform are believed by many to be on the cards at the third plenum. How do you expect these issues to be addressed? I think there’s a likelihood that there will be a large number of reforms that touch on most, if not all the issues that you mentioned and even far more than that. I think that’s encouraging. But again, I have a pretty narrow focus on what I’m looking for in the third plenum reforms. What I would like to see is a focus on two major objectives. One, boosting TFP for the reasons that I’ve already articulated, but secondly, boosting private household consumption. TFP without consumption is a recipe for continued unbalanced growth in China, which ultimately is not sustainable, and would be a worrisome outcome. What I’m hopeful for would be a more balanced economy, where the consumption share of Chinese GDP is well above 45 per cent on its way to 50 per cent. If that is accompanied by a resumption of strong TFP growth, then, I think the structure of the Chinese economy will be in much better shape heading to all the important millennial targets of 2049 than is the case today. China has been an investment-driven economy, especially when property and infrastructure construction were at their peak. By comparison, the US is a service-led economy. Now that China is attempting to transition more towards a service and consumer-driven economy, how can it be done – or at least fast-forwarded? The main impediment to consumer-led Chinese economic growth that I have focused on – and I have written papers and made presentations in Beijing about this for years – is the lack of a strong social safety net, especially medical care and retirement. The emphasis by Chinese authorities has been to boost enrolment in medical and health plans. But both – the medical plan in particular – are still highly fragmented by city and province. The benefits have been inadequate. As a result, there is an excess of household savings and that I think is a reflection of the fear of an uncertain future. Economists call that precautionary saving. The precaution comes for good reason, because the benefits are inadequate, especially now as workers and heads of household are getting older and the reality of retirement is, for many, extremely close at hand. I would add a third aspect of the safety net issue which needs to be addressed, and that is the imperative of hukou [household registration] reform. Currently, there are nearly 300 million migrant workers lacking benefits in the cities that they’re working in. That also, I think, builds a bias toward excess fear-driven precautionary saving by this very large segment of the Chinese workforce. I think hukou reform should be an equally important aspect of the need to boost household consumption through structural reform. What might be the consequences if China struggles to boost private household consumption to around 45 per cent, like you suggested? Does it increase the likelihood that it gets stuck in the ‘middle-income trap’? I don’t think we really know the answer. A lot has been written over the years about the middle-income trap. And there are actually those who believe that it’s blown out of proportion. There are a lot of considerations that drive and sustain growth and development. China has clearly moved through successfully many of the thresholds associated with this middle income barrier. With China’s [global growth] share coming down, you have to ask yourself, who is filling the void? But I think the consensus among economists, both inside and outside China, is that to keep pushing right now through this barrier that many have associated with the middle-income trap – correctly or not – requires a shift from imported to indigenous innovation. And I think if China fails at indigenous innovation – and there’s no reason to believe that’s going to be the case, as I think China’s progress on indigenous innovation is very, very impressive – that would be more problematic for a low- or middle-income trap than a failure to boost household consumption. There is a notion that as long as China maintains gross domestic product growth of around 5 per cent annually in the short term, and at least 4 per cent growth until 2035, it can overtake the US to be the world’s largest economy. Can it? So many people, especially in China, always ask me that question: “when will China overtake the US?” First of all, given a population that is more than four times the size of the US, it is pretty astonishing that China has not already overtaken the US. The real question for the Chinese people, I think, is convergence on a per-capita basis. And that is not feasible for many decades, if at all. But in terms of nominal dollar base GDP, it is perfectly possible and quite likely that that will occur at some point in the 2030s. Whether it is the early part of the decade or the latter part of the decade is dependent on some of the things we’ve already discussed, especially the TFP issue and the rebalancing toward internal private consumption. It is also dependent on the currency. The renminbi has been weak, and that has – together with a little bit of deflation, as measured by the GDP deflator in the past couple of years – caused many people, myself included, to push out the date of convergence from our earlier estimates. What does it mean for China and the world if China’s growth continues to decelerate? China had a period of spectacular growth from 1980 to 2011. And even after that, when the world was in the aftershocks of the global financial crisis, China’s power as an engine of global growth was extraordinary. By my calculations, from 2010 to 2019, China accounted for 32 to 33 per cent of cumulative growth in world GDP. That was extraordinary, and an unprecedented contribution for any developing emerging economy in any historical context. But now, the rest of the world has healed and China’s growth has slowed. The contribution has been reduced. So now China is contributing roughly 24 per cent of growth, which is still the strongest in the world, but not the 32 to 33 per cent that it had been contributing. With China’s share coming down, you have to ask yourself, who is filling the void? The one economy that stands out where the global growth contribution is now sharply on the rise is India. India is still contributing less to global growth than China. But if the International Monetary Fund’s forecast is to be believed, by the end of the 2020s, India and China will almost be on par in terms of their contributions to world GDP growth. So does that mean that the power of the global economy is shifting from China to India? No, it doesn’t. It simply means that India is now emerging as a much stronger source of global growth, but it has got its own problems to address. Its per-capita GDP is well below that of China’s, and while it has made big improvements in infrastructure, they lag dramatically behind the quality of Chinese infrastructure. India saves considerably less as a nation than China, and that leaves India with less ability to fund the investment that it needs to sustain growth in the years ahead. So it is not as if China has lost its role as the dominant source of global growth to the upstart Indian economy. But certainly China is not delivering to the extent that it did during that 10-year period from 2010 to 2019. In the past year or so, there have been increasing concerns about China’s so-called overcapacity in the new energy sector. Do you share that view? Unfortunately, I think that the politicians have done a great disservice in focusing on overcapacity or excess capacity, because they have taken an economic concept and turned it into a political attack. First of all, the accusation that any nation has excess capacity in green technologies at a time when the world is suffering horrific climate change is absurd. I mean, climate change itself is a visible sign that the world is deficient in the low-carbon capacity it needs to address a serious greenhouse emissions problem. There can be no excess capacity in low-carbon alternative energy products in a world afflicted with the existential climate change that we are experiencing. I don’t care who produces it, whether it’s China or North Korea or Russia, we need as much green technology as possible to address the problem. Politicians who want to restrict a nation like China, which provides green technology at low cost and high quality in areas like electric vehicles (EVs) and solar batteries, that is purely a political agenda that makes no sense from an economic comparative advantage point of view. Now there’s one other aspect of this, and that is the excess capacity argument in the West, which goes after China for subsidising green technologies, whether they’re direct government subsidies or produced by subsidised state-owned enterprises. And yet, the US is doing the same thing. We have rediscovered industrial policy with our own American characteristics – namely the Inflation Reduction Act, the tax credit that we’ve had in place for EVs, the massive federal loan that Elon Musk received from the federal government to build or to support Tesla during its more difficult years, the Chips and Sciences Act. We are just as aggressive and now subsidising industries that we think are just as vital to our competitive future as China does. There is a clear hypocrisy in this notion of going after excess capacity. Is that why you called the US’ recent tariff hikes on Chinese green technology a ‘blunder” in earlier public remarks? It is a blunder for two reasons. One, we’re protecting our own industries, which have been slow to get started and are not cost-efficient compared to their counterparts in China even after making adjustments for subsidies on both sides of the competitive spectrum. It is a blunder also because we are taxing green technology at a time when the world wants us to expand the supply of green technology to address an existential problem. This could be a blunder of historic proportions for a variety of reasons, but those are the ones that I think are most important. How has the US presidential election campaign weighed on US-China trade and economic relations? And how is that going to shape the relations of the two powers in the longer term? There is no question that China will be a lightning rod in the next few months in this election campaign, and anti-China policies are attractive, unfortunately, to Republicans and Democrats alike. There are very few issues that have bipartisan support in the US political system other than going after China. The big question I think will be – presuming we can make it through November without a serious problem – is what happens to US policies, US-China tensions post-November 2024. I remain very concerned. I think that we have really sort of crossed the threshold of finding a workable resolution of this conflict, unless we figure out a new way for the two countries to re-engage one another based on trust and collaboration. As to your concerns on “a new forever war” on trade between China and he US, is that still avoidable? That remains to be seen. I was very critical of the Trump administration for starting the trade war, but I’ve been equally critical of the Biden administration for continuing to prosecute the trade war and – if anything – escalating actions against China through sanctions on technology, and now these new tariffs on alternative energy products. For Joe Biden, who promised an end to America’s “forever wars” when he withdrew troops from Afghanistan, it looks to me like he is risking that when it comes to the trade war with China. He’s continuing to prosecute and escalate Trump’s trade war with a strategy that is very disappointingly similar to the one embraced by his predecessor. And who would you like to see as US president next? I’d rather not use this as a platform to make a political statement. I would be very worried about the extreme positions that former President Trump has staked out thus far in this campaign season. I do think that Trump’s talk of 60 per cent tariffs on China would have devastating consequences for both nations, and for supply chains that run through China in terms of their global impact as well. So that’s certainly a very worrisome outcome should he be elected again. If we can avoid an eruption of further tensions … we will have an opportunity to take a deep breath and consider a better approach What is your immediate wish for China-US relations? I think my immediate wish is no further damage between now and the election. Make every effort to limit the fallout, especially in light of worrisome issues right now in the South China Sea – especially in the Philippines – and once again in the Taiwan Strait. The drumbeat continues to get louder and louder in Washington and I think if we can just avoid an eruption of further tensions and a degradation in the relationship between now and the election, we will then have an opportunity to hopefully take a deep breath and consider a better approach. Last question. You said in an opinion piece that you used to be a China optimist. How would you describe yourself now? I would say that I am not a pessimist. I don’t believe in “the China crash” or “China disaster” scenario. I don’t believe that China is the next Japan, although I worry about several characteristics that have an eerie similarity. I would say, for lack of a better term, I’m more guarded in my assessment of China than before. I have been more cautious, more worried, in many of the areas we have discussed. But I would like nothing more than to be able to resume my former optimistic stance on China. But to do that, China’s structural growth challenges must be addressed. Only then would I be open to changing my mind again.","summary":"Economist Stephen Roach talks China’s third plenum, its long-term growth prospects and why efforts to limit its green tech development are hypocritical.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3270265/stephen-roach-how-beijing-can-right-its-economic-course-and-us-big-china-blunder","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/12/d5752bcf-49af-48fb-aa13-c39e76d9c400_8c0cbec3.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/06/21/China%20Middle%20Class%20explainer_1.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-14 22:00:17","author":"Kinling Lo","authors":["Kinling Lo"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":251757016,"title":"‘Massive security breach’: Secret Service under fire after gunman got clear shot at Trump","text":"“Why is there not Secret Service on all of these roofs here?” asked Smith, who described trying to alert authorities for three to four minutes. “This is not a big place. ... Security failure — 100 percent security failure.” As investigators dig into those accounts, it will be vital to scour radio traffic from local and state police as well as the Secret Service. How much time elapsed from the first reports until word reached the agents? Was there a communications breakdown? The last time the Secret Service’s handling of a high-profile situation drew as much scrutiny came after Jan. 6, 2021, when a security sweep overlooked a pipe bomb planted outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters as then Vice President-elect Kamala Harris entered the area. The agency drew bipartisan fury after congressional investigators discovered that the phones of dozens of high-level officials and agents were wiped in the weeks after the attack. The Jan. 6 select committee also obtained Secret Service radio recordings to determine how agents moved then-Vice President Mike Pence to safety amid the chaos. In the attempted assassination this weekend, questions are also swirling about whether the counter-sniper team moved quickly enough to locate the shooter and open fire. Audio of the event and witness accounts suggest the suspect may have gotten off as many as seven shots before he was killed. At a press conference late Saturday, the FBI special-agent-in-charge of the investigation, Kevin Rojek, called it “surprising” that so many shots could be fired at a highly secured presidential event. Relatedly, there are questions about whether Trump’s Secret Service detail moved fast enough to secure him and if they followed correct procedure. After the shooting, agents quickly covered Trump behind what experts say appeared to be a ballistic barrier. That’s what’s called for by the Service’s long-established “cover and evacuate” protocol. But as the agents began to evacuate Trump, they twice exposed his chest and body to the crowd. That may have been an error considering the possibility of multiple shooters. “Clearly USSS failed at the basics of a secure perimeter and once shots were fired their extraction was clumsy and left DJT highly exposed to follow on attacks,” said former Navy SEAL and founder of the Blackwater security firm Erik Prince in a post on X. Another certain area of focus for investigators will be whether Crooks had any prior encounters with law enforcement. After nearly every high-profile shooting or terrorism incident, FBI leaders now brace for word on whether its databases reflect any encounters or tips about the suspect, fearing it will mean recriminations for the agency if it failed to sufficiently follow up. During a briefing for journalists on Sunday, officials said they had found no contacts with Crooks or reports about him. Social media is also awash in wild speculation about the shooter’s motive. Trump’s allies have been quick to suggest a link between Joe Biden’s rhetoric and Saturday’s violence. But, as yet, there’s been no evidence publicly unearthed to shed insight into the attack. “We don’t yet have any information about the motive of the shooter,” Biden said during a White House appearance. “I urge everyone — everyone, please: Don’t make assumptions about his motives or affiliations. Let the FBI do their job.” Precisely, how far-ranging the FBI investigation will be was unclear from the briefing Sunday. Rojek, the top FBI agent in Pittsburgh, said his agency is zeroing in on the shooting itself and not broader issues of security tactics or procedures.","summary":"How a gunman could scale a roof where Trump was speaking prompts calls for investigation.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/14/secret-service-trump-shooting-rally-00168158","image":"https://static.politico.com/b5/63/5f9b5c314b1ca8dabbec999f7826/election-2024-trump-96414.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:51:36","author":"Josh Gerstein,Kyle Cheney","authors":["Josh Gerstein","Kyle Cheney"],"language":"en","source_country":"eu","sentiment":-0.566},{"id":251755964,"title":"Failure to intercept Trump shooter either ‘malice or incompetence’: Betsy DeVos’s brother","text":"Erik Prince, brother of Betsy DeVos, sharply criticized the U.S. Secret Service and other security agencies following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The brother of the former secretary to the Department of Education under Trump condemned the Secret Service‘s failure to prevent the shooter from getting within 150 yards of Trump, labeling it as “either malice or massive incompetence.” Prince, who founded the private security company Blackwater, argued that Trump survived only due to a miscalculation by the shooter, whose bullet grazed Trump’s ear instead of hitting him in the head. He emphasized that the Secret Service’s handling of the situation was inadequate, claiming that a counter-sniper’s hesitation and lack of coordination were evident during the incident. “Hopefully after the tragedy yesterday in Butler [Pennsylvania] we can all recognize that unaccountable bloated bureaucracies continue to fail us as Americans,” Prince stated. He criticized the security perimeter and the response time, highlighting the chaotic evacuation that left Trump exposed to further danger. Prince drew on his experience in providing diplomatic security, arguing that the basics of securing a perimeter were not executed properly. He called for accountability and a shift toward merit-based hiring and leadership in security agencies. In the wake of the shooting, President Joe Biden has directed the Secret Service to review all security measures for this week’s Republican National Convention and launched an independent review of the security at the rally. The FBI is leading the investigation into the attempted assassination, and there are growing calls from Congress for investigations into the security failures. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and other lawmakers have demanded a full investigation, with hearings expected to feature testimony from Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI later this month. The incident has raised concerns about the adequacy of security protocols for high-profile political events, especially with the upcoming convention. Prince’s post comes as the Associated Press reported Sunday an account from sources that described shocking details that allegedly occurred moments before the shooting took place. A group of rallygoers reportedly saw the suspect climb to the top of a roof of a nearby building and warned local law enforcement, two law enforcement officials told the outlet. One law enforcement officer climbed a ladder and saw the suspect lying on the roof, who proceeded to point his rifle at the officer. The officer ducked down the ladder, and the shooter quickly took shots toward Trump. At that point, Secret Service counter-snipers began to shoot at him, officials said under the condition of anonymity. The Secret Service has said there were four counter-sniper teams: two from the agency and two from local law enforcement on the ground. The agency has also said Cheatle was in Milwaukee at the time of the shooting, where this week’s Republican National Convention is being held. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The shooting has been described by sources as coming from the “three o’clock” position of Trump’s podium location, with shots coming from his right side about 150 meters away, according to CNN. After gunfire began, counter-snipers began shooting at the suspect, who was found dead on the roof of an American Glass Research building outside the perimeter of the rally. Authorities have identified the shooter as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents after firing multiple rounds, resulting in injuries to Trump and the death of a bystander. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on how the shooter obtained rooftop access and evaded security measures.","summary":"Erik Prince, brother of Betsy DeVos, sharply criticized the U.S. Secret Service and other security agencies following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

President Joe Biden’s campaign raced to pull his television ads off the airwaves nationwide and paused all official outbound communications — no fundraising appeals, no news releases. An internal Biden campaign edict asked all staff members to “refrain from issuing any comments on social media or in public,” as did similar internal guidance from the Trump campaign. Biden, who was in church at the time of the shooting, condemned the violence as “sick” in a brief address to the nation from a local police department in Delaware, changing plans and returning to the White House after midnight. He and Trump spoke late Saturday, a call that a White House official described as “good, respectful and brief.” Trump issued his own graphic recounting of the searing moment in a social media post — “I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin” — as he returned to New Jersey before the Republican National Convention that officials said would continue as planned on Monday in Milwaukee. “I will Never Surrender!” Trump wrote in a text message to supporters. His top two advisers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, wrote in a public statement on Saturday night that Trump would still be joining his supporters at the convention. And in an internal message to Trump campaign staff, they wrote that they were “enhancing the armed security presence with 24/7 officers on-site” at both the Washington and West Palm Beach, Florida, campaign offices. LaCivita, in a text message early Sunday, said the assassination attempt would not alter convention planning. “Changes nothing,” he said. Of course, the shooting did change the complexion of the race. But in the immediate aftermath, questions surrounding how it will play out politically generated far more speculation than answers. What was certain is that the nation was confronting anew the ugly and rising tide of violence in American politics. The shooting came at what already felt like a deeply consequential crossroads in a 2024 campaign that has had its fair share of them. Trump this year became the first former president convicted of felonies. Biden has been besieged by his fellow Democrats as the party’s standard-bearer ever since a faltering debate more than two weeks ago. And Trump is preparing to name his running mate and formally claim his party’s nomination for the third consecutive election. But all of that paled in comparison to the first shooting of a current or former president since Ronald Reagan in 1981. “America, the fabric of our gentle nation is tattered,” Melania Trump, the former first lady, said in a rare public statement Sunday. The photographs of Trump rising back up after the shooting were indelible: His face bloodied, one hand high in defiance, the other clutching a red “Make America Great Again” hat, the American flag flying in the background. “Fight! Fight! Fight!” Trump mouthed as he pumped his fist in the air. Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley suggested that those images would, for many voters, overwrite any sullying of Trump as a felon with a new picture of him “as the wounded martyr of Butler, Pennsylvania.” Brinkley, a professor at Rice University who has been critical of Trump in the past, pointed to his presence of mind in the minutes after he was wounded. “Many people would have been much more shaken,” he said. “Trump realized it was a chance to be a profile of courage.” He added: “It is a huge boost for his presidential campaign in a grim and surreal way.” Some Republicans celebrated the fist-raised photographs as raw symbols of his strength and instinct. “Trump’s chances of losing just went to zero,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, wrote on the social platform X. Trump and other allies rushed to suggest divine intervention. A series of photographs from The New York Times appeared to capture the bullet that struck Trump, his wincing and then finding blood on his hands after touching his ear. His daughter-in-law Lara Trump, whom he appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee, posted a rendering of what appears to be Jesus holding Donald Trump’s shoulders on Instagram with the caption, “Fear not for I am with you.” On Sunday, Trump himself posted on Truth Social: “It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening.” The shooting was refracted through the lens of politics almost instantly. Some Republicans blamed Democrats or the news media for stoking hatred and fear of Trump. Federal law enforcement officials had identified the gunman early Sunday but not a motive. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who is on the shortlist of candidates whom Trump is considering as a running mate, wrote on X. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Biden, who ran for president hoping to heal some of the nation’s deep divisions, said Saturday evening that “there is no place in America for this kind of violence.” “It’s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country,” he said. “We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.” It was unclear how the shooting would affect Biden’s intensive efforts to reunite his party behind him after a faltering debate performance that raised questions about his mental acuity and competence as a campaigner. Could the shooting, for instance, slow the attempts to remove him as nominee, as the party waited to see if the president could play the role of uniter-in-chief in a crisis? Biden addressed the nation from the White House midday on Sunday and announced that he would speak from the Oval Office in the evening. He is also scheduled to sit for a nationally televised interview on Monday with Lester Holt on NBC, though he canceled a planned trip to Texas. “An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation,” Biden said. “Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is more important than that now.” After a Thursday news conference meant to reassure wavering Democrats, Biden had spent Friday and Saturday making his case to various factions of his party in a series of private meetings. “We spoke frankly to the president about our concerns and asked tough questions about the path forward,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, after the group met with Biden on Saturday. She pointedly did not offer an endorsement. Most Democrats, who have repeatedly warned that Trump’s return to the White House would be an existential threat to the nation, followed Biden’s lead in silencing their attacks on Trump and condemning the shooting. The number of top elected officials who have experienced political violence was a stark reminder of the increasing fragility of peaceful democracy in America. A violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol to block the certification of the last election in 2020, and Trump has been indicted over his role in trying to overturn the election. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose husband was attacked inside their home in San Francisco in 2022, said Saturday that, “As one whose family has been the victim of political violence, I know firsthand that political violence of any kind has no place in our society. I thank God that former President Trump is safe.” Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was shot in the head more than a decade ago in an assassination attempt, said in a statement, “Political violence is un-American and is never acceptable — never.” And Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana., the House majority leader who was shot in 2017 when a gunman opened fire on Republican members of the congressional baseball team during a practice, was among those who cast blame on Democrats. “It’s been an all-out assault on Donald Trump the person for years now and it adds up,” Scalise said on Fox News, warning of the “hypercharged rhetoric on the left.” One spectator was killed in the shooting Saturday and two others were critically wounded. Aides said Trump had authorized a GoFundMe page for victims that quickly zoomed past $700,000 raised. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said House Republicans would immediately conduct an investigation into the Secret Service, calling the director, as well as other top Homeland Security and FBI officials, to testify. He also sought in an interview on NBC to “turn the rhetoric down.” “We’ve got to turn the temperature down in this country,” Johnson said. Christine Toretti, a Republican National committeeperson who attended the Butler rally, had met with Trump beforehand, bringing along the 95-year-old mother of a man being held in a Russian prison for a marijuana infraction. “I thought, gee, this is a good thing I did today even though it is hot as hell,” Toretti recalled thinking as the rally began. Trump had assured Malphine Fogel, who lives in Butler County, that he would help get her son home. Then the bullets rang out. “I thought I was in a dream and it seemed like it went slow motion,” she said, recalling that Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania, tried to cover them as the shooting unfolded. “A lot of people were saying, ‘Is this the way our country is going? Why do we treat each other the way we do?’” she said. “We need to be better than who we are right now.”","summary":"The assassination attempt of Donald Trump on Saturday at his rally in Pennsylvania plunged the 2024 presidential race into a state of shock and uncertainty.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/14/shooting-plunges-an-already-tumultuous-campaign-into-shock-and-uncertainty/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/unnamed-file-789.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:47:37","author":"The New York Times News Service Syndicate","authors":["The New York Times News Service Syndicate"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":251757130,"title":"Former fire chief who died at Trump rally used his body to shield family from gunfire","text":"Corey Comperatore’s quick decision to use his body as a shield against the bullets flying toward his wife and daughter rang true to the close friends and neighbors who loved and respected the proud 50-year-old Trump supporter, noting that the Butler County resident was a “man of conviction.” “He’s a literal hero. He shoved his family out of the way, and he got killed for them,” said Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for the last eight years. “He’s a hero that I was happy to have as a neighbor.” Comperatore died Saturday during an attempt to kill Trump at Saturday’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. At least two other people were injured: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. Both were listed in stable condition as of Sunday. As support for Comeratore’s family began to pour in from across the country, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden also extended their “deepest condolences.” “He was a father. He was protecting his family from the bullets that were being fired and he lost his life, God love him,” said Biden, who added he was praying for the full recovery of the wounded. Separately, Texas U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson said in a statement Sunday that his nephew was injured but “thankfully his injury was not serious.” “My family was sitting in the front, near where the President was speaking,” Jackson said. “They heard shots ringing out — my nephew then realized he had blood on his neck and something had grazed and cut his neck. He was treated by the providers in the medical tent.” The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter, who attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue. The former president was showing off a chart of border-crossing numbers when at least five shots were fired. Trump was seen holding his ear and got down on the ground. Agents quickly huddled in a shield around him. When he stood, his face bloodied, he pumped his fist to cheering supporters as he was whisked off stage by Secret Service agents. Trump later extended his condolences to Comperatore’s family. Randy Reamer, president of the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, called Comperatore “a stand-up guy” and “a true brother of the fire service.” He said Comperatore served as chief of the company for about three years but was also a life member, meaning he had served for more than 20 years. “Just a great all-around guy, always willing to help someone out,” Reamer said of Comperatore. “He definitely stood up for what he believed in, never backed down to anyone. … He was a really good guy.” A crew was power-washing the front of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company on Sunday with plans to install memorial drapery to honor the slain former chief. Assistant Chief Ricky Heasley of Sarver, who knew Comperatore for more than a decade, remembered him as very outgoing and full of life. “He never had a bad word,” Heasley said. And in the front yard of the Comperatores’ two-story home in Butler County, a small memorial had sprung up of a U.S. flag and small bunches of flowers. For Morehouse, Comperatore’s death was an emotional blow — but it also has inspired political action. Morehouse says he plans on casting a ballot for the first time in his life come November and he plans on checking Trump’s name. “As soon as I heard what happened and then learned that it was to Corey, I went upstairs as soon as I got home and I registered to vote,” Morehouse said. “This is the first time I’ve ever voted and I think it will be in his memory.” A GoFundMe launched to support Comperatore’s family had already surpassed more than $480,000 in donations as of Sunday.","summary":"“He’s a literal hero.

Tasked with protecting federal officials, particularly providing security for politicians and candidates for office, the agency was caught on the back foot Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a shooter scaled a building hundreds of feet away from a stage where Trump was standing. Everything from the agency’s protocols in setting up a perimeter to how agents responded to the shooter is now under strict scrutiny. In the latest blow to the agency, the Associated Press reported one agent spotted and confronted Thomas Matthew Crooks, who the FBI identified as the shooter, before he began firing. The unidentified agent walked up on Crooks, who was camped out on the roof of the American Glass Research building, and backed away down a ladder when the shooter aimed his rifle at the agent. Crooks then turned around and opened fire on the former president. President Joe Biden announced on Sunday he is demanding an independent investigation and comprehensive review of the Secret Service after speaking with Trump following the attempt on his life. “I’ve directed an independent review of the security at yesterday’s rally to assess exactly what happened,” Biden said. “We’ll share the results of that independent review with the American people.” Secret Service rejects reports about denying more protection for Trump There were early reports that the agency had denied a request from Trump’s campaign team to increase the number of agents attached to him as his designation as the nomination to become the Republican presidential candidate approached. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied those reports on Sunday morning, before the criticism of the agency ramped up. “Theres an untrue assertion that a member of the former President’s team requested additional security resources & that those were rebuffed,” Guglielmi wrote on X. “This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.” The FBI also rejected the rumors. “There was no additional request for security that was ever denied by the FBI,” Kevin Rojek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office said during a news conference. Congress demands answers about security protocols and breaches Congressional Republicans weighed in in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, with many demanding answers about how the shooter got in such close range to the stage. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) vowed Congress would open an investigation into the security breach and questioned what kind of technology was used to establish the perimeter at Trump’s event. In particular, Johnson asked Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas if drones were used to scope out the roofs of the surrounding buildings — a question he said Mayorkas didn’t have an answer to. “We need to know how an individual could be at that elevation that was seen by, apparently, bystanders on the ground,” Johnson said. “How could not that not be noticed by Secret Service? Lots more questions than answers this morning.” House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) also sent a letter to Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Saturday requesting she make an appearance before Congress to answer questions lawmakers have about the breakdown. Comer was careful not to place blame on any agents, who he said showed “tremendous bravery” and “possibly averted more loss of life.” Questions about future problems Cheatle, the Secret Service director, wasn’t in Pennsylvania on Saturday. She was in Milwaukee, helping coordinate security for the Republican National Convention that is slated to begin Monday. As questions swirled about how effective Saturday’s security was, Cheatle was also being pressed to make sure future failures don’t result in a worse outcome. “I’ve directed the head of the Secret Service to review all security measures for — all security measures — for the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled to start tomorrow,” Biden said in his brief remarks Sunday afternoon. Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey B. Norman expressed confidence in the security measures his office has in place before the crucial event. “We have workings with our community members in regards to ensuring the safety of this event,” Norman said at a press briefing about RNC security on Sunday. “While we cannot talk about the operational plans, I can say from the CEO of the market Police Department, this local police department here, I’m very comfortable in regards to the plans that we have made together, not in silos.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Security plans for the RNC have been in the works for 18 months and Secret Service RNC coordinator Audrey Gibson-Cicchino said there are no plans to expand the security perimeter or make any other changes following the attempted assassination. “This is a national special security event, that designation is the highest level of security designation that the federal government can determine,” Gibson-Cicchino said. “So we are confident in these security plans that are in place for this event, and we’re ready to go. It’s been an 18-month process. It’s the, we’ve worked together over the 18 months to develop operational security plans for any and all aspects of security related to this event.” “We’re not anticipating any changes to our operational security plans for this event.”","summary":"The Secret Service is under the microscope for a series of security failures that resulted in former President Donald Trump being shot in the ear during a failed assassination attempt.  Tasked with protecting federal officials, particularly providing security for politicians and candidates for office, the agency was caught on the back foot Saturday in Butler, [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3082066/secret-service-cloud-questions-foiled-trump-assassination-attempt/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/secret-service-66.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:45:13","author":"Max Thornberry","authors":["Max Thornberry"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":251750542,"title":"Local officer encountered Trump rally gunman on roof moments before shooting but retreated: report","text":"A municipal police officer at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania encountered the shooter before the assassination attempt but retreated, according to The Washington Post.Butler County Sheriff Michael T.

Bush.Trump survived an assassination attempt Saturday while on a stage six minutes into a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed his right ear. Claims and a photo circulating on social media of a bullet hole near his suit jacket pocket, and that he was saved by a bullet proof vest, are being disputed. Truth or not, it remains uncertain.With blood on his face, during confusion about a still imminent threat and the possibility of more shooters, a defiant Trump raised a clenched fist high, and told his supporters to “Fight. Fight. Fight.” He wanted to continue the rally but was ushered into an armoured vehicle by agents. He again proved he has remarkable courage in his mission to Make America Great Again.The seething hatred his enemies have instilled in sick minds swiftly reared its diabolical head in the stunning reaction by tens of thousands on social media who despaired that the shooter didn’t have a better aim. Humanity at its ugliest.Trump’s injury would have been grave if the bullet had hit mere millimetres closer. One attendee behind him was killed and another critically injured. Innocent patriots were traumatized. Those thirsting for more Trump blood didn’t care about these fellow Americans.Bongino is one of many — including Elon Musk — calling for the immediate resignation of Kimberly Cheatle, director of the Secret Service. And for swift hearings and investigations into how this epic failure occurred. Cheatle, a Biden appointee in 2022, has long been blasted for her obsessive quest to infiltrate the Secret Service with diversity, equity and inclusion hires. She served on Biden’s security detail when he was vice-president.Cheatle is scheduled to appear before the House oversight panel to testify on July 22.“This is obviously a catastrophic failure and NO excuses should be made, or even attempted,” Bongino posted on X. “The failures are profound and questions must be answered about ground surveillance, air surveillance, post-stander support, and counter-sniper advance work and response. We have ONE job, and we came within inches of a deadly failure today.”This isn’t the first time Trump’s Secret Service detail, that all former presidents get, has been under scrutiny.Bongino reported that agents on the job have told him requests for more security for Trump and around his residences have been refused. That was supported by Sean Davis, CEO of The Federalist. Intelligence has long warned that Trump was under serious threat of an assassination attempt. Yet in April, House Democrats callously attempted to introduce legislationaimed at Trump to remove Secret Service protection from convicted felons. Sure. Nothing sinister there.Protection has been a priority since the 1963 shooting of former president John F. Kennedy, the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981 and threats against presidential candidates.Just not for Trump.The FBI will oversee the investigation into what happened. This is same agency that sent heavily-armed agents to raid Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in August, 2022 with the authorization to use deadly force.“It was a political act, a deliberate act,” said Republican Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives.President Joe Biden, whose slim chance of beating Trump in the November election has now evaporated, said he was “grateful” Trump was safe and that he’s “praying for him and his family.”Biden should be hauled into a hearing to explain what he meant when he secretly told donors a few days before that “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.” That comment cannot be spun in any way as normal presidential or even humane talk.Officials from the Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI will appear before panels, said Mike Johnson, speaker of the Republican-controlled House. Hopefully, the investigations will answer questions. How did the gunman, Thomas Mathew Crooks, 20, escape detection when he climbed onto the roof of a building in broad daylight outside the venue’s secured parameter, but only 130 to 150 meters away from where Trump stood?Well, he didn’t escape detection. Onlookers saw an armed man and tried to alert lawenforcement and Secret Service. Videos show him lying on his belly on the roof. Why didn’t the snipers there “neutralize” him before he fired five or six shots? People were screaming “He’s got a gun.”The Associated Press reported that a police officer located Crooks on the roof but scurried down a ladder when the gunman pointed a weapon at him, before quickly turning his weapon on Trump.Crooks, who lived 65 kilometers away, was shot and killed by two counter assault team members, possibly Secret Service agents. An AR-style rifle was recovered.Trump told Americans Sunday to “show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.”Former first lady Melania Trump, who didn’t attend the rally, watched from afar in horror as a “violent bullet” hit her husband. She realized her life and the life of their son Barron was on the “brink of devastating change.”“A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion — his laughter, ingenuity, love of music and inspiration,” she said in a statement on X.“This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,” she urged.“America, the fabric of our gentle nation is tattered, but our courage and common sense must ascend and bring us back together as one,\" the former first lady said in a statement shared on social media.Wise words. And necessary. There’s nothing crazed lefties and desperate Democrats — who promote riots and they accuse MAGA supporters of being guilty of — would like more than America descending into wild civil unrest. Wouldn’t that be a great excuse to delay an election that they are almost certain to be pummelled in? Many who cannot be dismissed as wacky conspiracy theorists have been warning that something might be orchestrated to delay the election: a major global war outbreak; a grid attack; or civil war in America. The devious left doesn’t play be the rules. How can an America so divided unite? It’s debatable whether minds that post “it’s a pity he missed” can even think rationally anymore. “So close, too bad… I really wish that person had a better aim,” posted a crazed looking Dr. Karen Pinder in a video showing her face twisted with hate. It got much uglier and frenzied, but these fools don’t deserve more attention.Can anyone reason with them? Not likely. But they’ve had a free ride, goaded on by people like the despicable California Congresswoman Maxine Waters who has often said things like “I will go and take Trump out tonight.”But they can be forced to behave if they’re held accountable for spewing dangerous threats. They are the minority.Something truly incredible happened at that rally. When Trump, who crouched down after the bullet grazed his ear, rose again to raise his fist — people in the crowd who had ducked for cover boldly rose with him shouting “USA” despite the possibility of danger still present.Couple that with massive declarations on social media from people who said they weren’t planning to vote for Trump before, but will now. That is the beacon of hope that rises from the shot that was heard around the world.","summary":"Former president Donald’s Trump Secret Service protection was a “catastrophic failure,” said commentator and former 12-year Secret Service agent Dan Bonginowho protected presidents Barak Obama and George W.

The shooter, who was killed immediately after the attack, was a resident of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about 40 miles south of the rally site in Butler. He had positioned himself on a factory rooftop approximately 130 yards from the Butler Showgrounds and fired a number shots at President Trump, with one bullet grazing Trump’s right ear. A former fire chief who was attending the rally with his family was killed in the shooting. Two other rally attendees were also critically wounded. “Open-air rallies present significant security challenges, especially during a campaign year,” said Mr. Gant. “The advance team evaluates the event space to provide the best protection possible.” Mr. Gant, currently an Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity at Maryville University in Saint Louis, Missouri, asserts that despite these measures, open-air events inherently carry more risk than indoor venues. The recent incident with former President Trump demonstrates that even with extensive precautions, determined attackers may still find opportunities. “My first reaction when I saw the video was that I would have been surprised if a weapon was in the immediate vicinity,” said Mr. Gant. “The shot came from outside the security perimeter. Snipers usually do a great job seeing those people who seem out of place.” Mr. Gant expressed interest in the upcoming investigation, suggesting it will provide important insights into the incident and potentially inform future security measures. “They put a wall of flesh and body armor between him and any other threat that may have come,” said Mr. James. “The agents did that perfectly.” After the shooting, President Trump was seen grabbing his right ear with his hand and then looking at it before dropping to his knees behind the protective podium. When he emerged about a minute later, his red “Make America Great Again” hat had been knocked off his head. President Trump then says, “Wait, wait. Let me get my shoes.” Mr. James warns that those few seconds could have been the difference between life and death. “I would have said ‘no,’ we’re moving now,’” said Mr. James. “If those initial shots were a distraction and there were four more people with guns, and now here comes the real attack, those extra five seconds could have been deadly. We wouldn’t have stopped for shoes, fist pumps, or anything else.” Mr. James noted that the assassination attempt is the first legitimate attack on the life of a president since President Ronald Reagan was shot as he left the Hilton Hotel in Washington on March 30, 1981. “This moment in history is significant,” said Mr. James. “President Trump was half an inch away from losing his life. If this assassination attempt would have been successful, I don’t know who the Republicans would have put on stage this week at the convention.” “Agents need to consider every possible threat,“ he told The Epoch Times. ”It’s a problem that a building that was less than 150 yards away didn’t surface possible security vulnerabilities.” Mr. Miller, who served under presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, says that, unfortunately, former presidents don’t receive the same level of security as sitting presidents. “With President Trump breaking all the molds, it should have been clear he needed more security given the current political environment.” Following the shooting, President Joe Biden said in a press conference Sunday that security measures for the upcoming Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee have been significantly enhanced. The RNC is proceeding with its planned event from July 15–18. Over 4,000 law enforcement officers will be present, including 1,600 from the Milwaukee Police Department, 800 from other Wisconsin agencies, and 1,600 from out-of-state agencies. The Wisconsin National Guard has also been activated.","summary":"As gunshots rang out during the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, Secret Service agents quickly formed a protective circle around the former president and escorted him off the platform to a waiting vehicle.

The lakeside municipality in battleground Wisconsin finds itself in the eye of a political and security maelstrom following the spasm of violence that has shaken the 2024 campaign and prompted questions about the country's political polarization. Police were enforcing a buffer zone in the fenced-off blocks around Fiserv Forum, the sports arena where some 2,400 Republican delegates from around the country will gather, beginning Monday, to formalize Trump as the party's nominee for the third time since 2016. And President Joe Biden, Trump's election rival, said Sunday that following the shooting he has directed the Secret Service, the agency which protects US leaders, to \"review all security measures... for the Republican National Convention.\" Several residents told AFP Sunday that they or their neighbors were nervous and on heightened alert, and were calling for an easing of the political pressure cooker. \"Tensions are high on both sides, and I think we've got to tone down the rhetoric,\" said 60-year-old Trump supporter Martin Kutzler, who was walking in downtown Milwaukee wearing a T-shirt that depicts Trump as 1970s movie character The Godfather. \"Calling any American officeholder Hitler just throws gasoline on the rhetoric, and calling a current president Sleepy and Crooked is not advisable either,\" said Kutzler, who works for Amazon. He was referring to some of the ugly comparisons and nicknames that have been thrown around to describe Trump and Biden -- at times by the candidates themselves. Resident Becca, 25, was walking her dog with her mother along the Milwaukee River when she paused to ruminate over the \"kind of crazy\" preparations for the convention -- and the passions that are driving US voters. \"It is scary that people are this heated about an election,\" Becca, who declined to give her last name, told AFP, recalling the trauma from Saturday in Pennsylvania. \"And with everything going on, like we're a little nervous.\" she added. \"I hope that they don't take it and escalate it in certain ways.\" Lynn Quirk, who owns multiple college housing units in town, stood somberly watching the proceedings at a security checkpoint outside the convention arena. \"Everybody I talk to is just really super shocked,\" the 60-year-old Milwaukee native said. \"It's a crazy time.\" \"Talking with my neighbors yesterday, people are nervous,\" she added. \"Some people were going to come down here and look around. Now everybody's like, 'Yeah, no I don't need to come.'\" High metal fencing rings the perimeter area and police vessels patrol the river. An employee of a downtown food establishment conceded that merchants have been meeting and coordinating with the Secret Service. Security forces are believed to number in the thousands, including hundreds of police from states as far as California. \"Obviously, we're going to be more vigilant -- not that we weren't going to be vigilant before. But with yesterday's events, the security is going to be heightened obviously,\" said Captain Anthony Scott, one of 63 Indiana State Police officers joining the sprawling operation. But for some, like convention volunteer and self-described \"huge Republican\" Becky Hawkins, who grew up in Milwaukee, the crisis of the past 24 hours has bolstered their resolve. \"I feel pretty safe being here,\" said Hawkins, wearing a Milwaukee Brewers baseball shirt. As for the shooting? \"I'm not shocked, I'm just sad,\" she said. But \"it makes me want to be here even more.\" © 2024 AFP","summary":"Residents and volunteers were urging a lowering of tensions Sunday in Milwaukee as Republicans descend on the city for their national convention just a day after Donald Trump…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/pressure-cooker-milwaukee-braces-for-trump-convention","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/86/3c/d7c240a5eb3931c016616f59f3651197507f/863cd7c240a5eb3931c016616f59f3651197507f/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:34:52","author":"Japan Today Editor,Michael Mathes","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Michael Mathes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":251750958,"title":"Trump headed to Republican convention after surviving assassination attempt","text":"Donald Trump said he was headed on Sunday to Milwaukee where Republicans will formally nominate him for president later this week after he survived an assassination attempt that further inflamed an already bitter U.S. political divide. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said he had ordered a review of how a 20-year-old man carrying an AR-15-style rifle managed on Saturday to get close enough to shoot from a rooftop at Trump, who as a former president has lifetime protection by the U.S. Secret Service. Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania - one of the states expected to be most competitive in the Nov. 5 election - when shots rang out, hitting his right ear and streaking his face with blood. His campaign said he was doing well and appeared to have suffered no major injury besides a wound on his upper right ear. Trump is due to receive his party's formal nomination at the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Monday. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said on Fox News on Sunday that authorities are working together to safeguard the venue, where officials have spent months making security preparations. \"I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and The Republican National Convention, by two days, but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else. Therefore, I will be leaving for Milwaukee, as scheduled,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social site on Sunday. He said he would be leaving in the afternoon. The FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect in what it called an attempted assassination. He was a registered Republican, according to state voter records and had made a $15 donation to a Democratic political action committee at the age of 17. FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone. The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspect's social media accounts. Both Republicans and Democrats will be looking for evidence of Crooks' political affiliation as they seek to cast the rival party as representing extremism. \"There is no place in America for this kind of violence,\" Biden said at the White House. \"I urge everyone, everyone please don't make assumptions about his motive or affiliations.\" Trump and Biden are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including those by Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting whipsawed the discussion around the presidential campaign, which had recently focused on whether Biden, 81, should drop out following a disastrous June debate performance. The Biden campaign had been seeking to reset its message, depicting Trump as a danger to democracy for his continued false claims about election fraud but said on Saturday it was suspending its political advertising for now. Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect, the agency said, after he opened fire from the roof of a building about 150 yards (140 meters) from the stage where Trump was speaking. The gun - an AR-style 556 rifle - had been legally bought, the FBI officials said, adding that the FBI believed it had been purchased by the suspect's father. The officials said \"a suspicious device\" was found in the suspect's vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe. VICTIM WAS SHELTERING FAMILY Authorities identified a rally attendee who was shot and killed as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania, who Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told reporters was killed when he dove on top of his family to protect them from the hail of bullets. \"Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community,\" Shapiro said, adding, \"Political disagreements can never, ever be addressed through violence.\" Pennsylvania State Police on Sunday identified the two people wounded in the shooting, both of whom were listed in stable condition. They are 57-year-old David Dutch, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and 74-year-old James Copenhaver, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania. The Secret Service in a statement denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected campaign requests for additional security. \"The assertion that a member of the former President’s security team requested additional security resources that the U.S. Secret Service or the Department of Homeland Security rebuffed is absolutely false,\" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. \"In fact, recently the U.S. Secret Service added protective resources and capabilities to the former President’s security detail.\" Residents of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, where the alleged shooter lived, expressed shock at the news on Sunday. \"It's a little crazy to think that somebody that did an assassination attempt is that close, but it just kind of shows the political dynamic that we're in right now with the craziness on each side,\" said Wes Morgan, 42, who added that he rides bikes with his children on the street where the alleged shooter lived. \"Bethel Park is a pretty blue-collar type of area. And to think that somebody was that close is a little insane.” While mass shootings at schools, nightclubs and other public places are a regular feature of American life, the attack was the first shooting of a U.S. president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan. In 2011, Democratic then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in an attack on a gathering of constituents in Arizona. Republican U.S. Representative Steve Scalise was also badly wounded in a politically motivated 2017 attack on a group of Republican representatives practicing for a charity baseball game. Giffords later founded a leading gun control organization, Scalise has remained a stalwart defender of gun rights. POLITICAL VIOLENCE Americans fear rising political violence, recent Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with two out of three respondents to a May survey saying they worried violence could follow the election. Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn his election defeat, fueled by his false claims that his loss was the result of widespread fraud. About 140 police officers were injured in the violence, four riot participants died that day, one police officer who responded died the following day and four responding officers later died by suicide. The shots appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said. Hours after the attack, the Oversight Committee in the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives summoned Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to testify at a hearing scheduled for July 22. Some of Trump's Republican allies said they believed the attack was politically motivated. \"It's one side that is going after Donald Trump in a way to demonize him personally,\" said Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican. \"The left seems to have targeted Donald Trump as a person.\" Trump began the year facing multiple legal worries, including four separate criminal prosecutions. He was found guilty in late May of trying to cover up hush money payments to a porn star. But the other three prosecutions he faces — including two for his attempts to overturn his defeat — have been ground to a halt by various factors, including a Supreme Court decision this month that found him to be partly immune to prosecution. Trump contends, without evidence, that all four prosecutions have been orchestrated by Biden to try to prevent him from returning to power. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Donald Trump said he was headed on Sunday to Milwaukee where Republicans will formally nominate him for president later this week after he survived an assassination attempt that…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-headed-to-republican-convention-after-surviving-assassination-attempt2","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/2b/3b/fcb22f411d82236f39faefa3440d6004ccb6/AP24196636361222/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:34:42","author":"Japan Today Editor,Nathan Layne","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Nathan Layne"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":251750540,"title":"50% of Americans believe political violence is a 'very big problem' in the US after Trump rally shooting","text":"One thing is clear after shots were fired at former President Donald Trump during his Saturday rally in Pennsylvania: Americans are freaked out.In a YouGov poll taken after the shooting, 50% of adults said that political violence is \"a very big problem\" in the US.

Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday slammed utility CenterPoint Energy, which has yet to restore power for hundreds of thousands of customers in the Houston area, and ordered the company to take steps to improve power reliability. In his first public appearance since returning from a pre-planned economic development trip to Asia, the governor asked CenterPoint to send his office a detailed plan by the end of the month outlining how it will prepare differently for future hurricanes this season. Abbott said the plan must include better preparation for linemen, increasing the number of workers to restore power and trimming trees that could fall on power lines. If CenterPoint fails to comply with his request, the governor said he will issue an executive order imposing his own requirements on the company. And he said that if the utility is unable to “fix its ongoing problems,” the state would have to reconsider the breadth of the territory it serves. CenterPoint maintains the wires, poles and electric infrastructure serving more than 2.6 million customers in Texas across the greater Houston area and some coastal communities like Galveston. “Maybe they have too large of an area for them to be able to manage adequately,” Abbott said. “It’s time to reevaluate whether or not CenterPoint should have such a large territory.” The governor on Sunday also sent a letter to Thomas Gleeson, chair of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, ordering him to launch an investigation into CenterPoint and deliver a report on its findings by Dec. 1He said allegations that CenterPoint was “penny-pinching and cutting corners” must be investigated.“Was CenterPoint protecting Texans, or was it protecting its own pocketbook?” Abbott said at the press conference. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who leads the Texas Senate, said the chamber will also hold hearings beginning in August to ask CenterPoint questions about its business. Following the press conference, Patrick shared on social media ten questions he plans to ask company officials, including: “Are Houston and surrounding areas still IMPORTANT to CenterPoint? Are their customers their number one priority in their mission statement and future planning?” “These are fair and legitimate questions,” Patrick said. The company has faced mounting criticism since Hurricane Beryl hit the Gulf Coast and knocked out power for nearly 3 million Texans. Both the public and elected officials say CenterPoint has failed to communicate clearly with customers and restore power efficiently. For days after the storm left Texas, the company did not offer a clear timeline for when power would be restored. Houstonians say a map showing when they will get power back is unreliable and riddled with errors. “The communications component of CenterPoint is unacceptable,” Abbott told reporters. “Corrections are coming, whether they like it or not.” In some cases, customers have turned violent against CenterPoint workers, a behavior Abbott sharply rebuked and said the state would not tolerate. Patrick said the Texas Legislature would consider laws that increase the penalty for crimes against people working to restore power. “Who is going to come to Texas and help Houstonians if Houstonians are shooting at them?” Patrick said. “That must stop.” The Sunday press conference came one day after former President Donald Trump survived gunshots that the FBI is investigating as an assassination attempt. Abbott condemned that act of violence and praised the former president, calling him “the mightiest warrior that we have in the United States of America.” “This unfortunately is not an isolated incident,” Abbott said, noting that a Harris County sheriff’s deputy was shot and killed earlier this week. “That is completely unacceptable. The attack on public officials is an outrage.” Sunday’s briefing was held inside Gallery Furniture, which store owner Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale opened as a shelter Monday for people who needed food, water or a place to charge their cellphones. The press conference marked Abbott’s first public briefing since the storm made landfall in Matagorda County on Monday. The governor spent the past week visiting politicians and business leaders in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. Patrick acted as governor while Abbott was abroad, requesting a disaster declaration from President Joe Biden and holding briefings throughout southeast Texas in the aftermath of the storm. Abbott emphasized that lawmakers will work together to craft laws during the next legislative session to improve power reliability but that action must be taken now since more hurricanes could be looming. Hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 and federal forecasters predict the highest number of storms ever for the 2024 season. Abbott asked that CenterPoint remove vegetation around power lines no later than Aug. 31. CenterPoint officials said during a meeting before the PUC this week that damaged trees were a leading cause of infrastructure damage and outages after Beryl. Abbott also cited reports that CenterPoint may have been “caught off guard” by Beryl’s magnitude and the level of devastation it caused in Houston. The storm was originally forecast to have the greatest impact in South Texas but it turned northeastward and ended up hitting areas further north. By the end of the month, the company must specify how they will pre-stage sufficient workers to immediately respond to future power outages, Abbott said. Patrick said CenterPoint may have a “flawed business model” if it requires multiple days to train workers and a day to conduct assessments before getting power back to most customers. CenterPoint officials did not respond to questions about the governor’s request. The organization’s media relations team said in an email that they plan to issue a statement Sunday afternoon.

To clarify that he was not being hyperbolic, Collins followed up by saying that Biden should be charged with “inciting an assassination.” Collins was one of the highest-profile people to boost a conspiracy theory almost immediately after a gunman fired eight shots during a Trump rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania, yesterday afternoon—but he was far from the only one (and not even the sole member of Congress). Within moments of the shooting, some Trump supporters started speculating online about the Secret Service’s complicity. “To deny that something is fishy here is to be willfully blind,” one Instagram meme account with more than 800,000 followers posted in a caption underneath a picture of the grounds where the rally was held. “He was counter sniped within seconds of pulling the trigger. So Secret Service knew he was there.” Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump right after the shooting, publicly wondered whether the Secret Service made a “deliberate” choice to overlook security gaps. Left-wing accounts posted their own “false flag” conspiracies. The now-famous photo of Trump surrounded by Secret Service agents, pumping his fist with small streaks of blood across his face, was simply too good to not have been staged, some people posted. Semafor reported that Dmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic strategist, emailed journalists yesterday urging them to consider the possibility that the shooting was staged by the right to make Trump look good. (He later apologized.) This is almost always how it goes now when something notable happens in the news: It becomes instant conspiracy fodder. Wildfires were actually started by massive laser beams. The rollout of 5G caused the pandemic. Kate Middleton’s extended absence from public appearances earlier this year was because of some sinister royal plot. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce aren’t actually dating—they’re doing a crossover marketing psyop to boost their profiles (and undermine Trump). These theories are obviously far less pernicious than ones demonizing migrants or falsely accusing people of trafficking children, but they speak to the same idea: Absolutely nothing is ever as it seems. Online platforms such as Facebook and X have long been accelerants for baseless information and conspiracy theories, but these things aren’t just the product of an information crisis that can be resolved with education and by reining in social media. When conspiracy theories become the default logic for many Americans in understanding all major moments, they suggest a more fundamental breakdown. In a system that doesn’t resolve social atomization or economic precarity, or mitigate the darkest impulses of technology companies, people will end up trying to make their own order amid intense disorder. It’s not surprising that solutions made inside a Russian nesting doll of messy conditions end up also being very messy. Conspiracy theories become the primary logic that begets more disorder, which begets more conspiracy theories.

Mr Trump was addressing a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. He was showing a chart of border crossing numbers when bangs started ringing out after 6.10pm local time. The former president could be seen grimacing and reaching with his right hand towards the side of his head, before blood appeared on his face. He quickly ducked as Secret Service agents rushed the stage to surround him. There were screams from audience members as the bangs continued. The crowd cheered as he got back up and pumped his fist before he was taken to his motorcade. Police evacuated the site shortly after Mr Trump left the stage. One rally attendee was killed and two other spectators were critically injured, authorities said. All were identified as men. The man who died has since been named as 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief. Pennsylvania governor Josh Sapiro said Mr Comperatore had died a “hero”, using his body as a shield to protect his wife and daughter from the bullets. The suspected gunman, who attacked from an “elevated position” outside the rally venue, was fatally shot. The FBI has taken over the investigation. – Is Mr Trump OK? Pictures showed blood on the former president’s right ear and part of his face. Writing on his Truth Social platform, Mr Trump said he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear”. Spokesman Steven Cheung said Mr Trump is “fine”, while the former president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, said his father “is in great spirits”. – What has Mr Trump said? Mr Trump took to his social media platform to thank the Secret Service and law enforcement. “Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured,” he added. “It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country.” Mr Trump said he knew “immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin”. He also said he will remain “resilient” and “defiant” in light of the attack, writing that “it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening”. “We will fear not, but instead remain resilient in our faith and defiant in the face of wickedness,” he continued. “Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed. “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand united, and show our true character as Americans, remaining strong and determined, and not allowing evil to win. “I truly love our country, and love you all, and look forward to speaking to our great nation this week from Wisconsin. DJT” – Where did Mr Trump go afterwards? He was checked out at a local medical facility before flying to New Jersey. The former president also confirmed he will travel to the Republican National Convention on Sunday as he originally planned, insisting people remain “defiant in the face of wickedness”. – Who is the suspected gunman? The FBI named 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the gunman. Officials added they believe he was acting alone. – What was his motivation? A motive has not yet been identified, but authorities are treating the shooting as an assassination attempt. – What has US President Joe Biden said? President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident and spoke to Mr Trump several hours after the shooting, the White House confirmed. He called the shooting “sick”, adding: “There’s no place in America for this type of violence.” In a later statement, he appealed for the country to “unite as one nation” and said he was ordering an independent security review of the lead-up to the attack. Mr Biden said: “An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation. Everything. It’s not who we are as a nation. It’s not America. And we cannot allow this to happen. “Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is more important than that right now.” – How have politicians in the UK reacted? Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: “I am appalled by the shocking scenes at President Trump’s rally, and we send him and his family our best wishes. “Political violence in any form has no place in our societies and my thoughts are with all the victims of this attack.” Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the Government “condemns all forms of political violence in the strongest terms”. Former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson said it is “a miracle that Donald Trump escaped an attempted assassination”. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, he added: “As we give thanks for his safety we are reminded once again of the tragic fragility of democracy in the face of violence and unreason. “Our thoughts are with the president and the Trump family.” Sadiq Khan said he was “shocked” at the news Donald Trump was shot at and that violence has “no place” in politics or society. The mayor told the PA news agency: “I was shocked when I heard about the attempt on President Trump’s life – he’s in my thoughts and prayers. “Unfortunately somebody lost their life – I’ve been thinking about them, people got injured. “There is no place for violence in politics or in mainstream society. “Donald Trump is standing to be the president, you may disagree with his policies but nobody should be turning that into violence – just thank God he’s survived. “We’re hoping the rest of the campaign is safe and the campaign doesn’t lead to any more violence.”","summary":"Images showed the bloodied former president defiantly pumping his fist in the air after shots were fired at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-jr-joe-biden-pennsylvania-keir-starmer-president-b1170586.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/07/14/09/13-ce278179f0644a6f8c25df8bafa1c7d9.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:22:50","author":"Ted Hennessey","authors":["Ted Hennessey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":251750984,"title":"After Trump shooting, the presidential race will change dramatically, and possibly violently","text":"In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign and raised fears of further political violence in the run-up to November's election. Trump's Republican allies painted him as a hero on Saturday, seizing on the image of him with his ear bloodied and fist raised, appearing to mouth the words \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" Whereas Trump has regularly used violent language with his followers, advisers and allies of the former president flipped the script on his Democratic opponent President Joe Biden, saying it was the demonization of the Republican presidential candidate that led to the assassination attempt. \"Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination,\" U.S. Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, a top candidate to be Trump's running mate, said on X. Biden moved quickly to try to defuse the situation, denouncing the attack as unacceptable political violence and pulling election ads attacking Trump. \"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick,\" Biden told reporters. The motivation of the shooter is not yet known. The suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was a registered Republican, according to state voter records. He previously made a $15 donation to a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians. In the short term, the attack will likely boost Trump's appearances in Milwaukee this week at the Republican National Convention as he accepts his party's presidential nomination, fortifying the sense of grievance and estrangement his supporters already feel toward the nation's political class. Within hours of the shooting, Trump's campaign sent out a text asking voters to contribute to the campaign. \"They're not after me, they're after you,\" the message read. Billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman also swiftly endorsed Trump. \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Musk said on X, the social media site he owns. Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump's campaign, said on X that \"for years and even today, leftist activists, Democrat donors and now even Joe Biden have made disgusting remarks and descriptions of shooting Donald Trump ... it's high time they be held accountable for it ... the best way is through the ballot box.\" LaCivita was apparently referring to recent remarks by Biden made in the context of asking his supporters to focus on beating Trump rather than his own performance. \"So, we're done talking about the debate, it's time to put Trump in a bullseye,\" said Biden, who has always condemned any political violence. POLITICAL ATTACKS The U.S. is grappling with the biggest and most sustained increase in political violence since the 1970s. Of 14 fatal political attacks since supporters of Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in which the perpetrator or suspect had a clear partisan leaning, 13 were right-wing assailants. One was on the left. Despite being a former president, Trump has campaigned as an outsider insurgent, complaining that he has long been targeted by the federal \"deep state\" and Biden's administration to prevent him from reclaiming power. He has typically employed violent, degrading and even apocalyptic rhetoric while doing so, warning of a \"bloodbath\" if he is not elected and saying immigrants in the United States illegally are \"poisoning the blood of our country\". Some Republicans were already agitated by his continued stoking of the fire. \"If the country wasn't a powder keg before, it is now,\" said Chip Felkel, a Republican operative in South Carolina who has opposed Trump. Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, said the shooting could benefit Trump politically because it feeds into his campaign narrative that the country is off-track. \"The attempted assassination creates sympathy for Trump,\" Bannon said. \"It also confirms the idea to voters that something is fundamentally wrong in this nation, which is an idea that drives support for him.\" Trump in May was found guilty of engaging in a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star, a conviction that did little to alter the race and suggested supporters of both sides remain entrenched in their positions. Biden has dealt with a debate within his own party over whether he should step down as the Democratic candidate because of concerns that he is no longer fit for the job. He says his doctors have told him he is in good shape. Trump has benefited in some polls from Biden's disastrous debate performance last month, but others show the race to be even. Many voters have already been alienated by both Biden and Trump. The chaos that surrounds the candidates may contribute to voters feeling that the nation's problems are unfixable and the gulf between the parties cannot be bridged. U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, a Republican who was shot by a gunman in 2017, told Fox News that violent election rhetoric needed to stop. \"All it takes is one person who is just unhinged to hear that and go out and act on it and think that's their signal to go take somebody out,\" he said. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign and raised fears of further political…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/analysis-after-trump-shooting-the-presidential-race-will-change-dramatically.-and-possibly-violently","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/ef/46/93b4407d07538417b6bd0071d503b4967854/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:22:04","author":"James Oliphant,Japan Today Editor","authors":["James Oliphant","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":251749796,"title":"Police Officer Found Trump Shooter on Roof Minutes Before Shooting: Report","text":"Before gunshots erupted at former President Donald Trump's campaign rally on Saturday, one police officer had confronted the now identified shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks on the roof of a nearby building, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to the Associated Press on Sunday.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was speaking at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening when he was shot on stage, with a bullet hitting the upper part of his right ear. The suspected gunman, now identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as 20-year-old Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was shot and killed by the Secret Service. A rally attendee, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore was also killed during the incident. Those injured, now identified as 57-year-old David Dutch of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are in stable condition.A spokesperson for Trump's campaign said on Saturday that the former president was \"fine\" and was \"being checked out at a local medical facility.\" Trump was released from the hospital later that night.The FBI has classified the shooting as an assassination attempt and is working as the lead agency on the investigation alongside the Secret Service and local law enforcement.Although Crooks' movements and motive leading up to the shooting are still under investigation, he was said to be positioned on top of a roof of a building nearby the rally with a rifle when he began shooting.According to the AP, who spoke to two law enforcement officials on condition of anonymity, rallygoers noticed a man climbing to the top of the roof of the nearby building and warned local law enforcement.This is when one local officer climbed to the roof and confronted Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer. The officer retreated down the ladder as Crooks quickly took a shot toward Trump who was speaking on stage and that's when the U.S. Secret Service counter-snipers shot him, the AP reported.Newsweek has reached out to the Pennsylvania State Police, the FBI, the Secret Service, and the Butler Police Department via email for comment.One rallygoer told the BBC that he noticed the shooter bear crawling on a building that was \"50-feet away from us.\" The rallygoer said he was trying to get the police and the Secret Services' attention before the shooting.\"We're standing there. We're pointing at the guy crawling up the roof...we could clearly see him with a rifle,\" he said.In response to the raised security questions, Pennsylvania State Police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens said at a late-night news conference on Saturday, which the Secret Service did not attend, \"It is incredibly difficult to have a venue open to the public, and to secure that against any possible threat, against a very determined attacker.\"While the investigation remains ongoing, Saturday's shooting has since sparked debate about the efficiency of the Secret Service and raised questions about the level of protection Trump and other presidential candidates receive. Some have even called for the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle in light of the incident as the Republican-led House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the shooting and asked Cheatle to testify on July 22.The shooting comes days before the Republican National Convention (RNC) kicks off in Milwaukee where Trump is poised to unveil his highly anticipated vice presidential pick, setting the stage for a rematch of the fiercely contested 2020 election against presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.The four-day convention is estimated to bring upward of 50,000 delegates, politicians, and official guests.In two Truth Social posts on Sunday, Trump confirmed he is still attending the convention, writing that while he initially planned to delay his arrival, he decided he \"cannot allow\" a potential assassin to force him to change his plans. He added that he'd be leaving for Milwaukee on Sunday afternoon as planned.Meanwhile, Biden announced that he directed the head of the Secret Service to \"review all security measures, all security measures, for the Republican National Convention.\"The president expressed gratitude to the agents who risked their lives for the protection of Trump in yesterday's shooting and expressed his condolences to Comperatore's family. Biden also emphasized that Trump \"already receives a heightened level of security,\" because he's a former president and the presumed Republican nominee.\"I've been consistent in my direction of the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability, and protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety,\" Biden said.","summary":"A officer climbed to the roof and confronted Thomas Matthew Crooks before Trump was shot on stage during a rally, according to the Associated Press on Sunday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/police-officer-found-trump-shooter-thomas-matthew-crooks-roof-minutes-before-shooting-report-1925027","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2427964/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:21:34","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":251750244,"title":"Biden campaign swaps Trump criticism for unity after shooting","text":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign quickly upended its strategy after an assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania, calling off verbal attacks on the former president to focus instead on a message of unity. Within hours of Saturday’s shooting, Biden’s campaign was pulling down television ads and suspending other political communications, including those that had highlighted Trump’s May felony conviction in New York state court relating to hush money paid to a porn star to avert a sex scandal before the 2016 U.S. election. “We must unite as one nation,” Biden said in White House remarks on Sunday, adding he would have an Oval Office address in the evening. Biden condemned political violence again, as he did on Saturday night, and asked Americans to “let the FBI do their job.” Rather than verbally attacking Trump in the coming days, the White House and the Biden campaign will draw on the president’s history of condemning all sorts of political violence including his sharp criticism of the “disorder” created by campus protests over the Israel-Gaza conflict, campaign officials said on condition of anonymity. Some Republicans have blamed Biden, without evidence, for inspiring the shooting by criticizing Trump. The 20-year-old shooter was a registered Republican whose motive is unknown. Biden’s advisers had hoped to tamp down recent calls from some of his fellow Democrats and others that he step aside and let another candidate represent the party in the Nov. 5 election, sharpening his focus on the dangers he has said Trump presents to U.S. democratic norms and reproductive rights as well as Trump’s false statements about winning the 2020 election. “This changes everything,” one campaign official said of the assassination attempt. “We’re still assessing. Making the case against Trump, drawing that split screen, will get much harder.” “The president is trying to lower the temperature,” the official added. CALLS TO STEP ASIDE The Biden campaign officials said they expect that the assassination attempt will lower the pressure from congressional Democrats for Biden, 81, to step aside in the race amid concerns about his fitness for office. Some Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate have publicly called upon Biden to drop out in the aftermath of his shaky performance in a June debate against Trump. “It’s over,” one White House source told Reuters about the attempt to push Biden out of the 2024 race. That may be overly optimistic, other Democratic sources said. The current wave of calls is over but is expected to resume once Biden inevitably stumbles again, they said. Biden’s planned trip on Monday to the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas – where he was expected to speak on the landmark Civil Rights Act that Johnson signed into law in the 1960s and criticize Trump’s attacks on immigrants and American diversity – has been postponed, the White House said. Biden’s plan to deliver a keynote speech at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) convention in Las Vegas on Tuesday on his administration’s commitment to racial justice and equity for all Americans is unchanged. Because the shooting happened in the election battleground state of Pennsylvania, which Biden won over Trump in 2020 by a narrow margin, the incident could be especially impactful, according to some political strategists, by increasing Republican turnout by voters sympathetic to Trump. “This doesn’t guarantee that Trump flips Pennsylvania,” Republican pollster Frank Luntz wrote on social media. “But the long and winding road for Joe Biden just became even longer and windier. Just as what happened to George Floyd had a lasting impact on tens of millions of Americans, the shooting of Donald Trump will be significantly consequential in a way the shooter never intended.” Floyd is the Black man who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020, a murder that prompted protests in many U.S. cities and abroad. Other Democratic candidates running this year are also rethinking their plans to focus on the dangers they have said Trump poses if elected. “The real question is whether in two weeks we can go back and declare Trump a threat to the country. That was our playbook, and it’s fair, but unclear how much of our spurs were taken off,” said a Democrat involved in a Senate campaign, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump, 78, is due to receive his party’s official nomination for president during the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee beginning on Monday.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden&#8217;s reelection campaign quickly upended its strategy after an assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania, calling off verbal attacks on the former president to focus instead on a message of unity.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/14/breaking-news/biden-campaign-swaps-trump-criticism-for-unity-after-shooting/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-14T155853Z_1704621333_RC2HK8AIG19O_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-14 21:21:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":251750844,"title":"Golden calls to drop ‘hyperbolic threats’ about democracy after Trump assassination attempt","text":"Democratic Rep. Jared Golden (MN) on Sunday called on the nation to cease making “hyperbolic threats” about the stakes of the 2024 election year one day after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Golden expressed deep concern about the current state of American political culture and its implications for the nation’s future after an attempted assassination on Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. He said the 2024 election between Trump and President Joe Biden should never be portrayed as a “no-holds-barred struggle between democracy or authoritarianism, or a battle against fascists or socialists intent on destroying America as we know it,” adding “these are dangerous lies.” “The result is an overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety about the future of our country, where the normal and tested tools of democracy no longer seem adequate to protect the common good. Inthis light, a rise of politically motivated violence in America is sadly unsurprising,” Golden added. Golden’s remarks are not the first time he has called on the nation to cool the temperature of political rhetoric. On July 2, he blasted Democratic colleagues’ “hand-wringing” following last month’s disastrous debate for Biden that has led numerous lawmakers to question whether the 81-year-old president has the mental fortitude to take on Trump in the Nov. 5 election. “I refuse to participate in a campaign to scare voters with the idea that Trump will end our democratic system,” Golden said earlier this month. Since the debate, Biden himself has taken to social media to label Trump as a “threat to our democracy,” according to a June 28 post on X, formerly known as Twitter. On July 5, Biden posted that Trump “could become the dictator that he promised to be on day one,” referencing Trump’s previous remarks where he quipped he wouldn’t be a dictator “other than day one.” On Saturday, hours after a gunman fired shots at the crowd in Butler and killed one attendee while also grazing Trump’s ear with a bullet, Biden briefly addressed the nation and said he was “grateful to hear” that Trump is “safe and doing well” and condemned political violence. “There is no place in America for this kind of violence,” Biden said Saturday. “It’s sick. It’s sick.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Biden addressed the nation for a second time on Sunday afternoon, where he announced he had ordered an independent investigation into the attempted shooting and the security measures surrounding the event. Additionally, Golden joined three other members of Maine’s delegation on Saturday to condemn political violence, including Republican Sen. Susan Collins, independent Sen. Angus King, and Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree.","summary":"Democratic Rep.

Retired volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore was sitting behind the former president at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania yesterday when he was shot and killed by Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20. It’s believed bullets, fired from a rooftop 130 yards away, had been meant for Trump, who was left with an injury to the upper part of his right ear. Two other people were critically injured, before Crooks was shot dead by a secret service sniper. Members of the crowd tried to save Mr Comperatore’s life, but he died at the scene. His family said he had lost his life trying to shield his wife and daughter from the gunfire. In an emotional tribute, his daughter Allyson wrote on social media: ‘He died a real-life super hero.’ One of Mr Comperatore’s daughters said her father was a real-life super hero (Picture: Facebook) ‘They are not going to tell you how quickly he threw my mom and I to the ground. They are not going to tell you that he shielded my body from the bullet that came at us. ‘He loved his family. He truly loved us enough to take a bullet for us.’ Mr Comperatore’s sister, meanwhile, wrote on Facebook: ‘The PA Trump Rally claimed the life of my brother, Corey Comperatore. ‘The hatred for one man took the life of the one man we loved the most. He was a hero who shielded his daughters.’ ‘His wife and girls just lived through the unthinkable and unimaginable. My baby brother just turned 50 and had so much life left to experience.’ Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said Mr Comperatore, who had served at the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, was a self-proclaimed ‘girl dad’ and firefighter who died a hero. Mr Comperatore loved his family, Governor Josh Shapiro said (Picture: Facebook) ‘Corey went to church every Sunday for a loved his community,’ the governor said today. ‘And most especially Corey loves his family. Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community. ‘I asked Corey’s wife, if it would be okay for me to share that we spoke. She said yes. She also asked that I share with all of you that Corey died a hero.’ ‘This is a moment where all leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity,’ he continued. ‘For all leaders, we need to take down the temperature and rise above the hateful rhetoric that exists in search for a better brighter future for this nation.’ Randy Reamer, president of the Buffalo Township volunteer fire company, called Mr Comperatore ‘a stand-up guy’ and ‘a true brother of the fire service’. He said he had been a life member, meaning he’d served for more than 20 years, and was chief of the company for about three years. The shooting started shortly after Republican presidential candidate Trump took to the stage at around 6pm. Trump pumps his fist as he’s rushed off stage by U.S. Secret Service agents (Picture: AP/Evan Vucci) Several bangs could be heard, before Trump bent down, then came up and briefly pumped his fist at the crowd and shouted ‘fight, fight, fight’ as secret service agents rushed him off stage and into a motorcade. Crooks, who graduated from high school in 2022, was a registered Republican. His home in Bethel Park has been searched by police today, with scores of officers and members of the press pictured outside. After the shooting, Trump posted on his Truth Social account, thanking the secret service and law enforcement for their rapid response. He added: ‘I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured ‘It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country.
